      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1 and 2.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will be engaged at Question Time in the Dáil but someone will sit in for him for the start.</P>

      <P>A matter I should like to raise on the Order of Business is the question of the notice of motion which has just come to hand from Members of the two Government parties, Motion No. 36 &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann notes the state of the world economy....&rdquo;  Motion No. 26, which is that we note &ldquo;with concern the deteriorating state of the national economy&rdquo; is Motion No. 36 in reverse. In view of the fact that it has been seen fit to put down a motion of this kind, which is in effect a negative of Motion No. 26, I take it that indicates an urgency on the part of the Leader of the House and the Government to debate the important matter of the national economy that we see declining to a very serious state at present.  May I take it that putting down this motion indicates a desire on the part of the Leader of the House to have the Minister for Finance here to have a full discussion of this important matter?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>While I regard that certainly as a very serious matter, I cannot refrain from pointing out that the pound reached its lowest ever level yesterday and that we already have been trying to arrange for the Minister <Col N="1296" /> for Finance to come to the House to debate the motion concerning the establishment of a Select Committee to examine the link with sterling.  I would put this as a more urgent single matter and, as everybody knows, the Minister gave as strong an assurance as he could that he would come here before the recess.  I hope that the motion dealing with the link with sterling will be taken before a general motion dealing with the state of the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator West was good enough to indicate in his remarks that he understood the Minister's position which the Minister explained last week.  Senator Lenihan asked me if he could take it that the tabling of Motion No. 36 indicated a degree of urgency to have the subject matter of Motion No. 26 discussed.  I think possibly the best way of putting the matter to Senator Lenihan, and I am sure that he appreciates it, is that the intention of putting down Motion No. 26 is to ensure that any discussion on the question of the economy will take place in its proper perspective.</P>

    <Title>Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1975: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was suggesting that section 3 of the Bill might be looked at with a view to introducing some amendments. I have already referred to the difficulty of getting a fair definition in law of the word &ldquo;disorder&rdquo;.  I feel that this word at least has some ambiguity and we all know that is a situation which should not obtain.  In section 3 (1C) of the Bill there is, I suggest also room for improvement.  Section 3 (1C) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> The Authority is hereby prohibited from unreasonably intruding on the privacy of any individual.</P>
    <P>This, as stated, could be very broad in its application and could in certain circumstances inhibit unduly the efforts of a journalist to get at the facts and get at the truth.  I understand that RTE apply a very strict code in ensuring that the privacy of the individual is preserved. This indeed has been a very worthwhile exercise and it has worked very well in the past.  While I do not object in principle to such provision being put on the Statute Book, I feel that subsection (1C) ought to be looked at again and some clearer definition given as to what unreasonable intrusion might be.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask if it would be possible, for example, for a journalist, in all good faith, to find himself in court for making what he would regard as reasonable efforts or reasonable attempts to seek the truth and to get the facts of a particular item.  For example, if a programme is about to be broadcast and the person involved at the last minute finds that he is not too happy with some of the facts as he knows them, and at 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock in the evening on the night of the broadcast proceeds to verify some of the facts by telephoning&mdash;as that is the only way at this time to verify these facts&mdash;some official of a Department or local authority at his private house, could that journalist be regarded as unreasonably intruding on the privacy of that individual?  I am quite sure that the Minister had in mind much more subtle intrusions, but if he has I would suggest that he should specify those.  We are all aware of the hidden camera, the hidden microphone.  These are something with which I do not agree and I am sure all of us here would not agree with their use.  I would suggest that, in order to clear up any ambiguity that might arise due to the very broadly based interpretation that might be applied to section 3 (1C), the Minister might have another look at this.</P>
    <P>I wish now to move on to section 6, which deals with the rebroadcasting of <Col N="1298" /> specified programmes.  Subsection (1) reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Authority, direct the Authority to rebroadcast programmes broadcast from any source other than the Authority and specified in the direction.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>The Authority shall comply with a direction under this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement did not dwell at length on this aspect of the Bill.  Perhaps there are reasons for this, that he wished to see what the ideas of Senators were who would be contributing to the Bill.  Perhaps he felt, as somebody else suggested earlier on in the debate, that this matter had been pretty well aired already in the correspondence columns of the newspapers. From the various opinions expressed on this matter it is obvious that, no matter what the Minister does, he is not going to satisfy everybody in this regard.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister did say that negotiations were in progress with the British authorities in order to allow for the transmission of BBC 1 or UTV.  I should like at this point to say that the Minister again has been misrepresented in what he said in this regard.  It has been pointed out, and rightly so, that the rebroadcasting of BBC 1 or UTV into single channel areas is not open broadcasting.  Nevertheless the Minister has been accused of welching on an undertaking which he gave some time ago that open broadcasting would be introduced.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the Minister never did say or did regard the provision of BBC 1 or UTV as open broadcasting.  Column 772 of the Seanad Official Report of 12th March, 1975, from which I will quote, deals with this section of the Bill:</P>
    <P>As Senators are no doubt aware, a network of transmitters is being erected to provide viewers in the present single channel regions with an alternative to the present RTE programmes.  It is hoped that it will <Col N="1299" /> be possible to begin transmissions over the second network about the end of 1976.</P>
    <P>The Government favour using the second network for transmitting BBC 1 or UTV if, as we hope, negotiations with the British authorities, which have been going on for some time now are successful.  This would of course be a step in the direction of my open broadcasting concept....</P>
    <P>In other words this, as the Minister has said, is but a step towards what he regards as open broadcasting.  This is one aspect of the Bill which has evoked a great deal of debate and discussion.  It is something in which the ordinary man-in-the-street and, in particular, those people in the single channel areas, are most interested.  As we all know, the people living on the east coast have at their disposal at present five channels.  This is not due to an effort on the part of the Government to provide them with such. It is due to the geographical fact that they are on the east coast, that they are within the transmission range and that technology can come to their aid because they are within a certain distance of the transmitters.</P>
    <P>One would imagine therefore that the people of the west, myself included, would not feel discriminated against.  Of course, we are all human and we do feel that we are discriminated against.  We feel also that the introduction of a second channel would go some way towards redressing our grievance.  For the introduction of the second channel, for the commitment of the Government to it, we are very grateful.  However, I am not satisfied that the rebroadcasting of BBC 1 or UTV <i>in toto</i> would be the most satisfactory approach.  I do not object to this on the same ground as some of the Opposition speakers.  They would seem to suggest that because the networks mentioned are British, therefore they must be unacceptable. They seem to suggest that we in the west are not yet mature enough to use our discretionary powers in viewing British television.  Fears have been <Col N="1300" /> expressed for the culture, the language. Fears have been expressed that our innocent minds in the west might be polluted by the introduction of BBC 1 or UTV.  They point out that people along the east coast have had this facility for some time.  They have been open to so-called corruption.  For my part I do not see any great mental or moral decay on the east coast and I do not see why this facility should not be made available to viewers along the west coast.  There are no outward signs of inward damage among the people who have been viewing BBC 1, BBC 2 and UTV for some time.</P>
    <P>As I have said I do not fully agree with the Minister in what he has in mind.  I would much prefer to have a second channel under our own control. I say that in the knowledge that the Minister in his opening statement has asked for honest comments, an open mind and plain speaking by Senators from both sides of the House. He hopes that in bringing this Bill into the Seanad he will get that.  I hope that in making these remarks I am speaking my mind without fear or favour, that I am being honest in regard to what I think and with the Minister in regard to what I feel he should be doing.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the difficulties because that area has been well ploughed and indeed harrowed for the past number of days in which we have had this debate.  There are financial difficulties and there is uncertainty with regard to copyright material. There are problems of cost.  As somebody said: &ldquo;BBC cannot sell us what they do not own.&rdquo;  In negotiating a a deal with the British authority they cannot negotiate details of cost or financial aspects of the deal with us because they cannot tell us what restrictions or what financial costs will be involved for us in rebroadcasting material which they do not own.</P>
    <P>They are the more mundane and practical aspects of the difficulties we might envisage in taking on BBC or UTV.  I should like to point out other aspects which should be dwelt on&mdash; for example, the aspect of control.  I think we should have a right to decide <Col N="1301" /> what we broadcast on our television screens.  In two articles published in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Fr. Dunne, he outlined some alternatives that might be provided.  One was that a second Irish channel could be set up under an independent body but accountable to the RTE Authority.  Setting up a second channel would be a very satisfying experience for the professionals and indeed a great challenge to them in ensuring that certain criteria were maintained and certain standards applied.  Above all, a second channel would not be in competition for viewers with the present RTE service.</P>
    <P>There are many cases in which the use of a second channel would be looked into&mdash;for example, programming for education.  We have a very fine limited service available to us at present for post-primary schools.  But there is also a great lack of adult education programmes.  Television is the one vehicle through which adult education could be made available to the masses of the people.  Education cannot be driven down people's throats but through the judicious use of a second channel people can be given a real choice of viewing.  If a person cannot or is not interested in viewing adult education programmes, he has a choice of viewing entertainment, sport or other programmes on the second channel.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already referred to the pluralist concept in our society. I think we all share his viewpoint on this.  Again the second channel could be used to ensure that minority interest programmes could be broadcast and that everybody could be given what they would regard as justice.  I am not saying that at the moment they are not getting that.  Indeed I would suggest that RTE as we know it since its inception has bent over backwards to ensure that there is a certain balance in the kind of programmes being broadcast.  The second channel would be a very acceptable means of broadening the scope of programmes, which, because of restrictions of time and because of the interests of viewers in the single channel areas, are not possible at the moment.</P>
    <P>As I have said there are many <Col N="1302" /> aspects into which Senators have gone very deeply since the debate started on this Bill.  I do not propose to rehash any of this.  In much the same context I should like to refer briefly to section 13. Section 13 of the Bill deals with the functions of the Authority, and paragraph (a), broadly speaking, refers to the functions of the Authority in regard to culture and, in particular, the promotion of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Be mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá as Gaeilge maidir le alt 13 agus maidir leis an smaoineamh atá taobh thiar de, agus ba mhaith liom é a cheangal isteach leis an díospóireacht faoí bhunú an dara stáisiún.  Nuair a labhraim i nGaeilge ní le haon magadh é. Tá suim agam sa Ghaeilge; bhí suim agam i gconaí sa Ghaeilge agus tá súil agam go mbeidh suim agam i gcónaí i ndul chun cinn na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Níl aon mheas agam ar an duine a sheasann suas agus a cheapann go mba cheart stáisiún lán-Ghaeilge a bhunú.  Ceapaim go bhfuil sé sin mícheart mar tá an smaoineamh taobh thiar de mícheart.  Beadh sé sin cheart go leor dá mbeadh caoga faoin gcéad de mhuintir na tíre ag labhairt na Gaeilge.  Níl sé sin ann.  Níl ann ach codán beag atá sásta an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Ceapaim go bhfuil saghas cultúr amháin sa tír fite-fuaite leis an Gaeilge, gur fhás sé as an nGaeilge. Fiú amháin an Béarla a labhraítear sna háiteanna seo gur fhás sé as leaganacha Gaeilge.  Ní fheadar go mba chóir dúinn anseo meas faoi leith a bheith againn ar an nGaeilge agus chinntú chomh fáda agus is féidir go rachfaidh an Ghaeilge ar aghaidh, go méadóidh méid na ndaoine a labhrann an Ghaeilge, ach gan an obair seo a dhéanamh trí bhrú a chur ar daoine. Tá fhios againn cén toradh a bhí le heigeantacht.  Le leath-chéad bliain bhí an Ghaeilge éigeantach sna scoileanna. Bhí an Ghaeilge éigeantach i ngach scrúdú.  Tá fhios againn an raic a bhí ann ar dtús an chéad seo nuair a chuireadh an cheist don chéad uair: an cheart go mbeadh an Gaeilge éigeantach sna hollscoileanna?  B'éigin don Piarsach an cheist a chur: &ldquo;An féidir a bheith ar thaobh na hÉireann gan a bheith ar thaobh na Gaeilge?&rdquo;<Col N="1303" /> Scríobh sé sin san <i>Claidheamh Solais</i> thart ar 1913.  Tá an cheartú seo ann fós.</P>
    <P>Ceapaim féin gurb fhéidir bheith ar thaobh na hÉireann agus ar thaobh na tíre seo gan bheith ar thaobh na Gaeilge.  Mar dúirt an tAire Poist agus Telegrafa bliain ó shin, ní cultúr amháin atá againn sa tír seo; tá a lán cultúir againn sa tír seo go bhfuil bunús faoi leith le chuile cheann acu.  Tá sé de cheart ag chuile dhream a gcultúr féin a leanúint chomh fáda agus is féidir agus tá sé de dhualgas orainne an ceart sin a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Anois tagaim ar ais ag an bpointe go bhfuil an dualgas orainn nuair atá an deis againn cur ar chumas Gaeilgóirí na tíre seo breathnú ar an oiread clár is féidir, sult a bhaint as ceoil agus dramáiocht más féidir, oideachas a chur ar fáil dóibh trí Ghaeilge.  Seo rud gur féidir a dhéanamh dá mbunofaí an dara stáisiún. D'fhéadfaí an t-am atá ar fáil faoi láthair a leathnú d'fhéadfaí i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge gan eigeantacht gan cur isteach ar dhaoine eile nach n-aontaíonn leis an loighic atá i gceist acu, agus d'fhéadfaí ar an gcaoi sin grá a chothú don Ghaeilge agus don cultúr na Gaeilge agus ag an am chéanna gan a bheith ag caitheamh anuas ar chultúir eile, cultúir gállda, cultúir meán-ghállda atá againn sa tír seo.  Tá an seans acusan chomh maith agus atá againne a gcultúr fhéin a leanúint. Tá sé de dhualgas orainne gan cur isteach orthu agus go deimhin tá sé de dhualgas orainne an ceart sin a shlánú dóibh agus a chuir ar fáil dóibh.</P>
    <P>Tá anseo againn:</P>
    <P>In performing its functions the Authority shall in its programming aims be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland, ensure that the programmes reflect the various elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland, and have special regard <Col N="1304" /> for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Aontáim le chuile fhocal atá sa chuid sin den Bhille mar tá creidiúnt tugtha ann do na cultúir ar fad atá le fáil ar oileán na hÉireann.  Ach déarfainn anois go bhféadfaí ár ndualgaisí a bhfad níos fearr agus go bhféadfaí ceart na ndaoine go bhfuil na cultúir eile seo acu, a chomhlíonadh agus a shlánú i bhfad níos fearr dá gcuirfí ar fáil an dara stáisiún teilifíse taobh istigh de chósta na tíre seo, go mbeadh údarás ina bhun a bheadh sásta, cur i gcás, na rudaí atá le rá sa chuid seo den Bhille a chur i gcionn agus bheinnse an-shásta dá bhféadfaí é sin a dheanamh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a firstclass debate inspired by a very wideranging speech from the Minister.  It has shown the Seanad at its best in dealing with a non-political subject. We have heard many fine speeches and we have also looked at very many different aspects of the problems of the medium and our duties and our functions as legislators in relation to it.  I would like to compliment Senator O'Toole for a fine speech. I agree with almost everything in it in both official languages&mdash;bail ó Dhia ar an obair.</P>
      <P>One of the interesting things in this Bill is that there are some potentially deep and potentially contentious questions. At no time have we divided along political lines in our approach to these questions.  There has been a great deal of agreement on both sides of the House on the question of the Government's necessity to exercise control over the media in the broader sense, particularly when discussing the security of the State.  There has been a broad feeling of agreement on the establishment of a second channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in agreement with the views of Senator O'Toole and other speakers on the Government side.  I feel that the proposal to turn a second Irish channel over <i>in toto</i> to BBC Northern Ireland or UTV is wrong.  We have seen the Seanad at its best in fulfilling its real function in the discussion of <Col N="1305" /> these two difficult and potentially contentious questions.</P>
    <P>I hope the questions I raise, if they have not been raised before, will be brought to the Minister's notice so that he shall have an opportunity to deal with them when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I should like to begin by talking about local radio.  There has been some support for extending our radio by means of local stations.  This is an excellent thing.  I was impressed by Senator Michael D. Higgin's contribution when he discussed in an abstract way how technology has been used to break down communities, in the building of motorways and in the planning of city developments.  We have an opportunity to use technology to recreate communities by developing local radio.  We have an opportunity to use technology in a positive and constructive way to develop our society at local level.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to give a go-ahead to local radio. It has to be regulated; it has to work to certain criteria set down by the Minister and his Department.  A great deal of good can come from the development of local radio stations.</P>
    <P>I had an experience of such local stations when on Sunday the Liberties Festival operated their own radio station for the duration of the festival.  This is a part of Dublin which has fought a long and vigorous fight for its survival against the planners and developers and technocrats and particularly against road builders in the Department of Local Government and the corporation. They are a vigorous, healthy community. As a result of their having to fight for survival they have, to a great extent, recreated themselves. They celebrate every year with a fortnight's festival in that historic part of Dublin.</P>
    <P>This year they have a local radio station broadcasting about six hours a day.  They have a series of fascinating programmes.  They have interviews with all sorts of people who visit the festival.  It has now become a major festival.  It is clear that such local broadcasting can focus attention <Col N="1306" /> on a community and its life.  I think it deserves every help and encouragement that the Minister and his Department can give to it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister, when he is replying, will deal with the problems of copyright in regard to educational broadcasting.  Both on radio and television there is much material of interest to the schools.  Some programmes are specifically schools' programmes; some are not.  Schools are gradually making use of the technology of radio and television.  It is not always possible for the classes to listen to the specific programmes as they are transmitted.  Some method has to be used to record these programmes and play them back.  A video-tape for television or some simple recording device for radio is necessary.</P>
    <P>The position <i>vis-á-vis</i> copyright seems very unclear.  The Copyright Act which covers educational broadcasting in Ireland is copied word for word from the British Copyright Act. The problem seems to stem from the fact that BBC and Independent Television have &ldquo;done a deal&rdquo; with Equity and the musicians' unions which sews up the legislative provision in the Copyright Act.  This deal has not been done here.  I realise there are all sorts of complications.  It is one thing to copyright a programme on RTE or retransmit it for schools purposes; it is quite another matter to retransmit a BBC or UTV programme. Perhaps the Minister will make clear what the actual position is.</P>
    <P>Some educational institutions are infringing this Copyright Act.  One of their problems is that they do not know what the actual position is.  If it was possible to make it clear, it would help.  If there is a deal to be done with Equity and the musicians' unions, then perhaps RTE could do it.  I would welcome a clear exposition of the situation as far as copyright and the schools are concerned. It is becoming a more and more pressing problem every day.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our broadcasting media. I should like to mention is advertising.  In common with many <Col N="1307" /> other Senators I should like to see it phased out altogether.  That is not a financial possibility.  The original idea when television was founded in the State was to make television self-sufficient by means of advertising but this is, in itself, unrealistic.  The cost of the technology and programme production and so on is such that capital equipment needs subvention from the State.  Of course the provision of capital equipment for the second channel will not come from advertising revenue.  There is no hope that it would.  Perhaps the Government have the intention of matching current expenditure with advertising revenue, but I think we should be more generous than this when the situation arises.  It may not have arisen at the moment but we cannot always expect to tie our current expenditure to income from advertising programmes. Neither do I think it is an entirely wise thing because it gives the advertisers too much indirect control of what goes out.</P>
    <P>If you are entirely subject to the advertiser then you are entirely at the mercy of commercial forces.  You are entirely at the mercy of the TAM ratings and that is not a position for a national broadcasting service to be in. We must try to keep advertising in its place as far as finance is concerned.  It is important, but it must not be the only god which we worship.</P>
    <P>I also think that advertising has a more subtle effect on the values which the media transmit than is apparent. The whole problem is a subtle one. McLuhan always said that the media is the message.  RTE is the only programme I see.  I come from a single channel area in east Cork where there is no hope of picking up any of the British stations so I have a monochromatic view of television.  The monochromatic values that come out of this stem almost as much from the advertisements as they do from the content of the programmes.  The advertising occurs every quarter of an hour and the central idea of advertising is that self-satisfaction is the chief end of man.  This is as much a value propagated by our television as any of the <Col N="1308" /> values transmitted by the programmes; indeed it is a more constant one.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more rigid control of advertising, not rigid in the legislative sense but some sort of overall council of which the advertisers themselves would be part of and in which other interests played a part which could, in an informal way, vet advertising overall, not just in television and radio but in the newspapers and on the advertising hoardings. I should like to see some sort of advertising council introduced which could exert a moral pressure on the advertisers.</P>
    <P>As somebody already said in this debate, we see something advertised &mdash;say an expensive car&mdash;and it is advertised by a beautiful blonde sitting on the bonnet.  I am all in favour of beautiful blondes sitting on the bonnets of cars, but the essence of the advertisement is that if you buy the car you will get the blonde also. Life is not quite like that and I think these things are more subtle than they look.  If this autosuggestion is allowed to go unchecked then it causes a problem.  The way to tackle this is by means of an advertising council which would exert moral pressure.  I think it is much more effective than any legislation that could be drawn up.  Legislation could not be drawn up to deal with this except in the broadest possible terms which will curb the worst of the abuses.</P>
    <P>I think it should be dealt with by means of a council in which all the interests would be represented which could exert a moral force which would be respected by the public, the consumers and the advertisers themselves. There is nothing wrong in advertising products provided that the advertisement is truthful and that the various subliminal suggestions are not too far away from reality.  When they get outside the bounds of reality there can be problems.  I should like to see these problems being dealt with by a council.</P>
    <P>There has also been discussion of another type of council in this debate, the idea of a Press Council, which I favour very much.  This council would deal with the problem of bias in <Col N="1309" /> journalism, on radio, in newspapers and on television.  Again, one cannot legislate against bias; we are all biased.  Anything that I say reflects my own personal bias.  The Minister is biased in the way in which he looks at the situation and, of course, the journalist is biased because of his background.</P>
    <P>Part of the journalist's training is to overcome the bias he has.  Nobody totally overcomes bias and they would be uninteresting journalists if they did. There are some journalists who would give the impression that they do not have any bias at all.  It is much better to recognise one's own bias and work within it.  If a person can recognise his bias, then he has taken some step to be objective about the way he presents facts.</P>
    <P>I would certainly say that our television stations and newspapers reflect trends of opinion and they reflect bias in that sense.  At various times certain opinions are more coloured than others by the media: they are more stressed than others.  When the problems in Northern Ireland began in 1969 I thought RTE in its reporting of these problems was biased.  I thought that BBC Northern Ireland had about an equal bias in the other direction.  This reflects my own personal prejudices just as much as it reflects the prejudices of the journalists who reported the news on the spot.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the moral pressure which a Press Council could exert being used to keep the balance right. Legislation to overcome this type of thing is impossible.  The authority does its best to preserve a balance and preserve a fair presentation within the legislation.  I am sure legislation can only curb the severest abuses and not really deal with the problem.  I should like to see the establishment of a Press Council to deal with it.  I cannot understand why it has not been established before now as I think journalists would welcome it.</P>
    <P>One of the problems with television, in a small country where there is only one station operating, is that of exclusiveness. <Col N="1310" /> Sometimes people in the media feel that because they are in that profession they have something above other people, and this gives them an exaggerated idea of their own importance. Senator Higgins made a very good point in connection with this sense of exclusiveness.  At column 1013 of the Official Report, Volume 80, he said:</P>
    <P>If you allowed children to experiment with a radio programme or make their own television programme they would learn to laugh at some of the professionals because they would say: &ldquo;You are so poor we made a better programme than that years ago.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we had more experimental work and involved the schools more often in the production of local programmes, if we assisted them in the development of their own television and radio programmes and the issue of their own newspapers, it would destroy this idea of the exclusiveness of television people and the mystique with which people in that profession surround themselves.  It would be the same if I said it was only university professors and such like who were qualified to teach mathematics, which is absolute nonsense, because there are many other people who if they has the same training as I had would do an equally good if not better job.  It is a question of one's opportunities and training.  Much good could be done by lessening this mystique which some media people try to develop around themselves.  It would help to get realism into the picture.</P>
    <P>One of the things we have tried to consider, and which we do not know very much about, is the effect which the media have on people.  Senator Noel Browne made an interesting speech on this point and helped to put things in perspective.  I do not think that the media create attitudes. They raise questions.  That is their most important function <i>vis-a-vis</i> change. One of the best ways in which the media do this is by way of discussions, where the opposite point of view is put forward and people have an opportunity of airing their own particular views.  If the chairman has proper <Col N="1311" /> control of the debate he will see that all views get an airing and in this way people will be able to form their own opinions about problems about which they may never have thought before. That is a very important function for the media.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about the problem, which comes up in open broadcasting, of whether people in the single channel areas are mature enough to receive BBC or whether it might corrupt them.  As he said, tongue in check, that is a lot of nonsense. There is no evidence to suggest that people living in multi-channel areas are any more mature than those in the single channel areas or <i>vice versa.</i>  This point also comes up in the discussion about rebroadcasting BBC 1 and how it would affect our attitudes to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I never thought that the attitudes to Northern Ireland in this part of the country were any bit more civilised or enlightened coming from people living in multi-channel areas compared with those living in single channel areas, or that they are any more likely to lead to the compromise and the special relationships that will be needed.  There is almost statistical evidence to support this opinion and it can be found by checking the addresses of people charged with membership of the IRA in the Special Criminal Court and breaking them down to their places of domicile.  I do not mean people who are tentatively living in Dundalk or Monaghan because they have had to leave the Falls Road.  I mean people who come from Dublin or Limerick or Cork. I do not think you will find that there is a higher proportion of them coming from single channel areas.  Therefore, the media cannot be said to form opinions.  I agree with the expression of opinion by the Minister on the need for the Government to exercise control. Not only do they need to exercise control but they have a duty.  In Article 40, 6ºi of the Constitution this duty of the Government is spelt out:</P>
    <P>... the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of opinions, such <Col N="1312" /> as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>That is a rather draconian article but in common with the Minister I recognise that that is the Constitution we are bound by and until, and unless, we change it we must operate within the confines of that Constitution.  I should like to see that section of the Constitution liberalised.</P>
    <P>I am one of the people who favour a total redrafting of the Constitution. I do not think it can be done piecemeal. This Constitution is out of date. I should like to see a more positive effort being made by the famous all-party committee&mdash;I do not know if they are still in existence&mdash;and the Government in consultation with the Opposition to get a proper redrafting of the Constitution under way.  I do not think any difficulty would arise between the two main parties if this were done.  As things stand we must operate within the confines of Article 40.  The problem arises in regard to its interpretation.</P>
    <P>Senator Noel Browne made the very important point that while certain members of certain organisations are banned from appearing on television and radio, Mr. Thomas MacGiolla and the Minister engaged in a debate some time ago, which I thought was a good debate.  I did not think that the Minister came off in any way second best.  I wonder which is the better for our country, whether one should face the arguments put forward by subversive organisations and deal with them fairly or whether one should give them a further aura and a further mystique by pretending that their ideals do not exist.  We do not pretend that the organisations do not exist.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to back any idea no matter from whom it comes provided I think it is correct.  Some of the ideas of some of these people are worth considering, but the basis on which they act, of giving themselves <Col N="1313" /> authority, is totally wrong.  But we should be prepared to consider their ideas.  The other ideas, which are tragic and disastrous, particularly those of the organisations whose aim is to achieve a united Ireland, are going to ensure that we never have a united Ireland.  This should be said and we should face them fairly and squarely.  I wonder whether it is best to suppress these ideas altogether, not to allow them to be discussed on the media, or to actually challenge them and allow the people to judge.  The people are not such fools and their judgment will be the right one.  By that I do not mean the one I agree with.</P>
    <P>While I recognise Article 40, and that consequent on that the Minister and the Government are bound to exercise control of the media, and in the ultimate sense that is correct&mdash; one cannot have media which exist totally without any connection from the Legislature&mdash;we can, by acting too repressively, set up the people we oppose.  There is a problem of bias here which always affects the Government in power.  It affected the previous Government and it will affect the current Government the longer they are in power.  The problem is that people get disaffected with Governments the longer they remain in power and quite rightly so.  This was very evident during the final stages of the previous Government which had been in power for 16 years, which is far too long for any Government in this State.  I should like to see the situation developing like in Britain in which, however similar the policies of the parties are, there are regular changes of Government.  This has been the pattern over many years, and that is a healthy situation.</P>
    <P>This is reflected in the way the media tend to examine Government policy.  There is always a honeymoon period when a new Government come in, which is a natural thing.  Then, as the Government's period goes on, they become less popular.  This is why there are changes in Government every so often.  It is not necessarily connected with policies.  Some of the things that <Col N="1314" /> determine people's views are things totally outside Government control. Of course, no Government will say that anything is outside their control but we know that lots of things are. It is not the fault of the group who hold power.  It is inevitable and well-known and it means that the Government of the day will come under more pressure from the media as their term of office goes on.</P>
    <P>We must be very careful to ensure that this natural tendency to exert rightful pressure on a Government by the media, which reflects what the man in the street is saying&mdash;the media are usually behind the man in the street in many things&mdash;is something that must go on.  There are always tendencies for a Government to resist this sort of questioning.  They cannot do much about the newspapers because they do not actually control them&mdash;let us hope they never will&mdash; but they legislatively control the broadcasting media, and I have always been worried by the attempt of Irish Governments to try to redress this balance.  It is a proper political thing, this is part of the political scene, but it is one of the areas in which a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has to be very careful and tread very warily.  If he does not, the people will take it into account and I think the people are clever enough to see what is going on and the Minister's Government will inevitably suffer when it comes to votes.</P>
    <P>This is something which could be dealt with by a Press Council, this whole problem of bias.  As I said, the media and the journalists reflect opinions abroad, sometimes not very much to their credit.  I remember a period when in the early days of the current trouble in the North, in 1969, everything that any politician, North or South, said was analysed, dissected and digested by the media but every word put out by certain subversive organisations was treated as if it came from the Almighty.  It was never analysed, it was never pointed out that any statement by any such organisation is a political statement and should be subject to the same analysis.  There <Col N="1315" /> was a total suspension of judgment when it came to the subversive organisations.  It took a few courageous journalists to take the lead and really look at what these statements meant, what the actions of these organisations really meant and how they affected the situation.  Gradually the balance was redressed.  That was a regrettable feature of the media in the 1968 and 1969 period.</P>
    <P>The confusion in many of our minds stemmed from the problem of trying to separate the role of a defender in a legitimate sense from the role of an aggressor.  As we know, the defenders of the minority&mdash;if we deal just with the minority in the North&mdash; soon exploited the situation to such an extent that they were no more defenders, that their whole philosophy was to act as aggressively as they could and get pressure put on the minority so that their support would be increased. It is only too easy to do this but it is very important that this should be seen and that the media should analyse the statements of any political organisation, whether it is one that has representatives in Parliament or not, in the same straightforward and unbiased way.  At last this is happening, but for a long time it did not and it certainly disturbed me very much as someone who spends a lot of time in the North.  I could see more than one side to the problem and I felt that at that time our coverage of many of these events and our analysis in particular was biased against the politicians and in favour of the subversive organisations.  I am sure this was unconscious, that it just reflected the feelings of the journalists, and the fact that it hit me reflected my bias in the situation, the fact that I felt very strongly about this.</P>
    <P>It is greatly to the Minister's credit that he exposed some of this and went on to pinpoint some of the things that were actually happening.  He in this case had a very correcting influence on the way the events were being reported and discussed.</P>
    <P>What I have been discussing is something that we have to guard against.  It is just a reflection of the <Col N="1316" /> fact that a Press Council would be a necessary way of dealing with this problem of balance of reporting and analysis.  I hope that efforts will be made to get a Press Council set up here.  It would do a tremendous amount of good.  It would take the pressure off the journalists when they felt that they were being pressed by politicians.  On the other hand, they could respond to the Press Council when politicians felt that they were being dealt with unfairly.  They could deal with the Press Council.  It would give a great deal of freedom all round. It would also help to establish a fair balance which by the very nature of things is not always there.</P>
    <P>I will now come on to discuss what I regard to be the two substantive parts of this legislation.  There is the Government exercising their authority as far as section 16 is concerned, and as I said I will deal basically with what the Minister is doing&mdash;and there has been general agreement from the House on this; there has not been much disagreement on that.  One can always improve the situation.  I am worried, in common with a number of others, about the interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;lead to disorder&rdquo;.  It is too wide.  It needs to be narrowed down. I hope to put down an amendment which will help to deal with the situation. I am very worried about the way the phrase would be interpreted in the courts.</P>
    <P>The problem of privacy is another difficult one.  I have heard the views from both sides.  I am glad that the problem has been recognised.  There have been occasions when people have been hounded by the media without any justification and their personal privacy intruded upon.  There again I am worried about the interpretation. The media people have a job to do and it is very important that they should have conditions in which they can do it.  Again, it is a question of achieving a balance.  This is one of the very difficult sections.  I do not think one can treat politicians entirely as other people.  When we act as politicians we automatically give up some of our privacy.  We must be prepared to deal with critical problems at critical <Col N="1317" /> times and be prepared to answer questions asked of us by the media. That is one of the things one accepts when one goes into political life.  It is generally recognised that politicians, too, must have a private life which unless it is endangering the security of the State is something which is their own.  It should not be invaded or intruded upon.  It is a question of balance.</P>
    <P>The man-in-the-street is a different kettle of fish and unless he is involved in something I do not think that one can really intrude upon his privacy. I remember when I was working in Britain seeing some of these candid camera television productions and I must say that they would worry me a lot.  I presume that in all these candid camera programmes the recipient of the candid camera, the person who is being exposed, had to sign a form of some sort giving his consent to the programme appearing at all. Otherwise I imagine he could take an action against the television companies. I always felt that there was something sick about these sort of programmes, which seemed to be doing two things: they seemed to be showing up the man-in-the-street, the public, as being thick and ignorant and stupid and then showing up the broadcasters as being such smart and clever people.  That is rather sick.  I hope it will never appear on our national station, whether rebroadcast or not.  I dislike any programmes which set out to show the broadcaster as a cleverer person than the public. It is wrong.</P>
    <P>As I said before, I do not regard myself as the only person who can teach mathematics or the people who are trained to teach mathematics as the only people who can do this.  They are the people who have actually had the training, though lots of people who have the same talents have not had the same training.  Perhaps they preferred to do other jobs.  They probably could do the job which I am doing just as well as I could.  I do not like this idea of broadcasters or media people or journalists appearing cleverer and trying to make themselves appear smarter than the people <Col N="1318" /> they are interviewing, scoring points off them.  I think they have got to try to be fair.</P>
    <P>We generally avoid this sort of thing here and I hope we will continue to do so.  There again, in this whole area, a Press Council could fulfil a most useful mediating function.  They could act as referee in the disputes that inevitably come up whenever an investigative programme is being made.  They could do a useful job. They would be a better way of dealing with the problem than the broadcasting complaints commission.  Perhaps if there was an effective Press Council a broadcasting complaints commission would not be necessary. But until there is, I think the Minister is correct, that a complaints commission are necessary.  It is necessary for the public to have some redress when they do not have a Press Council.  I would prefer the Press Council.  The broadcasting complaints commission idea is right until we get a Press Council.  Perhaps when that day comes the complaints commission proposal can be re-examined.  We can see then if it really is necessary.</P>
    <P>I now come to the second contentious proposition in this legislation which is incorporated in sections 6 and 12, the provision allowing for rebroadcasting of foreign programmes. This has been pretty well thrashed out.  I will not go through all the arguments again.  I am against allowing any foreign broadcasting station to be broadcast <i>in toto</i> over a second Irish channel.  I do not care which foreign station it is.  The problem of constitutionality has already been raised.  If one looks again at Article 40 (6º. i), which I have already read, one learns that the State shall ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, including the television, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.  What sort of guarantee can we give that a foreign broadcasting station would not attempt to undermine the authority of the State?  We cannot.  It is that simple.</P>
    <P>When I say that I am against broadcasting <i>in toto</i> of any foreign television service, I really want to insist <Col N="1319" /> upon the control of the material on the second channel remaining in our own hands.  As legislators we are not doing our duty if we give away this control.  If we want an Irish broadcasting service rather than rebroadcasting BBC TV, we should exert control over the material broadcast.  I am not against rebroadcasting material from other broadcasting services, in particular from the BBC, Independent Television, European television and, perhaps, good quality American television. We have more than enough of standard American television.  It is that which keeps the TAM ratings up but we do not want any more.  There are high quality American television programmes which perhaps do not hit the highest ratings in the US but would be worthwhile on a second channel here.  I hope we will consider spreading ourselves right across the board, and including a certain proportion of home-based programmes.</P>
    <P>I know that every Senator has had communications from the National Union of Journalists and from various branches of the ITGWU.  I have a cutting from <i>Liberty</i>, the ITGWU magazine of March, 1975, in which they set out their arguments against the Minister's proposal to rebroadcast BBC 1, Northern Ireland.  I sympathise with them.  They wish to protect their own jobs, and quite rightly so. Their jobs would be at risk whatever we say.  We should look into all these problems very carefully before making a decision.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to these sections as they stand and will oppose them.  As I said, the ultimate responsibility for our broadcasting, as laid down by the Act, remains with Parliament.  We cannot hand over any sovereignty of our airwaves, if we have it in our power to control them.  All sorts of anomalies can occur.  For example, we go to great lengths&mdash;as in section 16 of the Bill amending section 31 of the Principal Act&mdash;to control, suppress or stop certain representatives of certain organisations appearing on RTE.  If we rebroadcast BBC 1 there is no gainsaying the fact that these people may be interviewed on BBC 1.  They <Col N="1320" /> have been interviewed on BBC 1.  Our own television station is not allowed to show programmes or interviews involving these people.  We have no control over the BBC or UTV who may give interviews with impunity and rebroadcast these interviews on the national network.  That is totally contrary to the spirit of what the Minister is trying to do in this Bill.  In my opinion, we cannot give away such control because it raises all sorts of anomalies.</P>
    <P>I was in Downpatrick on St. Patrick's Day where, because of the Slieve Donard mountains, they cannot get RTE.  It is quite near the Border but they cannot get RTE.  That is a great pity, and something should be done about it, without necessarily having to broadcast BBC 1 on our national network.  That St. Patrick's Night there was an interview on BBC and UTV with hooded UVF men claiming their sectarian murder victims. Is it good or bad that we should see such a programme here?  Are we, on the one hand, going to stop the Catholic extremists appearing and, on the other hand, by courtesy of the BBC, broadcast the Protestant extremists? That is the sort of problem a person comes up against if they try to have open broadcasting.  We just cannot run away from this.  It is our duty as legislators to apply controls in this area.</P>
    <P>All sorts of arguments are floating around.  One is that in ten years time it will not matter because we will get everything by satellite.  That is similar to the argument which says that the Minister for Finance will in ten years time make provision for something. We must argue about what is happening now, about this channel which is to start in 1976.  We cannot talk about what is going to happen or what may or may not happen by satellite in 1986.  We are talking about the present day and the second channel.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem about who controls the station.  That is an artificial argument.  Who controls the material the single channel area people want to show?  They do not want a Dublin monopoly.  If we are saying, by implication, that we are starting off <Col N="1321" /> a second Irish television channel but we are not good enough as Irish people to control it, then we should not be in business at all.  We should disband.  What are we legislating about?  Are we talking about our own television service or somebody else's?  There is absolutely no reason why the single channel interests could not be strongly represented on any controlling body for the second channel. If we cannot do that, we might as well say that we cannot govern ourselves.</P>
    <P>We should examine the consequences of rebroadcasting a British station, particularly at this time.  Our relationship with Britain has never been more difficult.  Not only are there problems in the North of Ireland, but Britain herself is facing considerable internal problems which, I think, are going to get worse.  My inclination is that we should become as independent as possible of Britain.  I have never felt that we, in the Republic, get any marks from the Northern majority for trying to become more British than the British.  The only marks we get are for what we have done by ourselves.  If Britain's economy goes down and we can manage to stay up, then we get marks.  If we can develop and retain our own cultural identity or identities, then we get marks also. As Senator O'Toole pointed out, the Minister has often said there is more than one cultural strain in this country. There are some very strong cultural strains and we should not run away from them.  We should acknowledge them.  We should also acknowledge that there are definitely two, and maybe even a third, if the Anglo-Irish mixture is taken into account.</P>
    <P>We do not gain any marks by trying to become more British than the British.  However close our personal relationships may be with Britain, our future is independent of theirs. I often feel that successive Irish Governments have not sorted out this problem.  We are too culturally dependent on Britain.  Our institutions are based on Britain.  Our currency is linked with sterling, and that is not doing it any good at the moment. We are too dependent on Britain. <Col N="1322" /> We must assert our independence. We must look at our relationship with Britain.  The more independent we are, the better our relationship will become.  While the Northern situation goes on, our relationship with Britain will not improve.  Since our relationships are going to diverge very spectacularly in the next 18 months, are we going to give control of our second TV channel to BBC?</P>
    <P>From the political viewpoint, the Dublin Government and the Government in Westminster are working on what appear to be the same lines <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Northern situation.  But that honeymoon will not go on much longer. There will be one, two, if not a series of crises in which our interests will be totally different from those of Great Britain.  We will not gain any marks by not acknowledging that fact. In the event of that likely situation happening, are we going to rebroadcast BBC on our own channel?  It is one thing having people who will always pick up BBC, UTV and other British channels, but it is another thing to build a channel and then hand it over.  That is psychologically wrong.  It is wrong from the political and legislative points of view. At this point in our tortured and tortuous relationships with Britain, we should attempt, in a civilised way, to be more rather than less independent.</P>
    <P>In regard to Senator O'Toole's remarks I do not think the multi-channel areas are in any way more civilised, advanced or more realistic in their thinking about Northern Ireland than the single channel areas.  I have not seen any evidence of that.  We have all sorts of psychological barriers to overcome. There is even a statistical way of testing this.  If one looks at the people who are being tried by the Central Criminal Court and their place of domicile, one would find they do not all come from single channel areas. I do not think television formulates opinions; it gets people to ask questions. These problems will have to be solved between Irish people and, ultimately, the deal that will have to be done between the people in the North and the South.  I do not think it will involve Britain very much when the <Col N="1323" /> deal comes to be done.  There are so many arguments against this that the proposal is not on.  This is not a political question; it is a question of sovereignty, of responsibility, and I will certainly oppose these proposals on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This has been a very useful debate. The Minister gave it a splendid start. He did not deal with every aspect of broadcasting.  If he had he would still be talking.  It was clear from the Minister's brief that he wrote most of it himself.  That was a very significant contribution.  It opened up what has been a fine, wide-ranging and deep debate.  The fact that the Minister did not make party political points or take up a stance, gave us all the opportunity of looking at our media in a balanced and non-political way.  This is the sort of thing the Seanad can do well.  The Seanad does not score when we are trying to be political.  I congratulate the Minister on his start to the debate and I look forward to what he has to say in conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I also should like to express my appreciation of the manner in which the Minister presented this Bill.  I also appreciate the fact that the Bill was first introduced in the Seanad.  From listening to the Minister I was convinced that there was sincerity and honesty in every statement he made on the Bill.  Senator Browne seemed to think that this was not an important Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill is very important because of the massive influence the media have on society.  If they were in wrong hands, they could do untold harm.  For that reason, the Minister has included certain sections in the Bill to restrain people who wish to use TV or radio to give dishonest information to the general public.  I find it impossible to believe that the Opposition should declare an all-out opposition to the Bill. Senator Lenihan, in concluding, said that they would not let the Minister away with this legislation, in particular section 6.  He said they would oppose it strongly and that it would also be opposed vigorously in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 reads:</P>
      <P> (1) The Minister may, after consultation with the Authority, direct the Authority to rebroadcast programmes broadcast from any source other than the Authority and specified in the direction.</P>
      <P>(2) The Authority shall comply with a direction under this section.</P>
      <P>The last part might be slightly dictatorial but otherwise I do not see anything wrong.  I am sure that the Minister will not make use of that section except on very rare occasions. In his speech, he asked for a full and proper debate and gave an assurance that amendments would receive full consideration.</P>
      <P>Many of the provisions in this amending Bill are long overdue.</P>
      <P>At column 263, Volume 79, of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
      <P>This amending Bill has two main purposes.  The first is to clarify and expand the duties of the RTE Authority in fulfilling their task of providing a national broadcasting service in the light of developments, experience and new insights since the Authority were established.  The second main purpose of the Bill is to provide greater autonomy and freedom for the broadcasting service within clearly defined statutory restraints and obligations, while at the same time improving public control in certain areas.</P>
      <P>Statutory restraints on the Authority are contained in section 3 (1A), which prohibits the Authority from broadcasting any matter &ldquo;likely to promote, or incite to, crime or to lead to disorder.&rdquo;  If the sentence stopped at &ldquo;crime&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;lead to disorder&rdquo; were omitted I would be happier.  I am sure there will be amendments to this part of the Bill and I hope the Minister will be sympathetic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also prohibits the authority from interference with the privacy of <Col N="1325" /> the individual.  Everyone will agree this is a very good section.  Section 2 gives the authority greater security of tenure.  They cannot be removed unless a motion is passed in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In November, 1972, the authority were removed and the Minister had to do something like this when he came into power.</P>
    <P>People living outside the multi-channel areas are crying out for open television.  Since this debate began a few weeks ago I carried out a survey among people I know.  The general consensus of opinion was for BBC I or UTV.  This might mean greater competition for RTE.  However, this could help to bring about a badly-needed improvement in the quality of home-produced programmes.  In the last 18 months there has been an improvement.  We have seen less violence and some excellent home-produced programmes on RTE.  The programmes which appealed to me very much were: &ldquo;Trom agus Eadtrom&rdquo;, &ldquo;Féach&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;, &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;Late, Late Show&rdquo;. If RTE did not have competition from the BBC programme, &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Late, Late Show&rdquo; would have more viewers in the winter months.  There does not seem to be a preference for a second RTE channel.  Of course, BBC I or UTV might pose some problems for the authority.</P>
    <P>What are the Minister's proposals in relation to subversive material being broadcast by a second channel? He would not have any say or control over BBC programmes.  Some people feel no restriction should be placed on RTE'S second channel.  People want a choice of viewing.  It might help people, North and South, to understand each other better.  It would have advantages.  It might even help the British and Irish people towards a better understanding.  There is no point saying that everything Britain does is wrong.  I would never place myself in that category and express such an opinion.</P>
    <P>It would also have disadvantages. The trade unions are of the opinion that it will cause redundancies.  In my <Col N="1326" /> view, the statement issued by the unions was exaggerated when they spoke of 800 redundancies as a result of the second channel.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply will comment on that.  RTE's advertising revenue might drop.  But people might not be so inclined to turn to BBC if RTE gave them good home-produced programmes. Licence fees will increase because RTE would need more money to produce more programmes. That would displease those who now have a choice at no cost.  This poses the question: could RTE survive?  I think it could.  Of course, it would mean more hard work and new ideas. Some excellent programmes from BBC were rebroadcast here&mdash;&ldquo;Upstairs Downstairs&rdquo;, &ldquo;Jenny&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Private Life of Henry VIII&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Onedin Line&rdquo;.  &ldquo;The Private Life of Henry VIII&rdquo; proved very popular.  When it was shown, you would not see one person on the streets.  It has been said that a second channel would lower the moral code.  People who have had multi-channel viewing for the past few years do not seem to have deteriorated to any extent.</P>
    <P>I attended an &ldquo;Aontas&rdquo; Conference in Cork recently where it was stressed that something should be done to produce more adult education programmes, especially in view of the large unemployment figures.  Radio and television could do a lot to encourage people to make use of AnCO's retraining facilities.  Many of the factories which have closed down, making clothing, shoes and so on, will find it very hard to reopen because of competition from abroad.  Perhaps the Minister would give consideration to my proposal for more adult education programmes to help those people. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with freedom&mdash;freedom of speech for commentators, audiences and the RTE Authority, freedom to criticise or agree, freedom to listen and view or freedom neither to listen nor to view. We have all become confused about what freedom is and means.  It has become confused with licence or the common cliché &ldquo;to do your own <Col N="1327" /> thing&rdquo;.  I should like to remind myself and everybody else that freedom does not mean that a person can do, say, think or omit what he likes, when he likes, where he likes, and to whom he likes.  This is not true freedom as we Irish people know it; it is not democratic freedom which brings peace and harmony.  This type of freedom is dictatorial and can only cause chaos.</P>
      <P>Each of us must be constantly conscious of the fact that the more freedom we have the more responsibility we have.  In fact, one grows in proportion to the other.  This is the frightening part of freedom.  It is the side of the coin which we would all like to ignore at times or forget quite frequently.  This applies to the individual, the group and the nation.  We need to educate ourselves to freedom and in freedom.  The community is never finished with its education in freedom because, if it is ignored or taken for granted, it will erode or fade away.  What is the proof that we have freedom?  It is that we are growing more responsible every day. This growing in responsibility is an everyday thing and needs constant care.  The Oireachtas is here to guide us in responsibility, preserving what we describe as true freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all love to boast that we have a free communications media.  Those who work in the broadcasting media are entitled to freedom and should be allowed adequate scope in their broadcasting profession to do their job really well.  All professions should have sufficient scope to carry out well the job they have to do.  I believe it is the duty of the Oireachtas in general and the Government in particular to see that all professions are encouraged, given scope and given the best facilities and fair remuneration. This is the freedom which is the right of all workers in all aspects of the running of the country.  It is the duty of the Government also to see that this freedom is used properly and not abused, and that the common good of the population is well served by the professions.  To state that any profession may not do this or that in specified circumstances is not to be <Col N="1328" /> judged as a limiting of freedom but as an insurance that the freedom of the general public is preserved and secured.  People such as teachers, lawyers, industrialists, farmers, skilled workers and unskilled people must conform to rules and laws and standards so that the maximum amount of freedom is ensured for the general community.  Perhaps it is because the radio and, more so, television are relatively so new on the scene of communications that we find it hard to give a precise workable framework to those involved in radio and television work.</P>
    <P>The RTE Authority were set up to give guidelines for the broadcasting media.  The Minister stated here on March 12th in this House that the main purpose of the RTE Authority, according to the 1975 Bill, was to provide a national broadcasting service. At once we have controversy here.  What is a national broadcasting service?  It would seem to many people that what the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would envisage as national would not be the same as what hundreds and thousands of Irish citizens would call national.  I would suggest that what is national in 1975 is all that is good and unifying from the past ages in the history of our land.</P>
    <P>In the past and up to the present men, women and children have suffered and died to preserve something indefinable called nationhood.  I suggest that &ldquo;national&rdquo; is still indefinable. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in his capacity as historian, philosopher and writer, Dr. Cruise-O'Brien, is trying to define the indefinable. It gives people who read or hear the Minister as a writer or philosopher the feeling that he is in a sense too authoritative and too impersonally logical.</P>
    <P>The nation, as I know it, is people living together and maybe not always liking one another.  It is not just the people on the island in 1975 but all the people in the past intermingling and dying together.  There is also the people of the future, the children who at this time are unborn.  I would imagine that a necessary ingredient of <Col N="1329" /> the RTE Authority is that they should contain a cross-section of our whole community as far as possible.  This is the nearest we can get to having a nationally-minded Authority, which is the only kind of Authority that will provide a national service.</P>
    <P>It might be a good thing to have this Authority elected by and through various groups; thus their appointment would be seen to be democratic. I would agree with Senator Horgan when he said that the Authority should be composed of laymen&mdash; neither broadcasters nor politicians.  I should like to see the Authority appointed by the people nationally.  I imagine that this could be done.</P>
    <P>In examining this Bill the Minister has requested that we ask ourselves seven questions.  I think the seven questions can be generalised into one question&mdash;&ldquo;What do we mean by freedom?&rdquo;  I have indicated earlier that freedom goes hand in hand with responsibility.  Therefore in answer to the seven questions, I would say that people in broadcasting should be given that freedom of expression which would be in proportion to their sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>This poses a further difficulty but one which is easier solved than the question of freedom, that is, the degree of responsibility.  RTE commentators are a very responsible group of people.  Regarding the Minister's last question:</P>
    <P>Are there any special circumstances prevailing in our society in our time which make it necessary or prudent to apply these principles in a particular way?</P>
    <P>Nobody can deny the existence of the IRA.  Their aim is to deny authority to the freely elected Oireachtas.  However, we can become too obsessed by their presence.  By being obsessed with their presence we can contribute to their importance in the minds of the people.  The Minister is right to be worried about the language used in connection with the IRA which, he says, &ldquo;reinforces the peculiar kind of authority which they hold&rdquo;.  Denying the existence of the IRA, through blanketing information on television <Col N="1330" /> and radio, has the effect of perpetuating that organisation.  Professional broadcasters know this fact.  Judgment in this instance would be best left to the professionals concerned. On the other hand, the professional broadcasters must work within the guidelines of a strong, independent, national authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that section 16 (1) and section 3 (1A) of this Bill are less wide in their delegation of power than is section 31 of the existing Bill.  The Minister said section 31 is a power without limitation of any kind and that he wanted to get rid of this absolute power which is capable of manifold abuse.  Inherent in this statement is the fact that he refrained from many of these abuses.  Have there ever been any serious abuses? If there were, is it implied that they happened during the administration of the previous Government?  The Minister said that sections 16 (1) and 3 (1A) will narrow ministerial power in all areas except that of security. Therefore in the area of security there could be enormous elasticity.  What is security?  How far does it extend?  Who decides?  Different opinions are held by various Members of the Labour-Fine Gael Cabinet in regard to what constitutes security and security risks. There are differing opinions in both Government parties in regard to this matter.  I sense that an effort is being made by a man who was a journalist &mdash;that is not taking from his political status&mdash;and was an Opposition Member in the last Dáil.  He promised to be liberal in the popular sense and to live up to that promise.  But, now that he has the sobering taste of ministerial duty, he is trying to contain the freedom of some in order to preserve the freedom of all.  This is not possible without authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister brings this Bill before the Seanad and describes it as a clarifying, expansionary and a freedom-giving Bill, that it is an opportunity for the Minister to air his personal philosophical tit-bits while seeking the same power.</P>
    <P>Everybody should be educated in the use of television, with the emphasis on educating our minds rather than on <Col N="1331" /> amusement.  Telefis Scoile does a great job but there should be more emphasis in our schools on the use of television, particularly in leisure time.</P>
    <P>A sense of discrimination in the choice of viewing should be inculcated into our young people so that when they become adults they will see the danger of television addiction.  We then have an educated and critically-oriented public which would not seek too much television.  Greater emphasis on the quality of television should be the aim of all television personnel.  I am not opposing a second channel for RTE, as I would prefer that to imported films, over which we have very little control.</P>
    <P>Sweden is a country which is far richer in resources than we are, and yet they have less viewing hours.  Have we gone too far too quickly in our policy?  I think we have.  This should be the main concern of any RTE Authority. It is not too late to develop the educational aspect of television.  Something could be done through our schools.  The demand from the public would be for quality programmes with thoughtful and intelligent presentation. Censoring would then become less of a problem and sham patriots would be discredited even if they appeared on the screen.  Perhaps too, and hopefully, the anti-bogoak pundits would be tuned off the screen by a nationally educated Irish public.</P>
    <P>I have stressed the national aspect of this because it is very important that the programmes we put out on our television screens would at most times have a national outlook.  Both in the short and long term it is our youth who look at television.  From our point of view they should be looking at it in the educational sense.  The programmes should be improved to ensure that this can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose time will tell whether this Bill is as important as we think it is at the moment.  The age of technology is with us and it is possible, as has been pointed out previously, that in the next decade we will be able to have satellite reception on every channel, which may make <Col N="1332" /> the Bill look prehistoric.  The most important aspect of the Bill revolves around whether or not we should have BBC 1 or UTV as our second channel, or whether we should have a second RTE channel.  It is highly debatable and there have been very interesting views put forward.  I am of the view that we should settle for either BBC 1 or UTV.  I believe that the majority of the people think likewise, especially those who live in areas which cannot receive multi-channel television at the moment.  Those people may not constitute a majority.  Indeed I believe they are in the minority, but their opinion should be heard loudest of all and most cognisance should be taken of it.  They only receive one channel at the moment and they feel deprived.  I noticed in a Sunday newspaper poll last Sunday that 85 per cent of the people who took part in a survey were in favour of either BBC 1 or UTV as a second channel.  The vast bulk of them did not want a second RTE channel.</P>
      <P>I was rather shocked to hear some people from the Northern part of the Twenty-six Counties give statistics of the extent of the reception of RTE radio and television in Northern Ireland.  I would not have believed that only 15 per cent of the population in Northern Ireland are in a position to receive RTE television at the moment.  Quite a large number of them cannot even receive RTE radio.  This is a lamentable state of affairs.  It was most forcibly brought home by a story told by Senator Martin.  He stressed that when on holidays in Ballymoney in Northern Ireland one of the finest speeches on reconciliation that has been made since the troubles six years ago was made by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, and Senator Martin could not hear it on radio.  He made the point: what hope have we of impressing upon the majority in Northern Ireland that we generally want reconciliation if they do not know our views?  We should do all in our power to have a reciprocal arrangement to make sure that everybody in Northern Ireland can get RTE television and radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of a reciprocal <Col N="1333" /> arrangement which has not been stressed and should be looked into is the provision of an RTE radio service for Irish people in England.  Several hundred thousand Irish people in England have no means of direct communication with this country.  If our news services and our sports programmes, on radio especially, were transmitted or relayed to all parts of England it would be of considerable benefit and be greatly appreciated by our exiles.  I have had reason to experience the frustration caused by this lack in years gone by.  For instance, when important GAA matches are played on Sundays, people gather into dance halls in London and tune into amplification of some sort, most often not satisfactory.  It is lamentable that this cannot be done.  I would ask that a radio service be looked into, especially for news bulletins and major events like matches.</P>
    <P>I agree with the setting up of a complaints commission.  They may not have to act very often, but they are a necessary body.  It has been stressed and, rightly so, that this would be a far lesser evil than to have to go through the awful &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; type of tribunal which we had a couple of years ago.  That did not do any good; it actually shattered a large section of a very good reporting team in RTE.  I should like to see something more palatable than a tribunal.  I think a complaints commission would fulfil that role.  There is of course an obvious drawback to the complaints commission, that it would not have jurisdiction over BBC 1 or UTV programmes. I do not know how we can overcome that problem, but it is an apparent problem.  I was rather interested in Senator Cowen's remarks as regards the suppression of news reports and the fact that the IRA and other subversive organisations get too much publicity.  He was of the opinion that by not giving them time on television and radio their views and objectives might be promoted rather than suppressed.  I do not altogether agree with that.  They have been getting far too much publicity.  I take very much to sections of the Minister's opening address, if I may quote a section:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> Commentators insist on the failures of democracy and yet tend to assume the survival of democracy as something to be taken for granted.  A strong overt commitment to democracy is less than general; indulgent attitudes to certain of the enemies of democracy are frequent.  A free Press, whose life-span can be no longer than that of the democratic state under which it exists and under which alone it can exist, has on the whole turned its critical attention more closely on the faults of that State than to the forces which threaten it.</P>
    <P>This is right, of course, if the faults are great and the threat is slight.  The faults are great no doubt, though less I believe than in any other form of organised State that we know.  Is the threat slight?  There are many thoughtful people who do not regard it as slight today, even in Britain, perhaps the most solidly established of all the world's liberal democracies.  It is not regarded as slight either in Italy or Germany.  If that trend is significant in western countries under the economic and social stress of the time, is it likely to be less significant in this land, cursed as it is with private armies and menaced as it is by the appalling situation which these private armies have precipitated in the North?  I do not say created there; I say precipitated.</P>
    <P>In recent years, looking at some of our own television programmes and listening to interviews on radio, one could well get the impression that they were press conferences being held by the IRA.  I definitely got the opinion that there was a very unbalanced attitude adopted to the interviewing of members of subversive organisations and to their figurehead spokesmen, that is the Kevin Street Sinn Féin political organisation as it is called.  These people at times have had free rein. I feel that this type of interview should be balanced.  There should also be a member of our security forces or our Government on that type of programme to give the other view.  Statements are made which are blatantly untrue and incorrect and are allowed <Col N="1335" /> to pass unchallenged.  We must get a certain balance which we have not got at the moment.  I go along with the Minister that there should be certain restraints in these matters where material is likey to lead to or incite disorder.</P>
    <P>Again, if I may quote very briefly from the Minister's speech&mdash;</P>
    <P>To speak more plainly: too many people speak and write as if the armed conspiracies known as the IRA have a legitimate or quasi-legitimate, though usually unspecified, role to play in our society. This permeates the language that is used about them and the language in turn reinforces the peculiar kind of authority which they have held, which has done enormous damage, which may seem perhaps at the moment to be on the verge of decomposing but still requires vigilance, plain speaking and determination in combatting it.</P>
    <P>I understand the point that Senator Cowen made but I do not go along with it.  We have been over lax in the manner in which we condoned the type of publicity they have been getting on State television and radio.  It is time to take firm action in this matter because many people are gullible and impressionable, especially the young.  This type of publicity must stop.</P>
    <P>The type of reporting I refer to is done by a very small minority but even a minority can do tremendous damage.  We have had wonderful coverage of Northern Ireland events since the troubles began.  Actually, I think that a major reason for the recognition of the problems of the minority in Northern Ireland was the activity of RTE, especially RTE television, in filming the peace marches initially at Burntollet and Derry. They showed up the one-sidedness and discrimination adopted by the security forces in the North.  That did tremendous good.  If those people in the Civil Rights movement had been left to do what they had been doing we might well not have what we have today: we might have a much fairer system without the violence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> Senator Browne in his speech criticised Senator Halligan for a statement he made about the interview with Cathal Goulding, one of the IRA men.  Senator Halligan said it should not be allowed to happen.  Senator Browne asked what good did it do.  To a certain extent he was correct.  Perhaps these people, when given too much latitude, can hang themselves&mdash; in other words, show themselves up for what they are.  That interview, perhaps, did not do any harm to the impressionable people because the person involved made such statements that he showed himself up in a very bad light.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred in his speech to culture and our approach to culture and our definition of culture. I agree that our attitude to culture down through the years has been far too narrow.  A certain percentage of our population have got this idea that to be Irishmen we must speak the Irish language, and we must carry out all sorts of cultural activities, and if we do not we are lesser Irishmen. That type of a definition of what an Irishman should be is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>These people may mean well.  We would all like to see the Irish language revived as a spoken language here, but we must let it take its natural course.  The bulk of the people must wish to have it revived; they must take an active part in doing so.  I do not see any point in trying to push the Irish language down the throats of people who do not want it.  I am not in favour of an increase in the time allocated to the Irish language on the present channel if it is to be the only channel for a further period.  There are cultural activities which should be promoted and to which more time could be given.  For instance, Irish music and Irish dancing and Irish games in particular which have tremendous appeal, but I would not like to see the bulk of the population having to endure programmes which have no appeal whatsoever to them because they do not understand the language.</P>
    <P>If we do get BBC 1 or UTV as the second channel surely we will release more time for home-produced programmes <Col N="1337" /> such as I would like to see. This point has not been brought out. For instance, on BBC 1 today I notice that there are two 50-minute programmes which have appeared, and are appearing on Telefís Éireann at the moment and that is &ldquo;The Little House on the Prairie&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Rockford Files&rdquo;.  They are both 50-minute programmes.  If we did have the BBC 1 channel we would not need to have those on RTE television.  It would release more time for home-produced programmes.  On the other hand tonight on RTE television we have a lengthy programme called &ldquo;The Pallisers&rdquo;.  That would not be shown.  Again, there are certain programmes which could be shown twice. For instance, I would like to see Harry Worth twice every week and, perhaps, &ldquo;Tom and Jerry&rdquo; three or four times.  We could use some discretion here and there.  In general, the point has not been made that we will have more time to put on more of our home-produced programmes on RTE. We would all like to see&mdash;but economics do not allow&mdash;multi-channel television and two RTE television programmes side by side and the second RTE television programme to be somewhat like the old BBC Third Programme on radio, where you had language programmes, cultural programmes, religious programmes, educational programmes and highbrow music.  That would be the ideal solution but unfortunately it seems we cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned education, I should like to refer to the schools programmes which are shown on RTE. Again, I think there is unnecessary duplication.  Many of the educational programmes which we get are done on other television networks and could be shown here at much lesser cost.  We could get them from other television networks and they are far superior technically, especially the programmes dealing with science, mathematics and some foreign languages.</P>
    <P>I do not see why we should try to produce programmes which the Americans especially, with use of cartoons and other devices, can produce <Col N="1338" /> in a far superior manner.  It might also be a help, when we have the two channels, if on the RTE channel, some of these educational programmes were produced in the evening: they might have a greater appeal.  My experience is that most schools cannot synchronise their timetables to coincide with educational programmes on television and cannot make use of them as they would wish. It might be well worth looking into it to see if educational programmes would serve a better purpose after schools hours, especially at study times in the evening from 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock onwards.</P>
    <P>A second channel, of course, involves finance.  The Exchequer will have to subsidise RTE more and more as time goes on.  I believe we are going to spend £3.7 million in providing the second transmitter network for this second channel&mdash;a huge expense.  Perhaps our income from advertising will not be as great because the new channel is bound to take away from the appeal of RTE to advertisers as they will feel that they are not getting the same benefit as formerly.  I am open to contradiction on that but I feel we will lose somewhat.</P>
    <P>There is a proposed allocation of £2 million for local studios.  I would like the Minister to explain to us whether this extension of local studios also involves the extension of local broadcasting to provincial centres other than Cork, which has such a service at the moment.  The obvious centres would be Waterford, Limerick, Galway, and Sligo, probably, or somewhere in the Midlands. I would like to know where these studios are to be located and does it mean an extension of the present local radio broadcasting system, and if there is any hope that in the near future there will be local television services as well?  &ldquo;Cork About&rdquo;, the local broadcasting service in Cork is, I believe, a great success.  We can actually hear it now&mdash;not that we understand what they are saying.  It has no real meaning for us even if we could understand what they are saying, but it is a tremendous success and I should <Col N="1339" /> like to see an extension of it to other centres.</P>
    <P>I have some criticism of our existing services.  I should like to see some new faces on our television service, more new broadcasters.  I think we have got into a bit of a rut especially with sport commentators, I should like to see an infusion of new blood into that sector.  We are trying to hang on a bit too long with certain individuals. We get the same faces, the same cliches and the same favouritism for certain counties when they are playing. We could give some younger people a chance.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on some of the extravagances of RTE television and radio in recent years.  What business have we sending a commentator out to Eastern Europe to comment on ice-skating championships?  It seems a dreadful waste of money when it could be used for some better purpose. It is such a minority sport.  Some other English-speaking network could probably give a more informed commentary. Likewise, we seem to find money to send people to European football matches every now and again. Again, we could get the same service from some other network.  We could get it from &ldquo;Eurovision&rdquo; anyway and the commentary from some other television network.  The only thing of interest that one of these gentlemen had to say at a recent match was that his team was losing&mdash;it was a British team: although he was an Irish commentator, he was definitely biased.  He reckoned that the referee had been bribed and that was the local information the night before.  The public are not paying television licences to be financing that sort of a twit, as I would call him, in foreign parts.</P>
    <P>What I would consider a gross insult to the Irish language is being dispensed with but a few years ago we were sending commentators abroad who came in every 20 minutes in the middle of a rugby match to give us their views on what was happening through the medium of Irish.  That sort of a sop is not any help to the Irish language. I would consider it an insult.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> We get ridiculous comments from time to time about how useless Telefís Éireann is.  I think, with the resources at our disposal, overall, despite what I have said, Telefís Éireann do a mighty fine job.  We hear criticism of the canned programmes but some of our most entertaining programmes are canned.  The word &ldquo;canned&rdquo; is a derogatory expression.  If we did not have some of the English and American programmes we would be very short of good material.  Every so often people pass resolutions at county council or urban council meetings, objecting to the violence or permissiveness on some television series.  I hate to think what they will say if we have BBC 1 or UTV.  But we will have to put up with it.  The Minister will have all sorts of resolutions coming to him.  We had a library committee meeting in my county lately and they absolutely scarified a home-produced programme which, in my opinion, was quite all right.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the attacks which have been made on the Minister.  We have had them here during this debate and we have them every day in the papers.  One paper described him today, I think, as a figure of hate.  That commentator was referring to the public regarding the Minister as a figure of hate so that every time he said something, people pounced on it and if it is anything controversial, they pounce on it twice as fast as they would in the case of anybody else.  In discussing this Bill I think journalism has been intertwined with television commentary.  I would say that the Minister is a very much-maligned man.  Many views, ideas and opinions that were formed about him were based on false and malicious reports which came from sources outside this country.</P>
    <P>I think his reputation begins largely at the time of the Congo war. I do not believe that one Irish newspaper or the radio or television service had a reporter in the Congo or anywhere near it.  We got a distorted picture of events and of Deputy Cruise-O'Brien's work.  In nearly every case the reports we got were deliberately twisted because it suited the people who owned the <Col N="1341" /> papers and whose commentators were reporting in those places.  It suited them because they were also involved in the mines and other major money spinning projects, L'Union Miniere in particular.  These people controlled the newspapers.  Incidentally, many of them were British.  The same people owned the mines and the newspapers. Many people here have built upon that false image and upon the malicious type of publicity that Deputy Cruise-O'Brien got then.</P>
    <P>Senator McGlinchey was talking about the Minister last week and his speech was on the Broadcasting Bill but one could hardly discern it from his speech on the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill&mdash;the same sentiment ran through it.  One quotation was repeated verbatim.  He quoted a Portuguese authority as having stated that Deputy Cruise-O'Brien was completely lacking in political ability. He thought that this was great, that it was something to work upon.  Who are the Portuguese to tell us or tell the Minister that he is lacking in political ability?  The Portuguese have not covered themselves in glory as regards politics: their general election last month was the first in 49 years. Senator McGlinchey's source could be described as tainted, especially as they were in the racket of trying to screw as much as they could out of the native Africans in Angola and Mozambique.  We have seen the mess they left behind.  In recent weeks hundreds, if not thousands of people have been murdered or assassinated in Luanda alone.</P>
    <P>I would not regard the Minister as a figure of hate or a person to be despised for his outspoken views. Generally our people have great admiration for him and for saying what he has said.  If the same thing had been said for the past 50 years we might not be in the terrible situation in which we are in today, both North and South.  We have got into a rut due to having politicians who do not want certain things said.  The Minister has shown great fairness and courage in expressing himself.  The only thing that many politicians and many of the public have against him is that he <Col N="1342" /> says it.  They know it is true, just as we all know it is true, but they do not want him to say it.  In America they call it &ldquo;queering your pitch.&rdquo; It is time it was said and he is to be congratulated for saying it.</P>
    <P>Senator Cowen spoke about the divisions within Fine Gael and Labour on security.  After listening to Senator McGlinchey last week and the week before, one could be inclined to say: people in glass houses should not throw stones.  It sounded as if Senator McGlinchey was trying to out-do other members of his party who were known for more radical views in the past.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to thank the Minister for putting such a wonderful effort into the preparation of this Bill.  There have been some wonderful contributions on the mechanics of it.  Senator Horgan's contribution was a masterpiece.  I hope that we will get definite results from it, preferably BBC 1 or UTV as our second channel.</P>

      <P>There does not seem to be anything in the Bill that requires any praise.  There are various sections which are open to criticism. A section of the Bill requires that before a member of the Authority can be removed a resolution has to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister and the Cabinet will discuss it and, if they decide on his removal, it is placed before both Houses.  The Minister by this action is divesting himself of the powers entrusted to him.  The situation is similar to Johnny Giles or a manager of a football team selecting individuals for a team.  They find it very difficult to tell them they are laid off and throw the responsibility on to a board of management.  If the Minister has responsibility for appointing a person to a post he should also have the responsibility for removing that person from his post.  He should not shirk his responsibility by throwing it over on another group of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the whole Authority were required <Col N="1343" /> to be removed from office a week or a fortnight following the Dáil adjournment for the summer what would be the position of the Authority?  Would they still exist until such time as the Dáil and Seanad resumed? Would both Houses of the Oireachtas be recalled in order to remove the whole Authority?  It may not arise but we have had an occasion when the whole Authority were removed. Perhaps the Minister would enlighten me as to what would happen to a person or an Authority if the case arose shortly after the summer recess.</P>
    <P>Another portion of the Bill deals with the complaints commission.  We are not told in the Bill whether this commission are to be remunerated or are they to be like every other commission that sit&mdash;before they even bring in a report they have forgotten what they sat for.  A commission may be appointed by a Minister to look into a certain thing and three months afterwards if the Minister is asked a question on it his answer is that he is expecting the report&mdash;he only gets an interim report until the final report is drafted.</P>
    <P>This complaints commission are in a very peculiar position.  I do not know whether they are subject to the Authority or whether the Authority are subject to them.  If the complaints commission receive a complaint from a viewer or subscriber and they decide that the portion of the programme that is being complained about has to be taken off the air, are they in authority to direct the RTE Authority to remove that part of the programme and can the RTE Authority tell them to mind their own business and that they are not going to remove it?  The commission have not any statutory powers to do such a thing.  They are bound up in another way.</P>
    <P>If we accept what the Minister envisages, that a second channel&mdash;BBC 1, BBC 2 or UTV&mdash;are not to be under the authority of RTE, how are that commission to make a complaint and how are they to have any of that programme taken off the air?  They are <Col N="1344" /> in a very peculiar position and there are many things that will have to be ironed out before such a commission could sit.  I imagine that, if there was a special committee appointed from among the members of the Authority and if all complaints were made to them and when they would have discussed those complaints they would list them down with the full members of the Authority and come to some amicable agreement as to whether the programme was fit for broadcasting or not, that would be a different matter. But once the programme has been broadcast you can complain about it but you cannot undo any damage that has been done by it.  It has come over the air.  You can complain that it was not fit for children to see but that is all the complaining you can do.  It cannot be withdrawn from the people's minds to whom it may have done damage.  The only thing they can do is to try to determine that no such programme will come over the air in future.</P>
    <P>The Authority, set up by the Minister who appoints them, are in a peculiar position.  They have to keep their eye on the complaints commission. They will have to keep their eye on both Houses of the Oireachtas and they will have to keep their eye on the Minister himself, because the Minister may decide sometime that he does not want a certain person on the Authority and wants him removed. He goes before both Houses and puts down a resolution and eventually he has that person removed.  I would not like to be a member of the RTE Authority in those conditions.  I can see some time in the future a complete closedown of both Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann owing to disputes arising within the three parties themselves&mdash;the Authority, the commission and the Minister.  It may lead to some sort of a strike.  I cannot see those three bodies agreeing if some difficulties arise.</P>
    <P>The other thing that is rather objectionable in the Bill and which could cause a lot of trouble is that a second channel would not be under the authority of Radio Telefís Éireann.  We opt for BBC 1 and BBC 2 <Col N="1345" /> and the first thing we are going to get on the channel we opt for will be something that will try to instil into our minds a culture that is alien to us. It will probably be some type of an English doctrinaire culture that is alien to our own culture and heritage. Before long that programme will endeavour to do this.  If that happens we will be listening to nothing on that programme in a very short time but lectures on contraceptives, lectures on divorce, lectures on abortion and lectures on everything that is totally opposed to our nature, heritage and culture.  The RTE Authority will have no jurisdiction over it whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Some Senator said today that a statement has been circulated by the Irish Transport and General Workers Union regarding this situation.  I do not blame them looking after their own jobs.  However, I believe they are doing more than that&mdash;they are looking after the culture and heritage of the Irish people as was brought down through the trade unions and the Labour Party by the teachings of Connolly and Larkin.  It should be respected.</P>
    <P>Along with the 103,000 that are already unemployed there will be another 1,000 added on to that number in redundancies and unemployment within our own network.  I quite agree with Senator West when he said that, if we are not able to control our own television and look after it in our own way, we could make a very poor effort in governing ourselves or looking after any line of our own business.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the second channel should be brought under the authority of RTE.  Let them pick the best programmes that appear on the European television, American television or any television, and examine it.  Eventually they could incorporate it in a programme that they would put out in a second channel themselves. In this way they would have some control over the kind of programmes that would go over the air and it would give some functions to the complaints commission if a complaint had to be made about that programme.  If the other method of <Col N="1346" /> obtaining a second channel takes place the complaints commission or RTE will have no jurisdiction over the second channel whatsoever.</P>
    <P>It would be better if, instead of having a complaints commission, a committee of the RTE Authority were formed to choose the best programmes for a second channel.  This procedure might cause difficulties but I am sure they could be solved without too much bother.  We would then have a second channel which would be far superior to BBC 1 or BBC 2.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Bill deals with impartiality in broadcasting.  We are not being impartial if we prevent the Provisional IRA or Kevin Street Sinn Féin from appearing on television or on radio&mdash;in saying this I do not want anybody to think I am a member of these organisations&mdash; while at the same time allowing Ian Paisley, William Craig and Harry West to give us their views.  These people are not welcome and do not hold any views in common with the people in this part of the country.  If there is to be impartiality it must be recognised as such.  We should not allow any spokesman in this part of Ireland to speak for those people.</P>
    <P>I take a very poor view of the Minister's statements on the radio on 3rd May, especially after the Convention election and before its first meeting.  There was no need for Paisley, Craig and West to tell us there would be no power-sharing.  The Minister did it for them.  He said there was no way this Government could authorise the British Government to authorise the Loyalists to share power.  His statement was ill-timed. This is the type of propaganda in which those gentlemen would engage.  If the RTE Authority were doing their job they would censor such statements.  If the complaints commission were in existence they would receive many such complaints. It is sad to see a Minister using his powers in such a way and causing so much confusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is going a little far in discussing the matter of the broadcast rather than <Col N="1347" /> the question of who should be allowed to broadcast.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Senator appreciates that the contention he has just made could be used to justify discussion on every problem that exists on the Broadcasting Bill and that would widen the debate unduly. The Senator should relate his remarks to the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody should have some authority to censor such statements.  It is too late to make a complaint when the programme has gone on the air.  If one organisation is to be banned, then all organisations should be banned.  Senator Deasy made great play out of the headline in a Sunday newspaper which stated that 82.6 per cent wanted BBC 1. That was only a headline; there was no mention of who carried out the survey or which sections of the community were interviewed.  I would not agree with anything in that survey. If the Minister or the Authority wished to know what type of channel the people wanted they should have gone down the country and they would soon have found that it is not the type of tripe that is coming over on either BBC 1 or BBC 2 that the people of Ireland want to listen to night or day.  If they discover that one of their channels is to be used as a second channel here we can expect worse tripe than we are getting at present.  Our imagination does not have to work overtime to realise that we will not be disillusioned about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest mistake made&mdash;and I blame previous Governments as much as the present Government&mdash;was this. When we started broadcasting our first objective should have been to beam our radio and television programmes into Northern Ireland to let them see and hear what is happening here.  We can get BBC programmes <Col N="1348" /> in certain parts of the country and along the Border.  It is peculiar that we, who are trying to enlighten the majority in Northern Ireland as to our ways and methods of living, what we want to do, how we are trying to be amicable towards them, are not able to put any of our programmes across that paper Border.  That should have been one of the first things we should have done when we started to broadcast radio and television to make sure our signals were strong enough to go into the furthest part of the North.  If they did not want the programmes they need not have tuned in.  But I am sure there are programmes they would be very interested to hear.</P>
    <P>I did not agree with Senator Deasy when he said we should get new broadcasters on our sports scene.  They may be old and even getting stale, but we should have great pride in sports commentators such as Micheál O'Hehir on boxing, racing and so on, and Eamonn Andrews.  They are outstanding commentators. I am doing no harm in paying them that compliment.  In commentating our national games, I do not think there is a man in Ireland or in Europe who could supersede Micheál O'Hehir.  He is not old enough to be pensioned off.</P>
    <P>I am a sports fan and would like to see more sports televised.  There is one sport I have never seen on an Irish television screen, although this country has had the honour of having a few world champions in that same sport &mdash;wrestling.  Some years ago we had two Irishmen in combat for the world championship.  The time wrestling is seen on television is Saturday afternoon on UTV.  This sport is worth cultivating.  Many people like it, if only to find out whether it is a fraud or real.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Senator Deasy finish up lauding the Minister. It reminded me of a few debates when Ministers began patting each other on the back because there was nothing to debate.</P>
    <P>Would it be possible for Telefís Scoile to have the intermediate certificate programme on for one hour and the leaving certificate programme the <Col N="1349" /> following hour?  Could there be a programme in the afternoon, say between 4 and 5 o'clock, for primary schools? This would be interesting for children just home from school and doing their homework.  It would also help with primary school education.</P>
    <P>Many comments could be made on the Bill if it were taken section by section, but this would not be proper on a Second Stage debate.  This will be done on Committee Stage when we will put down amendments which, I am sure, will be of some benefit.  My further comments will be made on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the introduction of this Bill much has been said in support of the Bill and, certainly, much in opposition to the Bill. Speakers from now until the final discussion may be guilty of repetition. There is one aspect I have not heard a speaker on either side refer to up to now&mdash;the standard of reception in certain areas.  I do not know what the extent of these areas are, but in my county, particularly in South Kerry, there are many licence holders who either get no reception or, at best, a very defective reception.  While we have within this broadcasting service some areas, whether by geographical convenience or cable TV development, with four channels, a priority issue for the Minister and the RTE Authority should be to ensure that for those segments of our community who have no reception or a very defective reception positive steps should be taken to ensure that all those who buy a licence get reasonable reception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to impress on the Minister and the RTE Authority that there is not only minor but grave dissatisfaction among a very widespread group of viewers that this defect has continued since the inception of TV in this country 15 years ago.  I realise that there may have been growing pains at the outset.  But surely we should have evolved from that situation long since.  Poor reception is not confined to small isolated valleys. Practically all the coastline of South Kerry and for a considerable depth <Col N="1350" /> inland, is incapable of getting any worthwhile reception.  This is a serious matter.  I expect the Minister and the RTE Authority to take positive steps to have it remedied.</P>
    <P>Opposition to this legislation has come mainly under a number of headings. One is that the development of a second channel should be exclusively by RTE; two, that the proposals in the Minister's legislation will or can lead to cultural and moral deterioration if BBC 1 or UTV are focussed on to the screens in this part of the country.  The development of a second RTE channel would be welcomed and cherished by every person.  We must be realistic.  At this point in time, the nation has not the financial resources to undertake this.  In realising that, we must look at the other side of the picture.</P>
    <P>A substantial number of those paying a licence for television have a four-channel reception.  This, whether it is through geographical convenience or otherwise, creates frustration and annoyance among those of our community, numerous in the South and West of Ireland, who have only one channel.  Not only the present Minister but his predecessors, were under considerable pressure, pressure which has been mounting over the years, for the development of a second channel for all these areas.  These pressures have come, not only from the widespread community who are anxious to have a choice of reception, but from business communities and especially tourist interests, because the west of Ireland is a major tourist development area. One of the factors which has been frequently mentioned is the absence of any choice of reception for people visiting these areas.  I would support the proposed legislation because at this point of time and with the restrictions on our financial abilities, it is necessary to create the opportunity for a second channel for all viewers.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with point two.  The major criticisms in that direction have come from speakers who enjoy four-channel viewing.  Over the years and even before the introduction of an Irish television service, these people <Col N="1351" /> had the opportunity of viewing these stations.  There has been no proof that either the morals or the cultural aspirations of the people in these privileged areas have suffered as a result of watching these programmes. Maybe they feel the people in the south and west are less capable of meeting the challenge or less intellectual. But I can assure them that whatever those in the privileged areas are capable of absorbing, we in the south and west are capable of also.</P>
    <P>A third aspect is loss of revenue. Again let me point out that a substantial number of areas already can receive foreign stations.  Five or six years ago a previous Minister gave authority for the development of cable television in highly built-up areas. Within the ambit of this cable television, foreign advertising was allowed and it can come in on a massive scale.  This did not result in any substantial loss of revenue to RTE. Again, is it assumed that because of the provision of an extra channel to those areas with only one channel at the moment there will be a complete collapse in advertising revenue?  I feel that this will not be the case.</P>
    <P>Another point is that there will be a great number of redundancies.  Let us face this.  In the rationalisation of any industrial service, the question of employment and redundancies must arise.  Since the inception of RTE there has been an expansion rather than a restriction on employment. Under this Bill, we have the Minister's assurance that this will be a continuing development.  The development of a second RTE channel will add to and not detract from job opportunities.  If we make television more attractive, and if we give a choice of viewing, then more people will become interested in television.  This, in turn, will mean an expansion in the manufacturing, distribution and servicing of television.  Therefore, there should be an increase in employment and job opportunities within the television services.</P>
    <P>The development of a second channel, be it BBC 1 or UTV, will give much greater time on the existing <Col N="1352" /> RTE channel for the development of Irish cultural, sporting and educational programmes.  This extra time should give substantial opportunity to our artists, musicians and technicians for a wider and more expanding employment. In the areas discriminated against there is a unanimous demand for a choice of reception.  I do not fear either a deterioration in the moral or cultural aspirations of the people in these areas.  I do not fear loss of jobs or job opportunities.  Our industry, our community and our nation will benefit from the provisions enshrined in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to some remarks made by Senator Deasy.  I compliment him on the manner in which he spoke and the way he presented his argument.  If he keeps up that very high standard, he will be a cause of concern to other Coalition representatives in his constituency at the next election, provided there is a Coalition then.</P>
      <P>However, I feel I should reply to the remarks he made about the Minister. He made a very spirited defence of the Minister.  He went back to the Minister's activities in the Congo and so forth and blamed the malicious thinking of the reporters at the time for the misunderstanding of the Minister's motives and statements. That may be so; I do not know.  But he said something which calls for a reply.  He said that the Minister was a figure of hate.  Those are very strong words.  I could only presume he meant that the Minister was regarded as a hate figure by members of the Opposition, the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not so.  There is no member of any political party who would think in those terms about any Minister of an Irish Government.  One could say that other Ministers, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Cooney, was a figure of hate because we disagreed with Bills he brought into the Seanad.  No Irish public representative would ever regard any member of another political party, and certainly not a Minister of State, in terms of <Col N="1353" /> hate.  Undoubtedly the Minister excites anger at times and possibly resentment and amusement.  His attitude of all-knowing and all-seeing, being almighty, is one that can cause resentment in some quarters and amusement in other quarters.  At times one could be forgiven for wondering if he would soon attempt to walk on water.</P>
    <P>Senator Deasy made a valid comment when he said that, rather than beaming English programmes into Ireland, we should attempt to bring more programmes to the Irish audiences in England.  That was a worthwhile comment.  Not alone should we beam our programmes to the many hundreds of thousands of Irish living in England, but we should beam them to the English themselves and certainly to all the people of the North of Ireland.  We are aware that news as presented by the BBC in regard to Irish affairs is generally a biased and twisted version of the truth.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the Bill as proposed, let me first say that it is a tribute to the Bill of 1960 that so little change is proposed now.  After all, 15 years is a long time in the realm of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I doubt if section 2 can be effective.  It reads:</P>
    <P>A member of the Authority may be removed by the Government from office for stated reasons, if, and only if, resolutions are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas calling for his removal.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be too critical of this section.  It will make all the members of the authority feel more independent and perhaps they might be more effective in carrying out their obligations with this feeling of independence. It may create great difficulties for this Minister or some Minister in the future, because while Members of the Oireachtas may accept that there are good reasons for the removal of any one member of the Authority, to expect them to pass a resolution to that effect may be asking too much.  While it may be a good section, and I am not prepared to be critical of it, at the same time it <Col N="1354" /> carries great risks.  Perhaps the risks are worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with rebroadcasting of programmes, although it is not specified anywhere in the Bill what sort of rebroadcasting the Minister envisages.  He should specify what sort of rebroadcasting he has in mind. In dealing with section 6 I want to refer to section 3 (1A), which states:</P>
    <P>The Authority is hereby prohibited from including in any of its broadcasts or in any matter referred to in paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of this section anything which may reasonably be regarded as being likely to promote, or incite to, crime or to lead to disorder.</P>
    <P>One would expect that section to be there.  But how does one apply this to broadcasts from the BBC or UTV? We will have absolutely no control whatsoever over the type of programmes to be shown here.</P>
    <P>There is another section dealing with the complaints commission.  The establishment of this commission is a completely useless exercise because they cannot deal with programmes presented from outside areas.  We may have programmes beamed here which are alien to the Irish people. There may be, as I have seen on English television, extremists expressing their views in a very forcible and presentable manner.  These people would not be allowed to express their views on RTE under section 3, because it might encourage young people to join the ranks of extremists and they may be influenced by the views presented by these people on television.  At the same time we are being asked to give complete freedom to an outside body who not alone have extremists presenting their views on television, but all sorts of programmes which are not acceptable here.</P>
    <P>I have seen programmes in England with people presenting arguments and proof, as they thought, even to the extent of the non-existence of a higher power.  It is normal viewing to see them knocking, as they describe it, organised religion.  These programmes <Col N="1355" /> were on at a time when young people would be viewing them. I do not think that is right.  I am not predicting what might happen.  I have seen these programmes.  The subculture society exists in England at the moment sees nothing wrong with these programmes.</P>
    <P>Asking us to leave ourselves open to the presentation of that type of programme here is irresponsible on the part of the Minister.  There are other reasons argued against section 6, not alone by Senators here since the debate started but by responsible labour leaders in the country.  Motions were passed, and I quote from <i>Liberty,</i> the magazine of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union:</P>
    <P>The ITGWU sound radio section wishes to bring to the attention of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the extreme gravity with which we view his stated policy of rebroadcasting BBC 1 television in preference to the introduction of a second national channel: Implementation of this policy, which is without precedence in any sovereign State, would be paid for by the Irish public.  It would seriously weaken the present financial structure of RTE and reduce substantially RTE's ability to provide a service worthy of the Irish people.  The resultant run-down of RTE because of the loss of viewers, staff redundancies and lack of growth in regional programming would lead to a situation in which RTE would not be able to maintain its rightful position as a national station.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has deliberately set up a barrier where he will not allow himself to be influenced by the arguments presented from this side of the House, he should at least take note of the views of responsible Labour leaders and some members of his own party.</P>
    <P>One could be critical of the Irish programmes if one wanted to be.  At least let it be said that any programme being presented from RTE can be seen by all the family.  They are not the type of programmes that I have seen in England and America.  All the <Col N="1356" /> family can watch all the programmes that are presented by RTE.  If some of them are dull, let us accept it because they are also worthwhile in so much as they are family programmes. Let us keep ensuring at all times that we have family programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help wondering about the physically strong men on the other side of the House and the way they can shoulder the burden of hypocrisy and lecture to us on the moral code.  It is noteworthy that most of the contributions about the second channel and the danger to the people in the south and parts of the west, where there is only one channel, have come from people who are already getting four or five channels.  While I welcome this Bill my only reservation is that the Minister has not provided five channels because it is only a matter of time, as Senator Deasy has said, until the satellite will give us the five channels.</P>
      <P>I did not hear any of the people from the other side of the House complain that, whereas the people in Kerry or Donegal were paying £20 for a licence for one channel, people in Dublin and parts of the east and west coasts could get four or five channels for the same price.  When Fianna Fáil were in charge of the Broadcasting Authority, was there any complaint when RTE got involved in providing piped television to receive revenue for giving the four or five channels, that we were lowering the moral code?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not doubt Senator Garrett's sincerity but he must have lost touch with reality and the people of rural Ireland when he says they do not want a second channel.  It is very wrong to have a second channel in the country, but it is all right to have it in Dublin. Senator Garrett can go to his hotel tonight and look at four or five channels, but his people in Mayo may only be able to see one channel.  I do not think he will go home any different a man than when he came to Dublin and saw these four or five channels.  Then Senator Hanafin had the same outlook.  I do not know if he can get more than one channel in <Col N="1357" /> Tipperary, but I would ask these Senators to go back to their constituencies and get the facts from the people and then come back here and tell us.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of talk about the loss of jobs that might come about.  This is nonsense.  There are various ways for RTE to increase their revenue and one of the ways I would suggest to the Minister is to give an opportunity, where he has regional stations such as Mullaganish, which is servicing Cork and Kerry, to arrange for people who wish to advertise a foreign product to do an advertising programme on the regional stations.  This would reduce the cost to the advertiser but increase the revenue to RTE.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  My only regret is that we have not five channels instead of two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamWhyte" hpid="Mr. Whyte Mr. Whyte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Whyte</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to add my voice to those that have welcomed this Bill.  We have had a very worthwhile debate on it.  The Minister indicated that he would like as many views as possible on this very important question.  It is important in the sense that it will influence everyone in the country for a number of years to come.  Up to now there was no need for any great change.  There was need for some change and the Minister has sought to bring this about.  There is need for control of some sort on a second channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people believe they have a right to put over what they feel like on a national channel.  It does not make much difference what kind of programmes are broadcast from outside as we do not look upon those as paid for by our own people.  With our own national channel there is need for control.  We have to ask the question: who will be in control?  We may criticise who is in power, we may criticise the Minister who is in charge of the Department, but nevertheless it is the democratically elected Government of the country acting through the Minister and the Oireachtas that must have control.  In troubled times such as we have now, which is one of the aspects of control which springs to people's minds, there is need for <Col N="1358" /> somebody at the top to say a certain type of programme is not suitable to be transmitted.</P>
    <P>The people demand a second channel. This to some extent has been forced upon us.  Half the population at present have a choice of viewing. A great percentage of the people can view outside channels.  It is unfair to say that the country cannot afford to give the other half a share in enjoying other channels.  The Minister has suggested that the second channel should be an English one.  I am not that worried that we would not have much control over it, as I do not think it makes much difference.  Everyone will recognise that it is not a national channel, but is this the best way to use the second channel?  Would it not be better to allow the second channel to broadcast what a responsible Authority would consider a suitable selection from all the other stations? I do not mean this to be taken as another form of censorship.  It need not be another form of censorship. It would be a means whereby those who have only one channel could get the best of the other channels.  The authority to be put in charge would be open to criticism, no doubt, for the programmes they selected.  The majority of the programmes shown on Telefís Éireann at present are imported programmes.  By and large I think a reasonably good job is being done.</P>
    <P>The possibility of having our programmes beamed towards Northern Ireland has been mentioned already. It is the only way to let the Northern people see the type of programme we enjoy.  For too long they have been getting second-hand views about the South of Ireland.  It may be true that we have some very out of date views with regard to the Northern Ireland people.  It is the extreme views that hit the headlines&mdash;the murders, the robberies, the crimes.  People in general are middle-of-the-road people who live quiet lives, do their day's work, have reasonable facilities for their families.  I should like to ensure that people in the North are allowed to see that roughly the same type of people live in the South.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1359" /> There have been comments on the right to free speech.  People are entitled to free speech.  But the right to freedom of speech is very different from the right of giving every crackpot the right to say something over Radio Telefís Éireann.  This is more than the right to free speech.  Very many people tend to accept something that comes from our national television service.  It is our duty to ensure that irresponsible people are given less time than they have been getting.</P>
    <P>The Authority have the duty to ensure that people who appear on television can express their views without being manipulated too much by interviewers.  People very often are made seem foolish in the eyes of the public.  This is wrong.  The Authority have a responsibility.  They cannot implement it in every programme, but they can at times say a word in the ear of a particular interviewer.  In this way they would give people who appear on television the right to express themselves with reasonable freedom.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin said that our Authority would have no control over an outside station, that we should have control over it.  It is well known to the people that this is a station which is beamed from the outside and not a national programme.  So it will not make a great difference whether the control is there or not.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has brought this Bill to the Seanad, and I feel sure that after this debate the people of the country will be more aware of what is involved than they were when we started it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from an area in which it is possible to receive only one channel.  I would be remiss if I did not voice the opinions of the vast majority of the people in my area.  If it is possible for certain areas to have transmissions and receptions of alternative programmes available to them in principle alone these optional programmes should be available to the rest of the country.  We, like all the other citizens in Dublin and the surrounding areas, should have the same choice of programmes.  I am rather <Col N="1360" /> surprised that the objections that have been raised are objections raised by people who themselves have multichannel viewing.  They are preaching that it will be the ruination of the innocent people of the country to have access to alternative viewing.  These same objectors would have the same God-given right to decide what canned BBC programme we would have if that was allowed.  This is where I differ with my colleague, Senator Liam Whyte from Tipperary. I feel that any form of control vested in any one person like this is quite dangerous.  Effectively the alternative to open broadcasting is the use of a second RTE channel with canned BBC piped into it.  If this is the case we must analyse what open broadcasting would mean as a source of competition to RTE as it is currently set up.  It is true that in RTE radio this sort of competition which has been there since radio began has effectively had no bearing whatsoever on either the quantity or quality of programmes put out by RTE radio.</P>
      <P>I say, without fear of contradiction, that 80 or 90 per cent of the people listen to RTE radio in spite of having alternative programmes available to them from BBC.  There are exceptions. Possibly late at night teenage pop lovers tune to Luxembourg or alternative Continental stations.  By and large, RTE radio has certainly never suffered from the competition of our big brothers across the water, from BBC or Radio Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would this competition that we are afraid of from BBC set a very high standard for RTE television?  Is this a standard that they could not achieve through limitation of funds?  If this is true, we have a commitment and a responsibility to ensure that our national television network has ample funds available to it to ensure not alone the running of the programme but that it is able to compete with the best alternative programmes available on other channels.  When we think of the large numbers of unlicensed sets in the country, that something like 50,000 people refuse to pay their lawful contribution to a very worthwhile service&mdash;we wonder at the pious <Col N="1361" /> preachings of people who complain about the lack of funds available to RTE.</P>
    <P>As Senator Deasy said, some of the spending on overseas coverage of events raises the whole question of proper programming and the approach of programmers to a demand for a particular type of programme, whether the programme be in sport, education, current affairs or entertainment.  I do not think for one moment that RTE are not capable of meeting this challenge. Not alone are they capable of meeting the challenge with a certain amount of optimism but they will possibly improve.  From what many of the Senators from both sides of the House have said today, it appears there is room for improvement in RTE.  Perhaps many of the points raised in this debate on the Bill at the Second Reading will awaken in the RTE programmers a consciousness that all is not well regarding the range of programmes which are available to the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In fairness, there are exceptions, as there are exceptions in any criticism. People have likes and dislikes in regard to programmes.  Senator Garrett made the best case possible for the Minister's Bill.  He said that, because of his particular liking for wrestling, the only way he could satisfy himself was to tune into UTV.  This is what the Bill is all about, to ensure that people's likes are available to them at the press of a button.</P>
    <P>Senator Deasy's comment that he was not satisfied with 30 minutes worth of Harry is quite interesting.  I think 30 minutes worth of Harry is quite sufficient.  If we are taking programmes currently transmitted by RTE, we must in fairness mention those with the standing of the news coverage, Round the Country, Frank Hall's programme, is a particular one that comes to mind.  He has the ability for humour and also has a message for us.  I think the programme Frank puts on would never be replaced by any BBC programme.  He usually acts as a conscience for people like myself and others who are elected to office or serve the public in other ways.</P>
    <P>We had quotations from a trade <Col N="1362" /> union booklet representing what purported to be the views of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  This quotation was from a single branch of the union.  Quite rightly that branch of the union were entitled to voice their concern for the welfare of their people employed in Telefís Éireann.  I have the greatest confidence that if there are any grounds whatsoever for concern among any employees of RTE, the Minister will go a long way towards reassuring these people that it is not our intention to make anybody redundant. I have the greatest confidence in RTE in measuring up to this challenge.  It is a challenge and is being looked upon as such by ex-directors and others in RTE.  I am sure they can meet this challenge and thereby ensure that the employment of the people in the station is maintained.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the basic principle involved in the Bill, that what is good enough for Dublin and the surrounding areas must surely be good enough for rural Ireland.  At least we should have the basic right of alternative viewing which many other citizens have.  We are paying the same licence fees; therefore, we should have the same options.  The message coming through from the people is: why should we not have the same options as others?  I have not noticed any great fall-off in the number of people attending church in the Dublin area as a result of viewing supposedly immoral or unchristian programmes on another station.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the section in the Bill which gives power to both Houses of the Oireachtas to remove a member or members of the Authority.  Speakers on the other side of the House have experience of this subject.  The difference in this Bill is that the reason for the dismissal will be laid before the House and can be adequately dealt with by debate.  The Minister has given the right to Members of the Oireachtas to discuss any suggestions for the abolition of the Authority.  This right, vested in the elected representatives, is a basic right which should not be vested in <Col N="1363" /> only one person.  I am glad the Minister had the courage to divest himself of authority and vest it in others.  This is what the Minister has done in this section.</P>
    <P>Much has also been said about the views of people in Northern Ireland. I concur with all the sentiments which suggest that we should be able to beam our television and radio programmes to our colleagues in Northern Ireland to maintain a link with them.  However I am rather disappointed that no groundswell of opinion has come from the minority in the North to let us know if they need or want RTE programmes.  This is disappointing, especially when they claim that they want a link with us in other spheres.</P>
    <P>Mention has also been made of the frequent broadcasting of extreme Protestant opinions on RTE.  Reference was made by Senator Garrett to Senator Deasy's speech, three-quarters of which supported the Minister.  The same proportion of Senator Garrett's speech was devoted to castigating the Minister.  Senator Garrett referred to the frequent appearance of Paisley, Craig and West.  I find that the more often I see these people the more I want to switch off the television.  I do not think their appearances bring any glory to the cause they expound.  Nevertheless it must be accepted that, much as we dislike the views of these people, at least they are elected representatives. If members of illegal organisations in this part of the country offered themselves for election and were chosen to represent a certain section of the population, irrespective of whether I agree or disagree with their views they would then have the same right to appear on the State's network.  They would have the same rights, available to any democratically elected representative in this part of the country, to use the facilities of the communication network.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that TV is the most powerful means of communication available in this age of technology which has made this mass medium available to every home.  We must be conscious of the power of this medium, <Col N="1364" /> a power which unfortunately under present circumstances must be subjected to some form of control.  The controls which have been written into this Bill are put there as a safeguard to ensure that in certain circumstances the security of the State is not endangered by its communications network.</P>
    <P>I have expressed the sentiments of the people and I look forward to the Minister's reply to the various points raised by Senators from both sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which the Minister has introduced provides for a twofold exercise, first is the reorganisation of the control of Radio Telefís Éireann and, secondly, the provision of a second channel to broadcast BBC 1 or UTV.  If we cast our memory back a short time we will recall that the Minister, in reorganising the structure of the control of RTE, divested himself of the authority which reposed, to a great extent, in his predecessor. The manner in which he did that has been criticised by the Opposition. The fact that the Minister has now made it the responsibility of the two Houses of the Oireachtas&mdash;that they should, by a majority, have the right to dismiss a member or members of the Broadcasting Authority&mdash;is an indication that the greatest possible care has been taken to protect the rights which the Minister has conferred on the Authority in the Broadcasting Bill.  These rights concern the acceptance of programmes, types of programmes and the control of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had that sort of situation when he took office and if he wanted to revert back to the position that is being defended by the Opposition&mdash;that the Government, through the Minister, would have the right to dismiss&mdash;then we would have an outcry and for a very good reason.  The cry from the Opposition then would be that the Minister was assuming the mantle of a dictator.  But when the Minister divests himself of that authority and leaves it to the elected representatives at parliamentary level to be the jury which will try, absolve or <Col N="1365" /> condemn, as the case may be, as they think fit, then he is taking the proper action and should be commended as I commend him.</P>
    <P>The other part of the exercise is the provision to broadcast UTV or Ulster Television as it is now known, or BBC 1.  This is a choice of programme that is available to two-fifths of the people of this country at present.  In the centre of Ireland, Longford, I can get four stations, but when I lived with my relations in Cork I found they could only get one station.  When they visit me they are fascinated at the idea that there are four stations available for the licence fee we pay, in North Leinster, most of Ulster, that portion of it which is in the Republic, around Dublin and somewhat further south along the coast.  We can have a choice of stations for the same licence fee that they pay and they can have only one station.  We have all looked at the various programmes on many occasions and I am sure that, relatively speaking, Radio Telefís Éireann is today able to challenge any other as regards the number of viewers.</P>
    <P>Senator Garrett was very emphatic in saying that he switched on the UTV to see wrestling, but many young people in the country switch on to see other entertainments of a kind that are harmless and more interesting and educational.  It is true that some programmes on BBC 1 are not everything to be desired, but let me say that over the past four years I found the same situation in regard to a few programmes on Telefís Éireann.  It is impossible to select what is best for the people or know what is suitable before it is actually broadcast.</P>
    <P>The situation that exists in relation to this part of the country and Northern Ireland, to my mind, cannot be made better by the sort of contribution that Senator Garrett has made. The notion that either Paisley or Craig or anybody should not be entitled to their views, however extreme or unreasonable those views may be, is something that is only comparable to the thinking of those in the North who say that we have no right to air our views.  There are 1½ million people there of which that particular section have a <Col N="1366" /> controlling, representative Parliament. We must get them to talk to us before we can make any progress in regard to either peace or unity.  There is no good in saying that these people should be suppressed and that this is the only way objectors to unity can be dealt with.  That is an extremist view.  I believe&mdash;and it is the view of many people in this country&mdash;that if these extreme elements in the North saw us in our everyday life they would find that we are not what the Paisleys, the Craigs and the others tell them we are.</P>
    <P>In that regard I regret very much that on occasions when there was an interchange of views between people of standing in the South and in the North on vital matters it was not possible to get their image but we heard the sound of the Northern commentator or the Southern commentator. That is a bad situation to obtain in an island as small as this.  The Minister when he lets these people know&mdash;I am sure the effect of this Bill will be to let them know&mdash;that we are a broad-minded people and that we are a sincere, honest people with a desire for peace and co-operation, the people of the North, including the Protestant community, will see that there is much that we have in common with them and there is much about us they would like.</P>
    <P>On the other hand if we were able to get Ulster Television relayed here and see the common people in their everyday life we would see much of what we might be convinced is very different from the image that we get from certain vested interests.  I would like to see the day approaching, and I hope it will be soon, when the Minister will have a reciprocal arrangement whereby Radio Telefís Éireann will broadcast and relay programmes in Northern Ireland on the Northern network so that the Northern people will have the opportunity of becoming acquainted with us.  The problem we have is that we cannot talk to these people.  The problem they have is that they cannot talk to us.  They cannot see us and we cannot see them.  The image that we have of them is a very old-fashioned image, the image of 50 or 100 years ago.  The image they have of us is equally obscure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> I am asking the Minister to direct his attention to the problem of having RTE radio and television programmes relayed in Northern Ireland so that our fellow countrymen will get to know us. Radio Telefís Éireann has been broadcasting certain programmes.  I regret to say they have for the youth the tendency to promote violence.  It is all right for adults of a certain age to watch &ldquo;Cannon&rdquo; and other American gangster films.  No matter how well reared a family is you will find in it a young lad with a gun, sniping at another kid and falling on the floor pretending to be shot.</P>
    <P>If we had the situation portrayed where a man was being run down by a car amid a great amount of laughter and enjoyment while he was being mutilated and carried away dead we would say that was a terrible thing to put before our youth.  But you have the equivalent of that when you present gun play to children of eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13 and 14 years.  I think that it has a very bad effect.  As soon as possible this position should be examined to see to what extent it can be made less injurious to the very young.</P>
    <P>The question of what programme is broadcast on the second channel is certainly a matter of concern to most people.  In the particular area where only the second channel can be received along with the Radio Telefís Éireann programme as at present, I think the Minister should see if he can vary with UTV, BBC 1 or, perhaps extracts from other programmes.  In doing that our minds would be broadened and our understanding of the outside world would be made so much better.  We would be independent of the story we hear at the street-corner or the crossroads, or the story we hear from the propagandists outside the church gate who want to tell us that everything is wrong that society is upside down, that we must change everything and to do what he wants us to do.  This could mean a completely leftist organisation and a leftist outlook.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> I think it is a compliment to the Irish people that through television it is an enlightened people who have given decisions in many matters in the last few years&mdash;perhaps in the last few months&mdash;when, if they believed what they were told at church gates they would act irresponsibly.  People have acted very responsibly.  That is an example of the influence of television. It is a tremendous influence.  It is an influence that the Government of the day can utilise in the best interests of the people.  I appeal to the Minister to have a look at this aspect of the problem and decide for future years what programme will be in the national interest.  I am satisfied that he is taking a step that will broaden our interest, increase our association with our fellow countrymen in the North and-hopefully-give us the opportunity of presenting ourselves as we are to them and securing their final acceptance of us as people of the one nation.</P>

      <P>As I expected it would be, this has been a very valuable debate, the most exhaustive, representative discussion of broadcasting in Ireland that has taken place in many years, even covering much ground that was not entered on in the debate on the original Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In replying to a debate so far-ranging I am in a little bit of a dilemma in that I do not want to be too exhaustive.  I spoke at considerable length in opening this debate. Neither do I wish that Senators should feel that there is anything perfunctory about my reply.  I think I shall err on the side of the exhaustive rather than the perfunctory.  I do not think that I shall be able to conclude this evening, though I have a fair amount to say this evening.  I am influenced by the fact that many Senators made the point, of which I accept the force, that in my opening statement I did not explain adequately the concept of the second channel or my concept of rebroadcasting.  Many Senators on both sides made that point.  I fully accept its force.  I want to go into that.  It requires to be gone into at some length.  At the same time <Col N="1369" /> there are a number of other major points that were raised that need to be answered at this stage of the debate.</P>
    <P>What I propose to do tonight is to deal with all the major aspects other than the open broadcasting or rebroadcasting, second channel, and when we resume in the morning to deal with that aspect which I think, after hearing the debate and the commentary on the debate in the country, is probably the aspect of this Bill that is of most interest, gives most hope perhaps to some and most concern to others.  I would like to deal with it reasonably thoroughly.</P>
    <P>In my reply to this stage of the debate I shall not attempt to cover all the points that were raised.  Many of them will more appropriately be dealt with, as far as I am concerned, on Committee Stage, although of course they were quite rightly raised by Senators at this Stage.  Important points, for example, have been raised about the subject of local broadcasting, about which there will be much to be said, I hope, on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal now with the main areas of the debate and of the Bill.  Senator Markey identified these I believe correctly as the complaints commission, the control of broadcasting matter, the idea of open broadcasting as envisaged by the Minister and the procedure for the removal from office of members of the Authority.</P>
    <P>I now propose to deal with three of these areas, leaving over until tomorrow the question of open broadcasting. These questions are not all of the same degree of importance or equally controversial.  I shall take them more or less in ascending order of the extent to which they bulked in the debate.</P>
    <P>First of all, I take the question of the procedure for the removal of members of the authority.  Most Senators who considered this aspect regarded the new procedure as an improvement.  Senator Horgan, I believe, put the matter in a nutshell when he referred to this and other <Col N="1370" /> sections of the Bill&mdash;to which I shall come later&mdash;as writing into law &ldquo;the idea that a body set up by the Oireachtas is fundamentally responsible to the Oireachtas, and not just to part of the Oireachtas, the Executive&rdquo;. I agree entirely with that formulation. I wish I had thought of it myself.  This essential concept was as I say, approved by most Senators who referred to it.  Some Senators, among them Senator Killilea and Senator Dolan and one or two Senators today, suggested however that this provision represented a &ldquo;shirking of&rdquo; or &ldquo;shrinking from&rdquo; his responsibility by the Minister.  I would like to say that the exact opposite is the case. This section&mdash;and the section about statutory directions which is analogous in respect&mdash;represents not a shirking or shrinking of responsibility but an acceptance of the principle of the Government's responsibility to the Oireachtas in such matters and, more important, an extension of the application of that principle in practice.  It will still be for the Government to take the decision whether to remove a member or members of the Authority but if they decide to remove a member or members they will have to convince both Houses of the Oireachtas on the propriety of that decision.  These Senators suggested that by adopting this procedure the Minister was in some way making things easier for himself by a transfer of responsibility to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We are all Members of the Oireachtas and I wonder if that argument can be seriously presented in the Oireachtas.  I think that on consideration the Senators will see that a Government which impose upon themselves a new statutory responsibility to the Oireachtas in such a matter are not making things easier for themselves but quite the contrary: they are making things a good deal harder for themselves in order to uphold and clarify the concept of democratic responsibility in relation to broadcasting.  Of course the clarification is very important here, the bringing of things before the Oireachtas and therefore before the people in open debate so there is nothing being <Col N="1371" /> swept under the rug, nothing being held back.</P>
    <P>It is claimed that it does not matter that since the Government of the day enjoy the majority in the Oireachtas that they steamroll the thing through anyway and they get whatever they like.  I do not think it is quite like that.  If a Government have a bad case in such a matter-Governments may have bad cases from time to time&mdash; they will shrink from that test and the test is there in order to make them shrink.</P>
    <P>When one speaks of the Minister or the Government accepting this or that limitation in this or any other piece of legislation, one is saying something which is true, but only part of the truth.  If the Oireachtas makes this provision into law it will be binding on any Government unless and until it is repealed.  This Bill, if passed, will ensure that no Government will in future be able to dismiss members of the Authority before the end of the term of office fixed for them when they were appointed, without first getting the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I think it likely that this provision, if passed into law by us, will become a permanent part of our broadcasting law.  This was a reason on which Senator Kilbride very ably touched.  It will be hard for a Government to come forward and say: &ldquo;Listen, I have to come before the Oireachtas at the moment if I want to sack the Authority.  I do not like that, I would rather have the authority that we had before to sack them without asking anybody or telling anybody and without giving any reason.  I would like to have that power back. Give it back to me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I may not get a very good Press for this Bill.  I got a reasonable one and I am not complaining.  I think any Minister who came forward with that proposition who said: &ldquo;I want to dodge the scrutiny of the Oireachtas, I want to recover total arbitrary power in that matter&rdquo;, would get a very bad reaction and so long as we have a democracy he is not likely to do that.  Therefore I think this is one aspect of this legislation which may <Col N="1372" /> well stand the test of time for that reason.  As I say, the main point about this is that decisions in this sensitive area and the reasons for them shall henceforward be made openly and be subject to closer scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that one or two Senators this evening stressed how easy it would be for me to abuse or dismiss the Authority.  Coming from those benches, that is a strange criticism, given the history of this matter, but I shall not dwell on that aspect.</P>
    <P>Some Senators suggested that if the Oireachtas is to be responsible for removing members of the Authority from office, the Oireachtas should also have power to appoint them.  This does not follow.  Within a period of appointment, which is an important limitation, the security of members of the Authority, if this legislation is passed, will be very like that of judges: who cannot be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour and then only by approval of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  But, of course, under Article 35 (1) of the Constitution, judges are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government, not by the Oireachtas, and their appointments do not require the approval of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>There are good reasons for that.  I am not sure whether the idea of appointment of members of the Authority by the Oireachtas was really mooted as a serious proposition in itself, or whether it was not simply intended to discredit or disparage the idea of requiring dismissals to be submitted to the Oireachtas.  It is clear in any case that there is an important distinction between the two concepts. The Government are appointed by the Oireachtas and the qualifications of their members can be subjected to debate there, often very sharp debate. Politicians accept that&mdash;that is what they are for.  Neither judges nor private citizens, such as those who accept appointment to State bodies like the RTE Authority, have chosen to submit themselves to such ordeals, which might be actually harmful to their future discharge of their tasks.  The case of a dismissal, which would be expected to be a rare event, is different <Col N="1373" /> in kind and in this case it might be expected that the person or persons concerned would welcome an opportunity for the vindication of his, her or their position.  For these reasons the Government consider that, while the final decision to remove members of the Authority from office should be in the hands of the Oireachtas, the appointment of the Authority should continue to be on the same basis as appointment to all other public boards, that is, a matter for Government or ministerial decision, and so it will be under this legislation if it is passed.</P>
    <P>The second area with which I wish to deal now to some extent is that of the complaints commission.  I will come in a moment to what I mean by &ldquo;to some extent&rdquo;.  The number and nature of the questions posed by Senators in relation to the commission show that there are genuine and fairly widespread perplexities about what the commission are supposed to do.  I should have liked to answer all these questions at this stage, but I think from the tenor of the debate so far Senators would prefer me to use their time to make a more extended statement at this stage of the debate on the open broadcasting question. Accordingly, I will deal in detail and at length on Committee Stage with the questions raised on the complaints commission in the debate, but I would just like to make a few general points on this subject now.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan suggested that the commission would be an example of elephantiasis, and a number of other Senators said they would be too elaborate, too cumbersome and too ponderous and so on, all of which seems to fit into the same diagnosis of elephantiasis.  The sections of the Bill dealing with the setting up of a complaints commission are lengthy and seem complex with the result that Senators may have got a wrong impression&mdash;I think they have&mdash;about the proposed commission.  In fact the body that would be set up would be quite simple in character.  It would consist of part-time members and would consider only unsatisfied complaints alleging breaches of the requirements regarding objectivity and impartiality, <Col N="1374" /> of the prohibition on broadcast of any matter that may reasonably be regarded as likely to encourage or incite to crime and so forth&mdash;whatever may be the final wording of that section, or any statutory direction issued in this connection and so forth.  They would operate in precisely the same way as the existing complaints advisory committee, the only difference being that, in order to demonstrate their independence of both RTE and the Minister, they would be serviced by the Department of the Public Service.</P>
    <P>Though it is possible that the volume of complaints might increase somewhat as a result of the publicity arising from discussion of the new legislation, it is hardly likely to reach anything like unmanageable proportions.  Experience with the existing advisory committee is a good enough indication of the likely volume.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald asked for information about how the complaints advisory committee have worked.  Three complaints have been made to the committee to date, curiously enough, the same number as was submitted to the equivalent British body last year.  The complaints concern (1), unbalanced coverage arising out of a speech by the Minister in Waterford in February, 1974 &mdash;not a complaint by the Minister; (2), unbalanced reporting relating to a public meeting at Coláiste Mhuire in June and a private deputation by LFM to the Minister for Finance on the same date; and (3), one-sided broadcasts in connection with the Contraception Bill.  In all these cases the committee found in favour of RTE.</P>
    <P>It may be asked: if unsatisfied complaints are so few, why bother with a statutory complaints commission? The answer is that it is of considerable importance to have this mechanism in existence so that when complaints are made about alleged breaches of impartiality, neither the Authority nor the Minister are seen to be judges in their own cause.  That is very important because in the past the vacuum left in the legislation meant that the sole judge of impartiality <Col N="1375" /> and so forth was the Minister of the day.  The Minister could take a position on impartiality, on matters affecting his own Department, or appearances of the Opposition on television and so on.  That was undesirable.</P>
    <P>The knowledge of the existence of this mechanism should of itself contribute to a reduction in the number of unsatisfied complaints on this important question.  There are many other matters relating to the complaints commission that I have not answered here but I shall make a statement on the Committee Stage on the complaints commission, explaining in more detail how they will be expected to work and answer the various points made.</P>
    <P>The third area of concern to which I gave quite an amount of time, perhaps too much, in my opening remarks, is that identified by Senator Markey as &ldquo;the control of broadcasting matter&rdquo;, that is, the restriction imposed on the Authority and the power of intervention conferred on the Minister by sections 3 (1A) and 16 of the Bill, replacing the existing section 31 (1) of the 1960 Act. Though I could not undertake at present to construe with any degree of precision the attitude of the main Opposition group in the Seanad to these provisions, it seemed from the debate that there was a fairly wide concensus to the effect that some statutory constraint is necessary in this area.  Senator Mullen, for example, said: &ldquo;I am not advocating that the IRA, Provos or Official IRA should have a free run on RTE&rdquo;. Senator Robinson said, and I quote from Volume 79, column 931:</P>
    <P>There is justification for State censorship, it is enshrined in our Constitution and it is reflected in our laws and reflected in both the Broadcasting Act and this Bill.</P>
    <P>Both these Senators were, of course, critical both of the Bill and of existing practice, and I merely quote these particular remarks to show how far consensus appears to extend on the principle that some form of restriction <Col N="1376" /> on broadcasting in relation to these matters is justifiable.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks I spoke at some length on what one might describe, perhaps pretentiously, as the philosophy behind such restrictions. Not many Senators entered into this territory but those who did, notably Senator Horgan and Senator Michael D. Higgins and to some extent Senator Robinson, had important things to say which have to be answered at this stage, if at all, as they are intrinsically unlikely to arise in Committee.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan's statement was a very weighty one which I believe will be carefully read and considered by broadcasters and journalists in this country.  I find myself in agreement with much of what he said, and disposed to further reflection rather than contention over much else.  There are, however, some points on which I would like to comment at this stage. Senator Horgan seemed to me to rely to an extent greater than I think the Oireachtas would be justified in relying, on what might be called a kind of inner light guiding broadcasters in these matters.  He said, quote:</P>
    <P>The good professional journalist operates in terms of impartiality by the seat of his pants.  He does not need maps to guide him.  He has, I would hope, an in-built professional instinct born of his experience and of his training, if he is lucky enough to have any, which tells him whether or not he is being fair, not just to the people with whom he disagrees but to people with whom he agrees.</P>
    <P>Elsewhere he said:</P>
    <P>the proper place for this kind of concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and this is concern with matter which might lead to crime and so on</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;is not an Act but basically in the professional conscience of people involved.</P>
    <P>I would agree generally that the more things can be left to the good sense of broadcasters the better it will be, and I would agree that broadcasters have as much good sense as other sections of the community.  But I think also that <Col N="1377" /> the State which is responsible to the citizens generally and not just to broadcasters, must retain a reserve right to intervene where is considers that the activities of broadcasters may be likely to endanger the community or a section of the community.  It is not enough to leave this to the professional conscience of each individual broadcaster. A broadcaster's individual judgment might tell him that it was right and proper, in a particular circumstance, to broadcast most inflamatory matter and he might, quite sincerely and with a good conscience as far as he was concerned, act on that judgment. Such a case is rare but it can occur&mdash; I would even say it has occurred&mdash;and the community, through the democratic organs which represent it, has to have reserve powers of intervention in such a contingency.</P>
    <P>This grand question of the right of democracy to protect itself is central to this part of the debate.  There seems to be some misunderstanding in this area.  Senator Robinson, for example&mdash;I am sorry she is not here as I do not like to criticise her in her absence; however, she will read what I say and come back later&mdash;having rightly noted the emphasis which I placed on &ldquo;the fact that democracy is under attack&rdquo; went on to say, wrongly, that I</P>
    <P>identified this with criticism of the existing Government, the <i>status quo</i> and the establishment in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how Senator Robinson can have drawn the first two inferences from anything that I said here or elsewhere.  I do not identify, and never have identified, criticism of the existing Government with attack on democracy.  Quite the contrary, I regard freedom to criticise the existing Government as an essential part of democracy and I made clear in my opening statement that I took that view.  Nor did I identify criticism of the <i>status quo</i> with an attack on democracy. Democracy provides the opportunity of changing the <i>status quo</i> by peaceful means, and is, therefore, the <Col N="1378" /> healthiest political critique of the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>As regards the establishment, that is a loose term used in various senses and I am not sure what Senator Robinson means by it.  She uses it quite a lot.  I know, however, that the term is often used as a kind of pejorative hold-all which can include the parliament, the judiciary and the other institutions of a democratic state.  In that sense I object to the term &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; and I consider the use of this term in that sense as a way of attacking democracy. I am not saying that Senator Robinson used it in that sense.  I do not know in what sense she was using it.  Perhaps at some stage she will make it clear.  I am suspicious of those forms of support for a vaguely conceived ideal democracy which involve contempt for the actual working institutions of democracy, including this Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There are ways of setting one's democratic sights so high that the basic distinction between democratic systems and undemocratic systems drops out of view.  Senator Robinson seemed to be in some danger of doing this when she said, as reported at column 928, Volume 79 of the Seanad Official Report:</P>
    <P>I do not think that this country is as democratic as any in the world. The powers of Government and administration are highly centralised, and a substantial area of public concern is outside the control of the democratic process in a direct sense because it is under the control of State-sponsored bodies and we do not even have any parliamentary committee reviewing the performance of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>We have failed to evolve mechanisms for allowing the individual to complain effectively against the administration&mdash;institutions such as an ombudsman or such as an impartial tribunal relating to the Garda.  We do not have any regional democratic structures.  On any objective analysis of the system in this country we do not come out as one of the most democratic countries either in Western <Col N="1379" /> Europe or in the world generally and we are fooling ourselves if we think we do.</P>
    <P>It might be more democratic to have certain kinds of Parliamentary Committees, to have an ombudsman or a Garda review body and so on.  Some people think it would be more democratic to abolish University representation in the Oireachtas.  But these matters, signficant though they may be, are peripheral refinements in comparison with the large crude fact about democracy: that it is the system under which people can change the Government under which they live through the ballot box.</P>
    <P>Over insistence on the desirable refinements which are not there, combined with a tendency to ignore the basic fact which is there, involves a danger of selling the precious reality of democracy short.  It tends to undermine the right of democracy to defend it.  The inference can only too readily be drawn that a democracy so flawed is no true democracy at all.  There are those who are only too ready to draw such an inference for purposes which I am sure Senator Robinson neither intends nor approves.  The fact is that she is herself such a sheltered flower of the democratic system that she has difficulty in realising how unusual and how menaced a system it is.  She thinks, for example, that we in Ireland &ldquo;do not come out as one of the most democratic countries either in Western Europe or in the world generally&rdquo;.  The great majority of countries in the world have no democracy at all and never had any.  Some had and have lost it.  They are countries in which the government change when the armoured cars arrive at the President's palace, and not otherwise.</P>
    <P>To the extent that we allow armed conspiracies to flourish among us, we too are in danger of being brought to that condition.  That is why some of us think it of more importance to expose and frustrate the varied activities of these conspiracies than to dwell excessively on relatively minor shortcomings of our parliamentary institutions.</P>
    <P>In general, I think people in this <Col N="1380" /> country are not sufficiently aware of how remarkable an achievement our democracy is.  Two American political scientists, S.M. Lipset in a book called <i>Political Man</i> published in New York in 1963, and Frank Munger in a paper called <i>The Legitimacy of Opposition;</i> published this year in London, show that very few countries with as few resources as ours and very few countries which have attained political independence in this century, have succeeded in maintaining stable democracy as we have done.  Our achievement may, in fact, be unique when these two factors are combined.  I think this is one case in which we are justified in taking a sober and wary pride in our achievement rather than disparaging it by dwelling excessively on its shortcomings.</P>
    <P>Before leaving that particular subject I would like to refer to Senator M.D. Higgins' comments.  He was somewhat bridled at the mention of the democratic value enshrined in our Constitution. He thought it should be &ldquo;all the values&rdquo; enshrined in our Constitution. Some of the things enshrined in our Constitution have been removed by the people.  The most key factor of the Constitution is that it provides within itself the means of changing it by democratic process, by the will of the people.</P>
    <P>That is why the Bill speaks of &ldquo;the democratic values&rdquo; enshrined in the Constitution, that which does not change, that which cannot change as long as this country remains a constitutional democracy.  It is important, therefore, that broadcasting should protect that and not any specific Article of the Constitution which, other than the democratic values, may change and which many of us think ought to be changed.</P>
    <P>I promised in my opening remarks to give careful consideration to any suggestions by Senators which improve the wording of sections 16 and 3 (1) (a) of the Bill which provides:</P>
    <P>...wherever it can be shown that different wording would tend to eliminate possible abuse, without seriously endangering the objectives sought in these sections...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> A number of Senators, who I know support that general objective, expressed considerable misgivings about the wording of these sections, and especially the reference to &ldquo;disorder&rdquo;, which they felt might lead in certain circumstances to use of the Bill for purposes for which it is not intended. This wording is in the British legislation: it has not been significantly misused there&mdash;not misused at all as far as I know&mdash;and I would hope it would not be misused here.  At the same time I attach weight to the objections of these Senators.</P>
    <P>Senator Halligan, in his very thoughtful contribution to this debate, made a suggestion which will, I think, lead to an acceptable solution of this difficulty.  His suggestion involved the removal of the reference to &ldquo;disorder&rdquo;&mdash;many Senators pointed out that &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; could be too widely abused&mdash;and the inclusion of a reference to &ldquo;the security of the State&rdquo;, a matter on which, as he rightly pointed out, I laid considerable emphasis in my opening remarks.  I shall keep in touch with Senator Halligan and any other interested Senators on either side of the House between this and Committee Stage and I think it should prove possible to frame an acceptable amendment on the general basis of Senator Halligan's suggestion.</P>
    <P>Senator Noel Browne said a good deal about violence in the course of his rather discursive remarks here. Much of what he said was interesting, and I agree with much of it, as the Senator knows.  But I found from sad experience that there is nothing that the Senator hates more than to be agreed with.  The Senator's view of the world is that he, and he alone, is sincere in believing the things he believes. Anyone else, therefore, who may appear to be saying somewhat the same things is suspect in that precise degree, and will soon need to have his insincerity exposed and his character flayed.  So I will not dwell on the extent of my agreement with parts of what the Senator said.  His was a rather rambling speech and I shall not attempt to accompany him <Col N="1382" /> on his rambles.  He likes to be alone and I cheerfully respect his wish.  Just one or two points, however, need to be made.  As regards violence he said &mdash;Seanad Official Report, Volume 60, column 967:</P>
    <P>It was from our teachers in our schools that we learned about this violence.</P>
    <P>He goes on to inquire why I do not talk about that and then supplies his own answer which is that I am &ldquo;a petty, cowardly bully-boy poltroon&rdquo;. The fact is that I was talking here about broadcasting rather than about education, because I was introducing a Broadcasting Bill and not an Education Bill.  As the Senator knows, I am concerned about teaching that incites to violence and I have spoken about that in appropriate places in the Dáil&mdash;see, for example, Dáil Official Report, Volume 259, No. 2 columns 246-9&mdash;at meetings of teachers and, for example, at a conference of teachers of history.  And I have discussed it with the Minister for Education, who is in full agreement with me on this subject and is also on record to that effect.</P>
    <P>But it is broadcasting we have to discuss here.  It is true that Senator Browne may not have felt much obligation to keep to the point, since he repeatedly said that he regards the Bill&mdash;the subject under discussion here&mdash;as itself totally irrelevant.  The word &ldquo;irrelevant&rdquo; is one often used by students as a sort of all-purpose, knock-down-drag-out, term of rejection. It is used to dismiss a proposition which you do not understand when put forward by a person you do not like.  I think it was in that sense Senator Browne used this term.</P>
    <P>While the Senator was clear in the negative sense in his rejection of this Bill, he was vague, though intense, about what it was he wanted.  The only specific thing he seemed to urge was that we should imitate the example of Holland, a country, he said, &ldquo;notoriously advanced in its views...a very civilised and advanced country&rdquo;.  I share the Senator's admiration for Holland.  The broadcasting legislation of Holland, <Col N="1383" /> which the Senator holds up for our emulation, provides that, and I quote:</P>
    <P>transmission must not contain anything that involves danger to the security of the State, public order and morality.</P>
    <P>The Senator can tell us on Committee Stage whether he recommends that formulation.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator McGlinchey's speech&mdash;very few of the people I am talking about seem to be here this evening&mdash;I think there is only one thing which it is needful for me to put on the record.  Senator McGlinchey at the beginning of his remarks said he was sure I would be relieved that Senator M.D. Higgins would not be a candidate for the post of Director-General of RTE and that the Minister would, and I quote:</P>
    <P>recall with sadness his efforts to ram the name of the director of his propaganda machine down the throats of the RTE Authority with no success.</P>
    <P>That statement is completely untrue and also damaging to a person who cannot defend himself here.  I, therefore, cannot leave this statement uncorrected on the record.  The gentleman to whom the Senator will be understood by some as referring is the Director of the Government Information Services, Mr. Muiris Mac Conghail. Mr. Mac Conghail was at no time a candidate for the Director-Generalship of RTE and I at no time intervened to have him appointed to that or any other RTE post.  The Senator appears to be relying on a Sunday newspaper report, garbled in itself, which claimed <Col N="1384" /> that I had tried to have another gentleman, whose Christian name also happened to be Maurice&mdash;and that is the bond between them&mdash;appointed as Director-General.  The Senator took a garbled newspaper report, not only made no attempt to check it but distorted it still further and presented it to the Seanad as fact.  I shall make no further comment on that Senator's utterances.</P>
    <P>I have now reached the point in my remarks where I would be entering on the subject of rebroadcasting, so I will draw to a close.  There is just one point I will make before I close.  Some Senators&mdash;this needs to be cleared up here and now&mdash;referred in dealing with this to an abandonment of sovereignty, to handing over the national broadcasting resources to foreigners and so on.  Nothing of that kind is involved here.  The proposal is that we shall, if Parliament and the people approve, use the transmission material which we are putting in, to rebroadcast BBC services.  We can drop that at any time we like.  We can retain complete control over our own territory and over our own broadcasting system. If the people do not like what is being rebroadcast, we will simply drop that and broadcast something else, which could be RTE 2 or something else. There is no abandonment of sovereignty here whatever.  I would like to develop the rest of my thoughts about rebroadcasting.  So, with your permission, a Chathaoirleach, I will resume the debate tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 14th May, 1975.</P>
