    <Title>Restrictive Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1975: Second and Subsequent Stages:</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm an order which was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  The order was made on the recommendation of the Restrictive Practices Commission which was contained in their report of a special review carried out into the supply and distribution of petrol.  The report and order were presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the 18th June, 1975.</P>
      <P>It might help if I explained the background to the making of the order. Some years ago the Society of the Irish Motor Industry asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to examine the possibility of curbing the growth in the number of petrol retail outlets.  The Minister requested the Restrictive Practices Commission to hold a public inquiry into the matter and the inquiry was held in 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the inquiry showed that the number of retail outlets owned by the oil companies had been increasing unduly and the proportion of total sales of petrol through these outlets had risen substantially.  The commission felt that unless this trend was checked the oil companies would gain substantial control over retail distribution. <Col N="308" /> Such control would probably reduce competition, facilitate restrictive practices such as market sharing and price fixing, and extend the economic power of the multinational oil companies.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission recommended, among other things, that the oil companies should not open any new company-owned retail outlets for three years.  This recommendation was accepted by the Minister and on the 15th June, 1972, he made the Restrictive Trade Practices (Motor Spirit) Order, 1972.  Article 3 of that order prohibits oil companies from opening new company-owned petrol stations for three years ending on the 18th July, 1975.  However, there were three exceptions to the prohibition, the first being a transitional one which applied to certain retail stations under construction when the 1972 order was made.  The other two allowed a company-owned retail outlet to be opened within a mile of one which had closed down (a) because of compulsory purchase by a local authority or (b) because of loss of trade due to road diversion.  The Minister undertook at the time to ask the Restrictive Practices Commission to review the operation of the prohibition before it expired on the completion of its three-year period of application.</P>
    <P>The review, which took the form of a series of private hearings, was carried out last March.  The hearings were attended by representatives of seven oil companies, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and the Irish Petrol Retailers' Association.  The report of this review now shows that the order had been reasonably effective.  Although the number of independent outlets continued to decrease in 1974, the number of company-owned outlets which had previously been increasing also decreased. In addition while sales by independents continued to increase sales through company-owned outlets, which had increased fairly substantially in previous years, fell in 1974.  The commission are satisfied, therefore, that the prohibition is succeeding in its object of curtailing the growth in the number of company-owned stations and in the oil companies' share of retail sales.  The commission recognise that even if the <Col N="309" /> prohibition were removed the present state of uncertainity in the oil industry would make it unlikely that the oil companies would try to increase the number of company-owned outlets. They feel, however, that this position would not hold good in the event of a return to normal conditions in the oil industry and they consider, therefore, that the prohibition should be extended for a further period.</P>
    <P>The oil companies indicated that they would not welcome any continuation of the prohibition but in the present state of the industry they would not be opposed to an extension for a further two years.  The petrol retailers, however, wanted an extension for as long as possible.  Taking all the circumstances into account the commission recommended that the extension should be for a period of three years.</P>
    <P>The report also states that a number of oil companies asked that the &ldquo;one-mile limit&rdquo; for the replacement of company-owned stations which were closed in the circumstances defined in the original order should be increased or removed altogether.  The purpose of the exceptions was to facilitate a company to retain its business in a particular area which it could lose because of traffic diversion resulting from the construction of a new road near its existing outlet or because of the compulsory acquisition of its existing outlet by a local authority.  If there was no limit the exceptions might be abused but bearing in mind the difficulty of acquiring sites within a mile radius and of obtaining planning permission the commission recommended that the limit be increased from one to three miles.  It might be argued that the &ldquo;one mile limit&rdquo; in the original order was sufficient to meet the requirements of the oil companies.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, for the reasons stated by the commission and in fairness to the oil companies, the Minister feels that an extension of the limit to three miles is reasonable.</P>
    <P>The Minister in making the order gives effect to the commission's recommendations relating both to the extension of the period of prohibition and the &ldquo;one-mile limit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> The commission pointed out in their report that matters which bore indirectly on the operation of the 1972 order were raised during the hearings. These included the effect of increasing costs, petrol outlets in new suburbs or satellite towns, the effect of various types of agreements and the significance of promotional schemes and hours of trading.  The terms of reference of the review precluded the commission from investigating these matters in detail but they consider that they warrant more extensive investigation.  They recommended that they should review these matters before the new extended period of prohibition expires.  The Minister agrees that the matters should be examined and he intends to ask the commission to carry out the necessary review as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the prohibition on the opening of new company-owned outlets could preclude new retail chains from opening up for business in Ireland in competition with the major oil companies who are already dominant in the market.  I accept that the prohibition could prevent a new competitor from entering the market, but I would point out that the Minister has the power to revoke or amend the order and would be prepared to do this at any time that it appeared desirable in the interests of promoting competition.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, provides that orders of this kind shall not have effect unless they are confirmed by Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the Seanad is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the order concerned.  With a Bill of this kind the order which it is proposed to confirm may not be amended by the Oireachtas but must be accepted or rejected as it stands.  The matters with which the order deals have been the subject of detailed special review by the Restrictive Practices Commission and their report, which was presented to this House, sets out the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions embodied in the Order.</P>
    <P>The Bill has already been supported in the Dáil and I can recommend it to the Seanad without reservation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill because we see the need for it.  There are just two matters involved.  First, the Minister wants to extend the order for three years and, secondly, he wants to extend the one-mile limit to three miles. One can see the necessity for and the desirability of doing this.  It makes good business commonsense.  We are all aware of the numerous retail stations, within 100 yards of each other, coming into major cities and towns.  It would be a common-sense business practice to have a greater distance between these stations.</P>
      <P>If I may say something about oil companies on this Bill, my opinion on oil companies is that quite a number of them have been dishonest in their dealings with the retailers over a number of years.  People established in the business felt they were being made a splendid offer by the oil companies in tying themselves up in a solus deal for a number of years.  The money appeared to be attractive at the time and they felt that, if at the end of five years they were not satisfied with the service, they had the option of changing to another oil company.  What happened was they found they lost their freedom once they had signed.  They were subject to all sorts of conditions that were not pointed out in the manner in which they should have been pointed out in the first stage when the agreement was made.  At the end of the five years they found, when they wanted to change to another company, the other companies were very reluctant to deal with them, not because of any feeling for the other oil company but because of a business arrangement: &ldquo;You stay out of our patch, and we will stay out of yours.&rdquo; The individual retailer was denied his liberty and was restricted in his business in many ways.  Because of that, I have no hesitation in describing major oil companies of that kind as completely dishonest in their dealings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be taking liberties in speaking about oil companies in connection with this Bill, but one could go on for a long time about the way Governments and the Revenue people particularly were fooled by the activities of the oil companies. When bringing oil to the refinery here they were able, as a result of <Col N="312" /> charging themselves or a subsidary company excessive prices for crude oil, to show a very small profit from which there was little revenue gain.  The subsidiary or associate company formed for the purpose of transport, which charged excessive prices for carriage, was registered in the Bahamas or some such place where taxation was very low. The revenue gain was limited here. Whereas one cannot always have sympathy with the Revenue, one can have a certain amount of sympathy in cases like this because this was a deliberate, dishonest, premeditated undertaking at the very beginning for the purpose of denying the Revenue Commissioners the revenue to which they were entitled.  Other than that we welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like briefly to support what Senator Hanafin said.  I welcome this Bill.  I think it is one very small indication of the fact that we recognise our status as a nation and have got to circumscribe the operations of some of these major commercial organisations which operate to the detriment of the small man.  We have had many illustrations recently highlighted in the world Press and the media generally of the operations of multi-national corporations.  Some of the corporations we are discussing in this Bill have budgets just as large as the budget of this state.  They exert power. They have influence and it is up to a nation like ours to take action to protect its own rights and, in particular, protect the rights of the smaller traders, in this case the petrol retailers.  Senator Hanafin has given illustrations.  One could add to them.  The operations of these companies are, to say the least of it, extremely shady, particularly when it comes to matters in relation to Revenue and taxation.  In any problems of this type the multinational companies can obtain the best lawyers, the best tax experts, the best advice at getting round the laws they may come up against from country to country.  It is important that we clearly determine what our own interests are.  In this case it was a good decision to have a commission.  Even though this is a very small matter, I certainly support the confirmation of this order.  I hope it is an indication that <Col N="313" /> this Government are and successive Governments will be prepared, when the national interest so demands, to take a firm line in dealing with multi-national corporations and other bodies of this type, to protect our own national interests and the interests of the smaller people involved in commercial enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to say a few brief words.  First of all, I welcome the Bill.  It provides mainly for an extension of the previous Bill which put some control on the expansion of the multinational companies <i>vis-á-vis</i> the independent outlets.  I do not think the encouraging picture painted by the Parliamentary Secretary can be taken completely at its face value.  While it is true the number of petrol stations owned by companies has been either going down or remaining static and the independents are, at least, holding their own.  What counts in the long run is the total amount of petrol sold by the companies acting for the multinationals and by the independent retailers.</P>
      <P>Some of the figures given during the debate in the other House would seem to indicate, certainly in the case of rural petrol stations, that some of the small petrol stations must be nearly at the economic stage.  That might be all right so long as they get some kind of a living out of it but, unfortunately, it is not the owners of the petrol stations who decide what is an economic outlet; it is the people who supply them.  That does not apply only to petrol and oil companies; it applies generally right across the board where commercial distribution is concerned.  Obviously it is more economic to distribute a large quantity of any given article than a small quantity.  I see some danger in that area and this is something the Minister should keep in mind.</P>
      <P>I understand we cannot amend this Bill.  We must accept it <i>in toto</i> or reject it.  I do not think there would be any intention of rejecting the Bill and all we can do at this stage is offer certain views to the Parliamentary Secretary which, I hope, will be taken into consideration in regard to future legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further change in the Bill is the extension giving the right to the companies <Col N="314" /> or any petrol distributor, where his site is required by a local authority for road widening or some other purpose, to relocate within three miles of the old site.  I understand that was recommended by the commission and I presume not without exhaustive examination of all the factors involved. I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary can deal with this point but while relocation seems fair and just on the face of it, if the relocation were to bring a company-owned petrol station right alongside its independent and weaker neighbour then there should be some method of prohibiting such a transfer, even if it meant some degree be compensation.  Of course, there would be compensation involved anyway if a local authority acquired the land on which a petrol station rested by compulsory acquisition.</P>
    <P>In a case like that the company-owned petrol station should not be allowed to relocate within the three-mile radius permitted under this Bill.  He should be reasonably compensated and let retire from business.  It is not unusual that a shopkeeper who happens to be in the way of a proposed building development is taken over under a compulsory purchase price order and receives adequate compensation.  In fact, his compensation is not large enough to allow him to start up in business again. His title to the property may be a tenuous one.  He may only have a monthly tenancy or some short title of very little value.  His only value is his goodwill which is something very difficult to assess in present-day conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the same rule should not apply in the case of company-owned petrol stations if for one reason or another they have to give way to development for the public good.  They should be reasonably compensated and not allowed to relocate in competition with an independent.  The desire to restrict the expansion of the company-owned petrol station, while in itself a good one, may not be achieved by the terms of this Bill or its predecessor.  It might be better to put an overall limitation on the number of company-owned petrol stations rather than try to restrict them in various areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> There is another factor which mitigates against the independent retailer. While everything in the garden may appear to be rosy so long as this limited control is exercised on the multinational companies, extra enticements, like trading stamps, are a popular form of inducement used by company-owned petrol stations.  I am absolutely opposed to trading stamps particularly in this case where very powerful groups can use their assets or their resources, within the terms of this Bill or any legislation, to put the small man out of business.  Why should any car or truck owner who pulls up alongside two petrol stations &mdash; one an independent, perhaps family owned and the owner solely dependent on his or her income from this station, and the other a magnificent company-owned petrol station giving away stamps &mdash; be offered an inducement?  Before the recent petrol crisis you would get 60 or 70 stamps for £1 of petrol.  In fact, there seemed to be no limit.  If the oil crisis had not come I do not know where the ceiling would be in this give-away campaign between the large petrol companies.</P>
    <P>In saying this, I do not want to be taken as one of those joining in the popular exercise of the day of tilting at multinationals or large corporations.  I think they have a very useful and important part to play in the development of our economy.  If we think for a few minutes we will find it very hard to say that we should have no multinationals or no corporations establishing outlets or subsidiaries here.</P>
    <P>Mr. Killeen in an encouraging speech in Cork yesterday paid tribute to the large multinational companies not only in regard to the immense resources they have in terms of finance but also in regard to the immense resources they have in technical knowledge, experience and know-how which no small company could hope to have available.  While we want to restrict the multinational companies and ensure justice and fair play for the small man &mdash; the common desire in this country down through the years &mdash; we should recognise the fact that the big corporations and the multinationals have an important part to play.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> It might be too fanciful to think that, in the same way as a very popular beverage in this country, the distribution of petrol might be left completely to independents or small groups of independents and that the multinationals would confine themselves to the importation and distribution from their outlets at the ports.  Apart from that the Bill is welcome.  It is obviously necessary. The Restrictive Practices Commission and the Petrol Retailers' Association should encourage us to give it a further term of three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with those Senators who welcomed the Bill.  However, I do not share the confidence expressed by Senator Russell in the multinational technology and I have been frequently guilty of tilting at multinationals.  I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary put into this section some control of the multinationals' activities.  They have tremendous resources, as has been pointed out recently by a number of people.  Our experience of the use of these resources and tremendous technological power has been that they have been to the detriment of our country.  Indeed countries with the same kind of social structure have most of the time suffered.</P>
      <P>The original intention in bringing in an order like this was to curb the activities of the multinational companies in reducing the number of outlets and insisting on a certain kind of control of activities which would not be in the social interest.  We should hope that, in future, we will have much stronger control of such activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Russell said about extra enticement and stamps being used by these large companies. They have been used in a very vulgar manner here and they also place smaller dealers at a disadvantage.  When I reflect on the outlets owned by the companies here, from a purely ideological or environmental perspective, we have managed to accommodate the worst and most vulgar exhibitionism of multinational oil companies displaying large hoardings, which they are not allowed to do in other countries, advertising commodities which are fetish items and by no means necessary. <Col N="317" /> For example, the average individual pulling up to a company station would not only be forced to get petrol from this station but would be forced as well to submit the children, who might be in his car, to a barrage of publicity in favour of items which are not necessary and which are corrupting in the sense of real need.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider the distribution of petrol, which is related to the consumption of energy in our society, our criteria should not be simply economic criteria.  It is not necessary at this stage to fall over backwards in favour of the argument that it is more economical to distribute through the large outlets.  If there is a lesson for us in 1975 it is that the criteria should not be merely economic but should be social and environmental criteria.</P>
    <P>I welcome the order, if it contains variation and variability and if it allows a man to run a station and add on to it aspects which he sees himself might sustain a traveller.  The effect of the existing order was not only to control the market in a particular way but to insist on a dreary, monotonous, almost coercive type of advertising as well. This order enables a station to be established where another station was removed because of a compulsory purchase order.  I should like to feel that it would not be possible to build a station of any kind unless environmental criteria had been satisfied.  The ones we have at present are most vulgarly placed.</P>
    <P>The effect of the order in retaining as many of the outlets as possible in private hands and in putting a ceiling on the number owned by the multi-national companies means that we may be able to insist nationally on the kind of criteria I mentioned.  I do not believe that we could effectively persuade multinationals to adhere to our environmental criteria.  Within the next ten years, in the structure of most of our consumer patterns, we will have to seriously consider the force of our legislation nationally, even at the level of the European Community, faced with the advertising and trading practices of the multinational corporations.</P>
    <P>Writers, such as Toffler, when commenting <Col N="318" /> on the new role which might be facing multinationals, introduced the extremely spurious argument that multinationals have now become so big that only they have the technique and technology and power to save us from the many ecological effects which are referred to as happening here.  Such an argument is like asking something that was moving in one direction suddenly to develop an automatic response to move in the opposite direction.  It is in the interests of the multinationals to be efficient in an economic sense.  It is not in our interest to be merely efficient in an economic sense.  It is in fact our experience that trying to be efficient in an economic sense and firing away many wise criteria of an environmental and social kind has been putting us even further at risk.  To try to develop even the slightest orientation towards making things easier for the oil companies would be extremely dangerous.</P>
    <P>This Bill is coming at a time when growth economics has been questioned by every serious economist.  We will have to feed back this new thinking concerning the kind of variation we need in consumer patterns, and we will have to regard orders like this as very useful and as a beginning of what will be much tighter legislation in the future concerning the whole nature of the structure of the consumption of petrol in our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be desirable to maintain the number of independent petrol outlets as a bulwark against company-owned outlets, which was the purpose of the order in 1972.  It ignored the facts of life, particularly in the words of the Parliamentary Secretary, that notwithstanding the existence of that order the number of independent outlets continued to decrease even if the number of company-owned outlets has not increased.  We are up against the hard lesson of economic dictates in petrol-selling individual outlets.  It is surprising to find that the average number of gallons of petrol which go through an average independent outlet in a year gives what I would regard as a less than adequate return to any person willing to set up in business as an independent petrol outlet.  The existence of the company-owned outlets has <Col N="319" /> over the years made it all the more difficult for the independent person to continue in business.</P>
      <P>If it is to be all the more difficult for small independent retailers in business &mdash; and it will be because the overheads will be just as high and difficult to overcome as in any small business, and if population trends continue with new urban developments and large numbers of houses going up on the outskirts of our towns &mdash; we will find a situation where somebody will have to go in and carry on the business of petrol retailing. We are inclined to make monsters out of the multinational oil companies.  I think the opposite of them.  They have contributed a certain amount of good, they have given substantial employment and a good service right from the beginning.  Somebody has to go into the business in the future in the face of hard economic facts.  If as of now it is quite difficult for a small individual business to carry on a viable existence through selling petrol, it will be more difficult in the future.</P>
      <P>There will be a public need, in the sense that urban areas will have a definite necessity for petrol retail outlets. I cannot foresee anybody other than the oil companies coming in and filling that vacuum in the future.  That is not to say that there have not been abuses in the past.  Of course there have been abuses as there are in every aspect of business.  We have all heard of cases where even the managers of tied petrol outlets &mdash; the outlets that were tied to the major oil companies &mdash; went through possibly a mini-crucifixion in the early years of his existence as manager, that pressures were put on to achieve certain targets.  It made life very difficult for him indeed.  We know that these pressures by the oil companies made it necessary for individual outlets to try to attract business in the face of the major oil companies.  These are all aspects of every-day life in every category of business nowadays and we must live with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly nobody in 1972 could have envisaged the situation which occurred in the autumn of 1973.  All of us had taken for granted that there would be a continuous supply of petrol for our <Col N="320" /> motor cars, but then we found ourselves in the horrible situation in October-November, 1973, where this supply became non-existent.  That brought lessons to us all and probably brought out the best and worst in every one of us.  We all made friends and enemies with various petrol outlet owners and retailers and probably fell out with many of them through just not getting service.</P>
    <P>Of course, there was one abuse there where the oil companies got to the stage where the petrol supply became so scarce that they had to ration it to whom they could supply it to.  Naturally, they gave preference and priority to their own tied outlets.  That, in some people's eyes, could be an abuse of their position, but in looking at it, one must take regard of the fact that perhaps we are fortunate in that the oil companies had already set up these outlets, that they could give a guaranteed supply in those difficult times.</P>
    <P>There certainly will be a need in future, if off-shore oil becomes available, and some companies have said so, within our shores to distribute and retail oil, and we may well have to ease the restrictions imposed by this order. That is something that we should all like to think would happen.  The two main points I should like to make are that I do not regard the outcome from this as being as monstrous as some people depict it.  I do not look upon the business of selling petrol as something in which environmental and social aspects and so on should have priority, as Senator Higgins seemed to indicate in his speech.  People are in that business to make money, the same as an individual trader is in it to make money.  They have got to make sure they cover their overheads and get a satisfactory profit before they start thinking in terms of environmental or social aspects.</P>
    <P>There is a public need for outlets in future years and I can see nobody but the oil companies, perhaps, being in a position to supply that need.  That is why I foresee the provision that this order certainly will have to be eased much sooner than we anticipate, even as of now, because if the number of independent outlets decrease as they have been doing in 1974 when this order <Col N="321" /> was in existence, we cannot see this trend reversed.</P>
    <P>While I welcome this as a bid in the early stages of 1972-73 to offset abuses which were then occurring, in the light of the circumstances and the economic facts which confront every outlet since the oil scarcity of late 1973, we may well have to have another look at this order much earlier than anticipated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWalsh" hpid="Miss Walsh Miss Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  My only complaint is that it is long overdue. I welcome it for a number of reasons, particularly because it favours the small petrol filling station which, like all small businesses, due to multinational companies and the age of the supermarkets and super everything, including the super rat, have become submerged in this super-duper world of today.</P>
      <P>I agree with much of the remarks of Senator Hanafin in his opening speech with regard to the malpractices and the activities of some of the multinational oil companies.  I am one who does not favour this super-duper type business. Due cognisance must be taken of the fact that the small farmer, the small businessman, the small oil retailer or whatever he is.  Society owes him a lot. He has a place in society and he also has a place in the business world because when the super-duper oil companies with their petrol filling stations are closed at weekends and on bank holiday weekends the tourists are very often pleased to go to one of these small petrol filling stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the reason for it was, but for a number of years petrol filling stations grew up like daisies all over the country.  I have my own reservations on how this came about.  I do not wish to express them now but I know that there was a certain amount of malpractice in the initiation of many of these stations.  The Planning Act was introduced and with it came the need for planning permission, and with it came planning refusals, string-pulling and so on.  In spite of all this, petrol filling stations sprang up, as I say, like daisies all over the country and to the detriment of each other because while competition is the life of trade, such a thing is overflogging an already tired horse.  Too much of anything is good <Col N="322" /> for nothing.  There is quite a proliferation of filling stations in Ireland and we could well do with fewer of them or at least leave the <i>status quo</i> for the moment.  For that reason, I favour the introduction of this Bill.</P>

      <P>There were one or two points which were raised by other Senators.  Senator Markey referred to the decline in independent stations.  For that reason we wish to keep our options open to the companies.  The real reason for the decline is that, as Senator Walsh said, these stations grew up like daisies or mushrooms.  There were too many of them and a good many of them were uneconomic and just died because they were not viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell put his finger on the nub of the whole thing when he spoke about Green Shield stamps, because Green Shield stamps in my view are the greatest fraud that this country has seen since Shanahan stamps, and we should have learned enough from that at the time.  The problem with Green Shield stamps in regard to petrol, as against groceries in supermarkets or any other form of business where they are given, is that supermarkets and so on can adjust their prices to compensate the cost of the loss on the Green Shield stamps, but on petrol there is a profit that cannot be altered and when a retailer gives Green Shield stamps he is giving away his profit.  Fair enough. If a person is foolish enough to give profits away it is his own business. However, as a result of the collaboration between the petrol companies and Green Shield stamps, there is the danger that we will have a restrictive practice. I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of this.  When a dealer gets Green Shield stamps he gets a franchise and nobody else in that area will get them.  The petrol companies have taken up most of the franchise and the petrol dealer is losing the <Col N="323" /> business because, even if he wanted to, he still could not give Green Shield stamps.  This is legalised blackmail.  The Green Shield company know they have the advantage so long as everybody does not have the stamps.  That is all I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to do, that is, to make them available to everybody and as a result they will lose their value.  If they can be obtained in every station, business will not be attracted to any particular station and the petrol companies will drop them.  One of the petrol companies are now giving them for central heating oil and as a result they are getting the major part of the business.</P>
    <P>When these submissions were made to the former Minister for Industry and Commerce he agreed with them and decided to make an order preventing this practice.  However, a month after this, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce opened a big gift store for the Green Shield company, so we can judge the sincerity of that decision.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary that if Green Shield stamps are to continue he should lift the restriction and make the stamps available to everybody.  Then all will be equal.  As a petrol retailer, I welcome the extension of this Bill and I hope it will be reviewed in three years' time.</P>

      <P>I thank the Seanad for the very generous welcome given to this piece of legislation and for the thoughtful contributions of Senators.  I shall deal <i>seriatim</i> with the points made by Senators and if any Senator feels I have not dealt adequately with his or her remarks I will return to those points.</P>
      <P>Senators Hanafin and West were concerned about the revenue avoidance in which they thought petrol companies were or had been involved.  This is a matter for the Minister for Finance rather than for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself.  I will draw the Minister's attention to what the Senators said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell referred to the relative prosperity of company-owned <Col N="324" /> stations and dealer-owned stations.  I should like to put the matter straight in this regard.  The position is, that in 1973 86 million gallons were distributed through company-owned stations.  By 1974, as a result of the operation of this restriction, the number of gallons dis-distributed through company-owned stations had fallen to 82 million gallons. On the other hand, in 1973, 140 million gallons were distributed through dealer-owned stations.  In 1974 that amount had risen to 147 million.  Therefore, the trend has been in the opposite direction in respect of the dealer-owned stations as against that of the company-owned stations.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell also referred to the relative competitiveness of dealer-owned stations.  I am glad to reply that there has been an improvement, perhaps by virtue of that order as well.  In 1973, the average throughput of dealer-owned stations was 36 million gallons.  This amount has risen to 38 million gallons in 1974, whereas, the average throughput of company-owned stations was 168 million gallons in 1973.  While that figure is much larger than the average throughput of dealer-owned stations, it fell in 1974 to 162 million gallons.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell mentioned the possibility that, with the extension of the permission to replace a station which is permanently closed because of road-widening or compulsory purchase to three miles of the location of the closed station by a company, it might result in some cases in such a company-owned station being located beside an existing dealer-owned station.  So far, there have not been any complaints in this matter but, of course, the position to date has been that the station could only be replaced within a mile of the former location.  On foot of what Senator Russell has said, I will ask the Examiner of Restrictive Practices to keep an eye on possible difficulties arising in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell called for an overall ban on new company-owned retail outlets.  That is exactly what this order sets out to do.  Senator Russell and other Senators referred to trading stamps.  I should like to say, in this context, that the consumer protection legislation which is being prepared in the Department <Col N="325" /> will deal, <i>inter alia</i>, with trading stamps.  The object of that legislation will be to control the use of such trading stamps rather than ban them altogether. The Minister has dealt in detail with the reasons for this approach rather than the total banning of them.  We must all recognise that people are employed in the firms engaged in the trading stamp business and also, in many cases, the consumer has an option of going to a place where trading stamps are given. To restrict the choice of the consumer in that matter by outlawing trading stamps might have a detrimental effect.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly made a very valuable point in relation to what he described as a restrictive practice in the allocation of the franchise in particular areas to one individual station.  I would draw the Senator's attention, and that of the Seanad, to the fact that in the Restrictive Practices Commission's Report they said that the question of certain promotional schemes was among a number of matters drawn to their attention in the course of the inquiry but did not come within the strict terms of reference of the inquiry.  The commission suggested that they might, within the three years following on the extension of the order by the Seanad, carry out a further inquiry into the operation of such promotional schemes. I had already decided to ask them to carry out this further inquiry as soon as possible and not just within the three years' period.  In particular, I will draw their attention to the points made by Senator Daly in carrying out that aspect of this further inquiry which relates to promotional schemes.</P>
    <P>Senator M.D. Higgins referred to environmental criteria in the location of petrol stations.  I think &ldquo;vulgarity&rdquo; was the word he used in respect of some of the locations and the hoardings associated with such stations.  As I am sure he is aware, this comes within the planning legislation rather than within the ambit of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Under the planning law it is open to people to make objections on amenity grounds to their planning authority and, if necessary, to the Minister for Local Government in relation to such matters.  The Senator referred in general to advertising practices. <Col N="326" /> This is a matter which, again, will be the subject of consumer protection legislation which we are working on. Some of the points he made are valuable in that context.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey expressed concern in an opposite direction to many Senators when he suggested a situation might arise in which there might not be anybody to distribute petrol if it were not for the continued operation of multi-national stations.  The figures I have already quoted which show a relative improvement in the position of independent retailers, indicate that they are given a fair chance, able to meet the challenge, and are able to increase both the total volume of their throughput and the average throughput per station. Therefore I am not as concerned as he would be on this point.</P>
    <P>There is not much danger in Ireland of lack of retail outlets from the public point of view.  We have more retail outlets for petrol per car than most countries in Europe.  The spectre of insufficient petrol outlets is one which is well over the horizon.  These are the main points made by Senators.</P>
    <P>There was one other point made which referred to independent retailers possibly being deprived of supply by the company on the ground that their outlet was uneconomic from the company's point of view.  The Examiner of Restrictive Practices has secured agreement from all the oil companies that they will not, without informing him well in advance, attempt to discontinue supply to any independent retailer.  This provision will allow him to fully investigate and, if necessary, ensure a decision on a proposal for the discontinuance of supply.</P>
    <P>Senators roamed far and wide in this debate.  I have not followed every point raised but I would like to conclude with my own general observation.  In the very short time I have been dealing with this field I have been very impressed with the useful nature of the machinery we have for the control of restrictive practices.  Schedule 3 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, indicates in great detail the type of restrictive practices which can come within the ambit of the control procedures set up in tha <Col N="327" /> Act, namely, the Examiner of Restrictive Practices and the Restrictive Practices Commission.  The whole philosophy therein is one of preserving competition.  Senators will agree that the best way of ensuring that undue increases in prices do not take place is to have healthy competition between as many providers of those services as possible.  That, rather than blanket systems of control, is the best long-run means of controlling inflation.  I feel that our machinery, in the form of the Restrictive Practices Commission and the Examiner of Restrictive Practices, is very useful and I hope it can be used, as it has been in the past, to an even greater extent in the future in identifying and subsequently rooting out any restrictive practices which interfere with competition and thereby contribute to excessive prices being charged at retail level to the consumer.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I thank Senators for their welcome for this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase from £350,000 to £850,000 the amount of grant moneys which the Industrial Development Authority may make available, without the prior approval of the Government, for:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  An industrial undertaking towards the cost of fixed assets purchased or leased for the re-equipment, modernisation, improvement or expansion of the undertaking;</P>
      <P>(ii)  An industrial undertaking towards the cost of fixed assets purchased or leased for new industrial projects.</P>
      <P>The present grant limits of £350,000 which the Industrial Development Authority may make available for both purposes, without reference to the Government, were fixed by the Industrial Development Act, 1969.  Since then, all costs associated with the setting up and expansion of industrial undertakings &mdash; plants, machinery, building costs, sites, and so on&mdash;have increased considerably.  A further factor which has resulted in an increase in the number of cases affected by the statutory limits is the fact that the limits relate to the aggregate sums paid to an industrial undertaking and a number of undertakings would, of course, have submitted several proposals to the authority over a period of time.</P>
      <P>The result has been that the number of cases which have had to be referred to the Government in recent years because of the size of the grant proposed has grown considerably.  The number of such cases in 1971 was seven; in 1974 it was 33, and this year the number of such cases is likely to be higher.  The processing of so many cases at official level for submission to the Government prolongs the period of negotiation with the promoters concerned and delays the creation of potential new jobs.  It also creates the danger of losing some worthwhile projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> It is accordingly proposed to increase to £850,000 the amount of grant moneys for both purposes which the Industrial Development Authority may make in respect of a particular industrial undertaking without reference to the Government. This will facilitate the negotiation of industrial projects under the industrial grants programme and will also reduce the demand on the Government's time resulting from the submission to it of many projects which are no greater in size or importance than projects which earlier would have involved grants of less than £350,000 and would not have been subject to the requirement regarding Government approval.</P>
    <P>Work has at present reached an advanced stage on more comprehensive legislation in connection with industrial development activities and I propose to introduce a Bill in the Dáil dealing with these more detailed provisions either during the present session or at an early stage in the next session.  This further Bill will afford the members of this House an opportunity for a full-scale debate on the industrial development programme.  In the circumstances I would ask the House to facilitate the passage of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend this Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which I regard as a continuing measure increasing the capital available to the IDA, to enable them to continue with their work, which they were established to do.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to pay tribute to the IDA for their efforts to provide industries in areas that had never been regarded as industrial centres.  This legislation is all the more important because it puts at the disposal of the local IDA officers more capital to encourage and induce new industries to areas in need.  We all fully realise the difficulties confronting industries at the present time, many of which are caused by indiscriminate dumping on the home market.  We also fully realise that many of those small industries are going through a lean period because of the scarcity of capital available and because of the overall recession which is affecting industry throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A discussion on this Bill at this <Col N="330" /> particular time is appropriate and opportune because one cannot stress too often the importance of the role of the IDA.  I would like to pay a tribute to those who set up the IDA.  Its continuance in existence and its efforts to promote industry fully justified its establishment and this legislation will enable the IDA to continue the work for which they were established.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the role of small industries which is important to our economy.  They are mostly family-owned and are small companies about which one hears little.  Their role in the creation and maintenance of jobs cannot be adequately stressed or emphasised. The IDA officers would be well advised at present to give adequate assistance and attention to existing industries.  It is very important to preserve jobs at the moment.  While we all recognise the need for job creation, we also recognise that there is an equally or even greater need for job preservation. That is borne out adequately at the present time when we hear of closure after closure and more threatened closures.  I believe greater liaison is needed between the IDA officers, the county development teams, the Midland regional development organisations and other bodies associated with industry. There is need for greater consultation and co-ordination of activities and services because they are all, in some way or other, directly or indirectly, concerned with the promotion of industry.</P>
    <P>It is important to give greater assistance to long established Irish-owned industries.  We are often inclined to bend over backwards in our efforts to help foreign industrialists here.  Many of them established industries here with the help of grants and availed of the services of the Industrial Development Authority.  These firms folded up and disappeared overnight in many instances.  I know the IDA machinery is available to protect the industry and themselves against loss of investment through grants.  At the same time, more attention should and must be given, to the maintenance of the small family industries which have been with us for years, industries that have passed from father to son and so on.  We hear little <Col N="331" /> about those industries.  They seldom hit the headlines.  Their opening announcements are never announced with a fanfare of trumpets, yet they are playing an important role in the economy of this country and the preservation of jobs.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary is replying I would like him to give an assurance that the small industries operating in our smaller towns and villages will be high on the priority list for assistance, which will be made available from the increased capital allocation under this Bill.  Of course, one always welcomes major industries. Only this morning I heard an announcement on radio and television of major industry for my county, County Westmeath. That industry, which is coming to Mullingar, will receive grant aids to the tune of £2½ million.  The anticipated job potential will be in the region of 600. That is very welcome.  In Mullingar we have many small industries which give employment to more than 600 people. We have not heard a word about them. That is why I want to stress the importance of the small industry and his role in the economic life of this country.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, industries of any kind will always be welcome in an area such as the midlands, which in the past did not receive due recognition.  It is very encouraging to see that County Westmeath in particular is coming into its own and is being recognised as an area ideally situated for future industry.  The employment content is and has been available there.  The training facilities are there, through the College of Technology in Athlone and other vocational schools throughout the county. We also have available the services of AnCO, which is playing an important role in the retraining of redundant people, the training of young people and equipping them to participate in industrial employment in the future.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more one can say on the Bill, except that it is an enabling measure to increase the capital available to the IDA.  I want again to express that greater recognition must be given to the Irish-based industry.  Greater recognition must also be given to industry being established which will utilise the raw <Col N="332" /> materials available in this country.  We fully realise that when an industry is established raw materials may have to be purchased in foreign countries which will add to the cost of producing the finished article.  Therefore, what we need do &mdash; and this is fully recognised by the IDA and everybody concerned &mdash; is to promote the maximum number of industries which can utilise the raw materials available here namely, the meat processing trade, fertiliser industry, woodworking industries and so on.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and can assure the Parliamentary Secretary and his Government, that we, on this side of the House, will do everything possible to facilitate its speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Senator Keegan in giving a warm welcome to this Bill, and particularly to compliment him on his generous tribute to the men who were responsible for the establishment of the Industrial Development Authority in 1956, mainly the late Deputies Sweetman and Norton. At that time the Bill was received with what might be described as not very great enthusiasm in certain quarters. Its success over the years has been a lasting tribute to the two men who conceived it and brought it into operation.</P>
      <P>It is only right, having regard to the enormous increase in costs over the past six years, that the Industrial Development Authority would be given the necessary powers to negotiate grants up to a substantially higher figure than that established in 1969.  While the increase from £350,000 to £850,000 may seem enormous to some, in present-day terms and having regard to the cost of buildings, machinery and equipment of all kinds, it is not excessive.  Having regard to announcements recently made &mdash; Senator Keegan referred to one &mdash; a figure of £850,000 is quite a small percentage of a large industrial undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further point was made by the Parliamentary Secretary &mdash; that £850,000 could be an aggregate of several grants paid out to a large concern.  Probably one of the most encouraging features would be that it would be an aggregate grant, in other words, that a firm would <Col N="333" /> start with a substantially smaller grant, get a second and possibly a third grant to cover extensions of its factory, premises, or additional plant and machinery or the training of additional employees.  Those would be very encouraging factors which the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and all of us would like to see.</P>
    <P>I am a great believer in giving all possible latitude to State and semi-State bodies.  They should be encouraged as much as possible to work on normal commercial terms, in other words, give them the necessary capital, pick the right men and let them get on with the job.  There is a lot to be said for that. They may make mistakes, but businessmen make mistakes, so do farmers, trade unionists, and professional men. If their judgement is sound, in the ultimate they will have more successes than failures.  The IDA, looking back over the years&mdash;while it can and must naturally count some failures amongst its list of industries established here &mdash; has proved in the majority of cases an outstanding success.</P>
    <P>I am sure that every Senator was greatly encouraged when he heard on the radio today, as I did, what Mr. M. Killeen, chairman of the IDA, had to say about the encouraging future for 1976.  Obviously all these new industries will take a lot of capital.  A substantial amount of that capital will continue to be supplied by this small country.  That is the price we have to pay for industrial development.  We are still a comparatively underdeveloped country and will continue to be for many years to come. For that reason, we must offer first of all to our own nationals every inducement to show initiative in enterprise and to establish industrial business to give employment.  We must go further than that.  We must show that we are an attractive country for the location of foreign industries.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish to think that within the forseeable future &mdash; looking decades ahead &mdash; that we could possibly generate the sort of capital necessary to provide employment for our growing population and for the number of young people leaving our schools every year.  The Parliamentary Secretary said <Col N="334" /> quite rightly that the mere fact of giving a grant, or being in the position to give a substantial grant and make a decision quickly might be the deciding factor in winning an important industry for this country rather than letting it go elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We should remember that grants are only one item in the very attractive package of inducements we offer, which include income tax concessions &mdash; which are possibly the most attractive concession we give &mdash; loans, retraining grants, the establishment of infrastructure, such as roads and waterways, sewerage water supply and so on, transport facilities, the quality and intelligence of our labour, educational facilities, AnCO as already mentioned by Senator Keegan, and &mdash; an important factor which may not be realised &mdash; the attitude of our people to industrialists coming from outside.  They like to come here; they like our people; they feel at home; they feel we can offer them something that cannot be offered in the giant cities of America or Europe.  Our very way of life is an attraction that appeals to outsiders.  I know that from personal experience.  This is something we should be proud of and do everything possible to retain.</P>
    <P>It may seem at times odd, and businessmen might at times have felt resentful of the fact, that large and wealthy corporations and companies who could easily afford to get on without a grant get a grant.  But to look at it purely from that point of view would be to look at it from a narrow point of view.  Other countries give very attractive inducements too.  Unless we are in a position to give equally or even better facilities we will not get the type of industries we want.  When at times we feel resentful and are a bit short of capital for the development of our own businesses, and know that certain wealthy companies could easily afford to do without the grants it might be as well to remember that if it were not for this little extra cream in the coffee we might not get this industry at all. It may be &mdash; and I was interested to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say&mdash;that new and comprehensive legislation dealing with the whole question of grants <Col N="335" /> and inducements to industrialists would be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary to have another look at our grant policy.  I do not suggest that grants should be done away with.  They should be retained as long as they are necessary to induce industries to come to here but the policy and the type of grant may have to be looked at.  What I have in mind, having regard to the still great imbalance of industrial development between Dublin and the east coast and the rest of the country, possibly outside Cork, is that it may be necessary to lean more heavily in favour of the south-west and western areas.  I know the designated areas have an edge on the other areas.  I suggest that in future legislation the policy of giving greater encouragement to industries prepared to locate in specific areas in the south-west and west should be considered.</P>
    <P>I naturally have my own area in mind. I come from County Limerick, the capital of the mid-western region.  If we are serious in our ideas of developing areas outside of Dublin, and Cork, to a lesser extent, we have got to be prepared to back our ideas with capital and incentives.  One way of offsetting the continuous trek to Dublin, which is becoming bigger and bigger, is to develop centres, such as Limerick, to take big industries and provide the sort of amenities that modern industrialists and their staff now require.  That is the only possible way of hoping to offset the trend which, in my view, will continue unless something imaginative, backed by the necessary cash, is done by the Government.</P>
    <P>A few years ago a policy was produced which suggested that we should have industrial centres dotted all over the country.  It was a popular political policy at the time.  I think, economically and factually, it was the wrong policy. It is far better to concentrate on a limited number of viable centres such as Limerick, Galway, Sligo, Athlone and so on, rather than trying to proliferate industries all over the country, which will not get there anyway.  It would be far better to build up centres such as Limerick, Ennis, Galway and other viable places in the west of Ireland in order that they can carry industries <Col N="336" /> of the size we need, give extra employment and give our students coming out of our regional technical schools the type of employment they require and for which they have been trained.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company who are in fact the IDA in the Mid-Western Region.  They, too, have done an excellent job over the years.  Sometimes we are not fully appreciative of the value of the IDA and its offshoot SFADCo in our economic set up.  Men in both these authorities have acquired an enormous amount of valuable experience and expertise down through the years that we could not hope to acquire with our present limited resources. They have been working there, in some cases, up to 20 years and there is not a corner of the globe that they do not know.  They have given weeks, months and years of their time and their talents trying to induce industrial development into this country.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are now going through a difficult and anxious time should not preclude us from paying a generous tribute to the men involved in both the IDA and SFADCo.  I would like to join with Senator Keegan in making a special plea on behalf of the smaller business and factory.  Notwithstanding the industrial development that has taken place over the past 20 or 25 years, 75 per cent of our industrial enterprise employ less than 50 people. They are spread all over the country. The far greater proportion are owned by Irishmen, some of them owned by the same family for several generations. They are the type of people, whether times are good or bad, who will stay on. They will not close down if the going gets rough.  They have a deep interest not only in their business but in the country.</P>
    <P>They are the kind of people that I would like to see given the maximum amount of encouragement.  We all have experience of businesses and small factory owners who are having a very rough time.  They cannot command the capital or other resources of the big corporations.  They stay on because they were born and bred in the country and their people before them resided there <Col N="337" /> also.  They deserve something extra special in the way of encouragement from the Government.  For that reason I join with Senator Keegan in what he said.  I hope that in any new legislation there will be particular reference to two things, the absolute and urgent necessity to be regionalise industrial development and, secondly, to ensure that the small Irish-owned and family-owned business is given the maximum amount of encouragement to stay in business in difficult times and to expand in good times.  Having said that I would like to give a warm welcome to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Keegan and Senator Russell I, too, welcome the Bill even though the amount of money made available to the Industrial Development Authority is small.  It is true to say that the Industrial Development Authority did a lot with £350,000 since 1969.  I have no hesitation in saying that the IDA need more money but I have one reservation in giving them more money.  We should ensure that the money is distributed within the authority on a proper regional basis.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot of talk about what can be done industrially in designated areas.  Designated areas have been thrown overboard by the Government now in office, as we saw very recently in the distribution of EEC funds by the Department of Agriculture, among others.  To come in here with a pious platitude and say that, industrially, we are in a special situation in the West of Ireland by being classified naïvely by the Department for Industry and Commerce as being a designated area is nothing short of sheer bunk.  There is nothing extra given to us on account of that situation. Nothing has ever been given to us since this Government came into office on account of that.  It is quite safe to say that in defining the West of Ireland as a designated area we were not lucky enough to get a Minister.</P>

    <P>When money is given to a semi-State organisation like the IDA it should be written into it that that money be divided equally and in a compatible measure to each area.  It is true to say&mdash; I defy contradiction &mdash; that in the last two years no industry in our area of any <Col N="338" /> significance has been opened by the present Government.  I know times are not as easy as they were.  No extra jobs have been created in the western section of the IDA.  The number on the dole has increased.  The amount of nonworking people in our area has increased no matter what the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government may say.  The £850,000 we are willingly giving to the IDA is only a very tiny proportion in relation to what is paid out each week in the labour exchanges of the western seaboard of this country.</P>

      <P>I know Senator Russell is one of those who has just joined the band of quicksand optimists and he goes into an area off the west coast where one can be gobbled up very quickly.  One wishes the best for him in his new enterprise, and I certainly do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the Bill, I would like to see that all moneys distributed by the Government to agencies such as the IDA, are distributed in such a manner that each area gets a fair slice of the <Col N="339" /> cake.  I come from an area which has not received a fair slice of the national cake.  I am sure every western Senator feels the same way as I do because the cranes have vanished from Galway city and other cities as well.  They were in abundance until very recently and we wish to see them back.  We would also like to see further development of the nature which took place as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome Mr. Killeen's statement this morning and I hope that every word he said last night was true.  I wish it would come sooner than that.  He is a responsible man and has commanded respect throughout the country.  We have listened to statements from Ministers for two years but maybe, coming from him, there is more fact in it.  I listened to some Senators, who spoke today, at the Monaghan by-election and all was rosy.  That was some time ago. They were only gathering votes then.</P>
    <P>The IDA have always paid respect to the multinationals.  In the statement by the IDA chief he paid respect to the multinationals who have made a good job of their projects in this country. Money such as this to any industry basically means we are employing our trained youth.  Unless we have a growth level and can provide employment for them, we are training them in the technical field for emigration. Any move made by the Parliamentary Secretary or his Department in this direction is welcome to us and will get a speedy passage through the House.  I would be part and parcel to this to bring it through.  The Parliamentary Secretary said in his statement that since the present grant limits of £350,000 which the Industrial Development Authority may make available for both purposes mentioned in the Bill were fixed&mdash;</P>
    <P>all costs associated with the setting up and expansion of industrial undertakings &mdash; plant, machinery, building costs, sites and so on &mdash; have increased considerably.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about that.  There is an obvious need for this increase.  At the same time, the Parliamentary Secretary had in mind that the IDA is an autonomous <Col N="340" /> body and he must be careful about the expenditure of public money to such an authority that may, through the Acts of this House, not report back in relation to the smallest detail on the amount of money that would be made available by the Houses of Parliament.</P>
    <P>The case has been made by both Senators Keegan and Russell about the smaller industries.  The Parliamentary Secretary said he was bringing a new Bill before the Dáil &mdash; I assume it is in more detail than the present one&mdash;and I hope he will take into account small Irish industries employing in the region of 25 men.  At the moment the county development teams look after such industries.  I do not think they have the finances available to them to do the job which is required of them.  A lot of it is thrown in the laps of the local authorities to help out in different ways.  Such viable little industries are as important to the nation as some of the larger ones. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will include in his new Bill a way to help those smaller industries to a greater extent than what is feasible or possible through the county development teams. I agree with Senators Russell and Keegan that the Bill is welcome and it can be assured of a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with those Senators who have welcomed this Bill.  I hope Senator Killilea will not think too ill of me if I refrain from accepting his invitation to comment at length on the expenditure of the IDA over the years in the western counties.  Such participation in the debate in the other House brought the reply from the Minister that it probably would be more appropriate to a discussion on the Estimates. Similarly, any discussion of structural changes within the Industrial Development Authority would probably be more appropriate to the major legislation which the Minister has indicated, and the Parliamentary Secretary has reaffirmed, will be introduced in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Senator Killilea's concern, and that of other Senators, for the apparent lack of fit between the willingness to vote money for the activities of <Col N="341" /> the Industrial Development Authority and the effect of such action.  I am in no way taking from the achievement of the people who have worked in the Industrial Development Authority. However I suggest that if we look at the history of the Industrial Development Authority and its achievements we can see that State initiatives by way of grants and other inducements have failed to affect radically the location decisions of industry here.</P>
    <P>It is a reasonable aspiration of Senators, such as Senator Killilea, that more money be spent by way of industrial incentive in the western region and that the expenditure be regionalised.  It is true when you look at the record of the Industrial Development Authority and the experience of the two-tier system of giving grants that we have failed to push industries into areas where they were most needed. Any serious politician interested in the industrial development of this country, interested in the political context of that development, knows very well the reasons for this.  The reasons for it are that foreign industry has tended to locate where profits will be at a maximum, where disabilities on economic efficiency will be at a minimum.  The result has been an expansion of industrial activity in an already overloaded eastern region, and slight increase in industrialisation in the western region.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter then is that there is no reasonable fit between the industrialisation strategy and the actual decisions being made by foreign enterprises and other enterprises.  It is as if the Industrial Development Authority and indeed the kind of vote we are making now accepts a certain social obligation.  Of course the experience is not fitting that social obligation.  When the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating, was replying to the debate on this Bill in the Dáil he spoke about a number of important matters.  In Volume 283, No. 3, column 499, he refers to what he should like to do.  He said:</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record of the House that the people with the first claim to help are those who live where the need is greatest.  That is all <Col N="342" /> there is to it.  The definition of greatness of need is made on an economic and sociological basis.  The only way to order the priorities is to say what has been the evolution of population, industry and income and what has happened about emigration.  I will not permit any other guidelines than those objective ones of an economic and sociological kind.</P>
    <P>He went on later, in column 501, to pay tribute to the Economic and Social Research Institute.  He paid tribute to their work in charting the degree of the impact of these indicators.  He mentioned in column 507 the necessity of being able to give such indicators a precise content.  Let me say that here we run into the direct challenge there is between the private enterprise location decision and the social expression of equalling out industrial development.</P>
    <P>To give meaning to what I have to say I now want to take the proof of areas of greatest need.  I am quoting from the Report of the National Economic and Social Council, No. 4, from the Report, Regional Policy in Ireland, a Review.  If we take the statistics offered to us by that body and if we take the Minister's injunction, which is an admirable one, that he would not locate industry on a mere political pressure basis and would move it towards the areas of greatest need, if we look at that report what do we find?  We find, for example, that if we take the crude estimate for emigration, which is given to us on page 86 of the report, that the out migration from the western region between the years 1966 and 1971 was of the order of something like 9.8 per cent.  The north-west region suffered a loss of 9.7 per cent and the eastern region, already suffering from huge urban dis-economies, had an increase of .1 per cent in its inflow of population. Therefore, judged by the criterion of out migration adverted to in the Minister's speech to which I have already referred, both the regions north-west and west would appear to qualify.</P>
    <P>Again, too, if one takes the dependency criteria referred to in the Minister's speech in column 499 of the Official Report, one will see that the west with a dependency rate of 43.6 per cent and <Col N="343" /> the north-west with a dependency rate of 43.3 per cent qualify there.  Similarly in the case of unemployment, but I do not wish to bore people.  If, therefore, we take the case as being made by the Minister's criteria for industrialisation, what then, you might ask, was the experience of expenditure over the years &mdash;with respect to Senator Killilea, this is not a new Government phenomenon &mdash; 1961 to 1971 of the Industrial Development Authority, given that the indicators I have said are proved? They are printed by the National Economic and Social Council.  I always give my sources lest people think I invent them.  In the case of the total sum spent by the Industrial Development Authority in the decade April, 1961, to March, 1971, 4.8 per cent was expended in the north-west region.  Remember this is a region with over 40 per cent dependency. The western region had 9.5 per cent of total expenditure.  Whereas, if one takes the south-west region, for reasons which I will not develop, which includes Cork, it had 20.4 per cent of total IDA expenditure.  In the eastern region there was 19.4 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Killilea's interest would be better spent in his native Tuam.  If I might continue, I was making the point that in this Bill, which is an enabling Bill to increase the ceiling concerning that sum which the IDA have to refer to Government and which they have not, I share the concern of those Senators who have suggested that the IDA's expenditure <Col N="345" /> to date &mdash; I have been looking at its history &mdash; had not moved into areas which would be regarded as of great social necessity.  I had been making the point across the different criteria of emigration, dependency and unemployment that we had not been so successful in securing the industrial base we might mention.</P>
      <P>Here I raise a question concerning this also.  I have said that the primary reason is that you simply cannot expect from private enterprise that it will accept social criteria as a means of operation.</P>
      <P>In other words, unless the role of the IDA is changed and it is decided to move in the direction of a national enterprise board, it will not be possible to reduce the indicators I mentioned.  Neither, I would suggest, will it be possible to regionalise expenditure.  However, as I mentioned at the outset, the restructuring of the IDA, giving it a new role, and the whole question of participation probably belongs in a discussion on major amending legislation which will be before the Seanad shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerning the sum itself&mdash;a lengthy discussion would not be appropriate as it was promised the Bill would be given a speedy passage &mdash; it is not a very great increase.  In so far as it represents an increase, I should like to make some points concerning IDA expenditure which is not of a regional nature.  The difficulty in changing the decisions of industrialists as regards location is probably affected by the provision or existence of infrastructure in the different regions.  It is interesting to note that the huge flow of money into the eastern region is adding to an urban dis-economy. We will probably begin to accept the notion of regional strategy, not because we are convinced we should allow all the people to participate equally in different kinds of activities but rather because of the necessity of regional policies being forced upon us. As the cities foul up, as the existing stock of social provisions becomes overburdened, it will be economical to establish disincentives in an already overindustrialised region.  It might be useful if we looked at the appropriate intervention of the Industrial Development <Col N="346" /> Authority in the area of infrastructure in some of the underdeveloped regions.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of environment, which I mentioned briefly in the discussion on the earlier Bill before the House this afternoon, the Bill dealing with restrictive practices, I was interested to see, on the front page of the June issue of the IDA <i>News</i> that they intend to become involved in the establishment of a recycling industry. They listed in that issue a number of the existing recycling plants which are in operation.  I think there are approximately eight.  This kind of industry is long overdue in the field of industrialisation. It would be schizophrenic in an unplanned economy to expect the location decisions of industry to achieve one's social aim.  That cannot be achieved except in the atmosphere of a planned economy.  Similarly, when we reflect on it, when people make statements suggesting that any cost in industry is welcome, that we must provide any kind of employment activity, we must remember that much of existing industry is involved in the production of waste.  Certainly much of human behaviour is engaged in the structuring of waste.  We are all indebted to people like Deputy Moore who has drawn our attention to the fact that something like 800,000 tyres per annum are discarded on local authority dump heaps and that a couple of million bottles are littering our environment.  We have not managed to institute, nationally or regionally, an adequate recycling activity in relation to paper.  Therefore, I do not see the point in going entirely for the idea of new and more industry without building a recycling component into our existing industrial activity.</P>
    <P>I would argue as something closely related to that point that before any future grants or increased grants are allocated industrial projects should be asked to indicate clearly &mdash; admittedly in a discussion like this we can only do it on a voluntary basis &mdash; what precise environmental monitoring devices they intend to apply.  In countries like Japan it is now required by law that this be done.  It would be very useful if those industries which have received Industrial Development Authority grants in <Col N="347" /> the last year or who may receive them in the future&mdash;there are a few involved and they are in the Bill&mdash;voluntarily offered us these environmental monitoring controls before they are legislatively demanded.  These controls should be legislatively required.</P>
    <P>Obviously there will be a number of Senators who will disagree with much of what I have said concerning the role of the Industrial Development Authority. Some people think the Industrial Development Authority exists as an organisation simply to promote jobs. Under the statute which established them, they are no such thing.  They are charged with the promotion of industry. A number of developments are possible. I hope that when the IDA are restructured new developments will give them, not merely a promotional role but a far more critical one, which will help the IDA to develop in the direction I have outlined.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the present economic difficulties.  With respect, I would suggest, regarding these difficulties and the reaction of the IDA to them, we must take cognisance of the fact that it is in capital intensive industry we have experienced some of our worst difficulties.  When we look at the whole question of industrialisation in a broader spectrum&mdash;I would agree with those Senators who suggested we should look at small-scale industries again&mdash;we might also look at other kinds of labour activities on a small scale.  It may well be time, taking cognisance of the failures occurring now and based on a number of false assumptions concerning economic growth to place our faith on labour-intensive industry with an indigenous base rather than in the creation of jobs at any cost on a capital-intensive base over which we have very little control.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that a number of the points I have made today were adverted to by the Minister when he was replying to the debate on 1st July in the Dáil. On that occasion, the Minister announced that he was reserving his position on the future role of the IDA&mdash; this is quite fair&mdash;because we are awaiting major legislation.  It was quite appropriate for the Minister to pay tribute to <Col N="348" /> the Deputies who suggested there should be an environmental consciousness of the kind I have just described. Commenting at column 500 of Volume 283 of the Dáil Official Report the Minister paid tribute to Deputy Seán Moore for his reference to the necessity of trying to assess the sociological effects and the effects on the whole environment of the establishment of new industry, the need to study, when an industry was established in a certain place, not just what it did for industrial jobs in that place but also its effect on the whole fabric of life.</P>
    <P>One of the things I found most appalling in the last two years&mdash;this is not a party political point but the reaction of someone who is critically interested in industrialisation as an historical phenomenon&mdash;has been the great dishonesty of members of the business sector in relation to the environmental monitoring of industrialisation of a certain kind. There is the feeling that somehow or other you can add in a care about the environment when the industrialisation has taken place.  It is not only that jobs are set against environmental conservation but it is sometimes suggested that environmental conservation can take place after jobs have been created.  It would be much better if industry openly opposed the environmentalists' lobby and said so.  It would be more honest. What it is intended to do is to kill the effort by faint praise&mdash;to suggest there is a place in public life and in public discussion for the environmentalists' lobby but that, of course, it has to be considered in moderation.  That kind of statement has very often been made.</P>
    <P>I feel that on this it is wiser, as another writer has somewhere else reminded us, to remind the Senators that one of the most thundering denunciations in the Bible is the phrase of St. Paul that God will not be mocked; one might, in 1975, say our ecological systems will not be mocked.  If we throw in a few lines here and there about care for the environment after the industrialisation effort there may be no environment to care about.  I would ask for a greater concern and much greater care for the kind of argument a number of people have been making.  I would ask that it be taken far more seriously <Col N="349" /> by those people who find it totally unpalatable to consider environmental arguments, who say they are in favour of industrialisation at any cost and an industrial development authority that will promote industrialisation without restraint.  It would be extremely useful if this were done.</P>
    <P>We are, for example, voting now a small sum to the Industrial Development Authority.  A project that could come before us for consideration might be a project dealing with oil or gas.  The idea that such a project could even be considered without clear environmental criteria being laid down as a policy, as a strategy, having before us the lessons of Scotland, the evidence of architects, planners and all types of social people, would be appalling.</P>
    <P>Recently I discussed this matter in another area.  One of the oil lobby told me the environmental lobby made him sick.  I was very appreciative of his comment because I had met an honest man.  It is time we had proper overall monitoring of the environment and, when we come to consider the larger legislation, we should move far more in the direction of participation, in the direction of a national enterprise board and probably an industrial promotions board, telling foreign industry that we are as environmentally conscious as anybody else and it is not a matter merely of accepting the creation of jobs at any cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the Industrial Development Authority are a very powerful agency in this country's economic fight.  Tribute will continue to be paid to their work and I would add a special note with regard to the integrity of the members and officers of the authority.  There are no finer men.  They are dedicated to the promotion of job opportunities.  To them it must be very satisfying to see such achievements and I wish them success in the future.  They have, of course, had their failures and, like all failures, they make news whereas successes very often do not make news. The success rate has been out of all proportion to the failure rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often think all the IDA need is the means to allow them to get on with the job, unhampered and unpestered in <Col N="350" /> their efforts.  They have an unenviable task.  As we all know, they set themselves certain targets for the period 1973-1977.  To date, one regrettably must admit that these targets have not been reached and one must extend sympathy to them because of that.  In the north-eastern region they have achieved 6.2 per cent of their target for the period 1973-1977, two-fifths of the period expired.  Breaking down the figures of net job creation in 1973 and 1974 we find that, whereas there was a plus figure pertaining to the net job creation of 1,324 in Counties Cavan, Louth and Monaghan in 1973, that figure changes to a minus of 1,113 for 1974, giving us a mere minimum of 211 new jobs created, allowing for redundancies in that two-year period.  That amounts to only 6.2 per cent of their target.</P>
    <P>The selling aids the Industrial Development Authority have provided over the years have been a very powerful incentive in job creation.  Possibly after 1977, when the transitional period allotted by the EEC to allow the selling aids to continue at the present level expires, these aids will have to be reviewed and that could create difficulties for the country as a whole and not only for the IDA.  One can only hope that in their battles with the EEC Commission they will be able to retain industrial incentives at their present level.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that one of the reasons for this increase from £350,000 to £850,000 is to speed up the processing of negotiations which can be tedious, lengthy, detailed and complex.  The Parliamentary Secretary indicated there is sometimes a danger that an industry may well withdraw its project if there is undue delay.  It is only right that such danger should be avoided.  I am not aware if it has happened in many cases but certainly I had one personal experience in which I had a slight fear there would be withdrawal due to a two-or three-month period involved between the preparation of the memorandum and the final approval by the Cabinet. It is a good idea to avoid such danger and, if not a danger, even a fear of it happening.</P>
    <P>One respect in which our industrial <Col N="351" /> efforts fall down is in lack of coordination between the different bodies. For a number of years the North-Eastern Regional Development Organisation has had to have a certain liaison with the Industrial Development Authority, local authorities and certain other statutory bodies in regard to planning, infra-structure and general industrial development.  As far as I could find, there was never any real sense of purposeful realisation or even purposeful participation in all of this work.  I think it was possibly due to the fact that the RDOs have a lack of real standing or effectiveness.  This is something the Government should examine if it is to extract the best from the RDOs and the bodies which liaise with them in this important work.</P>
    <P>The public view very often is that many long-established industries are not receiving the same consideration in regard to grant assistance as foreign industries receive.  I know that the IDA will refute such a statement.  It is a public misimpression which should be corrected by the facts.  Maybe in regard to small industries there is that feeling that these are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  In this regard it is worth reminding ourselves that 75 per cent of the total number of manufacturing industries are small industries.  They provide 20 per cent of the total manufacturing employment and 20 per cent of the total manufacturing output. These are quite convincing figures, but they are not measured up to when one sees that the small industries receive only about 7 per cent of the total IDA grants.  There is no doubt that small industries can be in very many instances a real bulwark against the effects of recession, particularly in rural areas where there is neither the population nor the labour supply available to provide for large-scale industry.  I am a great believer in the saying that five small industries providing, say, 40 or 50 jobs each are a much better proposition for any community than one large industry providing the equivalent 200 jobs.</P>
    <P>One aspect that has been the subject of a certain amount of public concern in the past year or two in regard to the <Col N="352" /> number of closures and threatened closures has been what happens taxpayers' money when it is given to industries in a shoring-up operation.  Is there sufficient control over that money, and how it is spent by the industry which receives the assistance?  There are grounds here for a long-term discussion as to where the IDA should stand when it renders assitance together with Fóir Teoranta, as regards control of the taxpayers' money.  One finds the cries of alarm sometimes going off only at the eleventh hour.  The mechanism within Fóir Teoranta and the IDA is switched on at that eleventh hour.  It is &ldquo;all systems go&rdquo; and the only objective seems to be to save that industry at all costs.  When the mechanism is switched on with that objective in mind we can unfortunately find instances where grants are given by either Fóir Teoranta or the IDA to concerns that might well be better off in the final analysis reassessing whether or not they should continue in existence.</P>
    <P>There is matter for discussion here about the criteria under which grants are given in such instances.  I believe the only criteria that should apply in the case of eleventh hour assistances is whether the money allocated can create a good job out of what is a bad job.  In the more comprehensive legislation the Parliamentary Secretary has intimated will be forthcoming we could go into that matter to a far greater extent.</P>
    <P>In welcoming this very small measure the least we can do is give it effect very quickly.  Senator Higgins spoke about ecology and the environment.  These are important matters.  We all realise that the earth is a finite resource.  It is not infinite in its supply, and we must care for what we have been privileged to receive.  I do not think this country is yet at the stage of economic growth where it can say to any industrialist, no matter where he comes from, that we want certain standards applied in regard to the environment and the ecology which he must either comply with or else we will have to reconsider giving him a grant.  I think the IDA would feel pretty hampered and restricted with such constraints upon their activities.  In the light of the IDA target in job creation over the next 20 <Col N="353" /> or 30 years, if we are to keep our people at home and reach anything like full employment, I do not think that anybody in this House or the public at large would consider it appropriate to apply such constraints at this time.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I look forward to more comprehensive legislation with regard to the future work of the IDA.  We could have a very constructive debate on that, and the defects and the good points in regard to the operations of this very fine Authority would be forthcoming in such a debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is a subject that holds a great deal of interest for me or for anybody from the part of the country that I come from, where we have not sufficient industry, where we have not got the resources, the people with sufficient resources or with experience of industry behind them.  We will not necessarily look to the IDA for the sort of development we need in our area.  I would add that I have some experience of the IDA and I believe that they have done a very good job with the resources given to them.  They are an organisation of very dedicated and qualified people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrary to what so many believe, they are available and can be reached at any time by the ordinary man who has a worth while idea.  I have always found this.  It is a semi-state body and in the past many people had the impression that political pull was involved.  On a public occasion in a small town in the west of Ireland I saw four or five families who had started small industries, upright sincere people, working hard to develop these industries, looking for grants, and I saw them blatantly walking into a political party meeting of the particular party that happened to be in power.  I am not making any judgment on the party at this moment, but I thought it was a great shame that these people should have got the impression that they must, if they were to succeed in getting an industrial development grant, walk into that particular party meeting, be seen to be there and be seen to be playing their dart with the Government of the day. I would say, from my experience, that <Col N="354" /> it was entirely unnecessary.  I know from long experience of working and having contact with the IDA that there was no need whatever for this demonstration.</P>
    <P>I see every good reason why local Deputies of any particular party should take an interest in industrial projects going on around them.  I see every reason why a Deputy should be asked on occasion to take particular problems to the Minister concerned, to ensure that what the Minister and the Government have in mind is being followed by the IDA.  In addition there are often special statements to be made in special areas and very often the best person to make them is the local representative. From my experience there is no need whatever for anybody to crawl to any political representative or to any political party.  That has not been the position in my experience in the past. It is a pity the small industrialists in particular should find it necessary to subscribe to any party fund or crawl to any public representative.  I do not believe it is necessary.</P>
    <P>Because of the amount of resources available to the IDA there are severe limitations on what it can do.  When we talk of the IDA we are inclined to think of something that ought to be a bit bigger than just a body that is there with money to hand out to particular industries when they have a good idea. The IDA should be much bigger than that.  Taking the two together, the IDA and the county development team, I would like to see more resources available, more co-operation and a much more efficient job being done. I am not talking now about the subsidiary of an international company but about the man who thinks he can make some article or has a special skill and who, with a little bit of money could get an industry going in his area. Very often an idea can develop into a worth-while industry, probably a most durable industry, where you have people with roots in the area employed, where there is a concern for the neighbours employed and a better understanding altogether between employer and employee.  At the moment this man must first of all employ accountants and prepare his case.  These people <Col N="355" /> have very little experience in business and no experience in bookkeeping. They find themselves at a loss in the preparation of a case.  For this reason many applications have dragged on over the years.  The whole process could be short-circuited in many ways to the advantage of the potential industrialist and the IDA.</P>
    <P>Agriculture meant a great deal to this country in the past.  We had a complete advisory structure available to farmers.  I will not comment on it except to say it is probably a little out of date, but there was available to every farmer a very worth while and useful advisory service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about making a comparison between the advice that is available to the agricultural community and the significance of the fact that the Industrial Development Authority, while doing a good job, are too restricted.  Particularly in the western areas and in the field of small industries generally, we could do with a team of high-powered consultants or advisers who could be called upon by people in smaller industries to give them advice and guidance in the initial stages.  There is no way in which that advice can be got at the moment without it being paid for.  Very often too many small industrialists who have a good idea and are able to do the job and have the technical know-how are left high and dry without the sort of high-powered industrial advice that ought to be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>This is an area which I would as the Parliamentary Secretary to have a look at.  Perhaps he might come up with some solution.  The county development teams are an important link here. Generally speaking, it is only through the county development teams that developers get encouragement and guidance in the early stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To begin with, the make-up of the county development teams is not what it ought to be.  The two sides of industry should be represented on the county development teams, who could gain a <Col N="356" /> lot by having representatives from industry&mdash;successful industrialists and men with knowledge and experience. It is too much to expect that the chairman of a county council, the county engineer, the CEO, the county manager and the chief education officer could have between them all that is necessary to make an adequate county development team.  There is far too much chance there.  It usually ends that a county which happens to have a good county development officer has the right link with the IDA and the right machinery for availing of the facilities that the IDA provide.  The county that does not have a good county development officer is out in the cold.  The resources of the county development team as well as their make-up are not anything like adequate.</P>
    <P>I do not see this as being a problem in relation to the larger industries. People who can pay their own consultants and who usually have big capital connections to begin with, know where capital can be got, know the sort of accounts that must be produced and the sort of things that must be said to get themselves finance. The small industrialist, generally speaking, is left to himself.  Even though he may be able to do the job, when asked to submit projections or to look for finance he will put his foot in it.  He ends up getting nothing.  Nine times out of ten he would scare off the IDA. I knew men who had the potential, and who succeeded eventually, who scared off the IDA just because they did not know what was the done thing in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>For this reason the IDA will not be complete as an industrial development authority until such time as we have a better force of high-powered advisers to whom the proprietors and managers of small industries will have access through their county development team.  I should like to see an extension of the county development team by the inclusion of the industry and labour side.</P>
    <P>On the question of finance for small industry, in the past year there was a very large number of small industries where the number of employees fell off and the profits dwindled away.  In <Col N="357" /> many cases there was nothing wrong except lack of finance.  Fóir Teoranta have done a good job but on the industrial development front we should look again at this idea.  Many industries tried to get finance from various sources but they were unsuccessful.  In the end they had to go to Fóir Teoranta for the residue operation which in the minds of a lot of taxpayers is a charitable operation.  We should have one body like the Agricultural Credit Corporation in agriculture for the financing of these industries.  That body should decide whether an industry was worthy of financing and should be in a position to give the necessary finance.</P>
    <P>As far as Fóir Teoranta are concerned&mdash;there is nothing charitable about it&mdash;there is no question of the money not being paid back or coming out of the taxpayers' pockets.  It is just like a loan from a bank.  In 99 cases out of 100 it will not be given unless the people are satisfied that the industry is potentially viable.</P>
    <P>All we want is one national industrial body that will cater for those who cannot convince the high financiers or cannot put forward the necessary security to obtain finance&mdash;a body that will not have a hard, callous, banker's outlook where security is all that matters and return on capital is all that they are interested in.</P>

      <P>What about the ICC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>The ICC have been in existence for long-term finance only. There is a gap still remaining.  People will go to the bank and they are not concerned about employment.  They could not care less if there are 1,000 jobs at stake or if the area is dying or if shops are going out of existence or if schools are closing.  They are not interested.  There is a crying need for the sort of facility for people who have been grant aided by the IDA of providing finance through a responsible semi-State body.  The idea of Fóir Teoranta is a bit out of date and looks too much like a hand-out and a charity which it is not.  I would ask the Minister to look at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have found the IDA to be receptive and co-operative.  However more recognition <Col N="358" /> should be given to the areas from which the application comes.  They get applications from areas, say the west, from an industry which may be in trouble, and the IDA are forced to say &ldquo;We cannot grant aid to you because your particular industry is in trouble&rdquo;. There is a problem about this.  If an area needs an industry and an idea comes up, special consideration should be given regardless of the state of the industry. What they should look at is the viability of the idea before them.  In an area where jobs are not available and structure is breaking down, the IDA should be more lenient than they are, if they are convinced that the co-operative or individual or whoever is concerned has the ability and can make a go of the industry even if there is over-production in that area or if that industry is in trouble in other areas.  I welcome the Bill.  It is a step in the right direction. I would ask the Minister consider what I have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to this debate is another constructive and interesting example of the reception in the Seanad of problems concerning semi-State bodies.  There is a general feeling in favour of a body such as this.  We should try to see how we can develop it and make suggestions, such as that which Senator McCartin made, which will help it to fulfil the purpose the IDA were originally set up for.</P>
      <P>There is an interesting philosophy in the Houses of the Oireachtas <i>vis-à-vis</i> semi-State bodies.  They are institutions which were set up by the State to fulfil specific needs at specific times.  The first such body was set up to operate or develop the Shannon Scheme.  The second one was either the Agricultural Credit Corporation or the Dairy Disposal Board.  From that small beginning a whole host of semi-State bodies have been set up, now employing more people than the Civil Service.  They were given a great deal of independence from the Oireachtas and were set up with this in mind.  On the whole, this has worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is always a need to look at the original requirements, conditions and the straitjacket in which the bodies were set up.  The only opportunity we get to discuss a problem confronting a semi-State <Col N="359" /> body is when a Bill such as this comes before the House asking for an increase in the grant, unless a new body is being set up.</P>
    <P>We heard recently about the establishment of an all-party committee to review the operation of the commercial semi-State bodies because they are the ones that impinge on the public.  Such bodies include CIE about whom, when they put up their fares, there was a howl, or the ESB.  When they put up their rates, there is a howl.  The Government have decided to establish a committee to monitor the operations of the commercial semi-State bodies.  A similar all-party committee should be set up so that Members of the Oireachtas will have an opportunity to monitor the operations of non-commercial semi-State bodies such as the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>Neither the public nor the Oireachtas would look on this as an effort to restrict the operation of these bodies but rather to ensure that they fulfil the needs which may change from the time they were set up.  They were set up by legislation; they may be restricted by legislation and that legislation may need to be changed.  This is the kind of this which an all-party committee, which should contain independent representation, should be doing.  It would be very effective and provide an important public relations link, because it would help the Members of the Oireachtas to realise what the scope of these bodies was and it would inevitably filter down, via the media, to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the manner of your rebuke and I am sure you will appreciate that I now wish to turn to some of the problems concerned with the specific semi-State body before us but, of course, as I said, this is our only chance to review the operations of this body, and while we welcome the <Col N="360" /> Parliamentary Secretary's determination to bring in a wider Bill which will give us an opportunity to look at the whole field which he has mentioned in his Second Stage speech, it means there is a problem in this respect: unless such a Bill comes in we, as public representatives who should be having some regard for the spending of public money do not get such opportunities.</P>
      <P>The annual report which the IDA issue is a very impressive document. They obviously have gone to considerable trouble to design it and to get the material together and to produce it in an attractive format in which one can readily get the impression of a wide-ranging organisation with links in all parts of the country, not just in the developed east coast area but with links in all parts of the country.  If one took this report at its face value, then the IDA would be a remarkable body indeed.  I am not saying they are not, but the problem that we face is that we have no criteria on which to judge the performance of the IDA.</P>
      <P>One of the figures which constantly comes from the IDA is the jobs forecast for the current year, the number of jobs that are to be created either by the efforts of the authority or across the whole industrial board.  We see this figure.  It changes from time to time: when things are bad it revolves downwards; when the boom is on it is revised upwards.  There really are not any comparisons of this figure in the following year with the number of jobs that actually were created.  This sort of comparison, which might not be flattering, would help to put the picture into perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the annual report of the IDA will favour the IDA, and quite rightly so&mdash;one would not expect it to do otherwise&mdash;but one would like to see some other information, which would have to come from another source. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would be able to give us the figures of the jobs forecast for last year compared to the number of jobs that were actually created to give us an impression of how close this IDA forecasting is to what actually happens.  One cannot expect it to be 100 per cent accurate, but it is important for us to know, to be able to <Col N="361" /> judge, because we see these figures in the newspapers day after day.  &ldquo;The general manager of the IDA forecasts the creation of 20,000 jobs in 1974-75.&rdquo; At the end of that year, when a forecast like that had been made, it should be tested against the reality of the situation. That is one of the things I should like to see, and it is the sort of information we should have.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers mentioned the problem of IDA resources, the fact that the IDA have done well inside their limited resources.  They do excellent work and I should always like to see their resources being increased because the sort of philosophy by which they operate is an important philosophy for this country in helping the people to help themselves, introducing overseas industrialists to the Irish situation, trying to entice them away from the developed areas to areas where there is plenty of labour, trying to get them to move to places where there is high unemployment but where there are plenty of skills, and helping such people with training and grants and setting up factories, with equipment, and generally providing a very well worth while stage-set for industrialists.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to see that this stage-set applies very often to Irish industrial-lists, and I should like to see more Irish industrialists making use of IDA facilities. It is always encouraging to see foreign industries, foreign investors, coming into this country, but it is more encouraging to us as Members of this Parliament to see an authority such as this, developing home-based industries, home-based skills, developing the ideas of people who are living in this country, who will not be moving away, who will not do a flit when the pressure comes on, and so it is encouraging to see more Irish industrialists making use of the IDA.</P>
    <P>Here I would very much back up what Senator McCartin said.  Perhaps for the smaller man who needs short-term finance there should be another body. There is a bit of a stigma attached to Fóir Teoranta although they do an excellent job.  There is this idea that they do a fireman operation, a rescue operation.  He has a point when he asks for a single body to look at the whole <Col N="362" /> problem of industrial financing in this country.</P>
    <P>One of the possible sources of revenue for the IDA must be the EEC Regional Fund about which we have heard so much and from which we have got so little.  One continually hopes for agreement on a substantive regional fund and policy.  The IDA would be a splendid agency to disburse some of the money from the Regional Fund because they do a lot of development in the underdeveloped areas of the country.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary might convey this message to his boss, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and, even more important, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and, even more important, to the Minister for Finance&mdash;that one Member at least of this House would like to see the IDA dealing with some of the Regional Fund money and spending it in a constructive way.</P>
    <P>There is another point which has been very ably dealt with by my colleague, Senator Higgins, and that is the problem of conservation.  Here rapid strides have been made in recent years, and we are now not so inclined to give our money away in industrial grants without tying in some pretty rigorous and rigid clauses on the effects of pollution from a particular industry.  Why should we give taxpayers' money away unless we are as sure as we can be that the problems of unemployment which the industry helps to solve are not less than the problems of pollution which the industry creates?</P>
    <P>This applies particularly to the big chemical industries.  It is very important to have not only very strict conditions but to have a properly organised, staffed and qualified team of monitors who will deal with the problem of pollution.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that in the last five years or so, when there has been an emphasis on the environment, on preserving our ecology and our land, the various Government agencies, including the IDA, have been much stricter in applying rigorous environmental control and conditions before allocating grants to industries.</P>
    <P>We are failing in our task if we invite foreign industrialists to set up industries and who may give employment and provide revenue but cause serious pollution problems.  It is right that there <Col N="363" /> should be this kind of controversy.  It is also right that the media and the public should be aware of the problems which may arise from the siting, for example, of a refinery in Dublin Bay or chemical factories being established around the country.  We should know, too, the conditions laid down, not only by the local authority but by the grant-giving bodies, such as the Industrial Development Authority before they give money to an industry which could have serious side effects in terms of pollution and destruction of the environment.</P>
    <P>We all see what consistently happens in Bantry Bay.  Each time there is a 100 per cent chance of no risk and a new system has been developed to prevent an oil leak.  Than there is another big oil spillage three months later.  All the good work done by environmentalists is undone.  This sort of thing must not be allowed to happen.  The preservation and conservation of the environment must be conditional on the allocation of a grant in advance.  It is no use trying to do it afterwards because that will be too late.  It is no use doing it unless we have a proper way of monitoring the effects and an organisation to deal with the effects of industrial pollution.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  The Parliamentary secretary might give us an estimate of the increase in total expenditure by the IDA likely to occur in the current year through the increase being voted in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no increase in expenditure in the Bill.  It is merely altering the procedure in relation to the approval by the Government of grants. It does not imply any extra expenditure. Certain grants have to be passed by the Cabinet and the requirement is being changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it is purely an administrative matter.  I take the point. I welcome the Bill but I should like to see some general way of reviewing the operations of the Industrial Development Authority without waiting until measures such as this come before the House, but that is no reason for not supporting the Bill in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKerrigan" hpid="Mr. Kerrigan Mr. Kerrigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerrigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief <Col N="364" /> because most of the points I intended raising have already been mentioned. In welcoming the increases which the Industrial Development Authority may make available we should bear in mind, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, that it is not a monetary increase but an authorisation to make grants available on a slightly larger scale than before because of the drop in money values.  This measure is to be welcomed because it gives the IDA more freedom to make decisions without having to refer back to the Government.  At times quick decisions have to be made and this Bill will improve decision-making.</P>
      <P>While there may have been some criticism of the IDA they have done a very good job.  Our own industrialists may have criticised the IDA for looking after the foreign industrialist more than the Irish one.  This depends on the function of the authority and on many more agencies mentioned by different Senators during the debate.  The functions of some of those agencies seem to overlap and I agree with Senator McCartin's suggestion that they should be brought in under fewer umbrellas. There are too many State agencies doing different types of work and it would be better to examine the whole structure of State agencies now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's assurance that during the next session there will be legislation to deal with this matter.  When Senators speak about conservation there should be an area of agreement.  It has happened that, even before the IDA decide what industry will be sited in a certain place, there is uproar.  This has frightened off many people.  I have had the experience where certain people were negotiating for an industrial site but before it was decided they abandoned the project because they felt they would have an unenviable task trying to please the objectors.  We all realise that we must look after the environment but we must do it in such a way that will be in accordance with the plans of the IDA and the local authority.  These two groups are involved in the scheme and will be affected by any change.  Therefore people who worry too much about conservation and who make too much fuss before anything is known about an <Col N="365" /> industry, should get the facts straight before they begin their campaign.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say on this Bill which gives us an opportunity to say a few words on the work of the IDA.  The IDA have performed an excellent job on industrial expansion because most of our industries are established through the IDA. Members of that organisation go abroad and try to get foreign industrialists to set up factories here.  We should also pay a tribute to the regional development authorities.  These colleges have had close co-operation with the IDA. They are doing excellent work by coordinating the work of each county. In my area, Mr. Cullinane, the director, and his staff prepared an enormous amount of data on the number of school leavers in the region, their ages and the various infrastructures and knowledge pertaining to them that would be needed and would satisfy questions that an industrialist might ask if he was advised to go to a particular area.</P>
      <P>The regional development authorities do excellent work, as do the county development teams.  For a reason unknown to me, members of the local county councils who are members on The regional development authorities are not members of the local development teams.  This is a mistake because it would mean that there was liaison and continuity.  It is one thing to say that the chairman of the county council may be a member, but there are at least two or three members from each county on the regional development authority who would be of great help to the county development teams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose is to advise people and make it worth their while to come into particular areas to establish industries. It is true that over the last ten or 20 years the number of people finding work on farms has declined and is declining progressively not alone in Ireland but in European countries.  Consequently there was a need to set up industries to try to absorb the population and the extra workers who returned from abroad because of the industrial expansion that has taken place here over the past ten <Col N="366" /> or 15 years and who felt that it would be better for them and their families to live in an Irish climate and in open spaces rather than in skyscrapers in foreign countries.  The aim was, if at all possible, that they would return to their own native place and find a job to sustain them and they could become citizens of the country they liked best.</P>
    <P>I have listened to tributes being paid to the semi-State bodies and I am in wholehearted agreement.  They did exmind Bord na Móna, who pioneered techniques with regard to using the turbary.  They invented and sold abroad not alone ideas but machines that are in use in many countries at present. They were almost the first in this field. I remember some years ago when people came from abroad to examine and study the methods used by Board na Móna to make use of native fuel.  They have also added to our export trade by exporting peat moss and so on.</P>

      <P>The IDA are a non-commercial body and are very much needed.  For that reason, I welcome any effort to give them extra funds.  I appreciate that, when the amount of money at present available is compared with what has been given, and allowing for depreciation and inflation, it is questionable if it will be better than they have been getting already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator West made some reference to job forecasting.  I suppose it is an exercise that is necessary for some people to go through.  It is not fair to completely level the charge at the IDA that they are responsible if jobs are not created.  I believe that in the main the creation of jobs is the function of the Government.  It is they who must provide the confidence that will ensure that outside industrialists, and natives, will take their courage in their hands and plough their hard-earned money into industry.  They must be convinced that it is viable, that there is a stable Government, and that there is ordered progress and a fair chance, if an outsider or a native invests money, that he will <Col N="367" /> get reasonable protection to ensure that his industry will survive.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the State ought to play an important part when industries are sent into undeveloped areas.  I agree wholeheartedly with the idea of sending them there.  Small industries are very important in the small towns and villages of rural Ireland which in many instances are dying for the want of industries.  It was good policy to ensure to the best of our ability that there will be some industry in every town and village, even if it was farmed out from a larger industry in some other part of the country.</P>
    <P>Dublin is bursting at the seams so far as houses, schools, churches and so on are concerned, while in many parts of our country schools are almost vacant. Many towns lack a good hinterland and a viable industry.  The Government must ensure that people will have sufficient confidence to start industries in rural Ireland.  People who put in money into this country, especially outsiders, do not do so for the love of the Irish people.  They are coming to Ireland to make money.  Some of them who came here years ago were counting on cheap labour, which I am glad they did not get.  Nobody likes to see people exploited. But we realise that labour have a responsibility to industry.  The Government were far-seeing when they devised means of settling strikes.  The fact that a country is reasonably strike-free plays a big part in the placing of an industry.</P>
    <P>In my opinion we have too many unions.  That is a matter for the trade union movement.  I am a trade unionist myself.</P>

      <P>The Senator is moving step by step away from this amendment of the IDA code to the IDA in general, to the question of employment in general and to the structure of trade unionism in Ireland. <Col N="368" /> Those successive steps have taken him extremely wide of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I do not want to be awkward.  I was going from one point to another.  There is a tremendous amount of merit in the IDA trying to encourage people to set up factories in those areas.  In most counties and in most regional development organisations, the figures are at hand so that an industrialist coming into the area can know at a glance what labour is available in that area.  I feel that AnCO, Mr. Agnew, who is in charge, and the colleges of technology have played an important part in seeing that we have an intelligent and highly skilled work force.  On its own that should be an incentive to any industrialist from outside.  The IDA can say with confidence that the Irish worker is on a par and, indeed, far ahead of many workers in other countries.</P>
      <P>I should like to put in a special plea for the native industrialist who has remained in Ireland and has found it difficult in the past to get any assistance, while the multinationals are getting grants to the tune of thousands of pounds.  Naturally he was discouraged. The man, woman or group who set up an industry based on our raw materials should be helped by the IDA and their staff.  In my area we have industries based on food.  In Killeshandra we have Killeshandra Milk Products, McCormacks and various food processing factories.  The latest is a cheese factory.  These are factories which will not fold up overnight because at home and abroad people get hungry everyday. In a business using native material the local people around are employed supplying the raw material.  That is very important to the area.  The same applies to industries based on cattle.  In the past many native industrialists worked under adverse conditions, and I would not like to see them by-passed in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how much money has come from the EEC to assist the IDA but much more is needed.  I do not think many of the people in the EEC are aware of our facilities, our climate and the ability of our people in general to <Col N="369" /> look at industry and take a pride in our work.  We are a sociable people with whom foreigners can mix with ease.  All these should be an incentive to foreigners to set up new industries here.</P>
    <P>When some industrialists arrive in Dublin they may have a very large cylinder or tank to transport across the country.  A look should be taken at the harbours on the west coast to ensure that it will not be necessary to take these tanks across the country, probably to the west of Ireland.  Some attention should be paid to the harbours because we have the best harbours in Europe.</P>
    <P>Bantry Bay was mentioned here.  I attended a congress there very recently and I can truthfully say that I did not see any sign of any oil pollution.  As a matter of fact I said to myself that it was well for the people there who are getting an industry so close to them.</P>
    <P>We may cry a lot about the pollution but there are pollution inspectors appointed for these areas.  I do not know what powers they have.  People are generally aware of pollution and the harm it can do.  There must be a better approach to establishing new industries than trying to hound some of these people before they have the industry set up.  We are on the outskirts of Europe.  We are not a highly industrialised country.  Jobs are tremendously important to a man with a family.  He would rather put up with pollution than take the emigrant ship.  We could be too hard on industrialists because we feel we will be all dead in nine or ten years because of industrial pollution. Remember many of our people had to go to England to work in coalmines, for ten or 15 hours a day, in the tunnels under London city and so on.  They had to put up with pollution, sand, coal dust and many other hazards.</P>
    <P>A reasonable number of anti-pollution laws are necessary.  We must realise that the world will not fall asunder because of pollution.  There are highly industrialised countries whose people&mdash; I do not know if the people live as long as they do in Ireland&mdash;live a fair length of time and their standards are fairly high.  Our aim should be to try to give foreign industrialists confidence in the ability of our workers to do a good job, the co-operation of our industries and <Col N="370" /> to pin point our excellent harbours, and our geographical position as a jumping off ground, not only to the EEC, but into Europe and Asia.  Anything we, in the Houses of the Oireachtas, can do by way of increasing the grant, or changing the conditions under which they are given, which would help create more employment for our people, is very worth while.</P>
    <P>There are many areas that need assistance to get industries established there.  In my own north-western area it is very difficult at the moment because of the unhappy situation that existed there over the last five or six years and also because we were on both sides of the border and there were custom duties and so on.  Because Britain decided to go into the EEC many tariff barriers have been crumbling.  The Six and the Twenty-six Counties are very favourable areas for industries.  The IDA, the county councils and the Minister for Local Government should ensure that areas such as the north-western and north-eastern areas, which suffered the loss of the railways and do not have any airfields, should have more money pumped into them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to give a brief, non-academic contribution to this Bill which has been generally welcomed by Senators on both sides of the House.  This is an enabling Bill. Many Senators, because of their affiliations with the IDA and the county development teams, have found it difficult, in their efforts to compliment the IDA, to stay within the confines of the Bill.  I no doubt will have the same problem.  I hope for your indulgence, a Chathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many comments have been made about the IDA, complimentary and otherwise.  Anyone who criticised it did so constructively.  It might be no harm to put it on the record of the House that the credit for the formation of the IDA goes to a colleague of mine, Senator Connolly, who in March, 1949 in the Dáil, initiated a Private Members' Motion requesting that such an authority be set up.  If anyone cares to check the records of the Dail Report of that time, Volume 114, column 796, they will discover that Deputy Connolly had a Private Members' Motion down which <Col N="371" /> the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Morrissey, accepted with gratitude and formed the IDA. That was the beginning of an organisation which contributed more to the economic development of this country than any other body which has been set up in the meantime.  The then shadow Minister, of course, promised that as soon as he came to power, he would abolish it.  However, having seen the wisdom of it, that did not happen, and today we have a Bill before us which enables us to pass additional funds to the IDA to ensure that they will have additional grants available for industrial development.  For that reason everybody welcomes the Bill.  We realise that undue delays in dealing with applications whether these delays are primarily caused by appeals against the setting up of their industry or because the IDA lack funds can cause industrialists to have second thoughts.  Within the restrictions of the previous Bill they had to come back to Cabinet level.  That usually caused delays.  Therefore anything that eases that situation will be welcomed by all sides of the House. Many of the recent applications before us from industrialists by their very nature, size and complexity, particularly in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, are of a very high order requiring extremely high capital input by the Government.  Any Bill like this that enables the IDA to deal with it in the first instance is certainly to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I note from the Parliamentary Secretary's speech that there is more comprehensive legislation dealing with the IDA coming before both Houses of the Oireachtas at a later stage.  Naturally that will give us ample opportunity to go into a very wide debate on the pros and cons of particular industrial development.  I will confine myself to just two points.  One is the policy of the IDA with regard to advance factories. I understand now that advance factories as such will not in future be provided, that preference will be given to the provision of development sites allowing the industrialist the provision of a factory more tailored to his needs rather than building an advance factory and <Col N="372" /> then the local development team having the problem of endeavouring to get an industry to fit the factory.  If we have gone away from this to developed sites this is a very welcome move and one to be commended.</P>
    <P>We have such an advance factory in my area.  I know we have problems and because of the closure of Gortdrum mines I hope that the IDA will consider that area for a designation, that supreme efforts will be made by the IDA to have an industrialist, at all costs, come into the advance factory in Tipperary Town so that some of the unemployment that will be caused by the closure of Gortdrum is absorbed in the factory. We will of course have a new IDA assisted factory there shortly, but this is primarily for the employment of females.</P>
    <P>The second point I would like to deal with, which has been touched on by several Senators, is the protection of the environment and the anti-pollution policy followed by the IDA.  It is as well to put on record that the county development teams&mdash;I have been a member of a county development team &mdash;in fact under the auspices of the IDA, avail of the facilities of the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards, which is a body set up, of course, independent of any particular industrialist or otherwise.  They have the technical know-how and facilities.  They have indeed assisted my county development team to check out the industries that are now coming to the Suir valley, as regards pollution.  They have tremendous facilities in the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards.  If the public were more generally aware that the IDA as such do not grant aid to companies that they fear for and that they make use of these facilities, we could nip in the bud many of these objections we have to planning and be able to assure the people, through public relations and other media, that primarily our concern is not alone for employment but also to ensure that the environment will be protected.  I would like to go along with the sentiments expressed by Senator McCartin when he wished that the local county development team was broadened.</P>
    <P>I can see a very useful function for <Col N="373" /> industrialists and indeed the trade union movement at that level.  With the present structure of the county development teams there is room for the advice of industrialists, whether they be through the Federated Union of Employers or any other such industrialists, that have an interest locally and the trade union movement to involve the workers at that level.  I certainly welcome that kind of development. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary if possible, to give an indication as to whether the IDA would consider this trend.</P>
    <P>I will reserve any other remarks on other functions of the IDA to another time when it would be more relevant to a Bill before us.  I will just welcome this Bill before us, I am sure it will get a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  I am very pleased that an opportunity is presented to this House to discuss and review the development of industry and the advance that the Industrial Development Authority have made in contributing to the establishment of new industries and, to some extent, assisting industries that are already in existence.</P>
      <P>During the debate I heard observations made that the IDA was the authority in respect of small industries. I do not think that that is correct. There are two sections of the IDA, the small industry section and the large industry section.  In a general way the Industrial Development Authority are to promote and assist the establishment of industry in the country generally. That to my mind should be based on the fact that the country generally has to have development, industrial-wise. To have that industry, and to give it a fair chance of succeeding in the country the Industrial Development Authority should examine the extent to which aid is required, financial or otherwise, in certain areas of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the situation in the country the first thing that one sees is that industrial-wise the east coast, with particular reference to the Dublin area, is over-loaded.  The number of people from the country, 70 or 80 miles away, who find employment in Dublin in industries is very considerable. <Col N="374" /> You have only to go along the road on Friday or any week-end and you find hundreds of people, working in industries in Dublin, hitch-hiking home.  The number of people who do not go home in such a way is even more.</P>
    <P>From a national point of view I see no reason why industry should not be established all over the country so that people do not have to travel 70 or 80 miles in order to find employment. That is the situation in Dublin city in regard to the location, and in rural Ireland, in the western or north western counties particularly, in regard to the employees.</P>
    <P>There are what might be called advantaged areas and disadvantaged areas where industry should be looked on in regard to what extent industrialists might be subsidised or allowed to establish industry with a maximum or a minimum of subsidisation in regard to the particular location.  I do not think that an industrialist coming into Dublin should be given the same incentive to establish an industry as if he was putting it in Leitrim, Longford, Roscommon or Cavan.  I want to remind the House that the first Senators who spoke here were from maritime counties such as Galway, Limerick, to the extent that it is an estuary of the Shannon, Louth and Meath.  The idea that some of these speakers put across was that regionalisation should obtain to the extent that industries should be sited where it was most economic to operate them and where it was most attractive to industrialists to locate them.</P>
    <P>If we take a national view we must disagree with that entirely.  We have to recognise that there is in the country the attractions I referred to, to bring industries into certain areas.  The area I refer to which requires the greatest incentive is an area roughly 30 to 40 miles from the east coast extending inland to the centre of Ireland and 20 miles from the west coast extending inland to the centre of Ireland.  The same is true in relation to the area from Tipperary to Dublin keeping as near to the Shannon as possible.</P>
    <P>These are the areas that have not the particular attractions both in relation to the modes of transport of manufactured goods outwards or the incentive <Col N="375" /> of recreational or social attractions in regard to locations for people to set up homes and to find more comfort and more likelihood to have a happier and easier time.  The people within the central plain and up to the very north of this State should get money to a greater extent than the maritime counties. We should examine to what extent this incentive might be allocated. If we look at the last census we will find that the counties which had the greatest amount of emigration were the ones that should come first.  In that regard on a hard economic analysis, an impartial and an unbiased approach we have to come to the conclusion that amongst these counties were Leitrim and Longford.  These are the counties that suffered most in the ten years prior to the last census.  The IDA should have a look at the situation and see to what extent they can help that particular area.</P>
    <P>The county development teams are energetic and determined in respect of their counties.  I appeal to each county development team within the underdeveloped areas in the 12 western counties to emphasise the importance of securing the maximum amount of the EEC industrial grant.  This is the area which, on analysis, is seen to be the most necessary to develop.  It is the area which, because of emigration, is most in need of immediate aid and help.  If we are to value in terms of money and personal comfort the advantages of being in Dublin, Galway, Limerick or Cork we must recognise that persons who exist in this country but have to leave it and turn their backs on it for ever are entitled to first consideration to the greatest possible extent in the area in which they intend to reside.  I would appeal to the Minister to ensure particular care is taken to influence industries into these areas that are regarded as unattractive areas. It is true that certain industries have been established in some of these areas.  Some of these industries came about by reason of the fact that natural wealth was found there.  In regard to the extent to which employment has been provided as a consequence the help of the IDA is certainly to be appreciated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> In areas where big industries are set up and subsidised to the extent of £2½ million, as is the case in Mullingar, we welcome the efforts of the IDA and the Government and also the people who are coming in.  Industry of that nature, which has such an expansive capacity, is something to be welcomed. The sooner we have more of these industries in areas of big population the better for this country and all the people concerned.  It is a compliment to the Government.  Regarding what Senator Dolan said it is an indication of the confidence and the amount of trust that the Government have from industrialists coming in as to the effectiveness of the system of government, security and progress in this country.  It is a fair barometer of the image of this country, the Government and the people in the eyes of industrialists abroad.</P>
    <P>It might be correct to say that industrialists coming into this country examine the opportunities from the point of view of labour force, whether it is free from strikes, whether it is a secure place to invest money, and whether as a country the reports that other industrialists have of it are in keeping with a progressive, sound, sincere people.  Our record in this regard is good.  We are going through a very difficult time.  The various funds and institutions that are set up to help industry in this country are certainly being called on.</P>
    <P>It is no crime or shame to say that any industry under present circumstances in the world today should have to have recourse to special funds to bring them over the hump in the industrial world.  The depression that exists is severe in every country in the world.  The extent to which the people's confidence may be enhanced in regard to our general wellbeing is certainly reflected in the extent to which outsiders and industrialists come in and invest their money.  I am delighted that the Minister has got this authority. While the sum is being increased to £850,000 in respect of any particular industry it is an advantage that will be availed of, I hope, in the coming year to a greater extent than it was in the past.  I welcome the Bill and I wish it success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senators for the gracious welcome they have given to this legislation.  Basically it involves a delegation of responsibility to the Industrial Development Authority in deciding on grants on their own without recourse to Cabinet decision up to a limit of a grant of £850,000.  The Seanad can have confidence that it will give this delegated responsibility to a body well fit to exercise it in a manner which is careful of public funds.  I should point out that in relation to every major grant that is given by the IDA they go in to considerable detail in regard to the credit-worthiness of the firm in question.  They study their annual reports if they are a public company.  In some cases they have specialist international consultants to advise them, both on the prospects of the particular company in question and the general prospects in the market for the products which it is intended they should produce.</P>
      <P>In any grant-aid decision there will be an irreducible minimum of commercial risk.  There will always be the danger that the company will not do as well as is projected.  We can be confident that the IDA have been very careful indeed in the grants they have given out.  In fact, it has been recognised internationally that they have a very good record in relation to this matter.  The First National City Bank produced a report on investment in Ireland and one of the sentences in that report was as follows:</P>
      <P>One of the impressive features of investment in Ireland is the low failure rate amongst new grant-aided industry.</P>
      <P>It can also be said that less than 7 per cent of the grants paid in the period 1960 to 1973 went to companies which subsequently failed.  This is a very low percentage, I understand, on an international comparison basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have substantially increased the amount of capital available to the Industrial Development Authority to create new jobs and assist in expansion of existing industry.  In the nine-month period April to December, 1974, £19 million was available to the IDA.  This, on an annual basis, would <Col N="378" /> represent £26 million.  This year, in 1975, the following 12-month year, £42.5 million is being made available, that is against the previous annual equivalent of £26 million.  Even allowing for an intervening inflation rate of 20 per cent we can show that in real terms the extra grants made available to the IDA in 1975 represent a real increase of 40 per cent on that made available in the immediately preceding year and that is making an adjustment for inflation. The Government are putting money, which is what really counts, into industrial development in this country.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that we are facing a difficult economic situation at the moment.  A Government in this context can be measured in their effectiveness on the basis, not on the problems they confront, but on their relative success in meeting those problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> the success of other Governments facing similar problems.  Obviously the most severe and relevant problem in terms of industrial development is the problem of unemployment.  I should like to draw the attention of the Seanad to the fact that in the period 1974-75 there was an increase in unemployment in Denmark of 340 per cent, in West Germany of 110 per cent; in France, 72 per cent; in Belgium, 70 per cent; in the Netherlands, 55 per cent.  These are all higher than the increase in unemployment, unduly high as it is, of 41 per cent which we have had in the most recent 12-month period.  The fact that we have been able to keep the increase in unemployment down to this level represents two factors.  One is the increasing activities by the Industrial Development Authority, and the other employment-creative initiatives of the Government and also, in fairness, the fact that we were starting from a higher base in terms of unemployment in this country. We have had traditionally a greater problem.  As I have said, the effectiveness of a Government can be measured in their relative performance <i>vis-à-vis</i> other Governments and previous situations rather than in absolute terms.  On that basis, the IDA and the Government have been doing reasonably well.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators expressed concern about the need to provide aid in particular for small industries.  This is <Col N="379" /> a point of view which finds considerable sympathy with me.  It is represented in thinking expressed by such people as Professor Schumacher when he speaks of intermediate technology, that is forms of technology which are suitable to small industry.  Many economists would agree that the best proof against inflation is competition.  To have competition you must have a number of competing units.  This means encouraging diversity, encouraging small units in many cases rather than allowing one monopolistic concern to dominate any particular market.  Therefore, I concur with the spirit of the remarks of many Senators in seeking a strong emphasis on the development of small industry. Our attitude in this country must not be one of solely seeking to control multinationals and trying to seek some punitive approach towards them but rather to compete with them.  I believe small industrialists can, if they get the technology and show the enterprise which they should be able to show, compete in many fields with the multinationals.</P>
    <P>Senator McCartin made a characteristically good speech and referred to the need for an advisory service for small industrialists seeking to set up in this country.  While I do not go all the way with his suggestions that there should be some new institution or advisory body I agree with him that small industrialists need more help. They should be aware of the help that is available already.  There exists not only the IDA but also the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards which such small enterprises can approach. The Institute produces a magazine, <i>Technology in Ireland,</i> with many ideas of new forms of processes in industrial production.  The Patents Office produces, on a regular basis, information on new inventions and new industrial processes which have been deposited with them.  We need more <i>entrepreneurs</i> in this country who are prepared to seek out such new ideas from the sources already available.  If, having sought out these new ideas, they want further to develop them, the IDA are prepared to make available research and development grants to <Col N="380" /> enable small industries to develop the technology which can compete with the technology and the strong R. and D. arm which exists in so many multinational companies.</P>
    <P>I intend, so far as my responsibility extends to the Patents Office and others, to ensure that the maximum help is made available in the dissemination of new innovative ideas for small <i>entrepreneurs</i> to get going in this country on a competitive basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to small industries, we should also bear in mind that the IDA are prepared to make available a substantially larger proportion of grant to small industries than they are to large industries.  They are prepared to go up to a proportion of 60 per cent of the fixed asset investment in the case of small industries.  This is far more proportionally than they will make available in the case of larger industries. It can be borne out by some figures.  In the context of the small industries programme grant commitments in the nine-month year, April to December, 1974, to small industries represented £1.5 million.  This was as against a total investment of £3.5 million; in other words, almost half the cost was going to be put up by the IDA.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, in the case of fixed asset investment by domestic Irish industry which was not within the small industry category the IDA were putting up £14.8 million towards a total fixed asset investment of £77 million.  Again, the figure is more striking still in the case of new overseas industry in that period.  The grant commitment by the IDA represented £34.3 million as against a total fixed asset investment of £153 million by the companies themselves inclusive of the grant aid they are receiving.  While the total amount being invested in small industries is relatively small we can thus clearly demonstrate that the proportion of that being made available by the IDA themselves is proportionately highest in the case of small industries and relatively higher in the case of domestic new industry, which is not small industry, than in the case of industry coming in from overseas.</P>
    <P>Senators expressed concern also about what some considered to be an <Col N="381" /> insufficient attention to the regions outside the eastern region in the matter of industrial jobs creation.  Here again there is a need to place on the record some statistics which will indicate the real situation.  In 1972, the Industrial Development Authority drew up a five-year industrial plan covering the period 1973 to 1977 and they set for each region and, indeed, for sub-groups within such regions, specific job creation targets.  It is important, before I give the figures, to bear in mind that these were targets to be achieved by 1977, that is within the 1973-1977 period.  In the Donegal region, which is perhaps the most remote of all, 137 per cent of the target had been reached in terms of job approvals by the end of 1974.  Job approvals represent grants which have been firmly committed.  They may not all have been paid out but the money is firmly committed.  In taking job approvals along with money already paid out, 137 per cent of the regional target had been reached by the end of 1974 in the Donegal region and that was for a target set, as I say, up to 1977.</P>
    <P>In the north western region by the end of 1974, 95 per cent had been reached.  In the western region, 148.7 per cent had been reached; the target has been exceeded by almost one-half again; in the mid-western region, 98.7 per cent; in the south western region, 100 per cent; in the south eastern region, 264 per cent; in the north eastern region, 99.4 per cent; in the midland region, 127 per cent and, in the area where everybody was saying that there was too much industrial development, the eastern region, which comprises Dublin, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, only 64 per cent of the target had been reached. Therefore, relatively speaking, in terms of the target set for the period the eastern region has been doing least well.</P>
    <P>I have been talking in terms of job approvals and grant commitments.  I am sure Senators and, in particular, Senator West will be anxious that I should talk in terms of firm actual money spent.  In this context I can tell the Seanad that in the period April, 1972, to December, 1974, out of a total overall expenditure by the IDA of £176 million only £30 million was spent in the eastern region.  That represents <Col N="382" /> approximately 17 per cent of the total expenditure, although approximately 34 per cent of the total population are resident in the eastern region.  A statistic was given to me recently which stated that within 15 miles of the GPO there are one-third of the total population and, perhaps this is more important still, half of the children in the State. While I fully agree with the sentiments expressed by Senators in their anxiety to see decentralisation, we must also bear in mind that unemployment exists in Dublin too, that real needs are there and there are people whose talents are not being fully utilised in the Dublin region.  It is important to set one against the other.</P>

      <P>It is fair to point out that the special commitments of the year 1974 totally changed the nature of the statistic.  My figures, which relate to the period 1961-71, differ radically from the figures given by the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is the special nature of the commitment made in 1974 which has had the affect of changing the figures radically if, in fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a matter of being perfectly clear as to the difference that might arise in the minds of a number of Senators.  If you take the decade 1961 to 1971 you will get the difference, for example, between the north west and the east of 4.8 and 19.3 per cent but, if you add in the 1974 specific commitment, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, you will see that the decisions taken in 1974 had a curiously different effect.  It would probably help the Seanad if the Parliamentary Secretary emphasised that the decisions made by the authority in 1974 differ quite radically from the decisions made in the decade 1961 to 1971.  These are being shown now in the figures adopted in the House.</P>

      <P>Of course, the policy of the Government has been one of regional development.  I am merely pointing out in hard statistical terms the implications of this policy and how it has affected the relative performance of <Col N="383" /> the different regions in terms of the targets set for the IDA.  I might come now to something that would be of even greater interest perhaps to Senator Higgins and Senator Killilea, who is unfortunately now absent having made a rather passionate speech in which he sought to extend into the political arena also.  I should like to say something about the west of Ireland.  In the nine months ending December, 1974, in the western region grant commitments made represented £11.7 million as against only £6 million in the whole period from April, 1972, to March, 1974.  That bears out in the case of the western region what Senator Higgins was saying, which is perfectly correct, and disproves conclusively what Senator Killilea was trying to establish.  In the first two years of the regional industrial plans there has been a net increase of 2,200 new manufacturing jobs in the western region.  Twelve new industries were approved by the IDA in the western region in the nine month period from April to the end of 1974 and seven major expansions were approved. Senator Killilea suggested that nothing was done, which was the exact reverse of the facts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> Why is the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; used and not &ldquo;shall&rdquo;?  I thought the whole purpose of the Bill was to give the IDA powers to give grants up to £850,000 without reference to the Government.

      <P>That is the exactly the same wording as the original Act except for the substitution of the new figure.  It is reasonable because in the final analysis the Government must take the responsibility for decisions made by the IDA. It is correct that the Government should have the power, if they see fit, to restrict the IDA's authority at any particular time should some difficult situation arise.  It would not be wise for the legislation to make it mandatory on the Government to delegate such powers to the IDA without any comeback.</P>

      <P>Surely the position as regards the first query raised by Senator Russell is that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; there is referring only to cases where the Government decide that the IDA may give grants exceeding £850,000.  The previous subsection fixes the limit which was £350,000 at £850,000.  That is the limit up to which the IDA may give in a particular case without reference to the Government. The next subsection says that the Government may authorise the IDA in a particular case to exceed the limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, as amended by the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1962, elections to boards of conservators are scheduled to be held every five years <Col N="386" /> but the elections due to take place in October, 1974, were, in accordance with the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1974, postponed to 1975 or such later year as may be fixed by order.  As provided in the Act of 1974 it is now proposed to make an order postponing these elections to 1976.</P>
      <P>It had been my intention to introduce legislation which would improve the constitution of boards of conservators and the system of election of members. However, before introducing amending legislation it was decided to await the final report of the Inland Fisheries Commission which has been examining all aspects of inland fisheries.  It was considered desirable that, if the commission had additional proposals in regard to boards of conservators, consideration should be given to the widening of the proposed legislation to include such proposals.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that the report has now been received.  It is a very exhaustive report and will require very careful study over the next few months. While at this stage I am not in a position to make a statement on the general contents of the report, I can say that it does in fact contain some very important recommendations affecting boards of conservators.  In Dáil Éireann last week the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries paid tribute to the chairman and the members of the commission for the hard work they have put into the task which they have now accomplished.  I would like to be associated with that tribute.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries also expressed appreciation of the work in the conservation and protection of our fisheries which has been accomplished by the Boards of Conservators.  As we know the members of the boards have worked on a voluntary basis and they have given their help and time most readily.  I would like also to record my appreciation of their work.  I look forward to the boards' members continuing in office for a further year, during which time the preparation of the necessary legislation for improved conditions governing boards of conservators will be a matter of priority for my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> I accordingly recommend to the House that a resolution be passed approving of the draft order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to the postponing of this in view of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said. I would join with him in complimenting the Inland Fisheries Commission on the task they have undertaken. This matter of the election of boards of conservators is very important because of the work connected with improving and developing our fisheries.  The Parliamentary Secretary might, perhaps, say something with regard to the Drogheda Board of Conservators being abolished and why they were abolished.</P>
      <P>The work the Parliamentary Secretary is undertaking is important and he is quite right to delay the elections until he has made himself <i>au fait</i> with the recommendations having studied them minutely.  Preservation of our fisheries is tremendously important, not alone because of the amount of money that will flow from them but because of our tourist industry in particular.  In many areas we have a great influx of English, French and German fishermen annually and fisheries are, therefore, a part of our economy we cannot afford to neglect.  While we may offer prizes for the largest pike, salmon and so on we have also to watch the preservation of the different species to ensure our rivers will be stocked.  This ties in with pollution and with anything that might depreciate stocks or ruin the fishing industry <i>in toto</i>.  Consequently this, to us on this side of the House, is a very important exercise and I welcome it wholeheartedly.</P>
      <P>Boards of conservators have had a very difficult task.  It is not a popular board to serve under.  For many years poaching was very prevalent and there was agitation, and rightly so.  Many of our rivers should be handed over to public ownership and compensation paid, if necessary, to ensure they are handed over.  We have a great potential asset so far as fishing is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB own rights to some rivers such as the Boyne and the Erne.  In the case of the Erne, which is a cross-Border river, I am sure there will be <Col N="388" /> close co-operation between the Six Counties and here.  I suggest the Minister should have consultations where a river flows from the Twenty-six Counties into the Six Counties.  It would be much wiser to handle these on a catchment area basis rather than on locations.  A river flowing from the Six Counties into the Twenty-six Counties would carry their industrial waste and <i>vice versa</i>.  I welcome the Order.</P>

      <P>I should like to join my voice to what has been said by Senator Dolan.  What is being proposed is eminently sensible now that the Report of the Inland Fisheries Commission is available.  This report contains proposals is affecting boards of conservators and it seems appropriate that we should defer their reappointment for a year.  I also join with others in paying tribute to those who served on the Inland Fisheries Commission.  I say this as someone who met the commission when they visited Galway.  Their report is a document of great urgency.</P>
      <P>This summer alone in the city in which I live there are quite a number of people who are very seriously concerned about the future of salmon.  There are a number of reasons for this.  The particular circumstances of the very dry year mean the salmon have great difficulty in returning to spawn and it is becoming increasingly important that we have new and imaginative legislation in relation to salmon and trout stock preservation.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary will have courage&mdash; he has shown this before&mdash;in taking some unpopular decisions concerning conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, for example, the absurd position by which it is a State responsibility for the most part to provide for the replacement of stocks while private fisheries do not have stringent legal obligations on them in this respect is unsatisfactory.  The boards of conservators, when they are established, will be dealing with new and amended laws and clearer laws, as against the confusion which has arisen concerning, for example, the question of the responsibility for water levels which, I understand, lies with the Board of Works. <Col N="389" /> Water levels affect the possibility of the salmon going up river.  The responsibility for fisheries needs to be more precisely specified.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am glad to see the Parliamentary Secretary in the Seanad tonight because I know he has taken some unpopular decisions.  It is difficult to make decisions when one is speaking, for example, concerning poaching, pollution and the indiscrimate use of nets. This is something which we will have to face.  We are dealing now with an order postponing the election of boards of conservators and, in our own time, it may well be that there may be no need for such elections because we may have done such damage to fish stocks.  I hope we will see legislation as soon as possible, legislation with real teeth. Such legislation could most appropriately take into community ownership private fisheries.  It is only by matching together the usage of our fishing resources with the responsibility for spawning that we can ensure the future of the species.  Senator Dolan was quite right in his reference.  This work should not only be embarked upon but it should be escalated to the level of a public relations exercise to educate people into a sense of the importance and value of salmon and trout in particular.</P>
    <P>I must confess it is no great pleasure for me to say I do not think I have witnessed in a long time such brutality and savageness as I have witnessed in Galway city this summer.  There has been an indiscriminate butchery of salmon.  This is at a time when we are postponing the election of people who have served well in a voluntary capacity. I look forward to legislation with real teeth and I hope the new boards of conservators will have good statutory instruments to enable them to discharge their duties and deal with the real threats of pollution and other sources of attack on important fish species.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cáit Bean Uí Eachthéirn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in joining with the Senators who have congratulated our boards of conservators who down through the years have acted in a voluntary capacity and have done <Col N="390" /> trojan work.  I think it is proper the elections should be postponed because many years of research have gone into this report on inland fisheries.  The report will need deep study.  As Senator Dolan said, there are many aspects of conservation of salmon and other species in general that need attention, especially from the point of view of pollution.  With more industrialisation and many other problems in the agricultural field, pollution is now much more serious than it was, say, ten or 20 years ago.  This is something that needs very deep discussion.</P>
      <P>Another point that needs study is that our fishing in many areas has changed and I think the beginning and the ending of the season in different areas need to be looked into.  I am speaking from experience in my own area.  What was true about the start of the fishing season in north Kerry ten or 20 years ago has completely changed. Another thing that needs looking into is the question of penalties.  I think the penalties inflicted on those convicted of fishing offences are completely out of line with penalties inflicted for other offences.  If you are convicted of a motor offence your motor car in not confiscated, or if you are convicted of a breach of the licensing law your pub is not confiscated.  That is another aspect of the fishing industry that needs to be changed and seriously investigated and looked into.  I have seen people suffer very heavily.  Not only are they not able to fish for the season because of one minor offence, but they have to suffer the loss of their gear as well.  I hope this will be looked into in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to this motion, but the substantive issue behind it is of tremendous importance and we look forward to receiving the legislation, which the Parliamentary Secretary has promised us, at the earliest possible moment.  In the debate which took place on 24th July, 1974, on the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary said he hoped that before October, 1974 we would be in a position to bring in the legislation which he discussed here before the Houses of the Oireachtas and he said he was awaiting the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission.  This clearly was <Col N="391" /> the right thing to do.  I know various people have tried to get the Commission to produce their report, perhaps a little more speedily than they did.  It is a report of the most tremendous importance. I am one of those people who line up with Senator Higgins here in saying that if we do not tackle this problem now there will not be a problem left to tackle because some of our most important species of fish will disappear.</P>
      <P>I have talked on various occasions about this problem.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary has it in his heart but I also know that we have different views on this problem.  One thing I would say to him and to his Department is that when he and his Department have spent sufficient time digesting and discussing this report, which is their right, they then publish the report before they bring legislation forward to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If we have legislation and we have not seen the report, this completely hamstrings us in not having the background to the problem.  The background is something of serious debate and query.</P>
      <P>The boards of conservators at the moment are really an anachronism.  It is not their fault by any means, the fault lies in the fact that they are directed by legislation which was drawn up in 1848.  In 1848 fishing was a totally different game to what it is now.  The only way you propelled yourself was by means of rowing or sailing.  You had not got these high powered trawlers, motor boats.  The length of net you were able to drag after your boat was pretty short if you were rowing, no matter how many oars you had.  You did not have the facilities which people have for hauling nets, in certain parts of the country, over a mile long. I know that this has happened, and to my mind many of the types of fishing that are going on now are just legalised poaching&mdash;they are within the law.  The boards of conservatives can do nothing about them.  The boards are composed of local people who have got to impose penalties on other local people.  The whole thing has got out of hand altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Higgins has pointed this out, and I will try to back this up with some <Col N="392" /> figures.  If we do not do something very soon, something radical&mdash;and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary takes a radical eye in drawing up this legislation&mdash;then, as far as some species of fish are concerned there will not be a problem.  Certainly the boards of conservatives as they now stand are quite incapable because of the way they are constructed, because of the legislation that governs them drawn up in 1848, because of the commercialisation of the entire fishing industry.  They are just not able to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>In 1961 a total of 319 drift nets killed 218,000 lbs weight of salmon while in 1972 a total of 1,156 drift nets killed 2,350,000 lbs weight.  On another occasion in this House I gave the dreadful comparative figures for spawning in the various rivers&mdash;the number of fish that go through the counters on the rivers in which salmon are counted.  I will just give one or two.  In 1963-64, one river in the north-west had a spawning count of 800; in 1972-73 it was 103. The Derg river had a spawning count in 1963-64 of 2,497; in 1972-73 it was 138.  The Fane river had a spawning count of 2,039; in 1972-73 it was 156. These figures are taken from the Foyle Fisheries Report which is one of the better known cross-border pieces of co-operation between North and South.</P>
    <P>Every fisherman knows the dangers which the salmon and trout species face. Let us be absolutely clear, all this talk of nationalisation of fisheries is not the answer.  Do not let us get the idea that nationalisation will solve the problem because the drift netting which is wrecking the salmon fishing, to my way of thinking, is done in the nationalised parts of our waters.  In other words, it is done outside the river estuaries.  It is done off shore.  It is done in the part of the country that is owned by everybody. That is why, under the legislation which we have, people can get away with what they are getting away with because of the totally inadequate provisions.</P>
    <P>The situation in countries which have really worried about their salmon stocks is that drift netting has been totally abolished.  It is abolished in Britain and it is abolished in Canada.  It cost a great deal of money to abolish it, <Col N="393" /> because, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, and he is perfectly right, there are a large number of people who earn their living from drift netting of salmon.  In those countries they took the big decision and said: &ldquo;If we are to have any salmon left at all we must buy out the people who are earning their living from this.&rdquo;  In the case of the US and Canada it cost many millions of dollars.</P>
    <P>We will have to face decisions of this type if we wish the fish to survive.  The point is that the increase in the number of drift nets is a recent phenomenon. The salmon has a fairly long life cycle. The grilse has a four to six year life cycle, so one does not know for four years after the figures like I have given, 1972, what the situation is to be.  I do some fishing every year.</P>
    <P>I know that a lot of the Members of the House do also.  Some of them may be involved in commercial fishing.  I know that the feeling throughout the country among fishing folk is that if legislation is not introduced in the very near future which gets a real grip on this problem, there will not be any salmon left to fish for.  We are killing the goose that laid the golden eggs. This is why it is essential that this promise the Parliamentary Secretary has given, which I know is a genuine one, be implemented.  It is essential that the report which the Inland Fisheries Commission have taken a long time to produce and which the Parliamentary Secretary says has many radical suggestions&mdash;one hopes regarding the whole of the problems of our inland waters and offshore estuaries&mdash;be digested by the Department and then be published so that the public, and particularly Members of this Parliament, know what is going on, what the authentic figures are, so that we will not have any argument as to whether the salmon is going to survive.</P>
    <P>I have one point of view.  I say that under present legislation, with the present number of drift nets, it has no chance.  The Parliamentary Secretary has a different point of view.  The Inland Fisheries Commission report should separate it and should give us a chance to see exactly what the position is.  I am only looking at the figures that I <Col N="394" /> get from various sources such as the Foyle Fisheries Report, the counts of salmon caught by drift nets, the number of drift net licences issued, the sort of fish caught.  We want a much more comprehensive review, and it is now on the Parliamentary Secretary's table, and when he has digested and decided on the best course and the legislation, I urge him most strongly to publish this report.  Otherwise we and the public will be working totally in the dark.  If that report is not published, when the substantive Bill comes along there will be some pretty hot stuff.  If we do not have it, then we will be working in the dark, and that is not the way a parliament or legislature should work.</P>
    <P>I agree with the postponement of the board of conservator elections.  I hope that the whole idea of local boards will be totally changed.  It is totally anachronistic&mdash;all this legislation is out of date; it comes from 1848.  The field is different now.  We have not many years to act.  Unless we act, and unless the Parliamentary Secretary is imaginative and radical and acts on the findings of the Commission, then many species of fish will not be a problem&mdash;there will just not be any fish.</P>

The talk about the vanishing salmon is just as loose as the talk about the vanishing Irish was.</P>

      <P>I come from an area where there is quite a lot of drift net fishing done.  We see no diminution whatsoever in the numbers of salmon being caught.  This is six years after the coming of drift netting as we know it. Surely there would have been a tremendous depletion of the stock by now <Col N="395" /> if it was having the effect stated.  I categorically state that the measure introduced by the Minister two years ago to restrict the number of licences and the measures brought in more recently to restrict the length and depth of nets have been a success.  They have succeeded in conserving the stock. It is all very well for people like Senator West and some others to tell us the drift netting is ruining our salmon stock. The fact of the matter is, there are 3,000 people engaged in fishing for salmon by this method, and there are at least 3,000 more people in the attached industries such as handling, transport and selling.  Indeed the figure could be much higher.  This is all in the general remote coastal areas.  There is little or no industry in these areas.  The only alternative in many case would be to emigrate.</P>
      <P>I should like to add my voice of appreciation to previous speakers as regards the voluntary work which is being done by the present boards of conservators.  The public may not realise that it is voluntary.  Not alone do they not get paid for the work they have been doing, they do not even get expenses for travelling to the meetings which they attend frequently.  In some cases this entails journeys of 70 or 80 miles and, especially in the high season such as this, for active fishermen to leave their employment and travel to and fro distances of that magnitude is a tremendous sacrifice, and they deserve the highest credit.</P>
      <P>If I were asked why or what is causing damage to our salmon crop I could quite easily tell you.  The answer is twofold: one, poaching and two, pollution.  I have no objection whatsoever to having the election of the conservators postponed for one year, because I am sure it will bring up a more streamlined type of conservator or board of conservators.  At the moment they are grossly under-financed.  This leads to insufficient numbers of waterkeepers, which in turn leads to a tremendous lot of poaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a tremendous lot of poaching going on at the moment.  It must be stopped.  You are not just safeguarding the tourist industry, because you are attracting continentals and Americans <Col N="396" /> who are searching for rod fishing, but you are also protecting the 6,000 people I have already spoken about who are engaged in drift netting.  The poaching is of gigantic proportion and Senator Higgins mentioned earlier that it is frightening in the Corrib and the Moy. We are told from newspaper reports that the gangs engaged in poaching are highly organised and even armed at times.  This must be most intimidating for waterkeepers who are trying to do their job, and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make sure that under the new legislation as a result of the Inland Fisheries Commission report, the conservators will be given sufficient finance and sufficient powers to combat this type of carry on.</P>
    <P>Might I refer to the employees of the boards of conservators, the bailiffs?  It is most unjust that people who have got the ugly and dangerous job, as it is at times, are not given a greater standing, both financially and otherwise.  At the moment all these people are employed only in a temporary capacity.  Their positions are non-pensionable.  Surely for such an onerous task that is not fair?  When they use their own vehicles to patrol, usually late at night or in the small hours of the morning, the expenses they receive are piteously small. I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to try to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to equate the damage poachers do.  I wonder if the boards responsible employed extra bailiffs what would the increase in the flow of spawning salmon be.  It is very hard to do a mathematical equation on that. I imagine that the increase in the flow of salmon would be tremendous.</P>
    <P>Senator West mentioned that certain rivers showed counts which were down by tenfold in some cases in comparison with the previous year.  I should like to draw Senator West's attention to the fact that the main salmon fishing river in the country is the Blackwater.  Last year at the weir at Clondullane there was never such a great number of spawning salmon passing upstream.  The problem mentioned by Senator West could be a localised problem or one caused by the other factor I mentioned, pollution.  It is obvious that fish will not go up a river which is polluted.  I have seen it <Col N="397" /> happen in small tributaries.  I do not know to what extent it occurs and how great the pollution has to be.  I remember the Parliamentary Secretary telling us here last year that he was appointing six officers to the boards of conservators to monitor pollution in the various rivers throughout the country. I would be interested to know the findings of these investigations.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary might make available to public representatives, especially members of county councils, the findings of the people who do the monitoring, because it is often said that local authorities are the greatest polluters. We as elected Members would like to know to what extent pollution is occurring and where it is occurring. Maybe we could help to put a stop to it. We are all concerned to see that pollution is stopped.  One of the greatest bogeys against having it stopped is the fact that the fines which can be imposed by the boards of conservators on industries and on local authorities and individuals who pollute rivers are trivial and do not at all compare with the extent of the damage.  The boards of conservators should be allowed to claim damage at least in accord with standards which apply for other offences.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to stress is that Senator Higgins mentioned that private fisheries are not playing their part in seeing that the hatcheries and fisheries were restocked.  I do not agree with that.  I find that the owners of private fisheries are outstanding citizens. They do a very good job within the resources available to them.  I dread the day when the rivers and lakes are nationalised because we would not get the same dedicated work, interest and the same concern as we are getting at the moment from these people.  I have heard slogans thrown at these people like &ldquo;West Britons&rdquo; and &ldquo;gentry&rdquo;. That is not the point.  Whether they are native Irishmen, anglers or West Britons, they are doing a wonderful job.  I take my hat off to them.</P>

      <P>The elections of conservators seem to be a bit undemocratic. I do not know if you have ever heard this in public previously.  It is a bit like the local election system which you had in Northern Ireland.  It seems to work very well.  For instance if you have a fishing licence for salmon and trout and it is less than £3 you are entitled to one vote.  If it is less than £6 you are entitled to two votes.  If it is more than £6 but less than £10 you are entitled to three votes and if it is more than £10 you are entitled to four votes.  If you own a fishery the valuation of which is greater than £50 you do not have to stand for election at all, you automatically become a member of the board of conservators.  It seems to be undemocratic but it appears to have worked quite well.  Is it the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary to have this type of system abolished?  If the Minister has a fishery which is valued at more than £50 he also is entitled to nominate somebody to the board of conservators.  So he is involved in the whole racket.  There is a lot to be said for it because it automatically means that the owner of a major private fishery is on the board of conservators. As I said previously, these people are invariably outstanding members and their ideas are very sound.</P>
      <P>Finally, I go back to the point which I raised with the Parliamentary Secretary previously&mdash;the discrimination against some of the private fisheries whereby their fishing hours at week-ends are reduced.  I feel the Parliamentary Secretary should revert to the original hours that obtained up to two years ago. In private fisheries such as the Black-water, fishing cannot commence on a Monday until 1 p.m. Elsewhere fishing can commence at 6 a.m.  There is a time differential of seven hours.  Seeing that these are the people who do the restocking of the rivers primarily and who pay fishery rates and provide quite a bit of employment, I feel they should not be penalised in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> In particular, the basis on which this penalisation is based is wrong.  It was assumed that the private fishery owner paid people a fixed wage.  When they fished, everything they caught went to the owner.  If he got £1,000 worth of fish in the week he paid four crewmen £25 each and he himself got £900.  That is fictitious.  In every case that I am aware of the crew members are also working on a share basis.  So they, too, are penalised.  They are at the moment earning a very meagre amount of money.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have that situation revised. I do not know of one case where people are working on a fixed wage.  The premise on which the restriction was brought in is completely incorrect.  I should like to see for the next fishery season of 1976 that the hours be revised to what they were previously.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for agreeing to the motion and for the valuable contributions they have made. Senator Dolan in welcoming the motion referred to the position of the Drogheda board.  The Drogheda board were abolished some time ago and the administrator is now acting as the board.  The position is that the administrator will continue in office for the ensuing year. That position also obtains in so far as Cork is concerned.</P>
      <P>We are all anxious to ensure that our fisheries will be conserved and that legislation will be enacted in the not too distant future that will endeavour to develop our inland and sea fisheries. I have in mind a comprehensive piece of legislation that would cover all aspects of our fisheries whether inland or sea fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senators expressed their appreciation of the members of the commission for the report.  While we were all rather annoyed at the delay in giving us this report, at the same time the Senators will appreciate, as I appreciate, that it is a very bulky document and contains many suggestions and recommendations. So far as the point made by Senator West is concerned regarding the publication of this report, I fully support that view.  I know from experience <Col N="400" /> that reports from some commissions have never seen the light of day. This report should be submitted to the Government, as is the usual procedure.</P>
    <P>Knowing the government's viewpoint on open Government, I cannot visualise the position obtaining whereby there would be any objections.  If that is the case, it will have my support and recommendation.  This report will soon be in the hands of Senators and Deputies who will have an opportunity of perusing it and making any recommendations or suggestions to the Department, even ahead of the legislation that will follow.  On that comprehensive measure I would appreciate any recommendations or suggestions that can be examined and scrutinised in conjunction with the recommendations embodied in this report.</P>
    <P>The fisheries question is big and wide enough to get everybody involved&mdash;the fishermen, the processors, the tourist trade, hoteliers and others who are naturally interested in our fisheries&mdash;to give their reports and recommendations.  When such reports and recommendations are available in the Department, they will be scrutinised closely and diligently by departmental officers, by the Minister, myself and other interested bodies, such as BIM. I am hopeful that after some time&mdash; though it is difficult to specify a time because there is need for exhaustive examination of all the recommendations that will be made&mdash;I will be in a position to bring before the Houses of the Oireachtas a comprehensive Bill dealing with our fisheries generally.  The Members of both Houses will then have an opportunity of expressing their views and making recommendations by way of amendments if they feel justified in doing so.</P>
    <P>There is no political element in fisheries.  Therefore, we could introduce legislation that would be different from other measures to be brought before the Houses.  If there are amendments which, on examination in the Department, are found to be feasible and justifiable, irrespective of what side of the House they come from, we can change the measure to embody such recommendations.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins and others expressed concern about conservation of our <Col N="401" /> salmon stocks.  They feel annoyed that our present conservation measures are inadequate and as a result, to use their own phrases, we will have nothing to discuss or conserve in the not too distant future unless urgent action is taken now.  The urgent action which both Senator Higgins and Senator West have in mind is the abolition of the drift net system.  As I mentioned previously, the question of fish netting is a very big one on which opinion in the House is divided.  A number of Senators on all sides of the House feel that we should be more liberal so far as the criteria set down for qualification for drift nets is concerned.  On the other hand, we have the ultra-conservative view that we should do away with fish netting and abolish the system completely if we are to have salmon in our rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>I have to take all suggestions into account and have them examined on their merits.  That is what we did on assuming office in 1973.  We liberalised the systems available for drift nets for the reasons stated here by Senator Deasy.  We are aware that a number of our people&mdash;Senator Deasy gave a figure of 3,000 around the coast&mdash;are dependent on salmon fishing for their livelihood.  That figure is approximate, 950 or 960 multiplied by three, rounded to 3,000.  That may seem a small number. Some people may ask why we should change the system for the sake of helping 3,000 out of a population of three million.  But my view is that every citizen is entitled to have his case examined closely and carefully before any decision contrary to his interests is made.  I felt that having examined it closely and carefully we could set down rather rigid criteria to qualify for a drift net licence.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the administrators in the Cork and Drogheda areas and the boards in the 15 other divisions examined all applications on their merits.  I would like to express my thanks to all concerned for the manner in which they determined the applications, because the information available to me is that the boards and administrators did, so far as they humanly could, make a fair and impartial assessment of the different applications.  Naturally many applicants are disappointed.  This <Col N="402" /> year, for instance, it is quite possible that in some districts qualified applicants failed to secure a licence because the boards were restricted to the number of licences granted last year and that number could not be increased this year.</P>
    <P>The concern of Senator West and Senator Higgins is a little beyond the marks of reality.  Here is what is happening.  I am not an expert by any manner of means but this is the position: an interim report of the Commission in 1971 indicated a need for conservation.  In that year 3.3 million pounds in weight of salmon was taken in our lakes, sea and rivers.  If that kind of fishing were to be continued, stocks would disappear.  It rose in 1972 to 3.7 million pounds, in 1973 to 4.0 million pounds and in 1974 to 4.3 million pounds.  In other words, catches are increasing steadily.  I have no figures for 1975 because the season has not closed yet but from the reports available there is likely to be a further increase.</P>
    <P>In 1974, 4.3 million pounds weight of salmon was caught.  Between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of that was taken by drift nets and draft nets.  The average price paid to the fishermen may be around 60p per pound.  That is a sizable sum, approximately £2½ million to £2¾ million.  The question facing the Department is, do we stop that?  If we do, what guarantee have we that stocks will be maintained, because there is great variation of opinion so far as the habits of salmon are concerned.  Will they come up the rivers to be caught by the tourists or the local anglers, or will they move away to some other country, to be caught in Greenland or some other place?  That is the type of question we must ask ourselves.</P>
    <P>While I have the greatest respect for scientific officers attached to the Department and private people who are well qualified and who have offered their opinions and suggestions, so far as dealing with salmon and their habits, and what happens if they are not caught, there is nobody capable of offering an opinion which could be deemed to be infallible.  What we are doing now is keeping a close examination on the position, because conservation is uppermost in our minds.  If we were satisfied that the policy we were <Col N="403" /> pursuing would lead to the reduction of our stocks, appropriate action would be taken.  It is not necessary to take up the time of Senators further on that point other than to say that this clash of opinion exists and we have adopted this course of granting from 900 to 1,000 drift net licences and a number of draft nets and that can be reviewed at any time.  The information to date indicates that that position is likely to continue for 1976.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator West, Senator Higgins and Senator Deasy who referred strongly to poaching and the indiscriminate use of nets.  From all the reports available, and even from the comments of Senators here, poaching seems to be widespread throughout the country.  I have made it quite clear, so far as the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are concerned, that we are giving every help possible to the boards to ensure that poaching will be reduced as much as possible, and we are giving every help to the people employed by the boards&mdash;the inspectors and water keepers&mdash;to achieve that objective.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the position is not good in some areas.  My friend Senator Higgins painted a rather gloomy picture of what is happening in Galway.  This brings one to the view that the present system of protection may be inadequate. I do not think this is the time to move into that because this is not a farreaching motion.  That is one of the items that will be examined.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy for the water keepers.  They are working in their own immediate locality.  They have a very difficult job, different to our Garda Siochána who are working in outside areas.  If they do their job conscientiously they have to go out and catch any of their neighbours, relatives or friends who are engaged in illegal fishing.  That is something that possibly we will have to review when the time comes.  Senator Deasy said that water keepers are receiving niggardly treatment by the Department.  There could be some truth in that statement, if it had been made two years ago.  Since this Government took office we have tried to improve the status of the water keepers certainly we have improved <Col N="404" /> their financial position reasonably.  I agree there is room for further improvement, but at the same time we are not unmindful of their task.  The review of this question is an on-going process.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins touched on another point with which Senator West and Senator Deasy disagreed, that is, the community ownership of our fisheries. I held a personal view down through the years which has not changed.  I felt there would be more respect for our fishery laws if we could acquire private fisheries on a compensatory basis, and possibly on a phased out system.  This cannot be done overnight.  Some people feel, possibly without justification, that poaching on private preserves is not in conflict with the law.  They feel that these fisheries were taken from the people years ago, and even though they may have changed ownership since, the time is at hand to examine whether there should be a change made in that direction.  My view is that the time will arrive sometime, when each citizen will have the right to fish where and whenever he likes, provided he complies with the regulations stipulated by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This will prove to our advantage.</P>
    <P>Mention was made about the Erne. I wish to inform Senator Dolan that a joint protection committee, between the South and the North, exists to plan management policy for the Erne.</P>

      <P>The other point made concerned pollution officers.  They have taken up duty and are working in collaboration with the inspectors of the board of conservators.  They have investigated stretches of many rivers and have consulted with farmers and others about pollution.  They report to the board of conservators and the information received in the Department is that they are performing a worthwhile job.  In the not too distant future, we may be in a position to analyse their work in detail and possibly increase their numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> I appreciate the Seanad's interest in the preservation of our fish stocks and the development of our fisheries.  I also appreciate the way the Seanad have received this motion.  Everybody agreed it was right to have this deferment motion.  It may take some time to prepare the comprehensive legislation we have in mind.  I hope no Senator will be slow to make any recommendation, because I give the Seanad the assurance&mdash; as I have given other organisations&mdash; that all recommendations will be examined. We want everybody to be involved in drafting this legislation.  If we get 50 suggestions and two or three can be <Col N="406" /> embodied in the legislation, it will be a worthwhile job.  We want to give people an opportunity of having a say in this legislation before it is presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas and I hope this legislation will help people make recommendations.  I thank the Seanad for the manner in which they have dealt with the legislation.</P>
