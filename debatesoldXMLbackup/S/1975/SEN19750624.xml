      <P>I should like to raise a point of order before we embark on any discussion on the Order of Business. The difficulty of taking the Report Stage of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1975, is that only this morning did we get the last Official Report of the Committee Stage discussion on this Bill.  This means that all the sections, after section 6, were available in report form only this morning.  This has made it difficulty, and in some cases impossible, to consider amendments for the later sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came back from Luxembourg this morning and had a rapid look at that report and find that there are at least four cases where the Minister agreed to consider points I made on some of the later technical sections and on matters on which I certainly would have drafted amendments had the report been available to me.  This raises a difficulty.  I should explain that I am not in any sense criticising the manner in which the Cathaoirleach has exercised his functions in regard to the production of the Official Reports.  I accept that there is a very serious problem at the moment with the long hours of sitting being undertaken by both Houses, and that a delay can arise.  I am not discussing the nature of the delay but simply the results of it, which in this case make it very difficult to consider this Bill.  So far as I am concerned, I would be perfectly happy to continue the Report Stage up to and including section 13 or even, perhaps, section 16. <Col N="1266" /> It is very difficult to discuss the later sections in the absence of the report which has made it impossible to put down amendments.</P>

      <P>The point of order related to the conduct of today's business.  The Chair fails to see how there is a point of order involved.  It is a matter for the House to decide whether to take No. 1 today.  In regard to the question of the production of reports and the tabling of amendments, it is hard to see a specific point of order which could now be determined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect, a Chathaoirleach, since the Chair, under Standing Orders is specifically put in charge of the production of the Official Report, it seems that the Chair also should have some responsibility as to what happens when the Official Report, for whatever reason&mdash;and I accept that there are reasons&mdash;is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The submission is correct.  The Chair is in charge of the production of the reports.  Equally when there has been a regrettable delay, as there has been in this case, the Chair would be entitled to take steps.  If it did not inconvenience any of those concerned, for example the discretion of the Chair in regard to the late reception of amendments would be exercised in view of the circumstances.  But the Chair can hardly disallow the question &ldquo;That No. 1 be part of the Order of Business today&rdquo; on the grounds of the late reception of debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, we are not objecting to the taking of No. 1, but I would be glad if it were possible to continue to, say, section 16 and stop there, or at the very least, if all concerned would agree to accept, if I can get them drafted in time, which is doubtful, some very late amendments from me.  There are at least four amendments which I would like to have made but I found it impossible in the <Col N="1267" /> absence of the report.  Is there any possibility that the Government would agree to stop the Report Stage, say, after section 16?</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House when it is proposed to give time for the Second Reading debate of No. 6 on the Order Paper&mdash;Family Planning Bill, 1974. I appreciate that the Seanad has been meeting very frequently and that we have a heavy amount of business before the summer.  The proposers of this Bill are very anxious to have a debate on it. The Bill was given a First Reading before Christmas and has been available to Members of this House for examination.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of very great public importance.  It is a matter of basic human rights and freedoms.  Anybody who attends a meeting in which women are gathered together to discuss International Women's Year will know it is a key issue.  They want a change in the law in relation to family planning and there can be no doubt about that.  It is now, in my submission, a majority view.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is tending to argue the merits.  She should confine herself to the question of whether it is to be taken as part of today's Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader of the House for an indication of when the debate might be taken.  The point I was trying to stress is the urgency of the subject matter and, despite the fact that there is a heavy programme, which I concede, that it is important to give time to a debate on this Bill before the Summer Recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point raised by the Senator in so far as the Order of Business goes is in connection with the Family Planning Bill.  It is not possible to be definite about this.  I understand so far as the Government are concerned, that the Tánaiste will be <Col N="1268" /> sitting in and handling the discussion. I cannot say off-hand when he might be available.  At the moment there is a considerable amount of Government business to be cleared before the Summer Recess.  As far as I am concerned, if there is time and the Tánaiste is available, we can go ahead with the discussion at any time.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we take up consideration on the Report Stage of this Bill, I should like to indicate that I have ruled that amendment No. 6, standing in the names of Senators Yeats and Lenihan, is out of order on the ground that it has the same effect as an amendment rejected on Committee Stage.  The Senators have been notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>I also remind Senators that on Report Stage each contributor is confined to a single speech with the exception of the mover of an amendment, who has the right to conclude the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 14, to delete &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a matter I raised on Committee Stage in a different form but with the same general effect.  My amendment now seeks to delete the word &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo; from the third definition in section 1.  By including this word the Minister is unnecessarily limiting himself. We do not approve of the procedure he is adopting with regard to rebroadcasts.  I ask the Minister to consider what I am saying about this rather than what he may think are my motives.  There is a valid point to be made in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is being given the power to direct the Authority to rebroadcast BBC 1, or UTV in its entirety.  The word &ldquo;rebroadcast&rdquo; according to section 1 <Col N="1269" /> means a simultaneous rebroadcast.  This is very limiting.  In the event of there being a difference in time between Ireland and England, the programmes that had formerly been at peak hours would have changed their times.  Deleting this word does not mean that the rebroadcast will not be simultaneous. It means that the Minister has the power to authorise the variation of perhaps an hour in the case of a change of time in the rebroadcast of all or some of these programmes.  This can be simply done by the mere recording of the programmes and rebroadcasting them an hour later.</P>
    <P>It is not merely that these BBC broadcasts could be rebroadcast here at inconvenient times for the Irish public, but this would upset the whole programming of RTE.  One assumes that if the BBC are to be broadcast under the provisions of section 6, programmes on the existing RTE 1 would have to be geared to this.  They will have to have regard to what programmes will come over on our second channel in framing their own programmes.  This would mean that not only would there be a difference of an hour, in the case of a change of time, with the whole BBC broadcast but that the RTE broadcasts would have to be altered also in order to fit in.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not give an adequate reply on Committee Stage to the point I made then.  When I asked him why he wanted to have the word &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo; in, he said at Volume 81, column 452, of the Seanad Report:</P>
    <P>Because that is what I want and that is what the people as I believe, of the single-channel area want&mdash; simultaneous rebroadcasting to get the degree of simultaneity which viewers in the multi-channel area are already getting.</P>
    <P>At column 458 he states:</P>
    <P>If there is a rebroadcast of a live programme, for example, under the definition as it stands in the Bill, and if Senator Yeats's position were to be adopted and the Minister were accordingly to order a rebroadcast an hour later, the Irish viewer is not getting the live broadcast the English viewer is getting.  There is a clear <Col N="1270" /> distinction.  They are two different things.  One is a simultaneous broadcast; the other is not.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Irish viewer in most cases would not be getting a live broadcast&mdash;he would be getting a broadcast which had been already recorded.  Whether you see a recorded broadcast at the same time as someone in Birmingham or Dublin or an hour later, does not appear to be of fundamental importance.  What appears to be of rather more importance is that the programmes should be geared to the needs of the viewers.</P>
    <P>The deletion of this word &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo; does not in any way mean that there would be a change in the actual time of broadcasting.  One could imagine, for example, with a football match or perhaps a horse race, that such programmes might always be simultaneous.  Equally, programmes in the evening which were recorded in any event, could well be shown an hour earlier, if there was a difference in time between Ireland and Britain.  The deletion of the word does not mean that these things will happen.  It merely means that the Minister is given the power, if he sees fit, to see that they will happen.  It will give him a slight element of flexibility which he is withdrawing from himself by means of his definition. In his own interests, I suggest he accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment because I believe it would create a more flexible situation.  At the same time, I would like to support it because it is necessary at this stage on the debate on the Broadcasting Bill to clarify exactly what we are talking about.  Senators do not like to legislate in the dark, and I submit that in relation to this Bill that is what we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were references in the press and at a seminar organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to a letter sent by the BBC in which there was a <Col N="1271" /> commitment not to engage in an agreement for simultaneous rebroadcasting of BBC programmes, if there was union objection in this country. The Director-General of RTE refused to comment on this matter and, I think, the Minister owes it to this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is wide of the amendment.  The net point in regard to the amendment is the question of simultaneity, not the principle of rebroadcasting <i>in toto.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that I am not straying wide of the point.  The question is whether this House should be considering the question of simultaneous rebroadcasting, if it is not a reality.  I do not think we should be legislating in the dark.  We should not be considering something where behind scenes there is correspondence indicating that it will not happen.  We will look very foolish at the end of the day if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is concerned because what the Senator has been saying would appear to be far more appropriate to the discussion of the section on Committee Stage.  The fact that later information becomes available after the Committee Stage debate closes cannot justify it being raised on an amendment on Report Stage if it does not fall within the narrow constraints of that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit it is surely open to a House of the Oireachtas when a Bill is being debated to be aware of the factual situation.  The net issue in this amendment submitted at Report Stage by Senators Yeats and Lenihan is to remove the word &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo;. I submit that the word &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo; should not be there if it is not, in fact, possible, in practical terms for the Minister to direct the Authority to rebroadcast, in the sense of simultaneous rebroadcasting of programmes from another organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's argument would apply to every word in the section.  The argument would indicate that if the Minister cannot do this <Col N="1272" /> because of certain constraints, then every word in the section serves no purpose.  The Chair is very concerned that the debate on Report Stage should be confined to the actual amendments which have been tabled for Report Stage</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for his indulgence.  I should like to ask, given the controversy over the weekend, and the fact that the amendment before us would delete the word &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo; in the definition section, whether the Minister is confident that if this Bill were to become law he could enter into a binding arrangement with a foreign broadcasting channel to rebroadcast, in the sense of rebroadcasting simultaneously, a broadcasting service in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate Senator Yeats's work on this Bill&mdash; he has done a great deal to improve it in my opinion&mdash;I am not in a position to accept his amendment here, because in my view simultaneity is central to the concept of rebroadcasting.  Deletion of the word &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo; from the definition of &ldquo;rebroadcast&rdquo; in section 1 would involve introducing a new interpretation of &ldquo;rebroadcasting&rdquo; which would be at variance with the generally accepted meaning of the word.  The definition of rebroadcasting in this Bill is on exactly the same lines as that contained in our own Performers Protection Act, 1968.  It is also almost identical with the definition of &ldquo;rebroadcasting&rdquo; contained in the 1961 Convention, that is, the International Convention concerning the protection of performers, producers of phonograms and broadcasters.</P>
      <P>As regards the question raised by Senator Robinson, first of all, I apologise for my own intervention, which I appreciate may have been considered irrelevant and I am sure there was no intention, either on the part of Senator Robinson or myself, of conspiracy against the Chair.  The point she raised is relevant to simultaneous rebroadcasting and she has, I think, rightly raised it briefly here.  She asked whether I am confident that I can do this thing. Yes I am, provided that the people in the single-channel area, in particular the people generally, really want this, and make their wishes known.</P>
      <P>It is true that since the Seanad considered this Bill in Committee, the BBC have indicated in public statements that they would not be prepared, in the words of one spokesman, &ldquo;to ride roughshod over the Irish unions&rdquo; and that in effect so long as certain major unions, notably the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, oppose live rebroadcasting of BBC 1, the BBC could not conclude an agreement for such rebroadcasting.  I am aware that that is the position of the BBC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully agree that the BBC cannot be expected to ride roughshod over the Irish unions&mdash;and indeed it could not do so even if it wished&mdash;neither has this Government any intention of acting in such a manner.  It follows that if the <Col N="1274" /> trade unions decide to do so they can in effect exert a veto over the live rebroadcasting of BBC 1 from Northern Ireland or of any other outside channel.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that, in view of this situation, the whole issue is a dead one since rebroadcasting is impossible. That would be the case on the assumption that there are no possible circumstances which could induce the trade unions to reconsider their position. I do not accept that this assumption is necessarily valid.  I believe that if it became clear that there was a strong preference in the single-channel area for direct access to BBC 1, or UTV, or other outside channels, then our trade unions, a substantial part of whose members live in that area, and some of them sit in this House, would necessarily, for good democratic reasons, review their position. That would be the sensible thing for them to do and I believe they would do it.  At the recent Conference of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union at Wexford it was quite clear that there was a considerable amount of support among the delegates present in favour of access to BBC1.  I was aware of that from responses to my own statement to the union and I have seen transcripts of contributions made to the debate later in which a number of delegates spoke quite strongly in favour of their concept.</P>
    <P>It remains therefore important to consult with the people, especially in the single-channel area, to lay the issues before them, to let them hear and consider all points of view and to find out what they want.  When what they want becomes clear I do not think any significant organised group is likely to stand in its way.  I have already made clear that if viewers in the single-channel area are clearly convinced by RTE's advocacy of a second channel under its control, then I shall be happy to proceed along those lines.  Similarly I believe that if a clear preference for access to BBC 1 or other simultaneous live channel should emerge, neither the trade unions nor RTE would be likely to adopt an intransigent position.  I believe that has already been said on behalf of RTE, I think by Mr. Louis MacRedmond.</P>
    <P>The trade unions would of course <Col N="1275" /> have to be satisfied that live rebroadcasting would not be likely to have adverse effects on the livelihoods of their members.  I have already quoted in the Seanad from the statement which I made at Wexford in this matter outlining the reasons why rebroadcasting should have less effect on the livelihoods of broadcasting workers than the advent of the cable television systems which many of them now enjoy.  Apart from the security of employment aspect there is, however, the question of what kind of television choice is advocated by broadcasting workers.</P>
    <P>Obviously broadcasting workers will have strong views, and they have been energetically putting them across, as they have the right to do and as I have encouraged them to do.  But do they wish to exert the power, which they undoubtedly have, to decide this issue for the people of the single-channel area?</P>
    <P>Mr. John Carroll, Vice-President of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, on Friday the 20th June, faced up to some of these two issues when he spoke at the Seminar which Senator Robinson referred to, run by the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, entitled &ldquo;Towards a Broadcasting Policy&rdquo;.  He then rightly said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>no section of the Irish community denies or challenges the right of the employees of RTE to protect their jobs and their livelihood, more especially in times of economic depression, and there is surely nobody in our community who would expect RTE employees to sit back and refrain from asking essential questions about the effects of the terms of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill 1975 on their employment.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with that.  Mr. Carroll also said:</P>
    <P>There is no question of any clique within RTE wanting to impose a style of broadcasting on the public at large.  Any effort in that regard would be doomed to failure and we, representing not alone RTE employees but 150,000 workers throughout the <Col N="1276" /> country, who are also listeners and viewers, would strongly oppose such an effort.  But RTE employees have an advantage over the rest of us, in that they are more appreciative of the technical and financial issues involved in broadcasting policy and they can help all of us, by articulating points of view, to come to more objective conclusions about the future of our broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>Here again I agree.  I think the major unions will want to abide by the wishes of the single-channel area in this matter, provided they have had the chance to put their arguments across and provided the interests of their members are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>I would like trade unionists to share the platform with me and Members of the Opposition at a meeting in Limerick on this subject, which is being planned for early July and at which I hope the Mayor will take the chair.  At this meeting and at others, which I hope will follow, RTE, the unions and the Opposition can put forward their concept of how an RTE 2, selecting the best programmes, could be more attractive than the rebroadcasting of BBC 1 live and in full.  It is not enough to expect RTE 2 to be chosen by default, if the only obstacle to BBC 1 (Northern Ireland) is a say-so of a major Irish trade union.  That say-so would be decisive, but it might not be the best augury for the future of the second channel.  The people of the single-channel area will have to be convinced of the positive programming advantages which a selection of the best British, American, Canadian and Australian programmes would have over the direct relay of what broadcasters themselves see as a very popular channel, whose programmes they see described every day in their newspapers.  That is the answer to the Senator.  I am confident that this can happen and if the people of the single-channel area in particular clearly indicate that it is their wish I do not believe then that anyone will stand in their way.</P>
    <P>I apologise once more to the Chair for having dealt with this now, but I felt that it would be helpful to the Seanad and to the public to answer the question which the Senator raised.</P>

      <P>The Minister has shown just now the absence of what he called for in his opening speech, namely an open mind.  The purpose of the amendment here to delete &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo; is precisely for the reason that the reality of the matter now appears to be that a simultaneous broadcast by the Authority as specified in section I is just not on.  I would like the Minister to Answer a specific question.  It is a very legitimate question.  It relates to at what stage, if at all, any discussions or negotiations have taken place with the BBC about the feasibility of simultaneous rebroadcasting.  Leaving aside the question of the unions involved-by the way <i>en passant</i> I am very glad that the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union took a lead in having a seminar over the weekend on this matter&mdash;is it on in any event? Have discussions taken place with the BBC Authority on the nitty-gritty of this matter?</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to recognise the fact that simultaneous broadcasting in its entirety by the BBC here is first of all not on because BBC have given no indication that any such discussions have taken place.  In fact, any spokesman for the BBC who has spoken on this matter has adopted, to put it mildly, an evasive attitude and has made it clear that if there is any trade union trouble in the matter it is not on. That was certainly the gist of what the spokesman for the BBC said over the weekend.  Why is this whole issue being raised and fanned by the Minister? Is he not deluding the people in the single-channel area into a belief that this is on <Col N="1278" /> when, in fact, a great weight of people throughout the country, both leader writers and newspapers in the single-channel area, are now convinced of the validity of the remarks made in this Seanad and endorsed indeed at the Irish Transport Union seminar over the weekend.  All the arguments in the Seanad were almost word for word spelt out under the heading of <i>The Subtle Imperialism.</i>  They were arguments made by Dr. Tapio Varis who was quoted here by Senator Halligan, as a leading world expert on the whole question of television technology and its influence.  I quote from him:</P>
      <P>I am very firmly of the opinion that the media should always be seen as an instrument of political objectives, which is why the unbalanced flow of information, impressions and sociology is a serious matter.  We should see clearly that the media has a social role and that anything that has to do with a social change is essentially political.</P>
      <P>He also says:</P>
      <P>... the fact that the free flow of information is a one-way flow from the Anglo-American commercial powers is a critical problem ...</P>
      <P>He believes it must be faced at national and international level.  This is precisely the point which I made and which the Minister disputed but subsequently agreed on Committee Stage that I was right.  I said then, and I repeat, that no independent State in the world allows the simultaneous broadcasting in its entirety of the broadcast issuing for a neighbouring State service.</P>

      <P>The fact of the matter is that certain countries allow private independent television stations in their country by way of licence, agreement or otherwise, but no country in the world allows the simultaneous broadcasting of a neighbouring power emanating from the neighbouring State service into its country on its own wavelengths.  I would like the Minister to elaborate on whether or not the specific paragraph to that effect, in the RTE Authority Report is right or wrong.  It is a very specific statement issued by the Minister's own Authority, which I mentioned on Committee Stage in justification of what I said on Second Stage, and the Minister apologised to me here on Committee Stage in relation toit.</P>
      <P>I feel that this is a most basic matter which indeed was the whole genesis of what Dr. Varis had to say over the weekend.  It is a matter on which I feel very strongly that Dr. Varis is completely right.  It is the basic political issue as to the control that should be exercised by a State over its own television service and with regard to the wavelengths operating in each national State.  Dr. Varis continued to emphasise that the most vulnerable countries in the world were the countries that were subjected to what he called Anglo-American cultural imperialism because the various Anglo-American agencies have specialised in the presentation and transmission of news in every form, and particularly since the war, in regard to the presentation and transmission of television news.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Minister to what I referred to on Committee Stage of this debate, namely, the RTE Authority statement.  Paragraph 6 of that report states:</P>
      <P>No other country in the world has concluded that a second television service in that country should take the form of the rebroadcast <i>in toto</i> of one of the services of a neighbouring country ...</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair and the Senator.  The RTE Authority did say that no country had handed over their second channel to a foreign programme. That statement is strictly true but slightly misleading because in Italy where there are already two national programmes rebroadcasting of foreign programmes has been approved by Act of Parliament.  But of course that is not a second channel, it is a third one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point.  In the Italian situation there is mixed State and independent television.  In Ireland we have one State channel and the RTE Authority say that in that situation no other country in the world has allowed a second television service to be taken in the form of rebroadcast of another country's service <i>in toto.</i>  That is related exactly to the point here of simultaneous rebroadcasting.  It is the reason this amendment has been put down.</P>
      <P>In addition to the point made by Senator Yeats, we feel that simultaneous broadcasting by the Authority of another broadcasting organisation in effect is rebroadcasting <i>in toto</i> another country's television service on a second channel already controlled by this country.  No independent state in the world has done this.  I hope I have clarified my point because this was precisely the point&mdash;I was very glad to see it made&mdash;made by Dr. Tapio Varis at the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union conference over the weekend.  His central theme was that no country should allow or make a political decision to allow the unbalanced free flow of information, impressions and ideology.  He regarded that as a serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we advanced here and what we said last week in a statement is that however this second channel is monitored&mdash;whether <Col N="1281" /> it is monitored by RTE, or by an advisory committee, commission or body in the single-channel area from Limerick, Cork or Galway, being the three main centres in the present single-channel area&mdash;by working in conjunction with RTE some system could be devised of complementary programmes which would include the best programmes from the BBC, UTV, ITV, European, Australian or American programmes.  If there is existing in the single-channel area a view that RTE by reason of the manner of presentation in the present single-channel are not a suitable authority to run the second channel along with the first channel, then my view is that the Minister should adopt some other means.  The Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting last week suggested that if the Minister's view is that he does not want to have the people in the single-channel area organised by RTE, it may be a valid and legitimate point.  Then let us have some body in the present single-channel area with studios in Cork, Limerick or Galway, with certain statutory powers and functions to ensure that a proper second channel is orientated in so far as they are concerned. That, at least, would be a constructive suggestion.</P>
    <P>What I and Dr. Varis objected to strongly over the weekend is the handing over holus-bolus to a simultaneous broadcast <i>in toto</i> from the BBC on our alternative second channel.  I do not mind how the Minister devises the control that should operate within this State, whether it is done directly by the RTE Authority, by some other body competing against the RTE Authority in Ireland or by a single-channel authority, body, council or committee. I do not mind how the Minister applies his mind to the situation as long as it is as it is&mdash;a body based in Ireland, There are various ways of doing it.  It can be second channel RTE controlled rebroadcast; it can be done by way of a competing State body, it can be done by way of the single-channel itself having an authority based in some of the major centres of population in the single-channel area with studios equipped in that major sector and with an authority composed of people who live in that single-channel area.  They could work <Col N="1282" /> within some overall umbrella that would ensure that there would be a reasonable degree of complementarity between the two programmes and that they would not be pursuing the idle exercise of competing pop programme for pop programme as happens in Britain between BBC I and ITV.  Britain can afford it by reason of the huge market outlet in relation to the viewers which are in tremendous number as compared with Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should like to come back to the principle of this amendment.  It is embodied in the phrase &ldquo;simultaneous broadcast.&rdquo;  Simultaneous broadcast as written in there envisages a broadcast from an outside source.  I am not objecting to a degree of simultaneity. There will be a high degree of simultaneity in the second channel broadcasting. While acknowledging that fact, the definition as incorporated in the Minister's Bill means simultaneous braodcasting <i>in toto.</i>  Rebroadcast means the simultaneous broadcast by the authority of a broadcast of another broadcasting organisation.</P>
    <P>If there is a flexible approach by the alternative Irish authority or by RTE running the second channel there will be a high degree of simultaneous rebroadcasting. I object to that rebroadcasting being automatic, operating in its entirety and being a simple matter of retransmitting simultaneously and in toto the broadcasting system of another State.  That is what is envisaged in the Minister's definition and that is why we are seeking to delete the adjective &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo; so as to ensure that there is a flexible approach to the matter and that in the alternative channel organised in one of the various ways I have mentioned to the Minister there will be&mdash;decided by Irishmen and women&mdash;a mix between what is best in a number of other channels.  Some of this will involve simultaneous rebroadcasting from the BBC or some other station but merged in with that there will be other rebroadcasts, not necessarily simultaneous.  In that broad flexible approach an Irish authority, composed as the Minister wishes, will ensure that there will be Irish monitoring of the rebroadcasting system and that Irish decisions will be made as to how, when and in what manner the <Col N="1283" /> presentation should be made, whether it be simultaneous or otherwise, whether it be BBC 1, BBC 2, UTV, French, Australian or American television.  All this should be a matter to be decided by an Irish authority&mdash;whether it be RTE, a single-channel authority, a Cork, Galway or Limerick authority, or a totally separate type or organisation&mdash; as long as the Minister under this piece of legislation leaves himself open to ensure that Irish people are in the last analysis to decide on the ultimate programme.</P>
    <P>It is on this basis that anyone who reads the excellent summary in today's <i>Irish Times</i> in the news feature of the seminar over the weekend can see for himself or herself that the whole tenor of the seminar, and in particular of the visiting speaker Dr. Varis, was exactly on all fours with the views expressed here right through the various stages of the debate by a number of Senators. That is why I ask the Minister to accept this amendment in that it will make his approach to the matter far more flexible in the coming months ahead. The Minister has stated that he is receptive to public opinion and the views that will be expressed in this matter, I accept what he says is true, but then he should have as flexible an instrument as possible in this statute. Defining &ldquo;rebroadcasting&rdquo; as meaning the simultaneous broadcast by the Authority of a broadcast from another broadcasting organisation is restricting him in exercising this flexibility of which I speak because it means that if there is any rebroadcasting it shall be simultaneous rebroadcasting.  I would envisage that if the flexibility of approach on the part of an Irish Authority in the matter of the second channel were to be expressed in practical administrative action it would mean on some occasions a simultaneous element would not be included and that one might not necessarily on all occasions have simultaneous broadcasting. One might not be able to fit into every programme throughout the evening or the week simultaneous rebroadcasting at all stages.  There might be situations where the simultaneous rebroadcasting would be totally unnecessary <Col N="1284" /> as far as Irish situations were concerned.  It might be necessary in that case to have a programme that was not simultaneous incorporated into the rebroadcasting programme taking place. That might be part of the monitoring that would be done by whatever Irish authority would be established, so that there might be a mix between simultaneous programmes and other programmes. It would be a matter for planning and for working out by whatever authority the Minister might establish, whether RTE or some other authority along the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>The deletion of the word &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo; frees the Minister and puts him in a position to make far more flexible decisions in this matter.  In particular it would enable whatever body the Minister might establish to monitor the second channel.  The fundamental message that we got from the leading telecommunications expert in the world, Dr. Varis, was that to think of a State in the modern age handing over its own airwaves <i>in toto</i> to another State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Chair is getting very troubled.  The Senator is speaking at great length.  He is again returning to this question of <i>in toto</i> which is certainly not in the amendment before the House.  The amendment deals with simultaneity and the Chair has indulged the Leader of the Opposition, as he indulged other persons previously in the debate.  I would ask the Senator not to travel again ground that he has already travelled in this contribution.</P>

      <P>Before I finish I should like to emphasise the point that the insertion of simultaneity here means inevitably rebroadcasting <i>in toto.</i>  Rebroadcasting <i>in toto</i> means including everything in the.  BBC programme right to <i>God Save the Queen</i> at the end. That is what is meant by simultaneous rebroadcasting of BBC 1.  The principle of simultaneous rebroadcasting involves <i>in toto</i> rebroadcasting.  This was the message from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union seminar at the weekend and in particular it is applicable to Ireland which is a small State. <Col N="1285" /> As I said already, Ireland is a small State in the middle of the Anglo-American cultural empire.  We are unquestionably in a far more dependent situation than many other countries in this respect.  We are going to be totally dependent if we hand over the second channel, and I emphasise second channel.  If there is any ambiguity about what I am saying regarding the second channel, the RTE Authority in paragraph 6 of their report stated that no other country in the world has concluded that a second television service in their country should take the form of the rebroadcast <i>in toto</i> of one of the services of a neighbouring country. That is what is related here to simultaneous broadcasting.  I am seeking to point out that the Minister may make for a far more flexible situation for himself and for the authority, or whatever body he may introduce, by allowing the deletion of &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo; and so enable a balanced mix of programmes to be decided on the second channel by whatever body may be responsible for it.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words on this because a lot of what Senator Lenihan said is over my head. As one who lives in one of the disadvantaged single-channel areas I get rather weary of listening to the people who enjoy the advantage of four or five selections telling those who reside in the less fortunate areas about the dangers to their culture and way of life if they are faced with the same selection or even a part of the selection of what those on the east coast now enjoy as a fortunate right.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate the Minister cannot conclude this debate because I think he might have cleared up some of the points made.  However, that is the Chair's ruling and we must abide by it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept that.  I suppose the Chair was ruling in accordance with Standing Orders.  As I understand it the word &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo; is a corollary to rebroadcasting.  Notwithstanding the noted authority quoted by Senator <Col N="1286" /> Lenihan I do not accept that by giving a Minister of State, who represents a Government selected by the people, the right to require a second channel to broadcast in its entirety certain programmes we are therefore handing over to an outside unnamed power the right to decide what our second channel will do.  I assume that the Minister retains the right to direct the second channel what not to broadcast or not to broadcast anything at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. Perhaps the Senator misunderstood me. What I said was that the Minister has the right under the Bill to direct that certain programmes would be broadcast and he can also decide that broadcasting will cease.  I have said here time and again that what I would personally prefer would be some outside institution, some consortium of newspapers or business interests who would operate an independent commercial station.  As I understand it that is not on and there is no indication that it is on.  I do not know what would be the costs involved in the suggestion of Senator Lenihan. No costs have been included in a recent statement from his party.  It is important in our present circumstances that if one is proposing an alternative to the proposal in this Bill that the costs should be included.  I think we could all make very airy-fairy ideal suggestions but unless we are practical about it and include in that what the cost is going to be to the taxpayer and ratepayer it is so much eyewash.  I cannot see any <Col N="1287" /> practical alternative&mdash;I wish there was a practical alternative.</P>
      <P>In the single-channel areas&mdash;Senator Lenihan and his cohorts can accept this&mdash;the people want an alternative. They want a practical alternative.  They do not want lectures from people living in the advantaged areas as to what they should or should not do.  If the Opposition can come up with a practical alternative and spell out the cost, I am quite certain that this House and the other House and the Minister would listen to it.  So far we have had no idea at all as to what any of these alternatives might cost and until such time as we do that I do not think we can give serious consideration to any of these suggestions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion began on the basis of an innocent, technical, little amendment but, largely by the Minister's wishes, it has spread its wings somewhat since it began.  I will begin my reply by sticking to the strict terms of the amendment.  I regret that the Minister is not willing to accept the amendment because its phraseology is not unnecessarily rigid.  I am not at all convinced by his references to other Acts and saying that &ldquo;rebroadcast&rdquo; meant such and such in them.  If the Minister wishes to achieve the effect of my amendment, I am certain the parliamentary draftsman would be able to come up with phraseology which would suit, instead of using the word &ldquo;rebroadcast&rdquo; if that has already been used in another Act in a certain sense. One could say &ldquo;retransmission&rdquo;.  There is no technical problem which could not be surmounted and it does not convince me in the least to say he cannot accept <Col N="1288" /> this amendment because there is a certain definition in another Act.</P>
      <P>The truth of the matter is that the Minister has got it into his head that it is an article of faith that not only must we broadcast BBC, but we must broadcast it simultaneously so that the Irish people can get whatever vicarious satisfaction he thinks they will get from knowing that they are looking at the same programmes that, at the precise moment, are being enjoyed or not enjoyed in Yorkshire, Lancashire, London, and elsewhere in the neighbouring isle.  I do not understand this article of faith but one must accept that this is his belief.  It is a curious creed.  It does not seem to me to have any basis in concrete reality but, nonetheless, we must accept that these are his views and, therefore, he will not accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>Going on to the rather wider aspect the Minister has raised, he dealt at some length in a prepared script with his attitude to the trade union reaction to these proposals.  He said, in effect, removing the verbiage and getting down to the bedrock of meaning underlying it, that he hoped and assumed that, in the event of the people in the single-channel area deciding they wish to have this foreign television service rebroadcast to them simultaneously, the Irish trade unions would not stand in their way and, indeed, trade unionists themselves have television sets.  The Minister altogether misunderstands the solidarity trade unionists, not merely in this country but in all countries, have on such issuses.  If there was a proposal by the Government to ask the taxpayer to subsidise the importation of large quantities of foreign shoes or articles of clothing or textiles from Hong Kong or Korea or even from England, trade unionists would object and they would be right to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate objectors would be the trade unions whose employment was threatened and they would be supported by the generality of trade union members.  We have already had trade union action.  Whether it be justified or not, we must recognise that the problem exists and action has been taken.  Already there has been trade union action with regard to the importation <Col N="1289" /> of fully assembled foreign cars.  We all know that on such issues trade unions take a severe view of threats, or what seem to be threats, to the employment of their members and that they are supported by other trade unions. Therefore, we may take it that they will be supported in this case by other trade union members, whether or not they have television sets and whether or not they live in the single-channel area.</P>
    <P>The Minister also suggested, as indeed he suggested in earlier debates on this Bill, that there is no need for trade unionists to fear any damage to their employment.  This is a matter of opinion.  The trade unionists feel that their employment and career prospects are threatened.  The RTE Authority also think so.  Commonsense would suggest that their prospects of employment and of future development are threatened. The Minister should have regard to the fact that trade unionists are not wholly activated by self-interest.  Obviously all of us, whether members of trade unions or not, are activated to a considerable extent by self-interest.  He should give trade unionists and other people the credit of assuming that self-interest is not their entire way of life.</P>
    <P>He should consider also that the members of trade unions who work in Radio Telefís Éireann have a pride in the fact that they work in a national television station.  They have a pride in what has been achieved and they have hopes for what may be achieved in the future.  They have a sort of national feeling that they would like to take part in the development of the best possible radio television service here.  They are naturally upset at the idea that, as a result of section 6 of the Minister's Bill, the prospects for what has been built up are gravely in danger, that at the very least the type of development in the future they could look forward to will not take place and that at the worst what has already been achieved may be very gravely endangered.  The Minister should have regard to this fact.  It is not simply a matter of self-interest, or of the take-home pay they may expect, or their employment prospects.  The Minister should have regard to the pride they have in their work, in the whole ethos, the whole concept, they have of the <Col N="1290" /> national broadcasting organisation, of which they are a part.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell told us as, indeed, the Minister has already said, that after all, the Minister still retains control of this foreign television service which is potentially brought in by this Bill, and the Minister has every intention of bringing it in.  Senator Russell says the Minister still has control because, even after the service has begun he can always stop it.  I pointed out to Senator Russell that, while the programme is being rebroadcast, the Minister has no control at all.  Once the BBC start broadcasting over the Irish frequencies under the control of the RTE Authority, he has absolutely no control over what is broadcast.  Indeed, he has copperfastened it in a number of sections in this Bill with the greatest care and against considerable resistance from this side of the House.  He has made it absolutely certain that it is legally stated in this Bill that no control of any kind is to be maintained over the BBC. That is specifically stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I can build dams or canals and I can do all kinds of things to control the elements, but I have no control sitting on the beach over the waves as they come in.  If I build a canal so that the waves come in and flood my neighbour's land&mdash;perhaps we are getting back to the swamp we had a discussion on earlier&mdash;and prevents his crops from growing, obviously I am responsible.  I am not suggesting this is a direct comparison.  While we or the Minister are in no way responsible for what the BBC or UTV do now, or any broadcasting station or any radio station in the world we happen to be able to hear, the Minister is responsible, or should be responsible, the moment he spends taxpayers' money, or authorities <Col N="1291" /> the spending of the licence holders' money, and in particular authorises in this legislation the rebroadcast of the BBC over Irish transmitters.  These are Irish transmitters, paid for by the Irish taxpayer, operated by the so-called national television service from Irish mountain tops.  This is a matter over which we have or should have control and for which we are or should be responsible.</P>
      <P>There is absolutely no comparision between the situation that will arise if the Minister gets his way under this Bill, and the situation which exists at the moment, whereby, if you happen to live in certain places you can receive the BBC.  The Minister quite clearly has no more control over the BBC than he has over the waves in the sea.</P>
      <P>The Minister exercises control in this Bill to the extent that he can effectively press the button, He can say: &ldquo;All right, from now on we will rebroadcast over Irish transmitters entire programmes simultaneously from the BBC.&rdquo;  Having done this he can, of course, stop it, but he cannot in any way dictate what they are going to broadcast.  As I say, he has provided most carefully in this Bill that the requirements that they should be objective and impartial shall not apply to them, that their treatment of current affairs need not be fair to all interests concerned, nor need they be presented in an objective and impartial manner. The various requirements about incitement to crime or undermining the authority of the State which we are specifically providing for in this Bill do not apply to the BBC.  They do not apply even to the extent that if they are breached there is an injunction on the Minister to cut off the service.  There is nothing at all about this.  No one can say&mdash;unless the English language has altogether changed its meaning&mdash;that the Minister has any control over the rebroadcasting of programmes by the BBC.  His only control is to stop it.  Once the material is rebroadcast he has no control over that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says he can stop it any day.  He cannot.  You simply cannot have a vacuum.  If you were to decide on a Monday that Tuesday's BBC rebroadcasts were to be stopped, what <Col N="1292" /> would you put in their place?  How long would it take for Radio Telefís Éireann to prepare a new team to put out a changed programme?  How long would it take them to prepare programme schedules and go through all the complicated administrative details that are required in such cases?  I would suggest at least a year and perhaps longer.</P>
    <P>The fact is that, if the BBC service started and the Minister or any other Minister were to decide to end it, there would be a period of at least a year during which it would willy-nilly have to continue until such time as there was something to replace it.  It is simply ingenuous for the Minister and, indeed, for Senator Russell to suggest that there is some element of control.  There is no element of national control, no element of Government control over the nature of these materials which will be broadcast from this service.  That is all I want to say for the moment on this amendment.  I merely express formal regret that my original, rather meek little amendment, was not accepted.</P>

The reference to exchange of aural and visual material by the Authority in section 3 (1) (c) of the Bill is technically incorrect also, as section 16 of the 1960 Act, as amended by the 1966 Act, does not cover exchange of aural or visual material published by the Authority.

      <P>During the Committee Stage debate Senator FitzGerald raised the point that the Authority could not respond to my suggestion to them to broadcast a programme explaining the case for an RTE 2 owing to the statutory prohibition on expression by the Authority of their own views. I promised to have a look at this and I have come to the conclusion that the blanket prohibition on expression by the Authority of their own views on current affairs broadcasts is inappropriate. Clearly on the other hand they should not be given total freedom to use the airways to propagate their own views, seeing that these same airwaves would not be available to the Government except by way of ministerial announcement under section 31 (2), or to members of the public who might be opposed to the Authority's viewpoint.  It seems reasonable, however, that the Authority should be free to broadcast their own views on proposed changes in broadcasting policy which are of public controversy or the subject of current public debate.  Amendment No. 4 is designed to make clear their ability to do this.</P>

      <P>Senator Martin, during the course of the Committee Stage debate, suggested that a prohibition on unreasonable encroachment by the Authority on the privacy of an individual would be more appropriate than unreasonable intrusion.  I have decided to accept his suggestion and amendment No. 5 makes the necessary amendment.  The substitution of &ldquo;encroach&rdquo; for &ldquo;intrude&rdquo; involves a rather slight narrowing of the restraint imposed on RTE by the section.  To encroach has been defined as to intrude usurpingly; in a usurping manner.  It is not my definition.  It implies that intrusion may be valid in certain circumstances and this reinforces the qualification contained in the subsection that only unreasonable intrusion is prohibited.  As the Cathaoirleach has said, amendment No. 8 is consequential on that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 3, line 22, after &ldquo;members&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;at least one of whom shall <Col N="1295" /> have professional experience of broadcasting,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This matter came up on Committee Stage as part of a proposal that the number of members of the committee should be increased from three to five. The Minister said for reasons one can understand that he did not want as many as five, and he thought a minimum of three was adequate.  In the light of that, this amendment keeps the number as proposed in this Bill, but continues with the requirement that at least one of them should have professional experience of broadcasting.  Of the three members of the present informal broadcasting complaints committee whom one assumes the Minister will appoint to be members of the broadcasting complaints commission under this Bill, while we understand that one of these had professional experience of broadcasting, that does not necessarily mean that at all times in the future, in the absence of an amendment such as this, there would be a member who had professional experience of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>It would seem elementary that, where a broadcasting complaints commission were considering whether a particular television or radio broadcast had violated the various requirements laid down in section 3 of this Bill, somebody should be there who understood television and radio broadcasting,  If none of them had any such professional experience, it would be difficult for them to have an understanding of the underlying problems in preparing television and radio broadcasts.  A layman who knew nothing about these things would very often be prepared to condemn the manner in which a broadcast was put out, lacking that understanding of the problems which faced the people who prepared the programme.  This is a minimum requirement which the Minister ought to be willing to accept. It is likely that one of the original members the Minister will appoint will have such experience.  There will be other days and other Ministers and, since we are laying down the terms governing the appointment of this commission for years to come&mdash;we have to think of 20 years from now&mdash;and, in the light of that, such a provision as I propose here would seem to be desirable.</P>

To follow this logically, it would be true to say that if the arguments made on Second Stage and Committee Stage were right, workers who had some role or function in the organisation of Radio Telefís Éireann should be sitting on the commission to hear complaints against them because of their expertise or because of their concern.</P>
      <P>There is an implication running through this kind of suggestion.  It is a complaints commission and not the Authority as such.  I would agree with the suggestion that an expert should be placed on the Authority.  The implication is that if you want to deal with a problem faced by a pilot you must be able to fly a plane.  I do not know if that is a good analogy to draw, but it is the one that strikes me.  It means that if you put something through some form of arbitration or some form of independent investigation, you must select at least one person with experience in the field being argued about.  I do not think that is practicable.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I gave reasons why I do not feel I can accept this amendment.  I would refer Senators to Volume 81, columns 550 to 551 of the Official Report.  I think that any Minister will necessarily bear in mind the desirability of having someone on the committee with that kind of general experience.  I would not wish to have the Minister bound by statute to appoint someone with professional experience of broadcasting. There is, for example, on the existing committee a very experienced and respected journalist, a senior member of the National Union of Journalists, who has broadcast frequently, but has never <Col N="1297" /> been professionally employed in broadcasting. I do not know whether it would be considered that he had professional experience of broadcasting, but he represents the type of person I would like to see on the commission.  He knows quite a lot about the subject but he is not a member of what one might describe as the professional corps of broadcasters and, therefore, does not have the degree of commitment to the broadcaster's position which might make for unsuitability in the role of a member of the complaints commission. Accordingly I am sorry I do not agree with this amendment and cannot accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister will not accept this amendment.  Perhaps he misunderstands the intention behind it.  As reported at column 550, Volume 81 of the Official Report, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I do not think it desirable to have a statutory requirement that a given number of members of the commission shall have professional experience of broadcasting.  I would not like to build in something that would seem to say that a certain proportion of the commission are meant, as it were, to speak up for the broadcasters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly never envisaged this.  It would be most undesirable to have one man or woman on the commission who was a sort of friend in court of the broadcasting fraternity.  I envisaged a situation in which there would be one person there who knew something about broadcasting.  I would remind the Minister that the amendment does not say &ldquo;one of whom should have experience in broadcasting&rdquo; but &ldquo;of broadcasting&rdquo;. Under that definition the person he has in mind would certainly qualify.  If people had been in broadcasting I would think that they would not be suitable members of such a commission until they had retired from or ceased to be employed in broadcasting. Obviously as has been pointed out by Senator Harte, that position would be very difficult.  A person who was actively engaged in broadcasting and at the same time sitting as it were in judgment on his fellows quite clearly <Col N="1298" /> would not do.  That is not what I had in mind.</P>
    <P>What I had in mind was a person who knew something about how programmes are created, the difficulties of creating them, the problems that arise in creating them, the bind of traditions and customs which exist, what one ought to do, what one ought not to do, the codes of conduct built up informally over the years.  Here you have three people, none of whom ever had anything to do with broadcasting, and I think it would be very difficult for them to achieve an adequate result in their work.  Senator Harte said it is not necessary, talking about flying, to know anything about how one flies; one does not need to be able to pilot a plane.  I would remind him that, if there was an inquiry into an air crash, it will always be conducted by people who have themselves professional experience in flying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not dealing with a complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  It is an inquiry into what happened.  This is fortunately not as bad as an air crash but there is not that much difference in principle. Here you have a situation where a programme was put out and there have been complaints, saying that the programme was not done right, that the requirements laid down in this Bill were broken, that fair play was not given to so-and-so, that somebody's privacy was invaded or that there was an incitement to crime, and so on.  The commission then have to consider how the programme was put together, what its purpose was, what its aim was, what in fact it did and so on.  It is the same kind of thing on a different scale and basis as you do in regard to a plane crash; you have to consider how the plane was serviced, how it was flown, what condition it was in.  It is a similar type of operation though fortunately not as tragic as inquiries into air crashes frequently are.  Senator Harte in any event mentioned the pilot and I did not. I think it is quite clear that any inquiry into a crash or, indeed, into anything relating to air pilots would be carried out by people who had experience in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> However, if the Minister will not accept it, he will not accept it.  I may be an optimist and I certainly hope, even without this requirement in the Bill, that future Ministers will certainly always include at least one person who has knowledge of or professional experience in broadcasting; otherwise, this broadcasting complaints commission will simply not be able to work.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> I move amendment No. 10:</P>
    <P>In page 5, lines 9 to 16, to delete paragraph (<i>f</i>).</P>
    <P>These amendments have a simple issue. I seek by the deletion of these various paragraphs and words to take out of the ambit of the commission the discussion of matters which come under paragraph (c) of section 3.  We had a good deal of discussion about this on Committee Stage.  I made the point then that the proposal to refer to the broadcasting complaints commission the manner in which such written material as the <i>RTE Guide</i> was put out seemed contrary to the prevailing attitude with regard to all printed materials, periodicals, newspapers and so on.  While they may be subject to the Censorship Board they are not subject to any other form of censorship or complaints commission or anything like that.  First of all, I made that point and, secondly, I argued that a body called the broadcasting complaints commission hardly seems the most suitable one to be dealing with printed material of this kind.  Therefore my first two amendments seek to take from the broadcasting division the power to deal with these.  It seems to me to be, because of its nature, the membership it is likely to have and the functions which are set out at such enormous lengths in paragraph 4, a quite unsuitable body to deal with the question of the way in which such a periodical as the <i>RTE Guide</i> or any other periodicals that might be put out by RTE are published or written.</P>
    <P>In principle it seems wrong that there should be what is inevitably a form of censorship.  We have the Censorship Act.  One may have views on its existence or views of the manner in which it is administered.  I might have them, the Minister might have them.  Everyone is entitled to have them but, nonetheless, it is there and it should be let do its job.  I do not think we should introduce this new form of what amounts to censorship.  We can leave it to the common sense of the RTE Authority to see that a matter does not appear which would be objectionable.  In the last 20 or 30 years in which periodicals have been issued by the RTE Authority I do not imagine there has ever been a <Col N="1301" /> complaint of a kind which might be considered by a commission of this sort. As there never appears to have been a complaint there seems to be no necessity for this and I would suggest to the Minister that it would be more sensible to delete it.</P>
    <P>We then have the position&mdash;the Minister was quite adamant on this&mdash; in which we have the injunction laid upon them in section 3 that they must present their material in an objective and impartial manner.  We can leave it at that and let the Minister take it up with the RTE Authority, if by any chance they publish material that is not objective or impartial.  But I think it is not a matter for the Authority but rather for the broadcasting complaints commission to consider a question of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Senator Yeats's amendment No. 10, I stated my views on this matter on the Committee Stage and I am afraid I have not been led to change them.  RTE control what are probably our most influential and pervasive communications media.  Publications by RTE are likely to be viewed in the same light as their broadcasts to which in fact their publications must, by the circumstances of the case, be ancillary.  Accordingly, it seems logical that they should be subject to the same restraints, including examination of complaints by the broadcasting complaints commission.</P>
      <P>As regards amendment No. 11, the time limits in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) could not in my view appropriately be applied to publications. They refer specifically to broadcasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extensive consequential amendments of subsection (2) would be necessary if this amendment were accepted.  In view of the peripheral nature of publications so far as the Authority are concerned I do not think it necessary to provide a statutory procedure in the Bill for dealing with complaints about them. Indeed, Senators have themselves complained, with some justice, about the relevant section as already being overelaborate. However, I have considered this further since the Committee Stage, as I promised I would and I accept it owuld be desirable to provide statutory <Col N="1302" /> power for the commission to lay down procedures for dealing with complaints about publications.  I gather that amendment No. 12 has been put forward for this purpose.  I regret therefore that I cannot accept amendments Nos. 10 and 11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister is not willing to accept these amendments. My amendment No. 11, of course, could not possibly hang by itself.  It was tagged on to amendment No. 10.  I quite see that if amendment No. 10 is not to be passed obviously one could not bring in amendment No. 11.  The Minister's point about the vaious 30 days notice and so on cannot obviously apply to anything in writing.  So the two hang together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will, in due course, thank the Minister for his amendment No. 12 which obviously I am happy to see down there.  The only point I would make on these amendments is that, as I mentioned on Committee Stage, there are a very wide variety of publications issued by public semi-State bodies.  I mentioned a few before: <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i> issued by Bord Fáilte and a variety of written material issued by CIE.  Every semi-State body issues material in some shape or form and some of these certainly have the kind of authority the Minister attributes to the RTE Authority in the sense of having a position which might make people think that what they issued was in some way an important or official document. None of these is covered by provisions such as this.  It does seem contrary to principle.  However, I am not really that exercised about it because, as I have already said, in the long period since RTE began issuing periodicals no one, so far as I know, has ever complained and one can only assume that this will continue so the complaints commission therefore will not be bothered with any complaints arising out of this written material.  I raised this matter only because, on a question of principle, I do not think we should extend in any way the apparatus for censorship.  It already exists.  We may have views on it, but we would all agree, I think, that as a general principle it should not be extended beyond what exists at the moment. Unfortunately we now have a situation <Col N="1303" /> arising out of this Bill that the <i>RTE Guide</i> and any other literature that may be issued by RTE is to be subject to two censorship boards&mdash;first of all, the ordinary censorship board and then the complaints commission which effectively is the same type of thing.  I cannot see the point.  It seems quite contrary to principle but that, apparently, is what the Minister wants.</P>

      <P>During the Committee Stage debate on subsection (2) of section 18B Senator Yeats drew attention to the fact that the Bill contained no provision for procedures to deal with complaints about publications by the Authority.  The subsection provides that such complaints must be made in writing but it is silent otherwise. I have decided it would be desirable to include specific statutory power for the commission to draw up procedures for dealing with these complaints and this amendment is designed to do that.  I am grateful to Senator Yeats for drawing attention to the need for this.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 62, after &ldquo;Authority&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and, in any case in which the complaint relates to a programe or programmes produced by employees of the Authority, any person or persons directly involved in the making of the said programme or programmes and nominated for that purpose by the Authority,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am going to do what must be the almost impossible and change the Minister's mind on a Report Stage amendment, because I have studied very, very closely his amendment, compared it with my amendment and, for reasons which, I hope, have more to do with common sense and logic than with fact, I am convinced that one of mine at least is better than what the Minister has put before us.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is about 30 per cent longer than either of mine and, in my belief, says substantially less than mine.  In fact I am in some doubt as to whether it actually means anything at all.  The Minister's amendment, if I may paraphrase it, and I think the paraphase is not inaccurate, says broadly speaking that if anybody thinks their interests will be affected by the hearing of a complaint and, if that person works for the Authority, he can ask the commission for permission to be heard during the hearing of that complaint and the commission, if it is satisfied the person's rights may be affected, can or shall afford to the person such an opportunity.  All this says in plain English is that anybody can apply to the commission and the commission can refuse or accept him completely on its say-so; in other words, there is no statutory right given to any person to be heard in his own defence.  My amendments, on the other hand, put essentially on the Authority the duty of deciding whether or not the professional or other interests of any of its employees might be damaged by the hearing of a complaint and allow the Authority to nominate the person who shall be heard by the complaints commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> We can assume that the Authority will not act unreasonably in a matter of this kind.  On the other hand, one perhaps cannot always ignore the possibility that employees of the Authority if there is a very sharp contrary situation might act with the same degree of carefulness as the Authority itself might.  I can foresee a sort of conflict situation in which the commission might be deluged with requests from individuals working for the Authority to be heard.  The commission would, before it even got around to discussing the complaint, have first of all to decide whether any and, if so, which of these persons was entitled to be heard by it during the course of the hearing of the complaint. We might, in fact, have a whole series of prior hearings during which Mr. X and Ms. Y appealed to the commission to be heard during the subsequent hearing of the complaint.  This would give rise to all sorts of procedural problems and does not get around the basic problem which, I think, my amendment does get around, that the right nomination, if it is not to be vexatiously exercised, should not reside in the individual but should reside in the Authority.  How, for example, is the commission to decide whether or not a person should be heard during the hearing of a complaint without hearing the person concerned?  They have got to have some evidence on which to decide whether or not the person's interests will be affected.  It seems to me natural that they can only get that evidence largely from the person concerned or from his professional supervisors or colleagues.</P>
    <P>I can see the acceptance of the Minister's amendment setting up a sort of rolling-stone situation&mdash;not the sort of rolling stone that gathers no moss, quite the opposite, a snowball rolling downhill situation in which any complaint, and particularly complaints in a very contentious area, would become festooned with people who wanted to be heard and that would force the commission into all sorts of anomalous and awkward positions in trying to decide as between the people they will hear and people they will not hear.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge acceptance of either of my amendments.  The difference <Col N="1306" /> between them is only a drafting one.  I think amendment No. 15 is probably marginally preferable to amendment No. 14.  I strongly recommend that either of these two amendments, but especially amendment No. 15, should be taken in place of the Minister's amendment because I really believe that either the Minister's amendment makes no difference at all to the commission's procedures or, if it does make a difference, it is a difference which has within it the possibility of being very deleterious to the working of the commission and to its function with regard to the hearing of complaints.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments of Senator Horgan, though I am not wholly happy with the wording of them.  He provides that the persons to be heard by the complaints commission should be nominated for that purpose by the Authority.  I am not keen on that idea.  It seems to me that there might well be a person who felt that his interests might be adversely affected and who might wish to be heard and I do not think it should be a matter for the Authority to decide whether or not this person should be heard by the broadcasting complaints commission. However either of these amendments would considerably improve the position as it is at present when no one has any right to be heard.  I hope the commission under this Bill will be able to hear people other than the Authority. The only obligation laid upon them is to afford to the Authority an opportunity to comment on the complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems quite contrary to natural justice that in a case such as this, where the entire livelihood of a person might be affected, he should not have any right to be heard.  We should be realistic about this.  This is the commission that hears complaints against programmes issued by the RTE Authority prepared by individual people&mdash;the producer of a programme, the editor, the cameraman, a reporter or some individual who depends for his livelihood on his work in RTE.  If he is condemned root and branch for an invasion of privacy, or something like that, for incitement to crime, or any of the things laid down in this Bill, he could lose his employment and find it difficult to obtain employment anywhere else if he has <Col N="1307" /> been publicly categorised in this fashion.  Indeed, I am extremely doubtful whether in such a case, were he to go to court on this matter, this subsection would be held to be constitutional. Certainly if I were condemned in such fashion as I have described by the commission I would be very inclined, subject to whatever legal advice might be available to me, to go to the High Court and seek some kind of declaration that the subsection was, in fact, unconstitutional.  At the very least you would have a castiron case against the commission for acting in a way contrary to natural justice.  I do not think there is any doubt about that.</P>
    <P>One could go one stage further and say that in fact this subsection is unconsitutional.  Leaving aside the legal niceties, the Minister ought to agree it is only ordinary justice that, before an inquiry of this nature is undertaken by the commission, they will hear anyone who feels that his interests may be adversely affected.  I am not suggesting that they should hear hundreds of people.  They ought to have the power to say in a particular case: &ldquo;We think somebody is only in a very marginal relationship to this programme and we do not feel he could possibly do anything much to help us in our deliberations, and neither could his own status be adversely affected&rdquo;: in this situation they could refuse to hear him. Anyone who could reasonably be held to be in danger of being adversely affected by such an inquiry ought to have in ordinary justice the right to be heard.  I would suggest to the Minister that he ought to accept either of Senator Horgan's amendments because the Bill, as it stands, would seem to give wide scope for complaint.</P>
    <P>I know that on the Minister's proposed commission there is a very distinguished former judge.  One may assume that he would accept the ordinary requirements of law in these matters.  The likelihood is that in future years there would not be such a distinguished former judge on the commission; a person with a legal knowledge is not the kind of person that you would necessarily think of in relation to a commission of this kind dealing <Col N="1308" /> with broadcasting.  It would be very easy for a commission to issue some fairly scathing report without hearing the people concerned.  Since there is already so much in this section, it would seem the Minister should add something to lay some kind of an obligation on the commission to hear not merely the Authority but also the workers under the Authority.  One must bear in mind that the interests of the Authority and individual workers might not necessarily be on all-fours.  It is not sufficient to say that the Authority can comment on the complaint; it is also essential that at least those who are mainly concerned with the putting out of the programme should have the right to be heard.</P>

      <P>Senator Horgan in moving this amendment said that he was attempting the almost impossible task of persuading the Minister to accept an amendment on Report Stage. I am genuinely sorry that I cannot give the Senator the satisfaction of achieving the almost impossible on this occasion but I am sure he will achieve it on some other occasion.  I do not think the Government amendment suffers from the defects complained of.  I think it provides a clear right of access to the commission by employees of RTE who can show that they would be adversely affected by a complaint.  We should realise that these offered amendments and the Government amendment derive from, in the sense of a case that occurred, a complaint by an employee or employees of RTE who were not called before the committee to be heard in relation to a case in which the committee decided that the complaints against them were without foundation. I do not think there would be any question of the broadcasting commission reaching a conclusion adverse to an employee of RTE without giving him a hearing.  If that were to happen the constitutional matters to which Senator Yeats referred would arise, but they do not arise in reference to the section itself.  I have taken legal advice on this matter and I have accepted that legal advice and, indeed, that is among the reasons why it would not be possible for me at this stage to satisfy Senator Horgan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> When I considered after the Committee Stage the proposals made by Senator Horgan and one made by Senator Lenihan on this matter I did decide that a provision of this kind would improve the Bill and I then took advice as to how far we could go in that direction.  I have been advised that it would be undesirable from a legal point of view to provide that a decision as to the RTE employees, who would have a right of access to the commission, should be left to the Authority. The legal aspect apart, there is a great deal to be said for leaving this decision to the commission rather than to the Authority.  The Authority, not an individual employee, are responsible for all programmes broadcast and they would naturally protect their employees from unjustified criticism.</P>
    <P>However, a case might arise in which the Authority decided that an employee was at fault.  In such a situation the employee concerned might wish to present his own case to the commission.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 16 is intended to give him the right to do this whilst, at the same time, not precluding the Authority from nominating any RTE employee to represent the RTE case before the commission.  I am advised that the phraseology used is appropriate to give that.  In effect, it provides that an employee of RTE who believes he would be adversely affected by a complaint would have a right of access to the commission, provided the commission accepted that he had a genuine cause for concern.  I think that is fair and should be adequate to meet the point raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's statement in so far as it constitutes an acceptable rationale for his amendment, rather than for either of mine.  On the other hand, we must be quite clear to spell out how little it does.  In the Minister's words, his amendment gives a clear right of access to employees who can show they would be adversely affected.  My reading of that is not so clear.  The Minister's amendment states something, but to say that it gives employees a clear right of access is not true in so far as it is qualified by their <Col N="1310" /> need to show that their interests would be adversely affected.  Indeed, they have to show such a thing to the satisfaction of the commission itself.</P>
      <P>I accept the legitimacy of the Minister's point that there may be, perhaps, an occasion on which an individual might not be wanted by the Authority to give evidence on his own behalf to such a complaints commission.  To that extent, I come back a little on the wording of my own amendment about a nomination by the Authority.  At the same time, while perhaps not pressing the amendment very strenuously it must be underlined that the Minister's amendment, while the spirit behind it is clear, does not actually confer any rights on anyone independently of what the commission itself may decide.  It was my intention in framing this amendment to try and confer rights on people independently of the commission. I still think it would have been legitimate to include it in the Bill.  I am not entirely unhopeful that something like this may be added at a later stage when more legal arguments have been teased out but not, of course, in this House.</P>

      <P>This is a small matter that I raised on the Committee Stage.  I asked the Minister on subsection (8) what the words &ldquo;or request&rdquo; meant or added to the subsection.  The subsection reads:</P>
      <P>The consideration by the Commission of a complaint or request made to it under this Act shall be carried out by the Commission in private.</P>
      <P>I can see that the commission will consider complaints and agree they should carry out this process in private, but the sudden introduction in the middle of this immensely long section of the phraseology &ldquo;or request&rdquo; puzzled me, and I asked the Minister what on earth it was supposed to mean.

      <P>That did not help at all.  If the Authority or a member of the Authority wish a complaint to be heard, I should not have thought it could have been decided in half a minute or so.  One would not expect it to be held in public.  I suggest to the Minister, unless there are more coherent reasons for including these words, that he might consider deleting them.  Those who have to plough in future through this long section, should not have to decide in subsection (8) of section 6 what this word &ldquo;request&rdquo; means.

      <P>Senator Lenihan, during the Committee Stage debate, put forward an amendment to provide that a decision in favour of a complainant would be published by the commission immediately, rather than that publication be deferred pending the issue of the annual report of the commission.  In the course of the debate on this amendment it was suggested that the commission should publish all their decisions rather than only those in which they found in favour of a complainant.  I accept that early publication of decisions by the commission would be desirable but I am not convinced that there should be a statutory obligation on the commission to publish every decision.  To do so in some cases might possibly compound the original complaint, for example, if this involved intrusion or encroachment on privacy.  Amendment No. 18 will, I hope, be accepted as meeting the general intent of the House in regard to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are grateful to the Minister for putting down this amendment. To a certain extent, it clarifies <Col N="1313" /> the situation for us.  On the other hand, I do not altogether accept the rationale behind the idea that all the decisions on complaints should not necessarily be published.  When we are dealing with &ldquo;media&rdquo; we are talking about publication. Very often, if wrongs have been done or if people consider that wrongs have been done, they may not perhaps get a judgment by the commission in their favour.  But if the commission is required to publish the fact that they have felt sufficiently aggrieved to complain, and perhaps even some supporting details relating to statements made in support of the rejection of the complaint, this is a consolation prize for somebody who is aggrieved enough to complain, who is serious enough to follow a complaint through and carry it right through to the commission.</P>
      <P>There is a small analogy here with the Press Council in Great Britain in which the publication of evidence, and of the report of the Press Council, is in many cases the only redress of people who have been victimised or who have been wronged in some way by the media.  This is true in cases in which the Press Council has found in favour of the complainant.  It is, you might say, even more true in cases in which the Press Council has found against them but in which opinion might have been so narrowly divided as to make it an even bet either way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I really feel that all decisions made by the complaints commission should be published.  If not all decisions, it would be very important for the complaints commission to publish in any given year details of such decisions as it thought necessary, but also an actual log of the total number of complaints received.  It might not want, or be required statutorily, to publish details of every single decision made on complaints, some of which may have been very light weight indeed.  If we are given in the annual report of the commission details of three complaints we are not to know otherwise whether the total number of complaints was four or 300.  It would be a matter of legitimate public interest to know how many complaints were considered by the commission during the year under review, whether or not the commission are to be statutorily bound to give <Col N="1314" /> details of all decisions on all these matters.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for bringing in this amendment. It is to some extent limited in its wording, as Senator Horgan has said, but clearly it is an advance on the existing provision in the Bill which is that the results of hearings of complaints shall be known officially to the public only in the annual report of the broadcasting commission.  This could involve considerable delay.  As I understand this amendment, it means that well in advance of the annual report, as soon as may be after the complaint has actually been heard, the commission will, in most cases at any rate, publish the result of their considerations.  It is an advance on the existing wording of the Bill and we thank the Minister for it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 31 to 33, to delete subsection (9).</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to delete subsection (9) of section 4, which states:</P>
      <P>As regards proceedings under this section, the Commission shall not have any power to award to any party costs or expenses.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter on the Committee Stage and the Minister, at column 637 of the Seanad Official Report, said:</P>
      <P>...we envisaged the commission in this shape without executive power, the power to enforce their decisions. It follows from that that they should not have this power of awarding costs or expenses.  It is not that kind of commission we have involved here, despite the formality of the legal language in which it is to be encouched, but rather an informal body.  We would not expect that anybody coming before them would normally incur costs except the stamp on the letter written in.  Of course, he might have to come to Dublin but presumably he would consider that worth while.  That is the reason why we did not want the commission to have power to award costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> That is not altogether an adequate depiction of the position that could arise in the event of complaints.  In putting down this amendment, or in raising the matter on Committee Stage, I did not envisage that those who make complaints would be awarded costs or expenses.  The Minister is quite right in saying that one could make a complaint by writing a letter and stamping an envelope.  Two stamps might be required, one for the original complaint to the RTE Authority and another to complain once again after 30 days to the Authority.  In these days, that costs quite a lot.  Nonetheless, it is not going to put anyone in the workhouse&mdash;yet.</P>
    <P>I had another matter in mind.  I envisaged a situation where a producer of a programme, a technician, cameraman, or reporter might have to travel to Dublin, who would have to forfeit all or part of his pay for a day's work, to give evidence before the commission, particularly as the Minister has brought in this valuable amendment which makes it easier for such people to be heard by the commission.  I cannot see in such a case why expenses should not be awarded.  When the Minister said if someone came up to Dublin presumably it was because he considered it worth while, he was thinking in terms of people who made a complaint.  Obviously the person whose livelihood is threatened by the complaint must consider it worth while.  He has to put his case before the commission, whether he wants to or not, because it is in his own interests to do so.  This being so, the commission should have power to award expenses.  This does not mean that they must do so.  It simply means that they will have the right to award expenses, if they see fit.  That would only be fair because the Minister has provided elsewhere in this Bill, in an indirect way, that the costs of the commission will be paid by the RTE Authority.  It is taken from the licence money before it is handed over to them.</P>
    <P>The people I am interested in are the servants of the RTE Authority who have been involved in the making of the programme concerned in the complaint. As they will lose a day's pay from the RTE Authority, it seems only <Col N="1316" /> fair that they should be awarded expenses which, in the process of the Exchequer organisation, will have to be paid back to them indirectly by the commission in expenses and, ultimately, will be paid back to the State by the RTE Authority.  Awards should be made at the expense of the RTE Authority, who will have saved the day's pay which the producer or other employee has lost through giving evidence.  Money will not be paid to him for the day's work he has missed but in due course the RTE Authority, if expenses are awarded by the commission, will have to foot the Bill.  This is right in principle and I suggest the Minister ought to accept this amendment which does not in any way impose an obligation on the commission in any particular case or indeed ever to award expenses.  It would merely restore the position that, if they saw fit in a particular case, they could award expenses or costs.</P>

      <P>As I indicated on the Committee Stage when the payment of costs or expenses by the commission was raised, I do not consider it either desirable or necessary that the commission should have power to pay the costs or expenses of parties involved in their proceedings.  The four parties that one would expect to be involved in proceedings are the complainant, RTE, advertisers and, of course, the category of the complained against, about whom the Senator was particularly concerned in his remarks. Senator Yeats made it clear that he did not have the complainant in mind and, as he says, the only expense he would be likely to incur would be the cost of his postage stamps in writing first to the Authority and then to the commission. In the case of RTE there would be no point in the commission bearing their costs, because the money would eventually come from the same TV licence fees.  It should not be any great hardship on an advertiser who wishes to present his case to the commission to pay the costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There remains the case which the Senator has just made of the person complained against, who is granted access to the commission to argue his case.  I will certainly clarify this with the <Col N="1317" /> Authority.  I would think that the Authority would not wish to stop the paying of one of their employees who was absent from his normal duties because of having to appear before the complaints commission, but I will certainly clarify this with them, and if I think serious hardship to an employee could occur under this head, I will consider an amendment at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 41 and 42, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(12) (a) The Commission may receive complaints that rebroadcasts transmitted by the Authority did not comply with one or more of the requirements of section 18 (1) of this Act.</P>
      <P>(b) Complaints under this subsection shall be considered by the Commission in accordance with procedures laid down by the Commission with the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is to provide that rebroadcasts under section 6 of this Bill should be covered by the commission.  The Bill, as it stands, specifically provides that only broadcasts originating with RTE should be considered by the broadcasting complaints commission.  One can make complaints against locally-produced or locally-broadcast programmes. It is specifically provided in considerable detail throughout this Bill that the rebroadcast of BBC 1, which is transmitted by RTE but originates with BBC, should be altogether withdrawn from the paraphernalia laid down in section 4 for the broadcasting complaints commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As mentioned before on various occasions, BBC rebroadcasts can lack objectivity and impartiality, incite to crime, undermine the authority of the State and so on.  The commission, under this section have absolutely no control <Col N="1318" /> over the matter; they cannot even consider it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, and one must accept it as a fact of life, that this stems from the old, somewhat eccentric concept which is laid down in this Bill particularly in section 6.  One must accept that obviously the Minister, the Government and everybody else, is not in a position to haul the BBC over the coals for anything they may or may not have done.  Since we have a broadcasting complaints commission, it would seem to be a valuable exercise that they should at least consider these matters.  Even if they consider these matters, they will not be in a position to call individual BBC officials, editors, producers and so on before them to answer for their sins, but they should be in a position to consider complaints which members of the public, or even the Minister himself on a specific occasion, might lay before them.</P>
    <P>Over a period, always it would be very valuable that there should be an impartial body of this kind to review the manner in which the BBC acted. Therefore, I provide in this amendment that</P>
    <P>The Commission may receive complaints that rebroadcasts transmitted by the Authority did not comply with one or more of the requirements of section 18 (1) of this Act.</P>
    <P>In other words, people could write to the commission to complain that a particular news broadcast of the BBC, in their view, was not presented in an objective and impartial manner, or that the broadcast's treatment of current affairs, including matters which are either of public controversy or the subject of current public debate, was not fair to all interests concerned and that the broadcast was not presented by the BBC in an objective and impartial manner.  Obviously, there will be such complaints, that is, complaints of a private and informal nature.</P>
    <P>People will object, I am sure, from time to time to what the BBC do. Therefore, I would urge the Minister to allow the broadcasting complaints commission to consider such complaints. They cannot directly complain to the BBC, but, as the Minister provided in his recently accepted amendment, <Col N="1319" /> they could consider these matters and publish the results of their deliberations. If they had a complaint about a certain series of programmes on the BBC, in their view the complaint was or was not justified for certain reasons, nothing further would happen.  Under the Bill as it stands, if the broadcasting complaints commission issue a condemnation of a programme or series of programmes produced by the Authority, nothing happens because the Authority are under no obligation to do anything about it.  If there were too many of these complaints the Minister might ask the two Houses of the Orieachtas to sack the Authority.  In the same way, if there were too many justifiable complaints about the BBC, the Minister could not sack the BBC.</P>
    <P>In the event of the acceptance of this amendment, the procedures laid down in this section for considering complaints about Telefís Éireann programmes would not be relevant.  Therefore, I provided in paragraph (b) that:</P>
    <P>Complaints under this subsection shall be considered by the Commission in accordance with procedures laid down by the commission with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In other words, anyone who wishes can write to the commission to complain about individual BBC programmes.  The commission when first formed will lay down procedures for hearing such complaints.  They will, in due course, publish statements in each case stating the nature of the complaint and their views of it.  Over a period of months or years, these hearings and considerations would be very valuable.  Provisions for hearing complaints against RTE are set out in the greatest detail but nothing is said about BBC.  There appears to be no way in which an impartial body can consider the nature of BBC programmes and whether they are in accordance with what the people would wish to see, or more particularly, whether they are in any way in accordance with the provisions laid down for RTE by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  In my view, there is no doubt that the commission would have <Col N="1320" /> more than adequate time to consider these matters.  As has already been pointed out, the present informal advisory committee the Minister formed, have only heard three complaints against RTE.  It is not very likely that the number of these complaints will rise dramatically after the passing of this Bill.  They would therefore have ample time to consider whatever complaints there were about the BBC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this reasonable amendment, particularly as it is in accordance with the more reasonable attitude that appears to be adopted by the Minister as the debate proceeded. He made it quite clear that he is not tied to the concept of rebroadcasting BBC 1, and that he will keep all options open between now and the end of next year. As public opinion appears to be developing according to the points of view expressed here, the Minister, if he takes note of that public opinion, may not rebroadcast BBC 1 <i>in toto</i> but may adopt one of the many options open to provide national control over what is rebroadcast on the second channel.  In that context, amendment No. 20 would appear to be very reasonable.</P>
      <P>The section, as it now stands, removes the procedure for complaining about the second channel broadcasting, and, from the logical point of view, is only relevant in the context of BBC programmes being rebroadcast <i>in toto.</i>  It is obvious in that context that the Minister, for practical reasons, could not have the whole complaints procedure, as set out in the section, invoked against the BBC transmitting from London.  He could, as suggested in Senator Yeats's amendment, have a complaints system which would help him to monitor BBC 1.  In that event, having received sufficient complaints, he could invoke the residual power in section 6, which he says he has, to cut off BBC 1.  The Minister knows, of course, that this will not happen.  He will not be able to cut off BBC 1, if it gets started.</P>

I appreciate that the procedures in the section <i>vis-à-vis</i> RTE 1, could not be invoked against the BBC1 because of the lack of control exercised by the Minister in regard to BBC1.  If the Minister is serious about having an open debate on this matter, he will accept this amendment and delete the removal of the second channel from the strictures which he has imposed in the section on RTE.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(12) (a) The Commission may receive complaints that rebroadcasts transmitted by the Authority did not comply with one or more of the requirements of section 18(1) of this Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 20 relates to the complaints commission. Before we adjourned for tea I was seeking to get across the fact that this amendment is seeking to make the Minister's whole approach a logical one. We are seeking here to help the Minister in devising legislation that would be at least logical having regard to the way he has responded to the debate here in the House.  Broadly speaking, his approach here in the House has been that on section 6 he seemed to have a closed mind as regards BBC 1 coming in here. The Minister has indicated this from <Col N="1323" /> the earlier remarks he made long before the introduction of the Bill and on Second Stage he indicated that this would be so.  In subsequent discussions on Committee Stage, and the reply indeed on Second Stage, the Minister indicated that if there was sufficient argument put forward he, as of now, has an open mind in regard to how he would implement section 6.  If sufficient argument was put up for various other solutions the Minister would agree to them and adopt an alternative to the mere automatic transmission of BBC 1.</P>
      <P>In that context why write in what is written in here in the section and is sought to be amended by our amendment on Report Stage?  What is written into section 4 is that this section, in relation to the complaints commission, shall not apply to anything rebroadcast by the authority pursuant to a direction given by the Minister under section 6 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1975 The complaints commission and all the paraphernalia of criteria, standards and functions that are set out in that section, which is a very major section in the Bill, are regarded as not applying to whatever the Minister does under section 6. What we are merely seeking to do in amendment No. 20 is to insert a new subsection that the commission may receive complaints that rebroadcasts transmitted by the authority did not comply with one or more of the requirements in section 18 (1).  In other words, that the commission may receive these complaints so that they would be apprised of public complaints in regard to the transmission of the second channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We understand that if the second channel is going to be BBC1 we cannot have all these procedures written in unless the Minister himself is going to take charge of BBC1, which of course is an outrageous proposition.  I doubt if the Minister can transport himself in that manner.  What we suggest in the further subsection of the amendment is that complaints under this section shall be considered by the commission in accordance with procedures laid down by the commission with the consent of the Minister.  This is a very rational <Col N="1324" /> approach that again gives the Minister the greatest degree of flexibility possible in approaching this matter and he has indicated in the course of this debate that he will be flexible.  If he is simply trying to ramrod through this House a Bill in which he is going to have BBC1 under section 6, then the section as it stands in regard to the complaints commission makes sense.  It makes sense because the Minister in that situation has to exempt any rebroadcast by the BBC, over which he does not have sufficient control.  We suggest a way out for him here in suggesting that we are not going to apply all the criteria in section 4 as regards the complaints commission and that he may instead receive complaints that might be even valuable in the context of BBC1.  But if the Minister has an open mind in the matter and if he is receptive to further suggestions and possible solutions to the dilemma in which he has found himself, then it is obvious that this subsection excluding the alternative channel from the functions of the commission altogether, is wrong in the context of the Minister agreeing to some other solution of his problem than the BBC 1 solution.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that if the Minister, after hearing various representations&mdash;indeed what has been advised to him by the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and other people such as broadcasters brought in here by the transport union to advise us on what we should do&mdash;adopts the attitude that whatever method of administering an alternative channel is selected by him, be it RTE 2 or another form of associated body, committee or board representing the single-channel areas will ensure that control is ultimately in Irish hands, then it is quite obvious that in that situation he must maintain the criteria and the functions that are embodied insection 4 and he should not have the exemption provision that he has in section 4 (2) (11). In other words, the complaints commission should apply to such an alternative channel just as much as it applies under the Act to channel 1.</P>
    <P>What we are seeking in our amendment is to get the Minister out of this trouble and have an amendment that <Col N="1325" /> will cover both avenues; in other words, if the Minister persists in this rather personalised approach of his in trying to push against a growing volume of opinion that rejects his view that it must be BBC 1, then at least under the amendment put down by Senator Yeats and myself the commission may receive complaints in regard to BBC and the complaints can be considered by the commission in accordance with procedure with which the commission and the Minister may agree.  In that situation the Minister can be enabled to monitor the whole running of the affairs of BBC 1 or at least monitor them from this end.  He will not be able to control them because they come from London, right up to the British national anthem at the end.  He will not be able to control that, but at least through the commission he can monitor the various BBC 1 programmes that are irrelevant, injurious or contrary to our national interests.</P>
    <P>Having received from the commission a report on these matters the Minister himself will then be in a better position to exercise the function which he undoubtedly has under section 6 and that is, of course, as he has said himself, to drop BBC 1 in its entirely.  The Minister is being helped in that area in that he will be enabled to drop BBC 1 in its entirely if he is satisfied from complaints that have come from the complaints commission that such is necessary or, alternatively, if he does not decide on BBC 1 he will have here a section on which he can rely to deal with the alternative RTE channel or whatever form of rebroadcasting under whatever form of Irish control he may introduce.  In that event what we have here in paragraph (b) will in effect become the rest of this section in that the procedures in regard to complaints under the subsection to be considered by the commission in regard to the alternative channel, if it is an Irish-controlled channel, will of course be the procedures as set out under section 4. That would appear to be common sense.</P>
    <P>The Minister is saved by this amendment on two fronts.  He can deal through this amendment in a flexible way with BBC 1 and, alternatively, in the event of an Irish-controlled or monitored <Col N="1326" /> alternative programme by RTE or otherwise he can also devise the procedures necessary here under section 4.  The Minister will get out of all his troubles by simply deleting subsection (11), exempting altogether the section from application to any rebroadcasting authorised under section 6.  He could do it that way.  He could delete that particular subsection.  He is not willing to do that and, therefore, we are suggesting an alternative method here which will enable the Minister to monitor the situation and to ensure that the complaints commission will be enabled to implement the whole spirit of the Minister's section 4.  The complaints commission may be able to do that by receiving complaints relating to rebroadcasts transmitted under the alternative channel and the procedures for the investigation of these complaints can be devised by procedures laid down by the commission with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>This would appear to be an eminently reasonable approach to what is a dilemma as far as the Minister is concerned.  Great stress has been laid on establishing a broadcasting complaints commission.  It occupies four pages of the legislation here and it is a very important section giving a safety valve to a complaints commission to ensure that the public interest, weal and public welfare are acknowledged and examined by an independent authority that will look into any such complaints.</P>
    <P>If this section becomes law we do not have an amendment of the kind I have mentioned.  Alternatively, we do not have a deletion in regard to exempting the alternative channel from the provision of this section.  This means that neither the Minister or the authority nor any alternative body that may be established will have any day-to-day complaints jurisdiction as it were or complaints interests in programmes broadcast over the second national airwave. So the second national airwave is being totally exempted from the functions, criteria and standards of the broadcasting complaints commission. That is the effect of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister may reply to me that if it is BBC 1 it is not practical to introduce it or to implement the functions here.  If <Col N="1327" /> it is BBC 1 it certainly is not practical to implement the full functions that the Minister has designated here for the complaints commission, but it would be practical as suggested in our amendment to receive complaints that rebroadcasts transmitted by the Authority did not comply with the requirements set out in section 4.  They could then be considered by the commission in accordance with procedures laid down by the commission with the consent of the Minister. This means, in effect, that one could ensure some monitoring of BBC 1 if it is retransmitted <i>in toto</i> by the Minister. It will also ensure that the Minister himself&mdash;as I said earlier we are trying to protect him and to prevent him from the anomalies in his own legislation&mdash; through the broadcasting complaints commission, as envisaged here by our amendment, will be enabled to see exactly in what way and in what manner BBC 1 is performing.</P>
    <P>The Minister can get out of his trouble in this respect.  He cannot enforce BBC 1 but at least he will be in a position to know how they are performing and operating and what percentage of complaints are coming through to the commission from Irish viewers.  He will know the general standard of BBC 1 programmes.  This, in my view, will be a very positive benefit to the Minister in the event of it being BBC 1.</P>
    <P>Going back to my first point, if the Minister is serious that there are other options in his mind then he will accept this amendment.  If there are other options in the Minister's mind the logical thing is either to remove the exemption that is incorporated there or insert the amendment which would meet the other alternative options and would meet the BBC situation also. Either by removing the exemption or by incorporating the amendment the Minister would be in a flexible position where all of the various options that he would envisage between now and the end of next year could be monitored and regulated and could be subject to the broadcasting complaints commission which he has set up.  In that way the Minister could be flexible in regard to what assessment he may make as to the <Col N="1328" /> performance of whatever alternative channel uses our national airwaves.</P>
    <P>I appreciate fully that if the Minister goes against all the clamour of public opinion and insists on imposing BBC 1 <i>in toto</i> he cannot enforce what is involved in the broadcasting complaints commission.  He has no ultimate power of doing so but at least he will be able to monitor the situation and thereby exercise the power that he talks so much about which he has in section 6 of the Act&mdash;the power of ultimately removing BBC 1 from the airwaves altogether.  In either or any of these situations our amendment would meet the case.</P>
    <P>Our amendment is only weak on the basis that the Minister has already made a preconceived decision to let in BBC 1 in any event and to hell with the lot of us.  It is only weak in that situation because then the importance of our amendment is accordingly diminished. If that decision has been made we are having BBC 1 and it will be there forever. It will dominate our airwaves and we will not have any broadcasting complaints commission to deal with it. If that is the attitude, the value of our amendment is considerably diminished although it has some value in monitoring. A Minister who might be sincere in monitoring programmes or broadcasting or rebroadcasting may wish to remove them from the airwaves after a period of time if they are not performing their functions properly.  If that is the Minister's attitude then our amendment has some value.  If he is merely making an assessment of BBC 1 and seeing how they perform, he will have the valuable assistance of his own broadcasting complaints commission.  He will be able to monitor what the performance is like.  Although I do not think it is practicable to consider removing something that is established and functioning for a number of years, at least it may have the value of forcing an intelligent Minister who has courage to remove BBC 1 if they are not performing satisfactorily after a certain period.  I agree that the value of our amendment has diminished in that respect.</P>
    <P>The value of our amendment accounts for nothing if there is now a predetermined attitude to have BBC 1 <Col N="1329" /> willy-nilly, irrespective of the consequences, not just to have BBC 1 for a trial period but to have it forever so that we are permanently little Britons. If that is the attitude of mind and if the predetermined decision has been made at this stage to have BBC 1 irrespective of the consequences, section 6 will never be invoked to remove it from the airwaves. If that is the attitude at this time, which I suspect it is, although it is not borne out by the Minister's words in this House, then our amendment unfortunately diminishes still further in its logicality and it practically disappears.</P>
    <P>The amendment has logic in the sphere of various options but it has no logic if the decision is (a) to have BBC 1, (b) to enforce it on the Authority under section 6 and (c) that the intention now is to have it not just for now but forever.  In this context the amendment diminishes considerably in value.  In any other context the amendment does have substantial value.</P>

Everybody <Col N="1330" /> knows that because the weight of money and so on will put them out of it. It seems the Minister wants in 1980 and 1990 that all little Irish children in Kerry and Donegal will go to bed happy at night once they hear God Save the Queen and once they see the Queen riding round on her horse as the final act of the day.  I have no objection to the Queen moving around in her own country.

      <P>The Minister may say he is not forcing them, but nothing has happened since this debate started which has led me to change in any way the opinions that I had at the beginning. It seems that the Minister, irrespective of what the trade unions, Radio Telefís Éireann and the general body of the people in the country may say, intends to have BBC in its entirety.  He put those words into section 6 to make sure that it would begin early in the morning and finish up late at night with a whole British outfit for all of Ireland.  That is exactly what is in it.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that all the Labour people will vote with the Government on this, because many of them have not been very anxious to come and take par in the divisions, but it seems that the Government will be able to carry this through.  Irish people who will be paying twice the licence they are paying now to listen to propaganda being rammed down their throats should have some body in this country to which they can complain.</P>
      <P>The only machinery for this is a broadcasting complaints commission. Our amendment proposes that such a commission should be allowed to hear complaints made by people who will be listening to this foreign service in their own homes.  As I said at the beginning, I am quite sure they will not have an alternative in 1980.</P>

      <P>A complaint is a complaint whether it is particular or otherwise. There should be some machinery whereby any citizen could make complaints against a broadcasting service, let it be Radio Éireann or a second channel.  Even if we have a second channel, which I hope we will have, but under Irish control, I would hope we would be able to complain about it if we felt like it.  After all, broadcasting is a very important medium, and very important to the nation.  I do not think control of it should be handed over in its entirely to anybody from outside this nation.</P>
      <P>If the Minister does not accept this amendment, he is giving 100 per cent control to BBC 1 to do what they like once they take over here.  He has the majority to do it.  Irish programmes will be controlled but we will have to put up with whatever we get from BBC 1.  The whole exercise we are going through here with these various amendments and so on may look to the outside world to be tremendously important, but so far as I am concerned it is a waste of time.  It is a matter of dilly dallying and going through the performance of debating the Bill.  It seems to me&mdash;and this has been borne out by something I read recently&mdash;that the Minister has been over in England already and he has been in consultation with these people.  I would like him to tell us whether he has fixed up all the legal details and can he broadcast BBC 1 in its entirely.</P>

      <P>A number of the amendments which have been put down, including certain amendments by Senator Yeats, have been very serious efforts to improve this Bill and have had that effect.  I should like to record once more my acknowledgment of that fact and of that contribution.  Some amendments put down&mdash;and this is one of them&mdash;have not at their core a real attempt to improve the Bill but are of what might be called, without offence I hope, a propagandist character.  That is to say, they are intended to reflect adversely on important sections of the Bill, notably on section 6, without being seriously intended as amendments which any Minister could accept.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan has spoken repeatedly in blandishing and kindly tones of his efforts to help me, to protect me and to offer me a way out. I should like to say that, if the Senator and his colleagues ever offer me a way out of anything, I will inspect that aperture of exit with considerable care before moving through it.  It was also said that the principle of open debate required acceptance of Senator Yeats's amendment.  I certainly do not see that. The principle of open debate demands that people honestly and clearly uphold the positions they believe to be right. They may change those if they are offered adequate argument against them or, in this case particularly, if it becomes apparent that public opinion demands a particular thing.  It certainly does not demand that one accepts a particular amendment.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan also referred to me as going against the clamour of public opinion.  I wonder am I going against the clamour of public opinion.  I do not intend to do so.  Indeed, I have been accused with I think a good deal more justice by some Senators, of being too respectful to the public wish and not giving a strong enough lead in the direction in which I believe it should go.</P>

      <P>It is very possible that public opinion is changing.  Public <Col N="1333" /> opinion sometimes does change, but we ought to listen carefully in that matter. We ought to employ all the means we can to find out what way public opinion is moving, above all, in what direction, in this case.  I do not accept editorial writers as necessarily representing public opinion.  They represent the views of the editors and sometimes of the managements of newspapers.  I think that is about all.</P>
      <P>Senator Dolan referred to people being forced to listen to broadcasts by the BBC if this Bill is passed and if I use the powers conferred on me in it. Should opinion decide in favour of rebroadcasting and should that be put into effect, what you will have will be RTE in its present form, in full competition with the BBC.  People who regard the BBC with that degree of abhorrence we hear from over there &mdash;nothing would persuade Senator Dolan to view the BBC, to listen to the BBC&mdash;will certainly tune into RTE and will watch RTE and nobody will force them to do anything else or anything they do not want to do.  There is no interference with their freedom at all. People cannot be forced to listen to broadcasts.  Those in Dublin and in other parts of the country, including I think the Senator's own area, who actually watch the BBC do so of their own free will.  Of course, the fact that they do so goes against certain attitudes held by Senators opposite, that is to say, that all things coming from a certain quarter are bad, but most people in this country do not actually take that view.  Indeed, many people who express that view publicly do not really hold it either and that has been brought out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me come more specifically to the amendment and I am sure the Chair will be grateful to me for that.  One point that has to be made is in reference to some of the things Senator Lenihan said in particular. If the second channel is provided other than by way of a rebroadcast service, and if it is handed over to RTE&mdash;this is relevant to the insinuation <Col N="1334" /> that I have closed my mind on this, which I have not&mdash;then sections 3 and 4 of the Bill would apply to it.  There is, therefore, no need in that connection to amend section 4 (18B) to provide that the broadcasting complaints commission would be in a position to deal with complaints about the second television service if these included rebroadcasts by RTE but did not involve the rebroadcast in its entirely of, say, BBC 1 or UTV.</P>
      <P>Of course a main reason why this amendment cannot be taken seriously is that it is clear that for live rebroadcast to become a reality two conditions have to be fulfilled.  One is that we have to establish that there is a consensus in favour of it.  I dealt with this at an earlier stage.  Senator Dolan was not here and I cannot go over that area again.  The other condition that has to be fulfilled is that it must be worked out in agreement with the BBC.  It is clear to people who have any practical experience that you could not attach as a condition to such negotiation the submission of rebroadcasting to a complaints commission here.  Senators opposite have every reason to say from their own point of view that they are against rebroadcasting but, to introduce an amendment such as this as a supposed means of improving a piece of legislation that does involve enabling power to rebroadcast is, I suggest, a bit unreal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implication in the amendment is that the authority would have editorial responsibility for the content of rebroadcast programmes and, in particular, that they would be required to answer to the complaints commission if any of the programmes are in breach of the restraints laid down in section 18 (1) of the 1960 Act inserted by section 3 of the Bill before the House. As I mentioned during Committee Stage, if it is decided to provide a choice of television programmes by rebroadcast of BBC 1, the programmes will be transmitted simultaneously as they are broadcast from the transmitter in Northern Ireland.  That was the subject of discussion under a previous amendment. RTE could not be held responsible for the content of them.  Accordingly, they should not be bound statutorily by the restraints laid down in <Col N="1335" /> section 3 (1) of this Bill.  The Senator's amendment in its present form, even if it were acceptable on other grounds, is, therefore, not suitable and I am sorry that I cannot accept it.</P>
    <P>I should like to reiterate, however, that the BBC and IBA are subject to much the same restraints as those provided for in section 3 of the Bill and there is no reason to assume that their programmes would be in conflict with the spirit of that section to any marked extent.  I should like to stress again that the fact that the complaints commission could not deal with complaints about rebroadcast programmes would not mean that people could not complain about them.  They would be quite free to do so, and it may be taken that the Minister would take serious notice of the position if complaints were of serious proportions.  The Government would, of course, always be free to arrange for cessation of the rebroadcast of any programme service at any time if they so wished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has brought forward in the proposition that the BBC would be rebroadcast by Telefís Éireann, a matter about which we have had so much discussion.  He speaks of Members from this side of the House having, as he puts it, an abhorrence of the BBC.  That, of course, is not the situation, nor has anybody suggested that that is the situation.  But we do&mdash; and I think it is fair to use the word in this context&mdash;have an abhorrence of the concept that a national Government, a national Minister, should come into a national Legislature and propose in this way that the second channel which is available to our national television service should be handed over to a foreign station.  We certainly have an abhorrence of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no abhorrence of the BBC. They are an excellent institution and, on the whole, they provide a very good service for British people.  To a much lesser extent they provide a good service for Irish people in the North of Ireland. To the extent of about 90 per cent I do not think their programmes are really suited to Irish people, either North or South of the Border.  We certainly have <Col N="1336" /> no abhorrence of the BBC.  They have been dragged into a totally false and difficult situation for them by the Minister.  I know of nobody from this side of the House who has an abhorrence of them.  It is not their fault that the Minister has invented this fantastic and eccentric notion.  English people to whom I mentioned this matter on the Continent recently expressed their utmost amazement that any Minister of a national Government would make such a proposition.  They thought it was, to say the least of it, eccentric.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this is of the nature of amendments that obviously one would not expect a Minister to accept or even to take seriously.  He ought to think very seriously indeed about the concept that if he does introduce this form of rebroadcasting, some independent, non-party, non-involved body should be in a position to have an idea at least of what kind of programmes were being broadcast over our television channel by the BBC.  The Minister says that the BBC and the IBA have their own codes of conduct, much the same as ours.  That may well be so, but does anyone, even the Minister, seriously suggest that on all occasions news broadcasts by the BBC, still less by the IBA, in so far as they relate to Irish events, are objective and impartial?  I am sure they are objective and impartial in so far as they relate to internal British affairs but I do not believe, and I do not believe that any Senator or the Minister himself would stand up and claim, that they are objective in relation to Irish affairs. They may sometimes be objective but on many occasions they are quite clearly neither objective nor impartial.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister seriously maintain that in accordance with the criteria laid down in section 3 of this Bill the BBC and the IBA are consistently, in their broadcast treatment of Irish current affairs, fair to all interests concerned, that they present broadcast matter relating to Ireland in an objective and impartial manner and without any expression of their own views?  We know perfectly well that their views and news about Ireland and their discussions about Ireland are frequently slanted and <Col N="1337" /> biased.  It is not surprising.  One could say the same about any national broadcasting concern.  One could say that perhaps, in certain instances our own broadcasting concern has an Irish slant and an Irish bias when we are talking about other countries.  These things are inevitable.  It is no use telling us that the BBC and the IBA have their own internal codes.  They are strictly internal codes, relating to British affairs, and they have nothing whatever to do with Ireland.  It is no use quoting this to us as a sort of safeguard that in fact there is no need to worry about what they will be saying about Irish affairs.</P>
    <P>We all know that on many occasions even in the recent past the BBC have broadcast matter which, as he puts it in section 3, &ldquo;may reasonably be regarded as being likely to promote or incite to crime or as tending to undermine the authority of the Irish State&rdquo;.  We know that consistently in all these respects their broadcasts of news, their treatment of current affairs and of matters of public controversy or public debate, do not comply with the criteria the Minister has laid down in section 3 of this Bill for our own television service.  The Minister knows that as well as anybody else.  He introduces section 6 into the Bill knowing that the material rebroadcast by the Authority&mdash;and bear in mind always that these rebroadcasts are transmitted to the Irish people by Radio Telefís Éireann, subsidised by the taxpayer, by the listeners or viewers, and by the advertisers of Ireland&mdash;will, as a matter of course, violate the criteria he lays down and insists must be observed by Radio Telefís Éireann's own Irish television and radio broadcasts. He would welcome a proposal which would attempt, at least in part, to deal with the difficulty this creates, a sort of vacuum left as a result of the inability of the Government or anyone else to apply section 3 directly to the BBC.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting in this amendment that the BBC should be subject to the strictures laid upon the Authority in section 3, nor am I suggesting that the BBC should be subject to being cross-examined by the commission, nor am I suggesting that the Authority&mdash; and this is a matter the Minister seems to misunderstand&mdash;should be subject in <Col N="1338" /> this respect to being cross-examined by the commission.  I say merely that the commission may receive complaints that rebroadcasts transmitted by the authority did not comply with one or more of the requirements of section 3 of this Bill.  The word &ldquo;Authority&rdquo; only comes in because I refer to rebroadcasts transmitted by the Authority.  There is nothing that says the Authority shall be called upon to reply, to make explanations, or condemned or criticised in any way by the commission.  The authority simply do not come into it.  It refers to them in an incidental way only to describe the nature of the rebroadcast.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (b) I propose that: &ldquo;Complaints under this subsection shall be considered by the Commission in accordance with procedures laid down by the Commission with the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;  I thought I would bring in the Minister so that he could ensure that it was done in a way which would not interfere with his various susceptibilities.  The Minister said in his reply that he and his Department would be keeping an eye on these rebroadcasts.  It is nice to know that, but nonetheless it seems more satisfactory, more reasonable, more common-sensical that this independent body the Minister himself is creating should consider these matters.  Maybe there will be no complaints: maybe everyone will be happy: maybe, on the other hand, there will be complaints.  People would much prefer, if there are complaints about the nature of these rebroadcasts, that they should be made to an independent commission rather than to a Minister, particularly a Minister who, in this instance, is dedicated apparently to the concept of foreign broadcasts being distributed throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would visualise the procedures to be adopted under this amendment, as being simply that the commission would receive these complaints.  They would consider whether in their view they were justified.  They would write to the complainant to this effect.  In accordance with the Minister's amendment we passed earlier today, they could publish their views on these matters. Their views, obviously, would have no effect on the BBC, but they could have an effect on the Irish public and on <Col N="1339" /> the Minister in showing over the years whether, in fact, there was general agreement with the way in which the rebroadcasts were going or general disapproval.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said repeatedly that, if the BBC do not give satisfaction, the broadcasting can be stopped.  Who is to decide, and how is it to be decided, whether or not these broadcasts have given satisfaction?  I do not think it ought to be left to this or any other Minister to decide on an individual basis as to whether in his view these broadcasts should be continued.  Obviously ultimately he has the authority under section 6 to withdraw or change his direction.  Some kind of independent guidance is needed, some kind of independent body which could consider these matters and issue periodical reports giving their views on these broadcasts.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the truth of the matter is that the Minister has made up his mind long since that he wants to have rebroadcasts. He wants to ensure that the entire BBC programme is rebroadcast with no additions, deletions, not even a variation of an hour.  The concept of simultaneity is being elevated to the status of a new religion, as I have already said.  None of the restrictions laid on RTE are to apply to them.  No one, except perhaps the Minister in an informal way and in secret, is to give any kind of official consideration as to the nature of these broadcasts.  He has decided all these matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister repeatedly speaks of public opinion.  I was rather surprised, although pleased, to hear him in his recent reply saying that this would only go through if there was a consensus in favour of it.  A consensus to me means that the great bulk of the people agree. Until now I was under the impression that if 51 per cent were in favour he would go through with it.  I now find from his recent statement that it must be a consensus which is encouraging because, whatever about a 51 per cent majority, I cannot see that he will get any kind of consensus on this proposal.</P>
    <P>He speaks repeatedly of public opinion in the single-channel area.  He speaks as if some sort of huge spontaneous <Col N="1340" /> demand suddenly sprang out of the soil like mushrooms after a rainy day calling: &ldquo;BBC 1, BBC 1, we want BBC 1.&rdquo;  Nobody ever thought of rebroadcasting BBC 1 until the Minister dragged it up out of the recesses of his own mind.  The broadcasting review committee received some 120 representations from individuals and organisations. As I understand it, only one of this 120 referred to the BBC.  The whole concept of the BBC, this so-called spontaneous demand, was originated by the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>Apparently having originated this, he is determined to ram it through, at least through the Oireachtas, without giving way in the slightest.  He has made changes of detail in the Bill which I think have improved it.  But, on the basic question of section 6 he has remained completely unbending and unyielding.  He has not been willing to make any minor change except for the one single one when he accepted Senator Horgan's amendment about the debate in the House of the Oireachtas which we will be coming to later on another amendment.</P>

On issues such as the one raised by this amendment, where one merely asks for some kind of consideration to be given to the nature of rebroadcasts, he has refused to budge in any way.  Apparently the BBC are to go ahead with these broadcasts over the Irish airwaves without any sort of scrutiny from any source except perhaps the Minister himself.  One can only regret that he is not prepared to accept this amendment.  It seems to me to be the minimum requirement that would seem to be essential.</P>

      <P>In the course of the Committee Stage debate I promised to consider the point made by Senator Yeats that it might be desirable, in some cases, for the commission to consider complaints which are withdrawn. I accept the force of his argument but, on the other hand, the essential function of the commission is to deal with unsatisfied complaints.  It must be assumed, generally speaking, that a person who withdraws a complaint is no longer an unsatisfied complainant.  Accordingly, a blanket mandate to the commission to deal with complaints that have been withdrawn seems inappropriate.  Amendments Nos. 21 and 23 would give a qualified mandate to the commission to deal with complaints that have been withdrawn. I hope they will be acceptable to Senators and, in particular, as meeting the general intent of Senator Yeat's amendment which, in its form as amendment No. 22, I am unable to accept because of commitment to amendments Nos. 21 and 23.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" />&ldquo;18C.&mdash;As soon as may be after the end of each year, the Commission shall make to the Minister a report of its activities during that year and the report shall contain particulars of all decisions made by it pursuant to this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have argued this out in some detail already, and I made a reference to it on amendment No. 18, which may have been marginally disorderly, but was not intended to be so.  It is important that the commission should publish some information about all the complaints they hear during the year. I certainly would not be prepared to press this amendment if we got an undertaking from the Minister that between now and the time the Bill finally becomes law he will at least consider the statutory inclusion in the annual report of the commission of at least the total number of complaints considered by them.  The report may contain details of three complaints and, unless there is some provision of this kind, we are not to know whether the total number of complaints was three, 30, or 300.</P>
    <P>In favour of the widest possible amount of publication by the commission subject to good sense, we could consider, for example, the precedent set by the National Prices Commission which have very often printed in their appendices details of statements made to them by persons in support of their particular claim for price increases.  We can see there can be a very valuable public and publicity role played by a commission which adopt a wide and generous policy of publishing on all matters under their concern.  I am prepared to accept that there may be particular cases in which it will be invidious for some reason or another to give details of individual complaints, but I feel there should be a statutory responsibility on the commission to give an indication of the total number of complaints considered by them during the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister earlier introduced an amendment saying that &ldquo;where complaints have been decided by the commission, they should give whatever information they see fit about <Col N="1343" /> it&rdquo;.  This is in advance of the issuing of the annual report and 18C (1) states:</P>
      <P>The report shall contain such statements (if any) as the Commission thinks fit giving particulars of decisions made by it.</P>
      <P>My first amendment proposes simply to add the word &ldquo;all&rdquo;.  It seems reasonable that where the commission have made a decision some information should be given in the annual report.  Under this subsection they are entitled to give such statements, if any, as the commission think fit.  They can decide in a particular case not to give such statements.  The word &ldquo;all&rdquo; added would show that the intention is that all decisions made by the commission shall be referred to in some fashion in the annual report.  It would be very undesirable to have a situation where the commission had received a complaint, and made a decision and no reference was made to it in the annual report.  There may be cases when a complaint has been rejected and for some reason, the commission felt they ought not to mention it, but I should imagine these would be very, very rare and we ought, I think, establish the general principle that all decisions made by the commission should be referred to in the annual report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment deals with a related matter though it is not quite on all-fours with this.  It relates to particulars of complaints.  The section, as it stands, refers to decisions made but it does not refer to complaints.  It would seem desirable that, where complaints have been made to the commission, as a general rule the commission should include these in the annual report.  I followed the lines the Minister has: &ldquo;The report shall contain such statements (if any) as the Commission thinks fit giving particulars of complaints made to it.&rdquo;  The commission have the power in exceptional cases not to refer to specific complaints&mdash;for example, if a complaint was held to be frivolous.  It seems desirable that, besides giving particulars of all decisions made by them in the annual report, they should also refer to all complaints made to them in the annual report as a general rule.  If the Minister feels that there <Col N="1344" /> could be cases where either decisions or complaints ought not be mentioned the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo;, which are in his text and in my amendment, would cover that situation.  I urge him to accept these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate on amendment No. 18 I mentioned why I considered it undesirable to require publication by the commission of particulars of every decision.  In some cases it could be undesirable to do so where the complaint involved a question of intrusion on privacy.  Section 18C, as it stands, provides that the commission must submit an annual report on their activities during the year which would contain particulars of decisions made, if the commission think fit.  The report must contain particulars of decisions not accepted by RTE.  Admittedly provision for mandatory publication of decisions not accepted by RTE creates the problem I mentioned in the case of complaints dealing with intrusion of privacy.  It seems unlikely, however, that a serious complaint of intrusion or encroachment on privacy in which the commission found in favour of the complainant would be contested by the Authority.  In the event of their contesting such a decision, however, publication of particulars of it in the annual report would seem desirable despite the risk involved of further encroachment on privacy.  If such a risk existed I am sure the commission would be able to minimise it, if not eliminate it altogether, in their report of the decision. Accordingly, I think on the whole that section 18C as it stands is adequate.  The point has been made that the commission should give particulars of the total numbers of complaints they dealt with. I think it would be surprising if the commission did not give particulars of the total number in their report seeing they are bound to report on their activities during the year under section 18C as it stands.  On the face of it that would cover the total number of complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not feel very strongly on this matter and I am prepared to look at some new points made by Senator Horgan and Senator Yeats in the course of their statements.  I am prepared to look at the matter again while this Bill <Col N="1345" /> continues its progress through the Oireachtas.  For the general reasons indicated in my comments on Senator Horgan's amendment, I am not inclined to favour Senator Yeats's first amendment either but, as I say, I will think over their arguments.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Yeats's second amendment, I am not convinced it is necessary to make statutory provision that the commission give particulars in their annual report of complaints made to them which they did not investigate because they decided they were frivolous or vexatious.  The commission would, of course, be quite free to include such particulars if they thought this was, desirable under subsection (1) of 18C which provides that the commission shall make to the Minister a report of their activities during the year.</P>
    <P>I regret accordingly I cannot see my way at present to accepting this amendment.  Again, I appreciate the reasons for this but Senators who have complained about the great elaboration of the functions of the commission show themselves disposed to elaborate them still further.  We have to try to strike a balance.</P>

      <P>If I attempted to elaborate on the functions of the commission it would not necessarily be the same thing as elaborating on their procedures, which is what the Bill does in a way I found both unpleasant and unnecessary.  I am grateful for the spirit in which the Minister has welcomed the observations made, especially about this view of the total number of complaints made.  There are really just two ways of doing what we propose. One way is for the Minister to undertake at some stage to bring what he has just said to the notice of the commission when he sets it up.  This is perhaps an informal way of doing it.  The other way is making a very minor surgical amendment to the Bill at some stage to make this a very modest statutory requirement. I myself would prefer the second, but I would leave it to the Minister to decide which is the more appropriate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 22 and 23, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>This is a very small matter.  It is more a question of what one might describe as common sense in legislation than anything else.  I raised it on the Committee Stage, though not as an amendment. The last paragraph of section 5, the section that deals with the informal advisory committee to advise the Authority, says:</P>
      <P>An adviser under this section shall advise the Authority whenever requested by the Authority.</P>
      <P>For practical purposes this paragraph has existed since the Principal Act of 1960 and, while it is not the Minister's own particular baby, I would ask him to throw out this baby now that he has the chance.  On the face of it, it seems silly to provide in some detail in this section that committees be set up to give advice; members are to be appointed to the committee, presumably with their consent, and would attend meetings and then an adviser, under this section, shall advise the Authority whenever requested by the Authority. Does this mean that he is in some kind of breach under the Act if he refuses to advise either because he object to advising on a particular issue or he is just too lazy to bother?  It seems to me self-evident that, if you have agreed to be a member of an advisory committee, when you are asked to advise you are likely to do so and, if you do not, it sounds a good idea to put you off the committee and replace you with somebody who will.  To put it solemnly as an injunction in a piece of legislation that an adviser shall advise when requested to seems rather unnecessary.  I would suggest it could conveniently be dropped.</P>

      <P>I have considered this point since the Senator raised it on Committee Stage and I am satisfied the paragraph should be retained in the Bill.  If it were deleted an adviser would be statutorily entitled to retain his position for the period for which he was originally appointed irrespective of whether or not he gave any advice to the Authority.  Admittedly, <Col N="1347" /> it is unlikely that a person who accepted a position as adviser would subsequently refuse to give advice when requested to do so, but it could happen, and subsection (3) (b) provides the necessary power for the Authority to compel the adviser to give advice in such an eventuality.  I am sorry I cannot accept the Senator's amendment.</P>
      <P>The Senator poured a certain amount of scorn on this section which he apparently regarded as inherently somewhat ridiculous.  I should like to point out to him that the subsection the Senator wishes to delete is identical with section 3 (b) of section 21 of the 1960 Act.  The need for amendment of section 21 of the 1960 Act arose solely because it was decided that the Authority, rather than the Minister, should have power to appoint advisory committees and advisers.  The Senator has advised me to throw out this baby. I would point out to him that the baby is some 15 years old and of impeccable Fianna Fáil parentage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Both on the Committee Stage and now I pointed this out to the Minister.  I explained with some care on the Committee Stage, in case there should be any doubt in the matter, that he was indeed a Fianna Fáil baby dating from 1960 and I repeat that now. I am perfectly well aware it was.  I also said on Committee Stage that I was not at that time a Member of the Seanad so that I was in no position at that time to complain.  This is the first time since 1960 that this particular subsection has come before me and on the first opportunity, therefore, open to me, I am complaining about its lack of common sense.  I do not follow at all the Minister's reasons for not accepting this.  As I understand it, he has said that, if this paragraph were to be deleted, the adviser could remain an adviser and member of the committee forever. I do not see that.  An adviser under this section&mdash;paragraph (a) of subsection (3)&mdash;shall unless he previously dies or resigns continue as adviser for the period determined by the authority when appointing him, and no longer, but shall be eligible for reappointment. If in fact he consistently refuses to advise, he cannot apparently be put off <Col N="1348" /> the committee.  He has to stay there until his time is up when, I take it, the authority will not reappoint him even though he may be eligible for reappointment. That is all that happens.  It happens whether or not this paragraph exists.  If deleted that is still the position. He can remain until his term is up but equally, if he is there and he does not advise, he cannot be removed unless he resigns.</P>
      <P>I do not follow the Minister's point. I am not pressing this because obviously it is of no practical interest, but it seems rather silly to have a paragraph like this which means nothing, which contributes nothing, which appears to lay some kind of legal obligation on someone to advise when he has already agreed to be on an advisory committee. However, it looks as if this original Fianna Fáil baby is now going to remain as a Coalition baby too and I can only regret the lasting powers of the child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 25, to delete &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A further contribution to this central core of the Bill might tend to be repetitious and I should like to try to avoid that and to concentrate on the basic principle involved in this amendment, namely, to remove &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; from subsection (1) of section 6.  It comes back to some extent to a theme we have aired already but it is also relevant in this context.  The Minister is seeking to circumscribe himself in this section, in particular in regard to subsection (1).  If the amendment is accepted the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; would be deleted and the section would read accordingly:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Authority, direct the <Col N="1349" /> Authority to rebroadcast a service of programmes specified in the direction and broadcast from any source other than the Authority and so specified.</P>
    <P>What we object to here, and I want to say it once again, is not the rebroadcasting of BBC programmes, not the rebroadcasting of a substantial proportion of BBC or any other programmes from any other broadcasting service but to the rebroadcasting of programmes in their entirely, run by a station controlled by another country. The phrase &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; in this section effectively prevents the Minister, once he has launched the particular service in its entirety, from interfering with that service short of withdrawing his direction and dropping the service completely.  That is the legal position. The Minister would agree with me in that.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister circumscribe himself by having the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; inserted here?  Surely again, and this fits in with the attitude towards another amendment earlier on, it would be much better, if the Minister is serious about his declared intention to be flexible about this whole matter between now and the end of next year, not to have the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; included in subsection (1) of section 6. The Minister could then direct the Authority to rebroadcast a service of programmes.  That might not be a bad idea if there was a second channel under Irish control and the Minister might take the view that the particular service of programmes should be rebroadcasted by that alternative channel.  That might be a point of view.  Indeed, I would envisage, as I said on all Stages of this Bill, the alternative channel carrying a substantial number of programmes from the various BBC programmes and UTV programmes, carrying them simultaneously, carrying them live.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear this is not a debate between RTE and BBC 1. This is not a debate between the multi-channel and the single-channel viewers. This is a debate fundamentally, as I have said on another section, about who in the last analysis controls the alternative channel, who decides on the programmes, who decides how to so organise the second channel so that it will <Col N="1350" /> complement the first and thereby ensure that the Irish viewing public will get maximum viewing and the best service.</P>
    <P>That is what this whole debate is about.  This whole debate fundamentally is embodied in this amendment in so far as one can get a nugget out of the Bill relevant to the basic principle of the Bill. That nugget is in these three words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo;.  They mean that the Minister will direct the Authority to rebroadcast an entire service of programmes from the first children's hour programme to <i>God Save the Queen</i> at the end of the day.  That will be the entire programme.  Excellent programmes and drivel, the whole lot broadcast willy nilly, without any power of discrimination, without any distinction or any separation.  The Minister has emphasised BBC 1 as being the one he would adopt if he was going to rebroadcast a service &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All sorts of options are open to the Minister if he deletes the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo;.  I mentioned some of the options earlier on.  It can be a straightforward RTE second channel.  It can be based on the single channel area. Senator Russell challenged me earlier on the costings involved in establishing an alternative channel based on a single channel area with a committee or some body associated in some way with the running of RTE 1 so that the programmes would not be competitive to a wasteful degree but would complement each other.  Senator Russell challenged me to state whether or not this would represent an enormous cost.</P>
    <P>RTE have some very interesting costings in their report.  BBC 1 represents the most expensive of the various options open to the Minister in this matter of providing a second channel. Indeed the Minister himself, as he has stated here and elsewhere, cannot at this stage given us an assessment of the costings.  We are entirely at the mercy of whatever BBC 1 may indicate in regard to costings, in regard to price, if they agree to it at all.  I am certain that there will be a growing reluctance on the part of the BBC to any participation in the matter which appears to have been largely gestated in the mind of the Minister and does not appear to have had any germination whatever in thought from the BBC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> If the Minister is in some way trying to enforce or persuade BBC 1 to come in here as unwilling partners he is doing something very foolish.  He can be held up easily to ransom if he tries to persuade unwilling partners to rebroadcast their system &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo;.  The Minister will certainly be on a very weak side of the bargaining table in regard to the cost the unwilling partner will demand.  If the Minister is open to other options and other arguments why have the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; been incorporated here in subsection (1) of section 6?  If rebroadcasting on the second channel is to be rational rebroadcasting, rather than the holus bolus acceptance of what comes from another State service, then the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; can be deleted.</P>
    <P>Whatever rebroadcasting the Minister may direct would be of programmes specified in the direction.  It can include a varied service of programmes, not just coming in their entirety from one particular broadcasting service, but coming from a number of broadcasting services. That is why, I respectfully submit, these words represent the kernel of this Bill.  If deleted, as we suggest in this amendment, it would mean that the Minister, in a far freer and flexible way, would be in a position to exercise the various options open to him over the next 12 to 18 months.</P>
    <P>However, I cannot avoid the belief that the Minister is not serious&mdash; although he has not expressed himself as such&mdash;about leaving himself open to accept options.  If he was serious in this respect, he would delete the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo;.  Once those words are in, the Minister is committed to a service derived entirely from an alternative station, and transmitted from an outside State service.  The Minister said that would be the alternative he would broadcast on the second channel.  I am trying to get him away from that over committment.  If the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; are deleted then the Minister has the option to take the best from BBC 1, BBC 2, UTV, European or North American programmes and services, and combine them into one sensible alternative channel that would complement the present RTE 1.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> If the Minister persists in including these words, I have to doubt his sincerity when he says that this matter is open to debate and that the options are open until the end of next year, because there are no options open if the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; are included. These words mean that the Minister must take in, willy nilly, without discernment or criticism, a programme that may be good in some respects but can contain an enormous amount of trivia, totally unrelated to Irish circumstances. That is why I doubt the sincerity of the Minister when he says that he has his options open in the matter.</P>
    <P>We are seeking in this amendment to ensure that the Minister will, under legislation, be seen to be empowered to keep his options open over the next 12 to 18 months.  If the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; remain in this subsection of section 6 it means that the reality of the situation, no matter what the Minister may protes to the contrary, is that the Minister is not keeping his options open, that he has a closed mind, that a decision has been taken, the issue has been predetermined and we are going to have BBC 1 whether the Irish people like it or not.</P>
    <P>A growing volume of opinion has arisen against the Minister's measure since its introduction in the Seanad.  In his introductory speech the Minister asked for critical and constructive comment and got it.  He got it from the six university Senators, every one of whom voted with the Fianna Fáil group in the various debates and divisions.  We had a strong expression of views from the trade union movement.  An excellent seminar was organised by the Irish Transport and General Workers Union over the weekend in which the Finnish communicator, Dr. Tapio Varis, one of the leading television experts in the world, spoke on his paper &ldquo;The Subtle Imperialism&rdquo;.  This paper set out, for delegates representing the Workers' Union of Ireland, the Irish Film Workers' Association, the Irish Actors' Equity and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union the dangers that exist, particularly for a small country like ours in the middle of the Anglo-American information commercial stream, the severe and serious <Col N="1353" /> difficulties with which we would be faced if we rebroadcast in its entirety a service of programmes specified in the directions made by the Minister.  We object strongly to the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo;.  We are not going to be driven into an artificial disagreement with the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not object to a substantial number of excellent BBC programmes being incorporated in an Irish second channel.  They show some of the best world affairs programmes which obviously we could not afford, such as &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo;.  There are excellent sporting programmes throughout Britain and the world which we cannot afford because of the cost of sending equipment and personnel.  It is common sense to borrow these programmes and incorporate them in our alternative channel.  By incorporating the best in BBC&mdash;it is quite easy to assess the best and to get the programmes that have a reasonably high TAM rating with Irish viewers&mdash;in an alternative channel that would be complementary to the existing RTE channel, we will not be engaged in wasteful competition.  That is why I want to emphasise that this is not an argument of RTE versus BBC.  This is not just an old-fashioned, jingoistic, argument that everything coming from Britain is bad.  That is not so.  I object to the BBC programme, the State programme of another country, being rebroadcast in its entirety, without anything being taken from it, diminished or cut out.</P>
    <P>BBC being transmitted here automatically without any Irish control, or monitoring on the Irish air waves is, as I said, unprecedented in the world today.  We will be the only country in the world&mdash;including the Banana Republics in South America and the newly-emerging countries in Africa&mdash;with one single State channel and who, after 55 years of independence, took the retrograde step of allowing the State service of another country&mdash;in this case a powerful country with the whole Anglo-American culture behind it&mdash;to be rebroadcast on our second channel. We are doing this at a time when that neighbouring state is already devolving its powers in television into cultural regions within its own community, and <Col N="1354" /> where Welsh television is now being established by the British state as an independent television service, under its own state control to preserve Welsh culture.</P>
    <P>One of the great weapons of the modern world for good or ill is telecommunications. Each sovereign, independent state has certain rights in regard to their air waves.  We have sovereign rights over our air waves. We have sovereign rights over the various television wave bands that operate within our control.  We are now proposing to hand over a substantial proportion of those air wave rights &ldquo;in their entirety&rdquo;&mdash;to use the words that we are seeking to delete&mdash;to the services of a neighbouring foreign station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we are talking about the deletion of the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; from section 6, subsection (1), and saying that those words represent the heart and the nub of this Bill.  Our objections to the Bill have often been misrepresented but, as far as people in the single-channel areas are concerned, I wish to see them getting what is available to the people in the rest of the country.  I am certain that aim can be achieved by having, in the single-channel area, an alternative system that will incorporate everything good the people in the single-channel area see on BBC 1 and other channels.  They do not want to see the trivia broadcast by BBC 1.  That is what is meant by the three words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo;.  What we are suggesting here is that &ldquo;The Subtle Imperialism&rdquo;&mdash;to quote the phrase used at the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union seminar&mdash;involved in rebroadcasting <i>in toto,</i> the programmes from an alternative station run by another state is seriously damaging.  It can show up our weaknesses, be they cultural, social, economic or financial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, we are an independent sovereign State.  We have interests that run counter, in many instances, to British interests.  We have a very positive divergence of opinion within our own island on the North of Ireland problem.  We are very well <Col N="1355" /> aware of that.  There is no doubt about it, the British case in regard to the North of Ireland is totally different from ours. The Minister may think that by having BBC 1 <i>in toto</i> he may water down the Irish person's view of the Irish case. That could be one rather sinister reason for having the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; incorporated in this subsection.  If BBC 1 is rebroadcast in its entirety, propaganda and all, and if &ldquo;The Subtle Imperialism&rdquo; comes over our air waves, then the average Irishman's appreciation of an Irish Government's case in regard to the North may be very subtly eroded. That is one reason.</P>
    <P>There is also the common agricultural policy.  With our backs to the walls, we are fighting with our French friends in particular, and with our Danish friends to make sure that the high price agricultural structure which exists for producers within the EEC is maintained. While we are experiencing total opposition from the British in this respect, BBC 1 will be rebroadcast in its entirety into every Irish home, on our State wave lengths, and can carry the subtle message of the British consumer into every town in this country&mdash;that cheap food is good and we should not be paying high prices to agricultural producers. I mentioned that as an example of total conflict between the British and the Irish case.</P>
    <P>Now we, as a sovereign Parliament, are suggesting that a sovereign Irish Government should hand over those air waves to the State service of a country whose interests conflict with our own. It is no argument to suggest that BBC 1 is already seen in various parts of the eastern part of Ireland, because (a) it is a spill over, (b) it arises from the licensing of certain television operations and (c) at the present time there is very bad viewing, even in the multi-channel areas.  All this would be changed completely if we got equal strength viewing of BBC 1 and RTE.  Because of competition, our single national channel will gradually diminish in importance, strength and appeal as far as advertisers are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not in any way reflecting on RTE 1, but without an alternative Irish controlled channel to complement it, <Col N="1356" /> and avoid competition, it could not compete with the advertisement-free, fully-beamed, fully directed BBC 1 television channel.  There is no comparison between the two programmes. Without any discredit to ourselves television tends to be an area of massive expenditure in regard to investment, both on equipment, and the large number of highly paid personnel and so on.  It can be done by BBC 1 because of a substantial base of 17 million people.  It cannot be done by RTE on a base of 3 million people.  It is as simple as that, particularly if you circumscribe RTE 1 by having the highly-based, highly organised channel competing directly with it, in its entirety.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;God Save the Queen&rdquo; will emerge as the National Anthem instead of &ldquo;The Soldier's Song&rdquo;.  It is a very rational development.  That can easily happen because of that decision I suggest that a rational development will flow from an irrational decision.  If the irrational decision is made to include the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; in section 6, subsection (1), then the rational development is the one I mentioned.  RTE 1 will become an irrelevancy.</P>
    <P>That is what was agitating the various unions concerned at their seminar over the weekend, because they see the rational development from the Minister's irrationality, in terms of jobs, in the running down of RTE 1, and the elevation of BBC 1 in the course of time to be the principal and then the only channel operated in this country.</P>
    <P>The way to rationalise our limited resources is to take the rational step in the first instance&mdash;and the rational step is incorporated in our amendment: to delete the three words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; and thereby give the Minister and the Authority the wide range of choice that would be open to them in having an alternative programme that would dovetail into the existing programme.</P>
    <P>I do not mind if that alternative programme is controlled in the present single-channel areas, if it is established in Cork or Limerick or Galway.  I do not mind if there is a committee or body representative of people in those areas, set up to supervise it as long as these people are Irish people and the programme will dovetail in with RTE in a <Col N="1357" /> sensible manner.  In that way, one can make viable the two Irish-based channels and ensure they will not be competing in a wasteful manner.  We will be able to stand up to the BBC situation which will continue to exist as cable television expands and BBC programmes will be broadcast holus bolus&mdash;we cannot stop that&mdash;but RTE 1 and the second Irish-controlled channel will be able to complement each other and present a viable, vigorous alternative to BBC 1. This amendment is designed to help the Minister and to ensure that he does not completely commit himself to one programme coming in its entirety.</P>

      <P>The point has been strongly made in this House that in some way the Minister is still reserving to himself&mdash;which he is, of course&mdash;an effective power to direct the second channel, operated by BBC, at some future date.  I agree that, theoretically, the Minister has that power under section 6, but I would question that power on two grounds.  First of all, as a matter of practicality, once BBC 1 is operating on our second channel the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, even if he wanted to, could not turn them off without very serious difficulty.  The present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would have no interest in turning them off anyway.  I believe he is committed to rebroadcasting BBC 1 in its entirety for political reasons and for reasons that are not associated with the merits of television but are basically associated with &ldquo;The Subtle Imperialism&rdquo;, to quote the title of the Irish Transport Union Symposium, of making us all little Britons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fundamentally, the Minister thinks this is one way to solve the Irish <Col N="1358" /> problem.  As long as he keeps the three words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; which we seek to delete from section 6 (1) he has a closed mind, has already determined his approach, and is determined to rebroadcast BBC 1, if the BBC allow him. However, I have a very real reason to believe they will not.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not succumbing to particular pressures which he alleges exist in the single-channel areas.  He positively wants BBC 1 and that is the only rationale for incorporating &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; in this subsection.  He would be delighted to overcome every obstacle that might exist to bring BBC in as a second Irish channel.  He believes this is philosophically, culturally and politically desirable; that it is necessary and good for us.  Otherwise, there is no rational for what he is doing here. Talking in terms of keeping his options open, of having an open forum and free discussion on this matter over the next 18 months before he makes his final decision under section 6, is a mere smokescreen.  All my information is that the Minister's intentions to drag us into this situation are not going to succeed, because the BBC with their traditional British cuteness, will not be dragged by the Minister into an Irish row.  The BBC will not agree with the Minister, from a union point of view, because the unions will insist that the BBC unions do not co-operate and they will queer the Minister's pitch in that direction. That process has already started.  The BBC are a very conservative British establishment and it is not their form to get involved in an imbroglio such as this.  Even if the Minister wants to make us all little Britons, my view is that the BBC have no desire to participate in that mission field.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not yet given one iota of hard evidence to the Irish public that serious negotiations, or discussion even, have commenced with the BBC authorities or with his counterpart in the British Government, the Postmaster-General.</P>

      <P>I should like to know from the Minister what serious exchange of views and discussions have commenced with his counterpart in the British Government, or with the British Broadcasting Corporation, on the feasibility of or the manner in which BBC 1 will be transmitted into Ireland, and on what terms.  Is the Minister capable of disputing the very positive date in the RTE Authority report published a fortnight ago, in which they set out the expenditure involved bringing BBC 1 in here?  They said it would be double the cost of RTE 2 being operated by the Authority.  I should like the Minister to give his views on this, either here or in some other public place.  The Minister has been remarkably coy about stating what consultations he has had with his British Government counterpart, what discussions have taken place, what area of costs he feels is involved in this because unless and until that emerges, we cannot have any real assessment of the situation.  The Authority have done it in detail in their report on the second channel.  The Minister is aware of the figures.  I am precluded from going into them here, but they have set out a case which roughly means that a second Irish channel&mdash;they, of course, want an RTE channel, but there is nothing final on that, it might be operated by some other body&mdash;would cost half the price of a BBC channel.  We have had no financial facts from the Minister yet to dispute the case of the RTE Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be aware, at least in broad outline, of the nature of the fee or charges which will have to be paid to the BBC 1 for the complete use of our airways, together with RTE 1.  We would like information from the Minister on that because a lot will depend on the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; in subsection (1) of section 6.  In their document RTE said that specific programmes can be obtained at a reasonable charge, which is what we have been suggesting all along, but that to rebroadcast in its entirety would be a highly expensive <Col N="1360" /> operation.  I am certain that BBC 1 are not going to risk coming in here seeking to educate the Irish people in the British mould, which is a rather daunting task, without a very substantial fee.  They well understand the sort of antipathy they would be working up <i>vis-à-vis</i> their trade unions and <i>vis-à-vis</i> other people in the Irish political situation.  They are well aware of the area of disturbance they would be getting themselves involved in in seeking to make an arrangement of this kind with the Minister.</P>
    <P>This smokescreen was thrown out by the Minister two years ago in an emotional period after the change of government.  But the Minister is now coming to the crunch of reality.  My bet is that the Minister, even if he wants to force the BBC to come in here and make us little Britons, will not be able to do so, that he will not be in a position to negotiate or request the BBC to come to Ireland and record BBC 1 in its entirety on our airwaves.  I think we will get a situation where the Minister will get a very polite &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope the Irish national cause will be served in that manner by the good sense of BBC 1 against an Irish Minister seeking to erode a national cause by invoking BBC 1 to come here on some mission to make us all little Britons.  I would suggest to the Minister that the way he can meet the situation in this section, and maintain his open approach, which he says he wishes to maintain, is by deleting the three words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo;.  This will allow him the opportunity to exercise the options available to him if BBC do not want to come in, or if he changes his mind about their coming in or if he wants to have some service of programmes from a number of television stations.  All these options can be open to him by deleting the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; from subsection (1) of section 6.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment in that spirit.  It forms the heart and core of this Bill and at this late stage I would ask the Minister to take this matter seriously, which has not been done so far.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Senator Lenihan very carefully for the past half hour or more I should like to <Col N="1361" /> bring back a sense of reality into the discussion.  There was talk about subtle imperialism, little Englanders, West Britons and so on.  It seems to me to ignore the fact that Senator Lenihan and others fortunate enough to live on the east coast have been subjected for some years now to the subtle imperialism of BBC 1, BBC 2 and UTV.  They have had the further advantage of deciding which of these subtle imperialist stations to tune into.  I have no doubt that when this debate is over this evening Senator Lenihan will return to his house and tune into one of these stations.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately we in the south and west do not have that opportunity.  I would be the last person to suggest that the result of this subtle imperialism to which Senator Lenihan has been a victim now for many years has had any effect on his nationalist outlook and I am sure he would be very hurt if I were to suggest for one moment that he was a West Briton or a little Englander.  I do not think he is but I think he is a little naïve in suggesting that because people in the disadvantaged areas are now to be offered for the first time ever an alternative that, as a result, they are going to be turned into West Britons or little Englanders.  To say the least it is a grave insult to the patriotic instincts of those of us who are fortunate, or unfortunate enough as the case may be, to live on the south or west coasts.  I think that it is no harm to have a look at subsection (1) of section 6.  Three words have been taken and bandied about for the past half-hour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take it in the context of the Bill.  Just talking about the three words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; could give a wrong impression.  Subsection (1) of section 6 reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Authority, direct the Authority to rebroadcast in its entirety a service of programmes specified in the direction and broadcast from any source other than the Authority and so specified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> That seems to me to indicate quite clearly that the Minister has the right, if he so desires and after consultation, to direct that an entire programme or series of programmes from BBC 1, BBC 2 or UTV may be rebroadcast; in other words, putting the people in the disadvantaged areas in the happy situation which Senator Lenihan and his fortunate colleagues on the east coast have enjoyed for many years.  If we exclude &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; I assume the corollary would arise that the Minister cannot then direct the Authority to rebroadcast in its entirety.  That would seem to me to be the effect of taking out those three words.</P>
    <P>People who live in the disadvantaged areas want to have a choice of turning on BBC 1 or BBC 2 in its entirety, just as people on the east coast can do now. Something else which also seems to have been forgotten is that they will then have the alternative if they feel that their culture is under an attack of turning back to RTE.  Senator Lenihan talked about the dire position in which RTE will find themselves as a result of the Minister extending in a limited way the alternatives enjoyed by those on the east coast, and he said RTE will not be able to compete.  I would like to know, and I hope the Minister will enlighten us in his reply, how is it that RTE have managed to survive up to now in competition with three or four outside stations?  What is going to be the remarkable change if people on the south and east coasts are going to be offered one alternative in the not too distant future?  Why has Senator Lenihan so little confidence in the competence and quality of the RTE programmes to think that they are going to sink because people in the disadvantaged south and west areas are going to be offered a modicum of what their fellow-Irishmen on the east coast have enjoyed for many years?  I think that it is absolute and utter nonsense.  As said before, the alternative I would like to see is a group entirely outside RTE and BBC or any other station taking over but apparently that is not on.  Nothing that has been said by the Senators opposite can convince me that there is any alternative to the proposal contained in this Bill.  I would like to think that there was a sensible, practical, <Col N="1363" /> economical alternative but it has not been shown.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan picked me up on some remarks I made earlier on about the cost.  He referred to the very well documented case of RTE.  I did not refer to that.  I said that the Fianna Fáil Party, of which he is the leader in this House, had produced recently what they called an alternative to the Minister's Bill but they had not costed it.  and no figures were subsequently produced. In the absence of those figures I think it is quite impossible to argue the merits of the Fianna Fáil alternative, if in fact it is a practicable alternative.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan has repeated the speech he made on the first section of this Bill some hours ago but he has failed to convince me that by taking out three little words he will improve the Bill or offer any practical alternative to those of us who live in the south and west of Ireland.  Not for the first time in this debate, it is a question of the haves telling the have nots what the haves think they should have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We should recall that the words which this amendment seeks to delete were inserted by the Seanad on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  They did not appear on the Bill originally.  They were inserted as the Minister's response to arguments which were made or the dangers which would exist if a Minister were to be given power which would allow him to direct the rebroadcasting of particular films, programmes or interviews.  The Minister made it clear on the occasion of the Second Reading introductory speech that what he had in mind was the rebroadcasting of an entire programme and his response to the criticisms, objections or queries raised was to make the position abundantly clear by introducing an amendment on Committee Stage to insert the words which it is now proposed to delete.  If the Minister had not proposed the introduction of these words which were subsequently adopted by the House, it is possible that on Report Stage he would be met by objections that he had been so dictatorial in his approach that he had not amended the Bill even though he had stated that his intention <Col N="1364" /> was to have programmes rebroadcast in their entirety, that he had burked the issue by not putting that into the Bill and pinning himself to it.  There were objections that as long as the Bill remained without the words &ldquo;in its entirety&rdquo; it was open to the Minister to order the Authority to rebroadcast particular items which possibly might have political significance or be politically advantageous to the Minister.  As I see it, no matter what action he takes the Minister cannot win in this kind of argument.  By his amendment on Committee Stage he has made it quite clear that he meant what he said in his introductory speech and he has pinned his colours to that masthead.</P>
      <P>It is important that we should remember a point made by Senator Russell.  This is an enabling section.  It is not a mandatory section.  I know I have used the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; but it is necessary in this context because it denotes also the subject matter of the amendment.  The section enables the Minister to direct the rebroadcasting of programmes in their entirety.  Equally, when it uses the expression &ldquo;the Minister may after consultation...&rdquo; that means if he so chooses the Minister may not.  It is entirely discretionary. There is nothing to make it obligatory or mandatory on the Minister to do this.  If as a matter of public policy or for any reasons responsive to public opinion the Minister decides that it is not in the best interests of the State that this section should be brought into operation&mdash;</P>

The next point I want to look at briefly is the impassioned plea that was made by Senator Lenihan to save us from the fate of being made little Britons, and to ensure that we will not adopt &ldquo;God Save the Queen&rdquo; as <Col N="1365" /> our National Anthem.  If I thought that was being advanced as a serious argument I would regard it as the greatest insult ever offered by people in this House to Senator Garrett's neighbours and others, particularly those west of the Shannon.</P>

      <P>I regard people west of the Shannon as the salt of the earth and I have very great regard for the character and the calibre of the people there.  Certainly I would not like to be the one who would stand up and insult them by saying that if they switched on BBC 1 they would end up as little Britons singing &ldquo;God Save the Queen&rdquo;.  That seems to be the weight and purport of the argument advanced by Senator Lenihan.  It is equally insulting to the people living along the east coast who for years have been switching to BBC 1 or BBC 2 or UTV. Are we to castigate them now as little Britons because they have been able to look at BBC 1 or any of the other stations?</P>

I think something more substantial than that requires to be advanced if we are to regard this as a serious discussion. If that is true, if it is likely to have that kind of result, let us get back to the basic point, that this is merely an enabling section which may or may not be operated and which, if operated, can be discontinued.  Do not let us fall into the temptation of thinking that those who live outside the scope of the BBC reception at the moment are going to become little Britons, when those within that area have not become little Britons and have not yet started to sing &ldquo;God Save the Queen&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Senator O'Higgins thinks that Senator Lenihan and other Senators have overstated the case when they say that any section of the community who are exposed to BBC 1 indefinitely would become little Britons.  I think Senator O'Higgins would not deny that television has a very important influence on people who watch it.  There is no doubt whatever that, if the people of this country were exposed to BBC 1 and no other programme over a number of years, this would undoubtedly have some effect on the outlook of the people of this country.</P>
      <P>If I interpret Senator O'Higgins correctly, it is only a matter of degree because I do not think he would deny that exposure over a long period to a particular programme would have some effect on those who watch it.  I think it is a matter of degree.  Would it have some effect on the people of the country to be exposed, on the one hand, to the present RTE programme and, on the other hand, to one particular British programme?  I have no doubt whatever that it would have some effect.  As I have said it is only a matter of gauging what the effect would be, the extent of the influence, the extent to which it would colour people's outlook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned that the people on the east coast have been able to turn to these programmes and that it has not had any effect on them.  In the first place, the fact that they have been able to turn to several different programmes has mitigated the effects to a considerable extent, because they have not been <Col N="1367" /> watching a particular programme all the time.  The fact that there are several different ones helps to mitigate the effect; it does not have as serious an effect as watching one particular programme. The people on the east coast watch several different British programmes, UTV, BBC 1, BBC 2 and so on, and I have no doubt that it has some effect which should not be underestimated. Even if it does not make little Britons of those who watch it, it has some effect on us.  Perhaps the reason that my objection to the proposal is not as vehement as Senator Garrett's is because I have been exposed to BBC programmes and to some extent, I have become a little Briton.</P>
    <P>One may feel that the position has been overstated by some Senators but I believe it is something which should be seriously considered, that it is something which should not be underestimated, which properly forms part of this debate and is a matter for serious examination in considering the proposal that is apparently being considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to what Senator O'Higgins has said about this being merely an enabling section.  Of course we have been told that the Minister will exercise his discretion here and that this is something that may never happen. That would carry a great deal more weight if the Minister had never expressed any views about this and if we had no idea whatever as to what he was going to do.  The fact of the matter is that we are all aware of what the Minister has in mind.  We are all aware that he has expressed the view that BBC 1 is probably the programme he would like to see as the second programme.  We are not discussing this completely without having any idea of what the Minister would like to see happening.  The Minister may say that he has not any final decision made or has not a final view about it, but certainly the suggestion of broadcasting BBC 1 on the second channel has been suggested by him.  Consequently we are not merely talking about an enabling section without having any idea of <Col N="1368" /> what is going to happen.  We have a considerable hint of what is going to happen.  We have been told that this is quite likely to happen.  Consequently there is no use talking about an enabling section, as something that may never happen.</P>
    <P>These sections are not put into Bills for nothing.  It is not like section 31, as amended, which is something that enables the Minister to step in on some occasion but which will probably never happen and we all hope it will not.  This is something which almost certainly will happen, something which is going to happen very soon.  We have a very firm indication of how this section is going to be used.  We have very firm indication that it is going to be used in a way that many people think is the wrong way and that many people think will be used in a way which would do a great deal of harm, or in a way which is the least advantageous for the viewers in this country.  I do not think we should be merely shrugging it off as an enabling section.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell seemed to take quite for granted what was going to happen. He was saying that what was going to happen seemed to be the best possible thing in the circumstances, that there seemed to be no reasonable alternative to what the Minister proposed to do. We have a firm indication that the Minister proposes to put on BBC 1.</P>
