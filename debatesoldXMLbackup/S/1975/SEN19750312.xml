      <P>In my speech in Seanad Éireann on the Second Stage of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1974, on 18th December, 1974&mdash;columns 261 and 262 of the Official Report &mdash; I referred the fact that the drafting of an <Col N="762" /> amending Bill providing for important changes in broadcasting legislation was far advanced and that I intended to initiate the Bill in the Seanad.  This is the Bill now before the House.  The original Bill, that of 1959, was also introduced in the Seanad, so I am following precedent in introducing this Amendment Bill here too.  I think the then Minister, Mr. Hilliard, set a good precedent on that occasion and I am happy to follow it now.</P>
      <P>Before I come to the new Bill it may be worthwhile to look briefly at the background to the 1960 Act which this Bill proposes to amend.  Up to the 1950s the broadcasting service was governed by the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.  The legal position was that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was responsible for the detailed control and operation of broadcasting.  In 1953 the then Minister, the late Erskine Childers, set up Comhairle Radio Éireann, a committee of five persons appointed in a part-time capacity, to advise and assist him in the conduct of the broadcasting service and to be responsible under him for the general control and supervision of the service.  From then on, despite the legal fact of detailed ministerial responsibility, Radio Éireann was in practice free to manage its own affairs and to spend the moneys allocated for broadcasting purposes.  This <i>de facto</i> achievement of a large measure of practical autonomy for Radio Éireann was a very significant step in the history of broadcasting in this country and one on which it is appropriate here to pay tribute to the creative work, in this field as in others, of our late President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Towards the end of the decade the pros and cons for establishing a national television service were being discussed and proposals had been received by the then Government from commercial interests to establish a service without cost to the Exchequer.  The Government announced their intention of considering proposals from private interests for a television concession and subsequently the Television Commission was set up to consider such proposals and the relations between the proposed television service and sound <Col N="763" /> broadcasting.  Their terms of reference were on the basis that effective control must be exercised by a public authority and that there must be no charge on the Exchequer either on current or capital account.</P>
    <P>The commission reported in May, 1959.  The majority expressed their misgivings about entrusting the operation of the service to any private organisation and indicated that if the necessary capital were available there was little or no doubt that television should be established as a public service. The majority of the commission estimated the capital required to establish the television service at about £1½ million and were of the opinion that a service based on a reasonable licence fee and advertising revenue should pay its way within a few years.</P>
    <P>In the event the Government decided that the two public broadcasting services&mdash;sound and television&mdash;should be under the control of a single statutory authority, that the television service should be operated without ultimate cost to the Exchequer, and that £2 million to cover capital expenditure &mdash; mainly on the television service &mdash; should be made available to the authority by way of repayable advances.  The Broadcasting Authority Bill, 1959, was initiated in the Seanad to give effect to these decisions and when passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas became the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>On the whole that Act has stood the test of time remarkably well but, as might be expected, the passage of nearly 15 years has both shown the need for certain improvements in it and brought about a need to modernise it in certain respects.  The present Bill is intended to meet these needs.</P>
    <P>This amending Bill has two main purposes.  The first is to clarify and expand the duties of the RTE Authority in fulfilling their task of providing a national broadcasting service in the light of developments, experience and new insights since the authority was established.  The second main purpose of the Bill is to provide greater <Col N="764" /> autonomy and freedom for the broadcasting service within clearly defined statutory restraints and obligations, while at the same time improving public control in certain areas.  The Bill also contains a number of provisions in regard to financial matters. Finally it provides for certain amendments to the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, the main one being to facilitate statutory control of local programme origination for distribution on wireless broadcast relay stations &mdash; cable systems.</P>
    <P>At present the general duties of the authority in regard to providing a national broadcasting service are laid down in section 17 of the 1960 Act, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In performing its functions, the Authority shall bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.</P>
    <P>The two main concepts in this section &mdash; restoring the Irish language, and preserving and developing the national culture &mdash; are ambiguous in a particular way.  That is, they assume as obvious and acceptable to all the people certain concepts which are not in fact clear and which, if understood in a narrow sense, are not acceptable to many people in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the present Bill is intended to reflect a considerably wider consensus, based on the growing recognition of the diverse interests and concerns of the people of Ireland, the paramount need for peace and understanding and the variety and richness of our culture.  The authority are required to have regard to this broad spectrum in their programming while at the same time having special regard for those elements which distinguish our culture from those of other countries, and particularly for the Irish language. They are also required to uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution.  And finally, to guard against our being too inward looking, the authority are asked to promote understanding of the values and traditions of other countries.  I hope that this general conception of what our <Col N="765" /> national broadcasting service should reflect will commend itself to the Seanad.  If so, Senators may well, in this as in other parts of the Bill, help me to formulate this concept with greater precision.</P>
    <P>As to the second main purpose of the Bill, the statutory restraints on the authority are contained in section 3 of the Bill.  This section restates and expands the provision in the 1960 Act concerning objectivity and impartiality.  It imposes on the authority the obligation to apply the same standards as regards objectivity and impartiality to any written, aural or visual material they may publish or distribute and it gives statutory backing to the present practice whereby the impartiality requirement is considered to be fulfilled if all significant views are aired in two or more related programmes if these are broadcast over a reasonable period.  The section also prohibits the authority from broadcasting or publishing any matter likely to promote, or incite to crime or to lead to disorder.  This new provision is intended to replace the directive issued by my predecessor under section 31 (1) of the 1960 Act as well as that section itself.  That directive will therefore lapse with the passage of this Bill.  Normally, the authority will be left to apply this new provision independently, in accordance with its own judgment. However, because the Government responsible to Parliament must retain the final say in the particular difficult and sensitive area of the security of the State, I propose to retain, while modifying, the power to issue directions. I will refer to this again later, both when talking about section 16 of the Bill, and in more general terms in the final part of my remarks.</P>
    <P>Section 3 also prohibits the authority from unreasonably intruding on the privacy of an individual.  This gives statutory recognition to a problem on which the authority already has an internal code.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of other provisions conferring additional powers and independence on the authority.  Section 2 confers greater security of tenure on the authority; <Col N="766" /> it provides that the members of the authority may be removed from office by the Government only by resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This is an important and unusual provision.  The old section 6 of the 1960 Act, which gives the Government power to dismiss any member of the authority without reason given, was not unusual in that respect, as similar powers exist in relation to other statutory bodies.  It was no doubt for this reason that this provision gave rise to no discussion during the Seanad debate on the 1959 Bill.</P>
    <P>Members of the Seanad may also have been influenced to some extent by the knowledge that the British Government possess similar powers in relation to the BBC, which nonetheless is widely regarded as one of the most independent broadcasting authorities in the world.  However the British Government have not made use of these drastic powers.  The previous Government did use these powers, dismissing the entire authority on 24th November, 1972.  It is not relevant, and would not be appropriate, for me here to discuss the wisdom or unwisdom of that decision. What is certain is that the Government did have the legal power to take that action and was not required to justify it before the Oireachtas.  This Government believe that, in view of the peculiar complexity and delicacy of the responsibilities to Parliament of the RTE authority, it is desirable that during the term of its appointment, its members be removable only by the Oireachtas itself.  By requiring the Government to justify any proposed dismissal to the Oireachtas, this provision seeks to ensure that the authority, and through it the broadcasting service generally, will be protected against penalisation on any ground other than specified failure recognised by the Oireachtas &mdash; for example failure to discharge one or more of the duties imposed on the authority by law.  This provision should tend to enhance the autonomy of the authority and to clarify and improve its relations to Parliament and to the democratic process.</P>
    <P>Section 5 empowers the authority <Col N="767" /> with the consent of the Minister to appoint advisory committees and advisers &mdash; a power which rests with the Minister under the present Act.  Section 9 provides for payment of net receipts from broadcasting licence fees to RTE for an unlimited period &mdash; rather than for a limited number of years as has been the case under the 1960 Act and later amending Acts &mdash; hus giving the service greater finanial security.</P>
    <P>Section 14 gives the authority more flexibility in settling the hours of broadcasting and when advertisements will be broadcast, while, under section 21, the consent of the Minister will no longer be necessary before the authority can publish and distribute books, magazines, or recorded aural or visual material.</P>
    <P>One way in which the authority's freedom may be eroded lies in complaints to the Minister that the authority has been in breach of its statutory duty of impartiality, and in the Minister's present unlimited power to judge and act on such complaints.  Since the Minister is and presumably always will be a political figure it is clearly undesirable that he be left sole judge of impartiality in cases which may involve comment on party politics and politicians and even on his own Department. Nor could the authority be left as the sole judge as to whether or not it was properly discharging this responsibility.  The Oireachtas itself, by virtue of the power proposed to be attributed to it by section 2 of this Bill, must of course be the ultimate judge of the authority's conduct generally.  But it would be impracticable and undesirable to bring every instance of alleged failure in this area before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the problem I appointed the RTE Complaints Advisory Committee last year headed by Judge Kingsmill Moore.  This system seems to have worked well and the commission provided for in the Bill is to give a statutory basis for this solution.</P>
    <P>The commission will be an impartial statutory body which will be independent of both the Minister and the <Col N="768" /> RTE Authority.  As an earnest of the Government's determination to maintain the independence of the commission, the Bill provides that a member of the commission may be removed from office only by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas. Here much the same principles apply as apply to the removability of members of the authority itself.  The commission will deal with complaints alleging that RTE have not complied with the statutory obligations as regards objectivity or impartiality, that they must have breached the prohibition on the broadcasting of matter which might reasonably be regarded as likely to promote or to incite to crime or to lead to disorder, or that there was a breach of the prohibition on intrusion on the privacy of any individual.  The commission will also deal with complaints that advertisements broadcast by RTE were in breach of the code of advertising standards.</P>
    <P>Anybody, including any Senator, Deputy or Minister, who is dissatisfied with a particular programme or programmes broadcast by RTE in any of the foregoing categories and who is not satisfied with RTE's response to a complaint will have access to this impartial independent body which will replace the Complaints Advisory Committee I set up last year under section 21 of the 1960 Act.  That committee was of course equally impartial: the only difference is that the independence of the commission is here established and protected by statute.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the Bill provides for retention of power by the Minister to issue a direction in regard to one particular area of broadcasting. This is dealt with in section 16 of the Bill, which provides that the Minister may issue a direction by statutory order to RTE to refrain from broadcasting a particular matter or matter of a particular class which in his opinion would be likely to promote or incite to crime or to lead to disorder. A statutory order so made would be subject to annullment by resolution passed by either House of the Oireachtas.  The order, if not annulled, would remain in force for a period <Col N="769" /> not exceeding 12 months but could be renewed by order or by a resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In proposing this I had in mind that the Broadcasting Review Committee, in dealing with the nature and scope of the control which should be exercised over broadcasting, say at paragraph 4.5 of their report which was published in May, 1974, that there should be:</P>
    <P>statutory provision for Government directives: any use of such directives should be public, clear and specific and should be subject to subsequent parliamentary confirmation and review.</P>
    <P>I agree with this recommendation of the committee and have accepted it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's power under section 31 (2) of the 1960 Act to direct the authority to allocate broadcasting time for ministerial announcements will of course remain.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word at this point about the general character of the differences and resemblances between this new legislation and the old, in relation to the powers of the Minister over broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Under the 1960 Act the Minister had the unrestricted power to prohibit the broadcasting of any class of matter &mdash;section 31&mdash;and the Government had also the unrestricted power to dismiss any member or all members of the authority&mdash;section 6.  This combination of unrestricted powers is a very formidable one: it has proved too formidable, in my view, to continue to be entrusted to any Minister in relation to so sensitive a matter as broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The powers of the Minister will accordingly be restricted if this Bill becomes law.  The Minister will no longer have power to prohibit the broadcasting of any matter whatever; he will only have power to prohibit the broadcasting of matter falling into certain defined categories.  He will be obliged, as he is not obliged under existing legislation, to lay any such directions in the form of a statutory order before both Houses of the Oireachtas, either House of which can <Col N="770" /> annul it by resolution.  The period during which the order would remain in force is also now to be limited.</P>
    <P>Finally, the setting up of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission represents an implicit and indirect, but real, new limitation on the powers of the Minister.  Under the existing law there is no judge, other than the Minister, of whether the authority was complying with its responsibilities&mdash; for example in relation to objectivity and impartiality.</P>
    <P>It is true that the existing legislation does not explicitly make the Minister the arbiter on question of objectivity.  But it provides no other arbiter, and it gives the Government power to dismiss the authority without reason given, and presumably for some failure or failures in relation to any or all of its responsibilities under the Act, including its responsibilities in relation to objectivity and impartiality.  In the Broadcasting Complaints Commission there will now be an independent arbiter of these questions, relieving the Minister of a power which should not lie in executive hands, while thus at the same time providing a proper protection for the authority, and serving, and being seen to serve, the interests of broadcasting generally and of the people.</P>
    <P>The new legislation then restricts ministerial powers to a significant extent.  More important, it seeks to ensure that these powers be more clearly defined, less open to arbirtary use, and subject to closer democratic scrutiny.  The most important factor is not so much the restriction of these powers, as the greater exposure of their workings to the light of day. For the ministerial powers here retained and defined are still&mdash;and I wish to emphasise this&mdash;very important. In so far as they relate to broadcasting likely to &ldquo;promote or incite to crime or to lead to disorder&rdquo; the powers retained are not less, within that particular category, than the powers which were available in relation to that category&mdash;as well as all other categories&mdash;under the present section 31, subject only to the requirement of laying the order before both <Col N="771" /> Houses of the Oireachtas and the power of the Oireachtas to annul the order.</P>
    <P>Those whose main objection to the old section 31 was its blanket character, and therefore its susceptibility to arbitrary abuse, will regard the present amending legislation as constituting at least a significant improvement.  Those, however, who reject any power of Government censorship applied to the State broadcasting system&mdash;even reserve powers to be exercised in the interests of the security of the people&mdash; those who take that position will certainly regard the legislation which is designed to replace Section 31 as constituting little or no improvement on that Section.  And there is plenty of room for other views in between&mdash; for example the view that while the State should have <i>some</i> authority to intervene&mdash;that is to say to censor, let us not be afraid of the word, whether or not we are afraid of the thing&mdash;yet the State's powers should be more strictly limited than they are in the draft legislation before you.  There may also be those who think, on the contrary that the present legislation goes dangerously far in limiting the State's powers to intervene, that the State requires a great reserve of latitude in this domain, and that this is here unwisely and uncautiously reduced.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is on this issue&mdash; briefly the issue of State censorship&mdash; that the main debate precipitated by this legislation is likely to turn.  I propose, therefore, in the closing part of my remarks, to come back to this question, and to consider some of the basic problems and principles involved. I am afraid the nature and complexity of the subject will require me to treat it at some length.  I hope that Senators will not consider this an abuse of their time and patience, but I believe that one of the advantages of introducing such a measure in the Senate is that there is more room for calm deliberate consideration of issues of principle than tends to be favoured by the tempo and atmosphere of the other House.</P>
    <P>Before returning to those thorny and <Col N="772" /> interesting matters let me say something about the remaining, perhaps less controversial, though not entirely uncontroversial aspects of the Bill. Section 6 gives the Minister power after consultation with the authority to direct the authority to rebroadcast the programmes of other broadcasting organisations.  When I refer to programmes here, I mean the whole service, not any individual item.  As Senators are no doubt aware, a network of transmitters is being erected to provide viewers in the present single channel regions with an alternative to the present RTE programmes.  It is hoped that it will be possible to begin transmissions over the second network about the end of 1976.</P>
    <P>The Government favour using the second network for transmitting BBC 1 or UTV if, as we hope, negotiations with the British authorities, which have been going on for some time now, are successful.  This would of course be a step in the direction of my open broadcasting concept, under which programmes broadcast in Northern Ireland would be fully available throughout the Republic and RTE programmes would be available throughout Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should like here to reiterate what I said in the Dáil&mdash; Official Report of 13th June, 1974, column 1153 &mdash; as regards the effects on RTE of retransmitting one or more of the British services, and my intentions in relation to RTE in that regard.  I quote from the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I am interested in defending the standard of service provided by RTE as against outside competition.  I believe also in permitting more outside competition.  I agree that it increases the financial burden on RTE. I think the State should meet that burden in order to support not merely present standards but an improvement of the standards.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the natural and proper way for RTE to meet this competition &mdash; the way in which it can in fact serve its natural audience even in competition&mdash;is by extending the number and improving the quality of home-produced programmes.  I personally would like <Col N="773" /> to see the emphasis on development in RTE go on to that.  I do realise that it takes money.</P>
    <P>I now turn to financial matters. The Bill contains a number of important financial provisions.  Section 10 provides for an increase of £11 million in the amount that may be advanced to RTE from the Central Fund for capital purposes.  Section 23 of the Broacasting Authority Act, 1960, authorised the Minister for Finance to make repayable advances not exceeding £2 million in the aggregate to RTE for capital purposes.  The limit was increased by £1 million to £3 million by the 1964 Act and to £4 million by the 1973 Act.  The present Bill proposes to increase the limit by a further £11 million to £15 million.</P>
    <P>The initial capital cost of providing the television service was financed by Exchequer advances, and a few small advances were made in the early 1960s.  No advances were made to the authority in the years 1964-65 to 1970-71 apart from a small capital advance for the Ballymun multi-channel communal aerial system.  During most of that period the authority's revenue from licence fees and advertisements was buoyant, mainly because of the increase in the number of television sets in use, and necessary developrents were financed almost entirely from internal sources.  However from 1969-70 onwards there was a falling off in the increase in the number of television sets and the increase in revenue slowed down while expenditure increased rapidly, mainly as a result of inflation.</P>
    <P>The authority's financial position deteriorated sharply and, despite a number of increases in both advertising charges and licence fees, they did not generate sufficient income to finance capital needs.  In the five years 1969-70 to 1973-74 RTE earned a net surplus of about £500,000 out of a total income of some £36.5 million. Capital expenditure, including expenditure on renewals, in the same period totalled £4.2 million, the bulk of which had to be financed by the Exchequer. When approved advances to meet RTE's commitments on capital works during 1974 were made, the £4 million <Col N="774" /> limit authorised under existing legislation was exhausted.</P>
    <P>Heavy capital expenditure on broadcasting over the next few years must be envisaged.  RTE's approved capital programme for 1975 amounts to £3.5 million, which includes nearly £1 million expenditure on the second television transmitter network, and £1.5 million on renewal and extension of TV production facilities and regional studios.  RTE have estimated their capital requirements for the five years 1975 to 1979 at £14.7 million at current prices.  This does not include the cost of the extra production facilities which would be required if a choice of television programmes were provided by way of a second RTE channel which, of course, is one of the possibilities.</P>
    <P>Of this £14.7 million the transmitter network for the second television programme will cost about £3.7 million when completed and existing TV transmitters must be renewed at the same time at a cost of about £1.7 million in order to avoid extensive co-channel interference.  Additional television production facilities and extension of regional studios planned by RTE would cost about £2 million and improvement of coverage of the existing television service in those areas where reception is below average would cost a further £2 million.</P>
    <P>Renewal of other television plant at a cost of £2 million is envisaged and miscellaneous works on improvement of radio coverage, monitoring and control equipment, buildings, and so on which RTE consider to be necessary, is estimated at over £3 million.  There is no prospect that RTE could finance a programme approaching this magnitude from internal sources.  Moreover it would be unreasonable to expect any organisation to generate sufficient surpluses to finance a major development programme of this kind over a relatively short period.  It must be envisaged therefore that much of future capital investment in broadcasting will have to be financed from outside sources, including repayable advances from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The increase of £11 million on the limit of advances that may be made to RTE from the Exchequer provided for <Col N="775" /> in the Bill will enable the Minister for Finance to make available the necessary repayable Exchequer advances to help finance RTE's approved programme for 1975 and capital investent in broadcasting in subsequent years. Other financial provisions contained in sections 11 and 15 of the Bill enable RTE to borrow in foreign currencies for the general purpose of broadcasting and for current expenditure.  This power can be exercised only with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the fact that an increase in the licence fee will be necessary to pay for the second television programme. In addition to meeting the annual charges on the capital costs involved, the licence fee will have to cover the operating costs of the second programme.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate with any degree of accuracy the increase that will be necessary.</P>
    <P>RTE's present financial position is not particularly healthy despite the significant increases in television licence fees which were applied as from 1st October, 1974.  While they earned a relatively modest profits of about £260,000 in the year ended March, 1974, they ran up a deficit of an estimated £250,000 in the nine months April-December, 1974.  This was mainly due to cost inflation.  They will reap the full benefits of the increased licence fees during 1975 however, and they hope this, combined with stringent economies they have planned and, I believe, are beginning to put into operation, will enable them to break even this year, even though the buoyancy of advertising revenue may be adversely affected by the general economic situation.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the provision in section 9 of the Bill which provides for payment of net receipts from wired broadcast relay licence fees to RTE for an unlimited period.  These fees which are payable by cable operators under the Wireless Telegraphy (Wired Broadcast Relay Licence) Regulations, 1974, comprise 15 per cent where there is no identifiable income from a cable system.  Provision <Col N="776" /> is contained in this section too for charging the expenses of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission against receipts from television licence fees.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, contained in the Bill are mostly of a technical kind dealing with a widening of the definition of wireless telegraphy and of the Minister's powers in relation to control of interference caused by electrical appliances.</P>
    <P>The exception is section 17, which provides enabling power to regulate local programme origination for distribution on cable systems.  As Senators are probably aware, certain experiments in relay on cable systems in the Dublin area of locally originated programmes have taken place. In general I favour this development and regard its potential with considerable interest.  It is essential however that, if local programme origination develops on an extensive scale, it should be subject to statutory regulation and control, particularly in relation to programme content.</P>
    <P>I have in mind that local programmes should be subject to the same type of restraints as those applicable to the national broadcasting service.  It will be possible to arrange this under section 17, which empowers the Minister to make statutory regulations for the licensing of local programme origination for distribution on cable systems and laying down the conditions to be complied with by licensees in regard to such matters as programme content and so on.</P>
    <P>Before concluding this part of my remarks I should mention that those recommendations in the report of the Broadcasting Review Committee published in May, 1974, which, if adopted, would involve amending legislation, were considered by the Government in conjunction with their examination of the question of new broadcasting legislation.  While some of the main recommendations of the committee &mdash; for example, regarding a legislative declaration of the purpose of broadcasting in Ireland and the restructuring of RTE to separate the public control function from the day to day management of the service by creation <Col N="777" /> of a broadcasting commission &mdash; were not adopted, quite a number of the recommendations in the report have been implemented and the intent behind others has been incorporated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>For example, their recommendations about the statutory regulation and control of cable television are implemented almost <i>in toto</i> as are their recommendations about colour television.  The definition of the duty of the authority in fulfilling its task of providing a national broadcasting service contained in the Bill reflects some of the concepts in the legislative declaration which the committee recommended.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the beginning of my speech that the Bill had two main purposes &mdash; to clarify and define the obligations of the authority in fulfilling its task of providing a national broadcasting service in the Ireland of the 1970s and, secondly, to provide the maximum possible freedom to the broacasting service within clearly defined statutory restraints while improving public control in certain essential areas.  I should now like to discuss this vexed question of control, in terms of the general principles involved and the problems which arise in attempting to apply these principles.</P>
    <P>Any legislation on broadcasting, even limited amending legislation as at present, necessarily raises very fundamental issues: essentially those of freedom in a democratic state and the limits of such freedom.</P>
    <P>When the original Bill was debated, according to the record, there was relatively little discussion of these fundamental issues and the debate concentrated in the more immediate and practical aspects of the legislation, which was of course generally, and in the main rightly, welcomed.</P>
    <P>There was, I believe, still at that time in our Legislature a certain reluctance to discuss fundamental issues, based &mdash; as often among us &mdash; on the contradictory but simultaneously &mdash; held assumptions that we all, as decent people, thought alike on these matters, and that it would be dangerously divisive to discuss them.  These assumptions and the habits generated by them <Col N="778" /> still linger in various departments of our national life, but the degree to which they inhibit parliamentary debate is very much reduced.  The way is open for us now, if we wish, to debate these matters in a more ample and far-ranging way than would have seemed appropriate in the past.  I think it is right that we should do so, and I hope that Senators may agree with me on this point at least.</P>
    <P>I would hope that, when we come to discuss the Bill in detail and amendments to it, that debate will have been illuminated in advance by a thorough discussion here of the basic principles involved.  That discussion may appropriately take place at this stage of the consideration of the Bill, and it is that discussion I now wish to initiate.</P>
    <P>I hope that as I approach these very large questions, unavoidably touching on central issues of political philosophy, Senators will not feel that I am in any way attempting to lay down the law to them.  It is for the Oireachtas to lay down the law, and quite literally so.  As Minister I am simply bringing before the Seanad, as a contribution to the discussion, my own view of the principles involved in such legislation.  Some Senators may well support and seek to improve the Bill, as a reasonably workman-like measure, while not choosing to follow into the more speculative area which I am now entering, or indeed while rejecting some of my formulations of the principles involved.  Others may on the whole accept these formulations but feel that the Bill itself does not adequately correspond to them.  Both point of view and others could enrich the debate and help to chasten and improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>The seven basic questions which I would put, and to which I would offer tentative answers for your examination, are the following : Has the democratic State the right to pass repressive legislation?  Has it the right to restrict freedom of expression?  If so, what limitations should apply to such rights?  Should the State have greater rights of restriction in relation to broadcasting than to the Press?  What limitations should there be on the <Col N="779" /> State's right to intervene in broadcasting? When we speak of freedom in broadcasting, whose freedom do we mean and how is it to be defended? Finally, whatever principles we hold valid in relation to these general questions, are there any special circumstances prevailing in our society in our time which make it necessary or prudent to apply these principles in particular ways?</P>
    <P>As regards the first question, I do not suppose there can be many Members of this or any other Legislature who hold the doctrine that the State should never engage in any kind of repressive legislation.  Most of our laws seek to repress something or other, whether it be abuse of drugs, exposure of workers to unnecessary risks, ill-treatment of children, murder, or other undesirable practices.</P>
    <P>The reason I raise this question first is that in the form of a pejorative slogan it has very often been launched against the legislation I am seeking to amend and will certainly be launched against some parts of the amending legislation.  There are of course weighty arguments against such legislation as I am now introducing, and I shall come to these. But I begin with this particular argument, which is clearly invalid, because I am concerned about the implications of its fairly wide use, especially among young people.</P>
    <P>Those who use this slogan suggest that, whenever the liberal and democratic State uses repressive legislation, backed as it has to be by the power to coerce those who will not obey the laws, that then it is departing from its own principles.  The underlying argument, which has often been used by fascists and communists, but is also used by others, is that the liberal and democratic State, by reason of its own principles, has no right to defend itself or the citizens who look to it for their defence.</P>
    <P>This is of course an invitation to the liberal and democratic State to commit suicide.  It may be asked in parenthesis whether ours actually is a liberal and democratic State.  It is, I would say, as <Col N="780" /> democratic as the most democratic country in the world, and about as liberal as that democracy is prepared to stand.  It is less liberal than other western European countries but is undoubtedly growing more liberal than it was.  Unfortunately the wish to be liberal, or to demand liberalism from others, is often accompanied by only the vaguest notions of what liberalism is, as the slogans about repressive legislation show.  The debate now opening would be particularly useful if it helped to clarify ideas in that regard.  The simple principle which came to be at the heart of the liberal democratic State was laid down for Athens more than 2,000 years ago:</P>
    <P>Neither excess of rule nor anarchy That is the mean my townsmen shall observe.</P>
    <P>From the <i>Oresteia</i> of Aeschylus.</P>
    <P>All liberal and democratic states have tried to observe that mean, always differing strongly within themselves as to what particular measures may involve &ldquo;excess of rule&rdquo; and what may lead to &ldquo;anarchy&rdquo;, but always accepting that anarchy is to be abhorred and that the State must maintain, and where necessary use, an apparatus of repression.</P>
    <P>It may be well to distinguish here between what one might call practical work-a-day anarchy and the anarchy of the philosophical anarchists.  The latter would be a highly desirable thing, if the assumptions on which it were based were true, or could become true. And of course they may one day come true.  It may come about, as a result of technological developments and wiser use of that technology, stabilisation of world population, elimination of poverty, vastly improved education and understanding of our own psychology, that aggression, cruelty, greed and exploitation of the weak by the strong will disappear altogether from human behaviour and all people will devote their energies to helping one another rather than winning advantages for themselves.  In those conditions, anarchy would be a benign state of affairs and repressive legislation would be unthinkable.</P>
    <P>Whether humanity as a whole may conceivably be moved in that direc- <Col N="781" /> tion I would not care to guess: the question is related to that of the perfectability of man, and might bring us to the perilous fringes of theology. But we are certainly nowhere near such a Utopian state of affairs now, and this country is not noticeably nearer to it than any other country. In present conditions, human nature and the human situation being as they are, anarchy&mdash;that is, the breakdown of the State&mdash;simply involves disseminated retail-tyranny: forms of rule unchecked either by civilised tradition or by constitutional or conventional safeguards of any kind.  Of that, too, we have experience, but I shall come back to that.</P>
    <P>I have encountered, in different parts of Africa at different times, in parts of a great American city, and more recently in parts of Northern Ireland, situations in which the gunman for a time is absolute ruler over a given area, fairly large or very small: where the gunman's mind is the sole legislature and judicature, and his armed hand the executive.  In comparison to conditions in these squalid and barbarous little empires, the abuses which prevail in the daylight of the effective jurisdiction of a democratic state, serious as they are in absolute terms, pale into relative insignificance.</P>
    <P>The democratic State has the duty to defend itself and those whom it represents against such threats and such encroachments, and the duty moreover to do so effectively.  It has the duty also to defend and where possible extend the general liberties of the citizens to the maximum extent compatible with the secure survival of that on which both the liberties themselves and the prospect of their growth ultimately depend: that is, the democratic State itself.</P>
    <P>There is obviously a tight-rope situation here: the democratic State has to save itself on the one hand from being pushed by fear of anarchy into &ldquo;excess of rule&rdquo; and on the other hand to save itself from falling into anarchy through fear of excess of rule.  This is a perennial problem. How the balance is best kept at any time and in any place depends on <Col N="782" /> one's judgment of the circumstances prevailing then and there.  I shall come later to the question that concerns us most closely: the application of these principles to our own situation, and the balance most appropriate to our conditions.</P>
    <P>I imagine that all Senators, or almost all, will agree in general with the answer to that first question: that the democratic State has the right to enact repressive legislation, provided that it represses the right things in the right way, and by means that are adequate but not excessive.  Opinions may well be more divided on the second question: Has the State any right to restrict freedom of expression?  It is possible to hold that it is best not to do so at all: that the State should restrain, where necessary, overt and material actions, but should leave purely verbal utterances strictly alone. Language, it is urged, can be a safety valve for feelings which might otherwise find more dangerous expression; debate, using even the most heated forms of argument, has a cleansing power; even the most detestable ideas &mdash;the advocacy of genocide for example&mdash;should be allowed the widest possible public expression, and then be met by reasoned argument.</P>
    <P>Obviously, I am presenting here an argument with which I am in agreement. This is undoubtedly an attractive concept, especially to those who have an absolute faith in the force of rational argument, as capable of overcoming appeals to the passions. Those who hold to this view often quote with approval certain well-known lines of John Milton, including the famous &ldquo;Let her (truth) and falsehood grapple! Who ever knew truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This and other fine sayings have been adduced to support a doctrine that freedom of expression is an absolute, whose untrammeled exercise will necessarily be beneficial to society and that the State has no right to interfere with it.  The weakness of the doctrine is that it tends to assume that all discourse consists of rational argument and to ignore the rather obvious fact, not unfamiliar to us in this country, that a word can lead to a blow.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> In wider terms, language can be used to inflict pain and arouse cruelty; to instil fear into one group and arouse hatred in another; it can be used to whip up feelings conducive to pogroms; it can be used to exploit revulsion against one atrocity in order to justify the commission of other atrocities; it can be used to legitimise a sustained campaign of violence, to raise funds for that campaign and to confuse or intimidate those who tend to question or oppose such a campaign.</P>
    <P>Incidentally Milton, who did not in fact favour absolute freedom to publish with impunity, was well aware of the violence with which words can be charged.  &ldquo;Books,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;are as lively and as vigorously productive as those fabulous Dragons' teeth: and being sown up and down may chance to spring up armed men.&rdquo; What was true of the printed word in the seventeenth century is certainly no less true of the words far more widely &ldquo;sown up and down&rdquo; today by broadcasting&mdash;an emotional appeal is not capable of being dispelled by rational argument alone.  An insult, backed by a threat, is not adequately answered by a syllogism.</P>
    <P>For these and related reasons all states, even the most liberal, have in fact placed some restraints on freedom of expression and indeed liberal states continue to add new restrictions, notably, and rightly, in the field of racially offensive language. The effectiveness of such restrictions is open to question&mdash;as is the effectiveness of laws in general&mdash;but the placing of legal curbs on defamation, insults, threats, incitement to violence and racial smears is generally accepted as having on the whole salutary effects, as tending to establish desirable norms of behaviour and as being conducive to the peace of society and the well-being of individuals and families.  Words are in fact an integral part of many patterns of action.  If this is accepted, the absolute distinction between words and actions is broken down, and words and actions together become part of a pattern of behaviour which is and should be amenable to law.</P>
    <P>If we accept, then, that some restrictions <Col N="784" /> may be applied to freedom of expression, we come to our third question: what limitations should apply to such restrictions?  A line which one might legitimately seek to draw&mdash; though it is very hard in practice&mdash;is that which would set apart, as belonging to the sphere of action amenable to law, all forms of play on the emotions, through words and images, in ways likely to arouse fear and hatred, to cause acute distress, or to endanger the lives of citizens, and the security of the state responsible for those lives. All other forms of discourse should be the domain of freedom of expression. Any restriction on freedom of speech should have to be shown to be desirable in the general interest, not just the interest of the Government of the day.  That is very important.  Not merely its formal wording, but its actual working should be exposed to continued scrutiny and to renewed debate, so as to ensure that a restriction accepted for the protection of the citizens is not abused for the exclusive benefit of their rulers.  I hope this new legislation may meet these tests.  I am certain that it meets them better than the legislative provisions which it replaces.</P>
    <P>Coming now more closely to the nub of our discussion here, we consider the fourth question, that of what particular rights the State should legitimately exercise in relation to broadcasting, and in particular what restrictions the State may legitimately require in this sphere.  Our democratic State does, for example, exert much greater control over broadcasting than over the Press.  This arises from the nature of the situation: the fact that the electro-magnetic spectrum, unlike newsprint and ink, is public property and cannot readily be bought and sold in separate consignments and that therefore broadcasting has to be controlled, in some degree at least, by the State on behalf of the community, basically through an inherent monopoly in the allocation of frequencies, combined with responsibility to the people in the matter of how these frequencies were used.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> If the State allocates the use of a public asset and if it requires citizens who wish to benefit from use of that asset, to pay for their privilege, then the State, on behalf of the citizens who pay the licence fees and elect the Government of the State, has a particular responsibility in relation to broadcasting, and specifically the responsibility to ensure that broadcasting is not used to endanger either the security of the State which licensed it, or the lives of the citizens who pay for it.  These considerations are greatly reinforced by the fact that broadcasting, of all the media, both through sounds and images, has by far the most immediate impact on people and situations, has by far the greatest capacity to generate emotion, and that its capacities in these regards have aroused and held the fascinated attention of people interested in promoting and justifying violence, and strongly desirous of access to broadcasting for precisely these ends.</P>
    <P>Professional broadcasters have themselves publicly noted that, in certain conditions, the mere appearance of a television camera on a street may tend to speed up the action of a riot &mdash;the speeding up being clearly aimed at the television camera and through it at television screens throughout the area, the presumed object and probable effect of this being to spread similar patterns of conduct more widely.  I am aware that the issues raised by this pattern of the potentiality of broadcasting and in particular of television, are extremely complex and I shall return to them later, in part in this statement and in my reply to this Stage of the debate, and more specifically during the later Stages of the Bill in this House and in the Dáil.  At this stage in my argument I wish only to draw attention to the basic reasons why some form of State regulation of broadcasting is required.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the fifth question of what limitations there should be on the State's right to intervene.  As in other cases the power to regulate needs itself to be regulated carefully so that the response is not excessive and that broadcasting remains free to cover the flow of news adequately <Col N="786" /> and to discuss current affairs intelligently, probingly, comprehensively and with access to a very wide range of opinion.  The difficulties involved here are probably never entirely soluble.  Dr. Johnson implied as much when he wrote: &ldquo;The danger of such unbounded liberty, and the danger of bounding it have produced a problem in the science of government, which human understanding seems hitherto unable to solve&rdquo;.  I hope Senators will take that durable &ldquo;hitherto&rdquo; as a challenge.</P>
    <P>This question of the limitations on the State's right to intervene is closely linked to my sixth question: When we speak of freedom in broadcasting, whose freedom do we mean and how is it to be defended?  Some people&mdash; quite a few people, indeed&mdash;have written and spoken as if implying that freedom of broadcasting meant the freedom of any individual broadcaster to broadcast just what he liked.  It is not easy to see how this could be defended; to begin with, the general considerations I have already mentioned apply here too.  If an individual broadcaster should take it into his head to engage in hate propaganda against a minority, or a majority for that matter, there ought to be someone there to stop him&mdash;at least if we accept the essentials of the foregoing argument.  In broadcasting, as in other forms of collective activity&mdash;in newspapers, for example&mdash;no individual is entirely free to do what he likes; and, as in every valid, creative, collective enterprise, each individual involved in the creative process has a considerable say in what goes on: that is to say, the freedom involved is a collective freedom, under law.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this kind of freedom would be&mdash;and was here for some considerable time&mdash;stifled by direct day-to-day governmental control over broadcasting&mdash;the system which the late Erskine Childers ended.  It could also be damaged by indirect covert governmental pressure, exercised nominally in the public interest, but actually in the interests of a person or persons holding power at a given moment in time.  Broadcasters have to be protected from that type of interference, just as the public <Col N="787" /> has to be protected against the possible use of broadcasting in support of violent groups hostile to democracy by the exploitation of emotions, through the use of words and images, in such a way as to promote the objectives of such groups.</P>
    <P>I believe that, on the whole, the present structures, whereby the Director General is nominated by and responsible to an authority nominated by the elected Government, have tended in general to serve these two purposes&mdash;never wholly compatible or wholly attainable&mdash;of protecting both the public and the broadcasters.  But I believe also that these structures can be improved by defining what might be called the reserve powers retained by the Government and Parliament as relating to security&mdash;and security only&mdash;and by doing everything possible to eliminate the danger of covert interference for reasons other than those basic reasons on which I have laid stress here.</P>
    <P>I believe that the strengthening of the authority and the clarifying of its relation to the State are in fact the best means both of upholding the collective freedom of broadcasting and the principle of responsibility to the State.  That, at any rate, is the objective sought in this part of the legislation soon to be open for discussion here.</P>
    <P>The final question which I posed and which I would now like to discuss, is that of whether any special circumstances prevail in our society in our time which make it necessary or prudent to apply these principles in particular ways?</P>
    <P>I think our history, both in the more remote past and recently, has placed us today in a situation where the defence of the democratic State, together with the liberal values and civil rights for all citizens which that kind of State alone sustains, requires a high degree of intelligent vigilance and that such vigilance should be turned on our use of words and images and particularly on the broadcasting of these.</P>
    <P>Our Irish relation to democracy involves elements which we hold in <Col N="788" /> common with the citizens of other democracies, and also other elements peculiar to our own condition, which, in turn, give a special tincture even to that which seems to be held in common.  Like many other citizens of democracies, we practise democracy; but we do not greatly esteem it.  We are extremely conscious of its failings, which are many.  We see its ridiculous side&mdash;and we in Ireland perhaps see that more persistently than most&mdash;and certainly that side is there.</P>
    <P>We elect our representatives, but then we treat them like scapegoats, and rather shabby scapegoats at that. The casual, rather slighting relation of the citizen to the State is a part of democratic life, and even a part of why we value democracy.  This is the only form of Government in which the citizens can with impunity treat their rulers with contempt, and this is no small part of its drab but real glory.  Those who express themselves cynically about democracy ought sometimes to remember that democracy is the only form of Government about which it is possible to be cynical in public while continuing to live in safety under its jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Commentators insist on the failures of democracy and yet tend to assume the survival of democracy as something to be taken for granted.  A strong overt commitment to democracy is less than general: indulgent attitudes to certain of the enemies of democracy are frequent.  A free Press, whose life-span can be no longer than that of the democratic State under which it exists and under which alone it can exist, has on the whole turned its critical attention more closely on the faults of that State than on the forces which threaten it.</P>
    <P>This is right, of course, if the faults are great and the threat is slight.  The faults are great no doubt, though less I believe than in any other form of organised State that we know.  Is the threat slight?  There are many thoughtful people who do not regard it as slight today, even in Britain, perhaps the most solidly established of all the world's liberal democracies.  It is not regarded as slight either in Italy and Germany.  If that threat is significant in western countries under the economic <Col N="789" /> and social stress of the time, is it likely to be less significant in this land, cursed as it is with private armies and menaced as it is by the appalling situation which these private armies have precipitated in the North?  I do not say created there; I say precipitated.</P>
    <P>In our conditions there are forces at work which tend to turn the normal sturdy sulkiness of the democratic citizen into something rather more disturbing.  There are, to begin with, the lingering elusive doubts about the legitimacy of the State itself.  The actual denial of that legitimacy is now confined to a very small, but significant, minority of the population; but the effects of past denials are much more widespread, partly in the forms of doubts, disengagements and disparagements about State and Parliament, and partly in ambivalence towards anti-democratic bodies which arrogate to themselves powers rightly belonging to the democratic State.</P>
    <P>To speak more plainly: too many people speak and write as if the armed conspiracies known as the IRA, have a legitimate or quasi-legitimate, though usually unspecified, role to play in our society.  This permeates the language that is used about them and that language in turn reinforces the peculiar kind of authority which they have held, which has done enormous damage, which may seem perhaps at the moment to be on the verge of decomposing but still requires vigilance, plain speaking and determination in combating it.</P>
    <P>I know that in certain circles, it is regarded as somewhat &ldquo;paranoid&rdquo; even to refer to armed conspiracies. It would, indeed, be paranoid if these conspiracies did not exist.  Unfortunately they do exist: one of them murdered a Member of this House last year, and they continue to murder, maim and intimidate&mdash;especially intimidate&mdash;people every day in this island.  It is paranoid, I agree, to see armed conspiracies where none exists. What word is there for a failure to see armed conspiracies where they do exist and are murdering our neighbours? But, of course, it is not really a question of a failure to see them but <Col N="790" /> of an unwillingness to use words that accurately define their nature.  We prefer woollier appellations; thus the words &ldquo;the Republican movement&rdquo; are vague, convenient, give no offence to the conspirators, and are in frequent use.</P>
    <P>I think it would be fair to say of many&mdash;though certainly not of all&mdash;of those who write and broadcast in this country that they have fallen over the years into a cautiously propitiatory habit of reference towards armed conspiracies within the Republican family.</P>
    <P>Members of these conspiracies when apprehended, tried and duly convicted are generally referred to as &ldquo;Republican prisoners&rdquo;, as if they had been jailed for their opinions and not for their crimes, up to and including murder.  Their more spectacular crimes are, indeed, strongly condemned and the armed conspirators are frequently implored to desist from violence.  Such condemnations and such pleas are very often mingled with tributes to various virtues imputed to the conspirators, and a generous attribution of space to all their communiqués and all the hand-outs of the numerous associations whose only significance derives from the consistency of their alignment with the position of one or other wing of the IRA.</P>
    <P>There is also a disquieting tendency to attach credence, or the appearance of credence, to statements by the propaganda wings of these conspiracies, in spite of the fact that they have lied, and been caught lying, on so many occasions.  I would attach only symptomatic importance here to various individual phrases.  One could compile a long list of them; I will mention just a few &mdash; the use in a newspaper of the word &ldquo;execution&rdquo; to describe an IRA murder; the uttering by a columnist of a &ldquo;shout of joy&rdquo; at the news of the Portlaoise escapes; the placing by a Dublin periodical very recently of inverted commas round the word &ldquo;convicted&rdquo; in relation to a convicted criminal of Republican tendencies; the use by a commentator of the phrase &ldquo;subversive organisations, as the Government calls them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> None of these items is of much significance in itself: what is significant is the frequency with which language of this kind is used, the ease with which it is accepted, and the widespread equivocal approach to the IRA in our society which this implies. It is rather rare to find any explicit total rejection of the IRA as having any legitimate role in our society; any explicit recognition of the fact that, in a democracy, there is room for only one army, the army responsible to the people through an elected Government and that the citizens should co-operate with the Government in breaking any private army.</P>
    <P>I put not long ago to the editor of one of our Dublin newspapers&mdash;I speak of newspapers here because I am situating the journalistic context in which broadcasting occurs&mdash;the question whether he regarded the IRA as soldiers fighting for Ireland or as murderers.  He published my letter but made no answer.  From his editorials I would infer that he would regard them as murderers when they kill people in the Twenty-six counties but as soldiers when they kill people belonging to certain categories in Northern Ireland.  Unfortunately, there are quite a few people, in politics as well as in journalism, who share that attitude; and give it oblique expression.</P>
    <P>Indeed, if I have laid here an emphasis on journalism, it is by no means because I would suggest that journalists are primarily responsible for our present predicament in relation to armed conspiracies.  I do not think anything of the sort.  I am discussing journalists here because of the specific bearing of this legislation on journalism and broadcasting is a form of journalism.  I would agree that people coming from a number of other categories&mdash;clergy, teachers, businessmen, trade unionists&mdash;bear responsibility in this area no less than those of journalists.  I am not indicting journalists as a class, nor am I indicting the general membership of the other categories I have mentioned.  I would agree with journalists fully when they say that the prime responsibilities <Col N="792" /> rest with the politicians.  I would be glad to discuss the responsibilities of politicians in this matter, and how I view the distribution of these responsibilities, at another time and place.  But here, on this Bill, we are concerned with broadcasting and with the journalistic content of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I believe that our public are now clear sighted enough about the IRA, that they see its danger generally, detect the falsity of its promises and want nothing to do with it.  The IRA's senseless destructive campaign in Northern Ireland has accomplished that much at least.  But a certain miasma of glamour about these organisations still lingers in the channels of communications.  This is not entirely due to the way in which explicit communications tend to lag behind the intuitive processes through which ordinary citizens reach their conclusions. There are also, as in the question of attitudes to democracy, factors of more widespread application, not confined to our island.  Just as violence is attracted to the camera, so the camera is attracted to violence; it is a case of love at first sight on both sides.</P>
    <P>This is, of course, due not just to the perversity of cameramen or broadcasters generally, but to the fascination which violence has for so many people&mdash;especially for people who can witness or hear about it happening to others from the safety of their own livingroom.  The fascination too may have diminished for viewers in the Republic, as the violence has come nearer.  The news value of violence in itself confers an authority of a kind on those who can dispense violence and even on those more remotely connected with it.  The utterances of Sinn Féin would certainly not attract one-fifth the attention they do if their spokesmen were not rightly felt to be speaking for the gunmen, in spite of their ritual denials that this is so.</P>
    <P>These sympathies, these half-sympathies, these equivocations have their roots in history.  This is true, but it is not a reason for not trying to eliminate them&mdash;as many European <Col N="793" /> nations who also have a history, have eliminated their equivalents&mdash;if we now find them to be noxious to our own lives and those of our children.</P>
    <P>Many people who originally cherished such sympathies have already weighed them and found them altogether wanting, as far as our life now is concerned.  Others, perhaps, while not really supporting the armed conspiracies, would concede them a sort of privileged role, sanctified by historic precedent, existing on a plane above normal judgment and enjoying, if not a legal immunity, a kind of moral immunity for acts which, if committed by ordinary citizens, would be crimes.  This attitude, understandable enough perhaps in the 1920s and 1930s, seems now, in 1975, surely to have something sickly and retarded about it.  In any case the State has to reject firmly any such concept of historically privileged crime, and this rejection will necessarily be reflected in legislation and regulations affecting the State broadcasting system.</P>
    <P>This is not because there is any serious danger at the present time that material sympathetic to the IRA would cause the citizens of the Republic to engage in widespread violence. The results, the dangers are more long-term, and therefore all the more appropriate to be guarded against by legislation.</P>
    <P>Basically, if the State broadcasting system were in any way to accredit the idea that the IRA is a quasi-legitimate institution or that it is appropriate for citizens to be neutral as between the democratic State and the armed conspiracies which seek to usurp its functions&mdash;and have on occasions actually usurped some of them &mdash; then that pattern of presentation coming from that source&mdash;that is, a source closely associated with the State itself&mdash;would tend to confuse the citizens, by intensifying the false air of legitimacy with which the IRA has managed to surround itself and would thereby under any propitious conditions which might occur and there might be such conditions, further the criminal purposes of that organisation.</P>
    <P>Of no less importance than this is consideration of the impact of our <Col N="794" /> broadcasting in Northern Ireland&mdash; and, of course, our sound broadcasting can reach virtually all of Northern Ireland and our television some 14 per cent or 15 per cent of viewers there&mdash;where there exists among the majority a widespread impression&mdash; greatly, understandably and most ominously strengthened by certain events of five years ago&mdash;that this State is in some kind of collusion with the IRA.  Anything in our broadcasting that would seem to confirm that false impression, is directly dangerous to life, both in Northern Ireland and here, and I think Senators will know that I do not exaggerate there.  In normal circumstances, and I hope in all circumstances likely to arise, it is for the broadcasting authority itself to ensure that a proper balance is kept, through the discharge of its responsibilities under law.  But in view of the serious implications of these matters for the State and its people, it is necessary for the State to retain a reserve power of intervention which may never be used, but is there in case of need.</P>
    <P>This legislation seeks at one and the same time to retain that reserve power and to ensure that it is not misused for purposes other than those for which it is intended.  The actual wording of that reserve power, both in section 16 (1) and also in the parallel prohibition to the authority contained in section 3 (1A) will rightly be carefully scrutinised by the Seanad and has already been subjected to some criticism in the Press and by broadcasters. It is criticised as being unduly wide and the objection is understandable. It is fair to point out however that, wide though it may be, it is far less wide than the power conferred by section 31 of the existing Act&mdash;a power which is without limitation of any kind whatever.  I wanted to get rid of this absolute power, so obviously capable of manifold abuse, but I wished the power substituted for it to remain wide in the area where its exercise is justifiable: the area is that of security.</P>
    <P>The wording used in these sections closely resembles the wording used in the British Independent Broadcasting <Col N="795" /> Act of 1973&mdash;and similar prescriptions applied to the BBC&mdash;which have generally not given much concern to journalists and broadcasters.  The wording has, I think, to be reasonably wide if it is to be effective in application to the many unforeseen situations which may arise, to the ever-changing nature of crime and associated forms of disorder, and to the complex relationship of broadcasting to these.</P>
    <P>I think it likely that Senators will seek to amend sections 16 (1) and 3 (1A).  I can promise any such Senators that the most careful consideration will be given to their amendments, if they offer them, and that wherever it can be shown that different wording would tend to eliminate possible abuse, without seriously endangering the objective sought in these sections, and which I have tried to explain in my foregoing words, then I will have no hesitation in accepting that different wording.  But I do not want, either, to hold out any excessive hopes of major change.  That the Government shall retain an adequate reserve power, for security reasons, is a principle which the Government are determined to safeguard and, therefore, any amendments seriously weakening that would be resisted.</P>
    <P>I am not under the illusion that any restrictive provisions embodied in broadcasting legislation can be 100 per cent effective.  The 1960 Act, which in its present form is considerably more sweeping and drastic in its provisions than it will be if these amendments are carried, was yet by no means always successful in restraining the kind of manifestations which it was presumably intended to restrain.  Legislation is static; broadcasting fluid and volatile; broadcasters always impatient of curbs and on occasions ingenious in evading them.</P>
    <P>Restraints work only in a clumsy, intermittent and painful fashion unless those concerned are themselves convinced of a need for some restraints. If of course it were certain that all broadcasters were convinced <Col N="796" /> of such a need and would in all circumstances remain so, then there would be no need for any external legislative restraint.  However, this is not likely to be the case.  The broad-caster's professional instinct, I believe, inclines him or her towards exposure of what is exciting, even sensational and to regard the possible social effects of such exposure as conjectural and outside his or her sphere.</P>
    <P>Instances of active sympathy with the armed conspiracies and desire to promote their cause by propaganda are rare, though not altogether unknown. A kind of neutral professionalism, indifferent to social consequences, is much more widespread and lasting.  It is for this reason that the public interest has, in the Government's view, to be protected.  The old legislation, and the amendments to it which I now propose, both aimed to serve that end.  If legislation is to serve that end as effectively as possible, broadcasters and other interested citizens should have the opportunity of understanding, not just the nature of the steps the Oireachtas is taking, but the reasons why it judges such steps as it will eventually decide to be necessary.</P>
    <P>In this respect I think that the weakness of the old legislation was not just the unrestricted power conferred by section 31, but the failure to offer reasons why restrictive powers were needed at all.  As a result of this it was natural for broadcasters to regard the section in question as a kind of arbitrary big stick which might be brought down on them at any time, in any way, and for any reason.  I do not believe broadcasters generally will like my sections 3 (1A) and 16 very much better than the old section 31, but at least they now have some idea &mdash;though they may say not yet a clear enough idea&mdash;of the category to which the restrictive power is itself restricted, and the reasons for all this.</P>
    <P>They will also have had an opportunity of learning the framework of ideas in which the legislation is set and the intent and frame of mind of the Government with regard to it.  It is my belief also and my hope, that when the debate here and in the Dáil <Col N="797" /> is completed they will have a very full idea of the mind of the Oireachtas on these matters.  They have also their opportunity both as citizens and experts to influence&mdash;I am referring to broadcasting&mdash;our debate and perhaps also the ultimate form of the legislation.  Some of their representatives have been in touch with me on this matter and I believe they will also have been in touch with some Senators about amendments which they consider desirable.  Any such amendments which Senators may think worthy of adopting and submitting I shall be prepared to study carefully with a view to improving the wording of this Bill, always subject to the safeguarding of its essential substance.</P>
    <P>It is my greatest hope that this debate may lead to a better understanding between the Government, the rest of the elected representatives of the people, the broadcasting authority, the executives of RTE and professional broadcasters generally, with regard to the legislative framework of broadcasting in this country.  The thinking behind a law, as expressed during a debate on a Bill has to be considered irrelevant by the judges who interpret the law.  It will not however, I think, be felt to be altogether irrelevant by those who have to work under that law.</P>
    <P>The latter part of my remarks has tended to dwell upon those negative aspects with which it is the duty of the Government to concern themselves I have not wished to gloss over those limitations and restrictions which this Bill retains.  At the same time it should be kept in mind that this is not a more restrictive Bill than those provisions which it seeks to change.  It is distinctly less restrictive in relation to the authority while it delimits the powers of the Government more strictly, and provides for parliamentary scrutiny of these.  It reinforces the authority's security of tenure during the period of its appointment. It limits the ministerial orders which may be issued to the authority both in the scope and in duration, and makes them subject to annulment by either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>By providing for a Broadcasting <Col N="798" /> Complaints Commission it protects the authority from a possible situation under which a Minister, armed with the altogether unrestricted powers available under the old Act, could have made himself arbiter on impartiality, even in a case with which he was concerned politically, departmentally or personally.  The authority gains greater financial autonomy under section 9, and in a number of additional minor ways its position is strengthened.  Section 13 gives a wider interpretation of the duties in relation to culture, and this also is a relaxation of the existing position.</P>
    <P>As well as providing in these ways for a widening of the area of freedom of the RTE Authority, the Bill also aims at clearing the way to enable Irish viewers to have wider freedom of choice.  This is the meaning of the provisions for rebroadcasting&mdash;section 6 &mdash; and in relation to cable systems &mdash; section 12.</P>
    <P>In short, I think this Bill could be fairly described as one of the moderate liberalisation.  To revert to a passage which I quoted earlier, the Government are not prepared to ignore or minimise the threat of &ldquo;anarchy&rdquo; but not prepared, either, to allow that threat to push it towards what would in present circumstances be &ldquo;excess of rule&rdquo;.  In fact we aim to reduce a certain &ldquo;excess of rule&rdquo; now existing under the present Act.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Senators for their patience in listening to this lengthy introduction of the Bill. I now look forward to the debate.  I believe that a discussion of these issues in depth both in the Oireachtas and in the Press and media is likely to be no less significant than the actual legislation itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the Minister for giving the Seanad this opportunity to debate this amending Bill but I should add that such a lengthy introduction is new to this House.  The Minister's private philosophy on what he calls this liberal democratic State could be announced in other forms because it is not applicable to this Bill other than to say that the Government, after their loud and vociferous utterings, <Col N="799" /> have arrived at a stage where, despite a gimmicky rephrasing of words, have not changed section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, an Act which some present Ministers who were not Ministers prior to two years ago claimed was repressive legislation. Now that they are in Government, other than twisting words, they have not changed the situation as regards section 31 of the 1960 Act.</P>
      <P>The nation and, as the Minister said, many liberals in the nation, were expecting this Bill to be a broad Bill but it contains nothing concerning choice of programmes for the whole country.  There is nothing in it about open television and open broadcasting. I cannot see one single reference that would indicate broader broadcasting, a better choice of programmes and better programme functioning by RTE.  This Bill provided an opportunity to give to the nation an equal opportunity to see broadcasting liberalised, as the Minister phrased it.</P>
      <P>During the past number of years in certain areas a choice of programmes has been provided by cable &mdash;channel television.  However, great expanses of this Twenty-six county Republic have been deprived of this facility.  As the Minister said, a second transmission station would be on by now were it not for certain legal problems that have to be overcome. In his introduction he stated that there are certain legal problems to be overcome with the British Government. We heard of those legal problems 12 months ago.  We still hear of them. I assume from this statement that by this time next year or in two years' time there will still be certain legal problems and that we will not have open television much less a choice of programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in that respect that this Bill gives an opportunity to the Minister and to the Government to expand the RTE signal.  There were several pages devoted to the Minister's definition of subversive organisations and of this nation being bedevilled by them.  Here was an opportunity for the Minister to unload some of the necessary information on the Six Counties of <Col N="800" /> north-eastern Ireland through an RTE signal.  In that way he could have eliminated the ignorance of our situation among people who should know our situation and, perhaps, help to eliminate the present horrible situation as described by the Minister.  This is an opportunity which he has failed to take, but we will be tabling certain amendments in an effort to assist the Minister out of this predicament.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that he will accept any reasonable amendment that would help in achieving this goal.</P>
    <P>As I read through this Bill I consider it nothing but a bluff &mdash; a bluff of words by the Government and by the Minister to say that we are to have a second station and that that station will not be allowed to transmit. It is quite clear now, and the Minister stated this for a second and a third time, that those legal problems have not been overcome even though he assumes they may be in time, but an assumption at this stage is not good enough for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Coming to RTE itself, I refer to a statement by the outgoing Director General in which he said that RTE's job was to educate, inform and entertain. I speak for a lot of people when I say that this statement should be rephrased. I hope the Government and the Minister would agree that RTE's prime function is to entertain, secondly, to inform and, thirdly, to educate.  The majority of our people like sporting and light entertainment programmes.  They do not want to be educated through television.  Their prime concern is entertainment, and the Minister should try to provide it. The Irish people would agree that it is RTE's job to entertain, to inform and perhaps, by both, to educate.</P>
    <P>The principal changes in the Bill are, first, those contained in section 2. This section can be looked at from two different points of view.  One could say it is reasonable to give both Houses of the Oireachtas the opportunity to exercise control over members of the RTE Authority.  This will probably be welcomed by many Members of the Houses.  But some Members may say it is a &ldquo;chicken out&rdquo;<Col N="801" /> by the Minister to pass on his responsibility to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That point of view may be held because since it is not the function of the Houses of the Oireachtas to appoint the members of the RTE Authority, why should it be their function to sack the members of the authority, who were appointed by the Minister and the Government? This is a very valid point.</P>
    <P>What would be welcome would be to make it the function of both Houses of the Oireachtas both to appoint and to dismiss members of the authority.  This point must be considered. It is not fair for any Minister or any Government to make appointments and then transfer to another body the responsibility for the removal from office of those appointed.  It is important to have both powers or to have none.  We do not know how we would be expected to perform this duty.  Will it be by a motion from the Minister to both Houses or to a single House?  Will it be by motion of the Government?</P>
    <P>The Minister should, in the first instance, state that the House should have authority to appoint members and, secondly, give them power to remove members from office.  Alternatively, he should not give the Houses of the Oireachtas any authority.  As the Bill stands, it is a &ldquo;trick-o'-the-loop&rdquo; effort.  It is not quite fair to this House&mdash;I do not wish to speak on behalf of the other House, but it is not fair to that House either&mdash;to ask us to remove from office an appointee of the Minister or of the Government. It is a shirking of responsibility by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the setting up by the Government of an independent commission.  One would not wish to be critical of certain steps the Government take but one must be wary of the people who would be appointed to this commission.  They have not been named so we cannot comment on them.  If the meaning of the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; here is as is understood usually, we should know before this Bill is passed what qualification a man must have to be accredited as an independent member of this commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> There are six codes under which the commission will deal with complaints. I note the fifth one, which deals with breaches of the RTE authority's code of advertising standards.  I would like to know who defines the code.  What is the definition of the code?  Does this definition change from Minister to Minister, from Government to Government?</P>
    <P>While this commission may appear under the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; it has very little bite in it.  You can complain to this commission, but what action can the commission take.  Is there a real bite in this commission to say &ldquo;yes, that is correct&rdquo; or &ldquo;no, that is not correct&rdquo;?  Can we see in this Bill this independent commission having such authority?  I cannot read that into it.  Therefore, we will be asking the Minister on the next Stage to define clearly what authority, what strength, what bite this independent commission will have.</P>
    <P>Section 6 enables the Minister, after consultation with the authority, to direct them to rebroadcast programmes broadcast by other broadcasting organisations in addition to the authority's own programmes.  Here again this legal liability arises.  This is an attempt by the Minister to convey the impression of open broadcasting, but does the section do this? How can you stop BBCI from putting before the people a programme or a synopsis of a programme about those the Minister assumes are subversive people or people whom the Government assume are objectionable? Where in this section do the Minister, the Government or this House get around this legal problem?  It appears to me to be the main problem in this Bill.  Words, no matter how well spoken by the Minister or by the Government, cannot overcome this problem.</P>
    <P>Section 16 enables the Minister to issue a direction by statutory order to RTE to refrain from broadcasting a particular matter or matter of a particular class which in his opinion would be likely to promote or incite to crime or lead to disorder.  Section 31, subsection (1), of the Broadcasting Authority Act of 1960 reads that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> The Minister may direct the Authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or matter of any particular class, and the Authority shall comply with the direction.</P>
    <P>What is in this Bill is nothing more than a gimmickry rephrasing, but the Minister has stated it is similar to the English Government's Act governing the BBC.  It is no different from section 31.  It is just a spate of words, a volume of documentation, trying to escape from section 31 of the 1960 Act.  It fails because when one is read beside the other the meaning is clear. It is just a backtracking or a back-kicking by this Government using words and rephrasing section 31 of the old Act.  One could say, for example, that the programme <i>Cannon</i> is inciting.  We talk of guns and of men of guns holding legal power by means of the gun in some areas.  One could say that the use of the gun in this programme is destructive and incites. Can the Minister describe the different types of incitement?  I see words and phrases being used&mdash;for example, the phrase &ldquo;incite to crime&rdquo;.  As I see it the Minister has power to direct. This is replacing section 31 by narrowing rather than broadening.  How is the section to be implemented and applied? Will it be applied by way of writing or by motion of the Minister or of the Government?</P>
    <P>One can see absolutely nothing extra in this Bill as compared with the existing legislation.  Section 19 is another example of words.  How does the Minister propose to apply that section?  How will it work?  Is it workable? Can it be applied by the law of the land?  From a glance at it it seems impossible to work it.  I do not think the time of this House, or the other House, should be taken up by a Bill we presumed and assumed would be a broad Bill which would put into an Act the broad utterances and broad promises made by the Minister and the Government.  It is a disappointment to see that it is so narrow.  Many sections of it are unworkable.</P>
    <P>With all the Press articles and television <Col N="804" /> debates, many were looking forward to this Bill.  However, it is so false, unreal, and unworkable that one can hardly say one welcomes it or opposes it.  In my opinion it is an expansion of nothing which achieves nothing except dialogue about many things other than those the people expected to be dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill relating to a very fundamental and important matter, and it has been introduced by a speech of the utmost importance.  This House compliments the Government's decision to introduce the Bill here to give us an opportunity to have that rational debate which the Minister has invited us to participate in and which I hope will now start.</P>
      <P>My general reaction to the Bill is to favour its provisions, but the Minister has invited us to a debate which essentially involves the possibility of questioning and even adding points of dissent.  If there is questioning among the committed ranks of the supporters of this Government it should not be understood to indicate any lack of potency in that Government but rather should it be seen as a mark of identification of the type of Government it is.  I question certain points, but having regard to the fact that the Minister is conducting the affair I must not be taken &ldquo;as talking for victory&rdquo;, because I know how I would fare in such a contest.  I hope that the openness of mind which is the Minister's chief characteristic will be supported and aided by a physological self-analysis to enable him consider the validity of any criticisms I may make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had some doubt on the rephrasing of the functions or objectives, of whatever is the amendment to section 17, with regard to the upholding of the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution, as to whether that was not too narrow an extension.  I recognise the entire section to be a welcome extension of the section it is replacing.  I wonder whether in regard to this extension, by not including all these matters such as personal rights which are enshrined also in the Constitution, why we are selecting just <Col N="805" /> one aspect of the Constitution to give the Authority a particular function to relate to it.  On consideration of the broad general responsibilities being sought to be discharged I have come to the conclusion that that is probably a fair and proper selection of what should be the objective of the Authority in its programme.</P>
    <P>I was glad that the Minister opened by an appropriate reference and a tribute to our late President, Erskine Childers.  I wondered if it would have been forgotten that he inaugurated the practical change which led to the effective autonomy of the broadcasting authority and to its significant improvement even preceding the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  It is useful to remember how much it has been improved in considering the importance of reconciling the objective of maintaining not merely what the Minister referred to, the security of the State, but the authority of the State, which is also referred to in the relevant Article of the Constitution with regard to this matter, with the freedom of the Authority charged with the duties of programming.  It is a delicate balance and solutions offered in this Bill seem to be well balanced. Obviously we have the liberty to look at the language of particular sections at a later stage.</P>
    <P>On this question of autonomy and the freedom of the Authority, which is so important for its own self-confidence, for its becoming a more worthwhile institution, having such a morale, that the people who work there are inspired by the sense of doing a worthwhile job, we must realise that they need not merely such protection as is being provided in an improved way by this Bill but, they also need, so far as it is possible in Irish circumstances to achieve it, financial independence and security. This is a matter we will have to look at more closely and receive more information about at the later stage. In a funny way despite the magnificent breadth of the Minister's speech this could be more a Committee Stage Bill than the &ldquo;Second Reading Bill&rdquo;.  There are so many aspects which, if one wants to develop in <Col N="806" /> depth, one cannot do unless one can fit them under the relevant section. I see this question of the financial independence of the Authority arising with regard to this whole question of re-broadcasting under section 12 about which the Minister has chosen not to tell us too much but which may have financial significances if the legal obstacles that we know are really there.  In spite of what Senator Killilea says, if these are overcome, the consequence of overcoming them may itself give rise to debate. We ought to know all about it, in so far as we can, at the time we are proposing to enact the section providing for this.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this significant departure, the type of security of tenure which is given to the members of the Authority.  There may be precedents for this somewhere else but if there are I do not know of them. It is almost like the type of security that is enjoyed by certain members of the Judiciary.  There are those who are not protected by the Constitution provisions.  It is very extensive.</P>
    <P>There is also this empowering of the authority to appoint advisory committees. It seems odd that they did not have this power before now.  It is entirely right that they should have.  They are given a freedom now to publish and distribute printed materials, notices, publications, magazines and recorded oral and visual material.  They are also, in an uninhibited and unlimited way, given the right to get the net receipts from the licensing fees.</P>
    <P>I should like to understand the significance of the removal of this limitation.  It may relate to the ability of the authority to go off and borrow money and say to the proposed lender that they are assured of all the licence fee net of cost.  I wonder, if this is the position, why they are not allowed to collect it themselves, employing the cheapest type agent they can find rather than using the authority of the post office for collection?</P>
    <P>The Bill also strengthens their position of automony in giving greater <Col N="807" /> flexibility in fixing hours of broadcasting. The Minister's thinking seems to be that the proposed section 4 with regard to the Broadcasting Complaints' Commission will also be protective of the authority.  This is the only point in relation to those provisions with regard to extension of the powers of the Authority about which I remain doubtful.  We have been told that there is a Complaints' Advisory Committee and we should have known it. We should know before we enact a provision substituting for it something as fully thought out as this particular section is how this Advisory Committee worked.  How many complaints of what type of nature were received and how many were found to be justified?</P>
    <P>Is there any danger that this type of section may foster complaints? If a person is in business and nobody turns up he is almost inclined to go out on the street and look for people to pick up his card.  Is there any possibility that the complaints commission will be looking for complaints and that the complaints will come into existence by the very existence of the commission?</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the cost which one must think about because it is a parameter of all our endeavours in legislation.  If it is an unnecessary cost what is the justification for having it?  How much will the existence of this commission invade the free operations of the authority itself?  How does it work in other countries?  When we get to that section I should like to hear more about it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the definition in section 3, the strengthening of the provisions regarding objectivity and impartiality, this is really to realise in legislation something like the ideology of television.  While it is desirable it is obviously a matter for consideration whether the language is in all circumstances desirable.  It is an improvement on what exists.</P>
    <P>As I understand the reality of the Minister's observations with regard to the very real change he has made in <Col N="808" /> relation to the improved public control, I understand this to mean that it is to be &ldquo;for real&rdquo; and that control will be exercised.  I am inferring this from the language I read in the Bill and from the words the Minister has spoken; I know no more about it than that.  There will be control exercised which it has not been felt by the Government they could exercise because it would not be possible to do it in so clearly defined a way and so public a fashion.  This is really what lies behind the Minister's analysis of justification for what he called repressive legislation.  I do not know what type of liberals we are. Unlike the Minister, who hesitates at the word &ldquo;censor&rdquo;, he dislikes the thing, I do not see why he should dislike a thing if he feels he has to use the thing.  If the Minister does not hesitate at the stronger words of &ldquo;repressive legislation&rdquo; I do not see why he hesitates at the less strong word of &ldquo;censor&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If we can censor to prevent people incite to crime, to create public disorder, to strengthen private armies and conspiracies, what are the reasons we do not censor for other intentions and purposes, whether there are not to be found among the human beings we have to govern vulnerable conditions which need the intervention of censorship? We should look at the absence of the use of the word &ldquo;morality&rdquo; which appears in the Constitution with regard to the broadcasting authority.  This is, interestingly, missing from the 1960 Act as well as from this Bill.  The Minister does not refer to the Constitution when he asks the question concerning the limitation on who has the right to express opinions and what are the limitations on the State preventing the expression of opinions.  A lot about it is set out in Article 40, paragraph (6) (1) of the Constitution, whose existence I would suggest to the Minister may give rise to some difficulties for him when he comes to apply section 12 of this Bill.  If he gives a direction to the Authority to rebroadcast on a basis which does not give the Authority any right to do the things which the State is enjoined by this Constitution to do, how valid a direction will that be? However, he has good advisers to turn <Col N="809" /> to on that matter.  It is worth putting on the record what the Article says in regard to this.  Article 40, paragraph 6 (1) reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The State guarantees liberty for the exercise of the following rights, subject to public order and morality:&mdash;</P>
    <P>These words do not appear in the Act or in the Bill which is amending it. The liberalisation of Ireland which the Minister discerned must have begun before 1960 because these words are missing from the Act of that year which was introduced here in 1959.</P>
    <P>That Article states:</P>
    <P>The right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.</P>
    <P>The education of public opinion&mdash;</P>
    <P>None of the hesitancy of Senator Killilea about education is to be found in the Constitution adopted by our people in 1937.</P>
    <P>&mdash;being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy&mdash;</P>
    <P>This does not appear in the Act which at present applies or the Bill which proposes to amend it, curiously.  It seems strange that the authority is not allowed to express its own opinion as an authority if it is given a constitutional right to express criticism of Government policy under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>&mdash;shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>I attach great significance to the words, &ldquo;or the authority of the State&rdquo;, in terms of the way we must think in relation to curing the sickness which the Minister has so well diagnosed and described in his references to it.</P>
    <P>The last sentence of that Article of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>The publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious, or indecent <Col N="810" /> matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>In the light of that Article the Minister should not have hesitated on the perilous fringes of theology.  He will be required to discharge his constitutional duty to go across those fringes as bravely as he has gone across many another fringe over the last six useful years.</P>
    <P>There were some sentences in the Minister's speech, which I should like to refer to, even if I am boring in doing so, with regard to this whole question of the IRA and armed conspiracies. In one way I go further than he does in his language.  As I said in this House some years ago, I see no theoretical reason whatsoever why this State should not intern all armed conspirators.  The only reason why the State should hesitate in doing so is if it could not do it effectively and would not retain the concensus of the support of public opinion.  That is the only reason it would not work. The Minister has not said that but I want to say it because it is well not to depart from fundamental principles, not to be too shy about them or to evade them.</P>

      <P>That is quite noted but it did not work in the last few years for particular historical reasons.  It did work for many other periods of years before that.  That is not the point.  I want to tell the Minister that I so much agree with him but I go further than him.  I want to repeat some of the sentences in his speech which I have never seen better stated:</P>
      <P>Where the gunmen's mind is the sole legislature and judicature, and his armed hand the executive...</P>
      <P>Words are in fact an integral part of many patterns of actions...</P>
      <P>A free Press has turned its critical attention more closely on the faults of that State than on the forces which threaten it.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the &ldquo;cautiously propitiatory habit of reference towards armed conspiracies within the Republican family.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> The Minister spoke quite strikingly of the news value of Ireland, that it is conferring authority on those who dispense it.  I like particularly his concept of the historically privileged crime.  Finally, he refers to a kind of neutral professionalism indifferent to the social consequences as being a much more widespread and lasting danger.  All of that is very important: repression, the right to repress, the right of the State to defend itself, the right of this democracy to protect itself and not be a damned fool and an ass and sit there and be knocked down through lack of courage to adopt the right measures.  I am all for that, but repression is not enough.</P>
    <P>I have had to say all that so the Minister will not think I am one of those people who says &ldquo;but&rdquo;.  I am not one of those people who say &ldquo;but&rdquo;, but there is a social sickness here.  It is connected with the means used to establish this State.  It is connected with the events which succeeded its establishment.  It is connected with our whole long, violent history; and repression, like censorship, is just about as good as an aspirin is for a man with a tumour in his head.  We must think much more positively than we do when we merely condemn.  We cannot today see what precisely we do.</P>
    <P>We really have in this matter a very long-term problem.  It is true that the crimes the armed conspirators commit are, in a sense, the worst type of crimes, irrespective of the violence they use, because in ultimate terms they are engaged in treason, even if they were men who carried toy pistols and not real ones.  Therefore, by their conspiracies essentially they are committing the worst crimes.  But listening to the words which the Minister used when he talked about philosophical anarchists, I was reminded to adapt them to what Dr. Johnson said about another type of thinker&mdash;that they are philosophical anarchists as dogs are philosophical anarchists, never having given the matter any thought.  They are preconditioned by the history for which many of their elders, including some of ourselves, have a degree of <Col N="812" /> responsibility, by sins of omission if not of activity, by failure to apply early enough the scalpel of criticism which the Minister himself has applied, pre-eminently in the last few years, to the concepts that were offered to them to encourage them in the activity of their lives.  In another sense, they can produce something like a condition of mind which would accord with the McNaughton rules to justify their position, that they should really be detained during the pleasure of the Government while their condition of mind remains unhealed. I think that, while repression is necessary, re-education in the ultimate sense by open, brave and firm discussion of the real issues involved is the most important step to take.</P>
    <P>There is another thing I feel is appropriate in relation to this.  &ldquo;Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sé&rdquo; is an Irish observation which I have found useful when applied to my own children. Many of the people in this situation in Ireland are truly vulnerable children. It may be that a wave of discouragement about the whole Irish enterprise has some degree of responsibility for their condition.  I wonder whether, as legislators, we should be thinking more about the conditions which make for the lack of self-confidence of Irish people, which is, I think, the most notable characteristic of modern Irish life.  I am no historian but I think the new developing techniques of psychology and sociology ought really to be brought to bear to assist us in working out a solution.</P>
    <P>In another place I have used the word &ldquo;denazification&rdquo;.  Some equivalent to denazification may be required, some kind of national act of repentence, with regard to all that has been done by our people in pursuing these aims offered to them to pursue and adopted by them.</P>
    <P>There was a recommendation from the Broadcasting Review Committee about legislative provisions with regard to the duties of the Authority. I wonder whether one should give more consideration&mdash;the Minister has obviously considered it but perhaps he will reconsider it in the context of what we have been saying to him <Col N="813" /> here&mdash;to whether the taking on by the authority of a more formal task, expressed certainly in different language from the language used by the Broadcasting Review Committee, might not be a means of dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>The very existence of television itself has got to be considered.  I do not know that it is not appropriate for us to be considering what the effect of television, in so far as we have had it here, has been in the last 15 or 16 years.  What analysis has been made?  I look at the original functions of the Authority and I suggest to the Minister that he might consider now whether it would be necessary to add to the functions of the Authority the function of discovering what were the effects of its own programmes on the people, what the effect of television generally is on the people.  I am not saying&mdash;as it would be a hopeless position to take, even if one could democratically hope to succeed in holding it, which one could not&mdash;that one should exclude any type of new technology in the field of the media, entertainment and communications.  Not at all.  I am one who accepts this in its implications. But one then considers in a modern, rational and humane way just what controls have to be applied, what objectives have to be given.  Why do we hesitate at the education formula?</P>
    <P>I am not one who says that entertainment is bad, obviously not.  Entertainment of the right kind is altogether good for people.  But there is this whole question which relates to the very nature of man: how does man best find himself and get himself into a position of free action? What is the true nature of freedom. It seems to me to relate to some analysis of what a man is.  The objective of government may well be primarily to try to remove the dehumanising conditions in man's life which limit and inhibit him in expressing himself freely and being creative.  Marx's best contribution, I think, was his concept of the alienation of man in his work.  Because of his participation in the industrial process he was no longer engaged in a creative activity and he was alienated <Col N="814" /> by this.  But a lot of Marx is irrelevant because he could not, despite his prophetic powers, gifts and abilities, see all that was going to happen afterwards.</P>
    <P>One of the things Marx did not see was that there would emerge people with free time available for exploitation by profit makers, just as much as they were available before the exploitation when they did not have free time, when all their time had to be given to their work to maintain themselves.  Perhaps we should be considering whether or not there is this exploitative element now in the whole field of communications and entertainment which itself is dehumanising and alienating man now, not any longer limited to alienation from his work, but from his recreation so that the passivity which is, in fact, detected as one of the effects among deprived people, is not lying behind some of violence which is to be discovered in modern society.</P>
    <P>Many of us dislike the notion of spiritual capital in the sense that this might be a further excuse for locking ourselves up here, staying at home and saying we are all great and excusing ourselves from facing the realities of our lives.  But perhaps there should be some examination of these things that we ought to be striving to preserve, that we ought to be encouraging what is now a word that has come back&mdash; when the practice has declined in Britain the concept is being discussed &mdash;the concept of deference.  The deference which Bagehot analysed as being the strongest element in the British Constitution, which is now disappearing, is a habit of mind which we may need for our democracy to survive in the rather doubtful circumstances in which it does.  I am quite pessimistic about the future with regard to parliamentary democracy everywhere and more particularly here, certainly if we are not energetic about it.</P>
    <P>The habit of deference is certainly not going to be engendered, to make a solid and realistic point, if we try to say to the people of Ireland: &ldquo;You should respect parliamentary democracy&rdquo; and we do not then proceed to respect it ourselves.  We do not engage <Col N="815" /> in real debate between the parties.  We engage in a ridiculous system of point-making to which everybody realises there is no reality. It is just an excuse for thinking.  This engenders disrespect of parliamentary democracy.  I gather from newspaper commentators that a Deputy's contribution recently to the operation of the whole mode of democracy has not been welcomed by members of any of the parties.  I did not read very much about this, but this kind of idea ought to be explored.  Perhaps we could improve our procedures in this House, if they do not in the other House, people who know something about the matter to hand would deal with it and those who did not could go off and have a drink.  We would get our business done with more sense and with less waste of administrative and ministerial time.  My remarks are intended to relate to the positive steps which ought to be taken with regard to coping with this lack of confidence in people which is expressed in violence.</P>
    <P>With regard to sections 6 and 12, which relate to rebroadcasting programmes, I should like to raise a few points on this Second Stage so that the Minister might before Committee Stage provide information which Senators might want on this Bill.  I have read the case for a second RTE station.  I have not seen a fully articulated case made against it.  The phrase &ldquo;open broadcasting&rdquo; has enormous political power and the brute force of politics which became quite evident at a certain stage this afternoon, has always to be respected by people who have to operate with good sense the power that is to be collected from the people.  We must not be corrupted by our own words or our own propaganda.</P>
    <P>How open will this broadcasting be? What are understood to be its effects? What are the alternatives?  What are the costs?  What, in this field, is meant by competition?  In a situation where we are having several secondary schools closing down because of lack of money, we ought not to be putting money into something unless after a <Col N="816" /> full debate of all the facts we are fully satisfied in a time of scarce resources that we should engage in this cost incurring activity rather than in putting our money into maintaining the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>In considering any measures in this House we must be conscious all the time of scarcity of resources.  People who engage in economic and social criticism of the achievements of this country should be made aware of the fact that the average <i>per capita</i> income of our people is less than 70 per cent of the average <i>per capita</i> income of the British people.  If we are engaging in comparative performances let us remember the different standards of resources from which we operate.  We should always be aware of how scarce our resources are and how scarce they will continue to be.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to an Athens of 2,000 years ago.  The Athens to which he referred was significantly xenophobic.  Maybe the Dublin we should be proud of shall be whatever the equivalent of &ldquo;xenophobic&rdquo; would be in Dublinese.  If we Irish fail to put things Irish first, nobody else will put them first.</P>

Tuigim nach bhfuil mórán ann ach leathnú beag ar an Acht a bhí ann roimhe seo.  Ceapas ón méid litríochta a scaip an tAire thart agus os na billeógaí a fuair mé féin gur Bille an-chasta ar fad a bhí ann agus go raibh na mílte rudaí ann ach b'féidir nach maith leis an tAire cad atá á rá agam anois&mdash;do bhí sé cosúil le seanmóin.

Cuireann sé ar bhaill an <Col N="817" /> Oireachtais an obair sin a dhéanamh dó ón uair seo amach.

      <P>Before we adjourned I had been saying that the Bill affords us an opportunity of making some remarks about broadcasting in general.  Broadcasting should convey information, education and entertainment, though not necessarily in that order.  Broadcasters have an important role to play in the life of any nation.  They should be very responsible people because of the power they possess to mould opinions.</P>
      <P>We are a very small country sandwiched between two English speaking countries, Great Britain and America. These countries have been pouring propaganda into our country and we we cannot prevent them.  Newspapers and television programmes of various kinds reach our shores.  It is important therefore that our broadcasting service should have a national outlook and do its best to project our Irish way of life.  That was recognised when the State was founded.  It was one of the main reasons for the establishment of Radio Éireann and subsequent establishment of Telefís Éireann.</P>
      <P>A national broadcasting service should be able to sustain our identity as a nation.  Other nations jealously regard their rights to broadcast.  All countries, especially during the last war and since, have used their broadcasting services to put over their own points of view.  Each year Britain spends millions projecting the British way of life into every country possible &mdash;the idea that they are a superior race.  The British have long years of experience in doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it may be all right to make a broadcasting authority autonomous, <Col N="819" /> I believe the Minister should be in control.  Broadcasting, both televison and radio, penetrates into all our homes and exerts a tremendous influence on the lives of everybody. It can be used for good or evil and the broadcasting authority should be concerned to put out the best programmes possible.</P>
    <P>Coming from a Border county I have always been puzzled why it is that people living in the Six Counties are unable to get Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann.  If the Minister has any extra money to spend on the broadcasting service, these people should be his first priority.  The people in the Six Counties want to hear and see our programmes.  I believe the Minister would like them to be in a position to know exactly what is happening down here and there is no better means of doing that than making our television and radio programmes available to them.</P>
    <P>Almost 50 per cent of the programmes put out by our broadcasting service are British or American.  There may be a reason for that.  It is probably the cost, because it takes a lot of money to produce programmes at home.  Such a programme as <i>The Riordans</i> is tremendously popular.  We hear a lot of gloom nowadays that it is refreshing to turn on a programme such as that.  The people of rural Ireland in particular would be sorry to lose it, yet it is such programmes that often are axed when cuts have to be made.</P>
    <P>About 50 per cent of the people here can receive television programmes from outside.  The Broadcasting Review Committee recommended a second channel.  It is only fair that people in parts of the country unable to receive outside television should have an alternative programme available to them.  Unfortunately, the only alternative at the moment is the English programme, although in five or ten years' time it may be possible to receive continental programmes.  In the meantime, the Minister should consider providing a choice of programmes, which would include continental programmes, <Col N="820" /> rather than having us soaked with canned Anglo-American material.</P>
    <P>Would it be possible for the Minister to approach the Six County people to see if we could provide an all Ireland programme on a co-operative basis?  They are reasonable people there.  At present UTV produces excellent programmes on Irish culture, music and dance.  These are worthwhile programmes which would be much appreciated by the people of the entire country.  Some might think that, because of the political situation and being part of the British Empire, the people in the Six Counties have abandoned their Irish culture.  That is not so.  I am sure many Senators are aware that for years they have been running a folk school in Belfast and sending their people around the country collecting old Irish tunes and folklore. Co-operation between ourselves and the Six Counties would enrich us both.  It would be well to have the proposed second channel under our own control rather than rebroadcasting BBC programmes.  As I said, the Minister might be able to provide a selection of programmes including the best available on the Continent.</P>
    <P>RTE do not seem to have any regular programmes in the Irish language for children.  I am not a fanatic as far as the language is concerned.  However since the foundation of this State the language has been taught in our schools and a large number of people would understand and appreciate simple programmes in Irish. Such programmes would be of great help to our school children.</P>
    <P>Since we became a member of the EEC there has been more goodwill for the language.  People have come to appreciate how important it is to have a second language and how it enables us add a third, fourth or fifth.  The Minister himself is widely travelled and well-versed in languages.  He can appreciate the advantage it is to anybody going abroad to be able to speak his own language as well as French or German.  Television could be effectively used to help people in that respect.  That should be one of its functions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> There are a few things in the Bill to which I should like to make specific reference.  Section 2 states:</P>
    <P>A member of the Authority may be removed by the Government from office for stated reasons, if, and only if, resolutions are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas calling for his removal.</P>
    <P>That is a departure from the existing legislation.  With respect, I submit that the Minister is more or less shrinking his responsibility.  If he delegates power to the Oireachtas to remove a member of the Authority, he should also give power to the Oireachtas to appoint the members of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (1) provides:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Authority, direct the Authority to rebroadcast programmes broadcast from any source other than the Authority and specified in the direction.</P>
    <P>Where will these programmes come from?  Is this giving the Minister absolute power?  Could these programmes come from Russia, China or elsewhere?  Nothing is specified.  It simply says: &ldquo;from any source&rdquo;. This is giving the Minister enormous responsibility.</P>
    <P>I would agree with section 13 which provides that the Authority shall in its programming:</P>
    <P>...be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland, ensure that the programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland, and have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular for the Irish language.</P>
    <P>It was very fair of the Minister to include that and it will be very useful indeed.  If we follow that line we will not be going very wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister is no doubt aware that audience research shows that Irish language programmes have large viewing figures.  It is estimated that over 650,000 people view &ldquo;Feach&rdquo;, 210,000 view &ldquo;Gairm&rdquo; and about <Col N="822" /> 780,000 people watch &ldquo;Amuigh Faoin Spéir&rdquo;.  These are important educational programmes of immense benefit and I should like to see them getting every encouragement.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to violence, but there is violence in almost all the imported canned programmes on RTE.  In most cases the hero is the man who can shoot the other fellow dead.  I have seen young people glued to the television set watching these programmes and gloating when the so-called hero uses the maximum amount of violence and strikes down another human being.  Such programmes are really a form of propaganda, many of them degrading the American Indians who were, if you like, fighting an invader.  Such programmes inculcate violence into our young people.  Something should be done about violence as a whole.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in regard to the financing of television and radio.  The Authority have to rely on licence fees and advertising revenue.  Consequently they have not much say in what form the advertisements take.  I believe there is far too much glorification of drink on television and some of the drink advertisements are very detrimental to our young people.  They see those who are portrayed as the best people partaking of drink.  I do not wish to be a killjoy but I believe that young people fortunate enough to have jobs at present should be encouraged to save their money and to enjoy themselves in other ways.  Our youth of today are the men and women of tomorrow and those in charge of broadcasting should not take lightly their responsibility of providing the best service possible.  They should inculcate a good national outlook.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his fine speech.  He certainly took time out to make his case.  While there are sections of the Bill I certainly would disagree with, we shall have an opportunity on Committee Stage of putting forward amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a few points relevant to the Minister's speech.  He <Col N="823" /> refers to the setting up of this commission, which is to be an impartial, statutory body.  I should like to know how the Minister proposes to select this commission.  We are to have a commission and an Authority.  I should imagine that the commission will be regarded as a watchdog.</P>
    <P>If it is the policy of this Government to support industrial democracy &mdash;and I do not doubt that it is&mdash; steps should be taken to ensure proper representation for RTE staff on this commission.  If criticism of RTE is going to be made it is important that the people who operate the service should have representation.  I should also like to know how one will have access to this commission.  I think we are cursed with commissions in this country.  We have commissions for this, that and the other.  I hope that this new body will not merely be just another commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred in his speech to the rebroadcasting of BBC and ITV programmes here on a second channel.  But why BBC and ITV?  There is an opinion among people who have worked in television, and not necessarily members of a particular union, that there is a need for a second channel.  But they believe we should have control over this second channel.  There is also a feeling of disquiet about what will happen to RTE's advertising revenue should there be rebroadcast on the second channel programmes of ITV which also carries advertising.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to increased licence fees for the second channel.  We have had an increase in the licence fee for black and white and colour recently but in the case of colour television those owning such sets received nothing except advertisements and an odd race meeting in colour.  Everybody is looking for value for money nowadays but what will be given to those who are required to pay extra money for a licence for a colour television?  The people in Dublin are fortunate in that they can select from a number of channels.  In this regard it is worth noting that when the licence fee was introduced the people <Col N="824" /> in this area were charged a fee despite the fact that RTE was not in operation. The whole question of licence fees should be straightened out.  The Minister, dealing with RTE's financial position, reached a conclusion but I should like to know from where he received his information.  I should like the Minister to substantiate the contention he made in regard to the financial position of the Authority.</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired of hearing of complaints about the firms operating cable television systems.  Such firms insist on people paying a rent for a service they do not receive.  This matter is not covered in the Bill.  I have written to the Department of Industry and Commerce and to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, but apparently neither of them can do anything about this.  The Minister should take advantage of this situation to ensure that cable television firms who are given a licence to operate cable television will be obligated to give people value for their money and not be free to simply collect their fee and turn their backs to those who complain.  This has been the experience of those living in the Dublin area but, needless to remark, it has not been the experience of people living elsewhere because they receive only RTE.</P>
    <P>The Minister posed a number of questions and offered his opinion as to the replies.  I recognise that this raises the basic question of freedom of expression.  The Minister devoted a number of pages to the IRA but he made no reference to the UDA, UVF or The Ulster Workers Council, the Paisleys, the Craigs, the Taylors or the Wests.  RTE, unfortunately, has given real prominence to people like Paisley and I do not believe that Paisley would be the demigod he is now were it not for the free run he had on RTE.  The same applies to Taylor, Craig and West.  It makes me feel that we are not endeavouring to show the people the true situation.  I am not advocating that the IRA, Provos or Officials, should have a free run on RTE but I become a little mixed up when I witness a situation like this.  The Minister should <Col N="825" /> give a little more thought to this matter.  We should ensure that television and radio programmes do not relate solely to one aspect of the unfortunate situation that exists in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister, having regard to his other responsibility in respect of information, mentioned what broadcasters should do.  This highlights the importance of having a Press Council. If we had a Press Council RTE would be part of that set up and we would have a better set up.  The Minister made reference to other categories, &ldquo;such as journalists&rdquo;, but it is hardly necessary to remind him that journalists are good trade unionists and should not be separated from other trade unionists.  We should not regard all journalists as non-unionists.</P>
    <P>I would be obliged if the Minister would explain what he has in mind when he talks about &ldquo;major change&rdquo;. This brings me to the question of industrial democracy.  It is terribly important to have an understanding with the possible participants in advance, if at all possible.  There is a great need for the Minister, who has had some consultation, to have more consultation with the representatives of the various workers in RTE.  I accept that the Minister has his advisers but, generally speaking, advisers are at the top and are not in touch with the grassroots.  I am not saying this in a threatening fashion; but if we introduce changes in one's employment we run into trouble if we do not have an understanding of such changes in advance. All the unions are concerned about what will be done in connection with the second channel.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises the desirability of giving people a selection and of overcoming the predicament of one station.  When speaking to some of my colleagues recently I pointed out that if they had occasion to stay down the country overnight they would only see RTE.  Although they may not be interested in viewing another channel when outside the eastern area it would be nice to be in a position to watch a programme other than RTE.  We should understand that there is a strong opinion abroad that while there must <Col N="826" /> be a second channel it does not necessarily have to be a British one. Establishing a second channel should not mean that we are giving a free run to the British here as far as television is concerned.  Television has become a very popular and important influence on the people.</P>
    <P>I can think of lots of programmes that could be shown on that second channel.  We could select from the best available.  Now that some of us have become Europeans we could show the best programmes from France, Belgium, or Italy.  There is no necessity to concentrate purely on what is at times British propaganda. That second channel could be used to educate our people in matters of importance, to help them face up to the realities of life, inform them of the economic situation and assist them in understanding the necessity for a good trade union movement. People could also be helped to understand the value of food.  If we simply turn this second channel over to BBC 1 or BBC 2, we have no control over it.  There would be no use in complaining to this new commission about what we have seen on BBC or UTV.</P>
    <P>I was shocked to hear Senator FitzGerald's reference to internment.  I gathered from him that he felt there might be a need to have internment here.  I am not concerned whether we had internment in the past or not but my understanding of the situation today is that the Opposition party are against internment and the Government are opposed to it.  This has all come about as a result of what we witnessed in regard to internment in the Six Counties.  I hope and pray that the Minister does not take a cue from what Senator FitzGerald said in this regard.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with Senator Dolan's reference to violence on canned programmes.  That does not make me out to be a crank.  It was brought to my attention recently that the infamous &ldquo;Kojak&rdquo; was not allowed on British television until recently.  In fact, we were the first to screen this series.  A lot of violence occurs on that series.  &ldquo;Hawaii-Five-O&rdquo; is another example.  A police officer, according to a newspaper report, <Col N="827" /> stated that some of the crimes committed here were exact copies of crimes portrayed in these programmes. We should protect ourselves from a continuation of this.  I am aware that this smells of horrid censoring but there is a lot of room for improvement in this regard.  We have always been prone to copying others. If one stood at O'Connell Bridge and looked down the Liffey it would not be long before at least a dozen people would be gazing in the same direction. Likewise if one, while gazing at the sky, remarked that he had seen a cow in the sky, he would find a lot of people to say that they also had seen the cow.</P>
    <P>The trade unions representing the workers in RTE are very concerned about the proposed second channel. I am concerned about section 16, which will require serious consideration. I take it from the Minister that he is open to suggestions about this but the implications of this section are worrying.  Trade unionists could read into this that the Army could be used in the event of a strike, the Army could be used in connection with protests that, for instance, would be organised against white racialists. It is my intention to consider this section in depth and to put forward my own amendments.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot be accused of any lack of concern for the Irish language. To my shame I have not a good knowledge of the Irish language, but there is a feeling that section 13 will do harm to the language and to Irish culture.  Since we joined the EEC a lot more people are taking an interest in Irish culture.  I was informed by a colleague that it was a great joy to him to talk to fellow Irishmen and women in Brussels in Irish.  I understand that is catching on. It is nice to know that students from abroad are anxious to learn more about our culture and our music.  We should make use of the television to encourage a greater interest in our language and our culture.</P>
    <P>I got the impression recently that there is a great effort being made to encourage our people to go abroad for holidays.  RTE recently introduced a <Col N="828" /> programme on foreign holidays.  In the course of that programme travel agents are given an opportunity of singing the praises of countries like fascist Spain, and other continental countries, but they never urge people to visit parts of their own country. These people are being given a free run on television while other advertisers must pay for the time.  I heard a youth, aged 17, stating how cheap it was to get drunk on brandy in Spain.  A representative of the national airline told viewers that hotel prices in New York and Canada were very cheap.  What nonsense.</P>
    <P>Some of our interviewers will have to realise that they are interviewers and not interrogators.  It serves nobody any purpose if the interviewer persists in his efforts to get the person being interviewed to say what he wants him to say.  There should be no such a thing as insisting on the person being interviewed saying a particular thing.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the time he has taken with his speech.  It reminds me, as he mentioned, of the late President Childers, who in the various Departments he was in charge of always took time to explain what he was setting out to have adopted in the Dáil.  I compliment the Minister on the time he has taken in submitting this speech in connection with this important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by underlining what I believe to be a very important aspect of this Bill: the fundamental philosophy relating to the control of broadcasting which, I believe, to a large extent lies behind it. This philosophy, as I see it, is one based on a belief that broadcasting in a country like ours is most effectively seen as a public service.  It should be carried out in an area which is publicly accountable.  Behind this philosophy there is also a belief in the value of institutions which act for the public as trustees of the common good in a general supervisory role.  In the situation in which we exist the RTE Authority, as constituted by the original Act, is the body charged with the responsibility of carrying out this trusteeship role for the public.  This is very important.  It is important that <Col N="829" /> this trusteeship role should not be exercised only by the elected political representatives for reasons that the Minister himself has alluded to, in passing, in his speech.</P>
      <P>It is equally true and important that this trusteeship arrangement should not be carried out by the people who make, produce and develop the programmes, whether on radio or television, in public service broadcasting.  If I can conceive of anything more unpleasant than an RTE Authority composed entirely of politicians it would be an RTE Authority composed entirely of broadcasters.  I believe that, as originally instituted under the first Broadcasting Act, this concept of trusteeship of public broadcasting carried out essentially by a body of laymen, of people who even though they may have risen to importance or prominence in some spheres of public life do not have any special knowledge of broadcasting and do not have any special political allegiance, is a valuable and fundamental philosophical point.  I find it in the original Act.  It was also expressed in some detail in the report of the Review Body on Broadcasting, a report which has often been unjustly &mdash;and often justly&mdash;maligned.  For all its defects that report did underwrite that principle as it was written into the original Act and suggested that it should continue to be a fundamental principle of public service broadcasting here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that this Bill underwrites again, in a very substantial way, this basic philosophical point. There is another area on which this Bill is a considerable improvement on its predecessor.  It marks a substantial advance both in the spirit and in the letter of the original Broadcasting Act.  A major fault in the original Broadcasting Act was that while it laid down that the RTE Authority and the broadcasting service generally were to be set up in a certain form, it left the way open for the interpretation that this broadcasting service, although set up by the Oireachtas, was responsible not to the Oireachtas but to Government.  This was an erosion of what should be meant by a public <Col N="830" /> service broadcasting idea of responsibility and is an ambiguity which was acted on in the intervening years.  The sections in this Bill which write back into law the idea that a body set up by the Oireachtas is fundamentally responsible to the Oireachtas, and not just to part of the Oireachtas the executive is to be welcomed heartily. The way in which this is being done is to guarantee the independence of the authority by making its members, broadly speaking, irremovable except with the consent of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There is however one aspect of the Bill which does not go quite far enough and, to a certain extent, compounds one's difficulties in dealing with it.  I would prefer to see in the Bill a general proviso or set of provisions saying that members of the Authority shall not be removed from office save by resolution of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas.  At present there are two ways of removing the members of the Authority. The Minister may remove them by order or they may be removed as a result of a motion or resolution put down to that effect in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Without casting any reflections on the present Minister it seems that Minister X, given the choice of two ways of removing a recalcitrant Authority one of which is considerably easier than the other, would be more inclined to choose the easier way rather than the difficult one.  This seems to be an additional problem. Under this legislation any dismissal of the Authority can be carried by the Minister or by the two Houses of the Oireachtas together.  That is not good enough and I would like to hear the Minister on it later.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke of his concept of open broadcasting but he did not speak at any great length on it. He may think that the subject has been well enough ventilated in the media and elsewhere but it is something we cannot pass over proportionately in the same way the Minister did.  The whole concept of open broadcasting is fundamentally related to the first matter I talked about, the philosophy of public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> It would be accurate to say that we are in something of an interim situation.  Who is to say what the situation will be in ten years' time. The eastern conurbations at present have a wide choice of television programming and radio programming to a certain extent.  In ten years, with the growth of satellites and the further refinement of the technology of communications, the question may not be of deciding whether Galway, Limerick or Waterford should get this service but of defending our own share of the airwaves so that our domestic station can at least be heard nationally.  In the future, and perhaps the not-too-distant future, the question may not be one of deciding whether but one of deciding which.</P>
    <P>Now, in this interim situation, we have a responsibility as Members of the Oireachtas and as people involved in the development and, to some extent, the preservation of our own community.  I wonder whether the way the Government are presently considering to fulfil this responsibility is the right one.  We have limited resources; we have got to decide in this interim situation how best we can spend them and how best we can give concrete expression to the concept of public service broadcasting I have been talking about.</P>
    <P>The first thing I should like to say on this is that I do not believe anybody has really spelt out the options clearly.  It seems to me, from a cursory reading of the newspapers and listening to the media generally, that there is a widespread misunderstanding about these options, especially in the single channel areas.  If you ask somebody from Cork or Waterford or Limerick whether they would like BBC 1 or a second RTE channel they say: &ldquo;We are not going to be caught like that.  We are having exactly what you are having and nothing less&rdquo;.  It seems to me that it is our responsibility and the responsibility of the Minister to explain, if it is the case, as I believe it to be, that the options available to the present single channel areas do not include the kind of options that are currently available to us <Col N="832" /> in Dublin.  The obvious corollary of that is that, if people living in these areas wish to have available to them the choice at present available to the people living on the eastern seaboard, they ultimately have no choice except to move there themselves; and if they did they might find that the advantages of being in receipt of five television channels might be more than balanced by the disadvantages of moving to the eastern conurbation.</P>
    <P>This matter has to be stated fairly clearly.  The options for this country, and indeed for many other countries too, seem to be basically in terms of two channels which originated in some sense on the soil of this country and are broadcast nationally within this country, for at least the immediate future.  If that is the case the fundamental decision we have to make is not between BBC 1 and UTV but how these two channels can best be organised to fulfil the concept of public service broadcasting about which I have spoken.  Let us assume, for the time being, that the cost element of it is irrelevant.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that it does not really matter, from the point of view of resources, whether we take one of the options that has been suggested, which is the re-broadcasting of one particular channel from outside, or whether we set up a second station basically under our own control.  I should like to examine these options in the reverse order.  In other words, I should like to start by assuming that the most appropriate way of meeting this responsibility would be to set up a second national channel and to sketch out some of the consequences I feel would flow from that, consequences the consideration of which I would urge very strongly on the Minister.</P>
    <P>The first thing to remember is that a second national channel would not be and could not be a duplication of the first national channel.  The first national channel has problems enough as it is, mixing high interest programmes, popular programmes, on the one hand, with low interest programmes and minority group programmes on the other.  The creation of <Col N="833" /> a second national channel would, no matter how small the input into it from the local programming service, be an immensely powerful and good weapon in the hands of broadcasters who want to satisfy and please as many of the people as they can for as much of the time as they can.  It would increase the options open to them of creating a total broadcasting service in which the two channels would be complementary to each other.  It would offer them a great deal of help in putting forward, displaying, talking about and generally spreading the notion of cultural diversity, which in political terms and in our own time, we owe very substantially to the present Minister.  It would also improve very substantially our broadcasting relationships and our cultural relationships, if I may say so, with the North of Ireland.  The Minister has already indicated his desire to improve relationships with the North of Ireland and to use open broadcasting as he sees it as a major way of carrying this out.  I would suggest that a second national channel would be a far more flexible and responsive instrument of promoting this kind of co-operation with the North than the simple re-broadcasting of another channel.</P>
    <P>When we look at broadcasting in this island as a whole I think it is fair to argue that it has developed on either side of the Border very often in ways which were opposed to each other.  The first broadcasting station on this island was set up in a converted linen warehouse in Belfast and was then and for some considerable time afterwards almost completely under the control of the BBC of the day.  Certainly it was a very tame, very quiet sort of station.  When I say that broadcasting in this country tended to develop differently and sometimes in opposing ways on either side of the Border I have only to give you the example that for quite a long time the radio broadcasts emanating from the North used to refuse to broadcast the results of GAA matches, while those emanating from the South used to retaliate by refusing to broadcast the results of Association Football matches.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> Earlier I criticised the Bill for a provision which I thought it contained, to the effect that there were two ways of removing members of the authority &mdash;either by ministerial order or by resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  A rapid look at section 2 of the Bill has made it clear to me that this is not the case.  In fact, the section relating to removal of members of the authority is probably the most unambiguous part of the Bill or indeed of any Bill that I have seen for a long time.  I should like to correct myself on that point before coming back to the open broadcasting matter to which I was addressing myself.</P>
    <P>I was pointing out to the Minister how one of the problems in relation to the introduction of his open broadcasting concept, as he envisaged this Bill providing him with a mechanism to do, is that for a long time, at any rate, broadcasting in the two parts of Ireland grew up in contradistinction to each other.  I mentioned that in 1935, when there were very serious riots in Belfast, there was considerable outcry among politicians in the North because Radio Éireann at that stage could be heard over a large part of Northern Ireland and was giving very much fuller accounts of those riots than was available to people who were in the radio equivalent of a single channel area at that time.  The result of this was ferocious pressure by politicians in Northern Ireland for a complete takeover of the broadcasting service up there by Stormont so that in their eyes, the broadcasting service could be put to its proper use of hurling further insults back across the Border to match those coming up.</P>
    <P>I do not see an extension of broadcasting along the lines the Minister has suggested making any really fundamental difference to the cultural questions which he would like to see open broadcasting helping to solve.  I am saying this in the context of a strong argument in favour of a second national channel.</P>
    <P>Another argument which exists in favour of a second national channel is that there would be, if anything, <Col N="835" /> very much more choice available to people in the country as a whole than there would be with the simple rebroadcasting of a single external channel.  RTE already rebroadcasts quite an amount of material culled from other sources.  It has to because it has not got the physical programming resources to do anything else. Even if it had, we would welcome the diversity and the leaven that this kind of thing provides.  There is very much more broadcasting available to us than we can ever possibly use.  Importing one complete channel as an answer to the problem of choice is, I suggest, no answer at all.  To give you one very simple statistic, the amount of broadcasting on the commercial television networks in Britain which is available to east coast viewers in this country, because it is being networked by the Independent Television Network in Britain, amounts to 4,000 hours a year.  There is at least another 4,000 hours of programming which is produced in the regions by the independent television companies which should be available to us if we want it for rebroadcasting on a second channel.  Obviously many of these programmes would be local interest ones and not at all suited to the Irish situation, but many of them are very good. If we set up a second national channel we will have effectively a much more flexible editorial role with regard to the selection of programmes from outside sources such as these. If we take the other alternative we will effectively be abandoning that editorial control almost completely.  When I say &ldquo;control&rdquo; I do not mean to be restrictive.  If control is exercised properly in broadcasting it is a control for something and not a control of something.  It is a control exercised in order to provide people with choice and not to deny them the kind of choice that they want.</P>
    <P>Let us look for a moment at the second scenario which is the one the Government apparently seem to favour &mdash;the idea of a single programme being rebroadcast throughout the country.  There are many serious objections to this and not the least of <Col N="836" /> them is exemplified by an anomaly which has had to be taken care of in the Bill.  The Bill has had to provide that, in the case of a programme service which is rebroadcast under the power given to the Minister by the Bill, this programme service will not be under any obligation to respect any of the directives which may or may not be given by the Minister or the Government under other sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In other words, we have got to accept the fact that if we are going to rebroadcast another service in its entirety, effectively there is no control that can be exercised over it. While I have my own views about the nature and type of control which should be exercised over broadcasting, I think it only points to the anomaly of the situation to have one channel which might be broadcasting interviews, or material of one kind or another, which could not legally be broadcast on the national channel.  The rebroadcasting of a channel from Northern Ireland, either BBC 1 or UTV, would also inevitably force the present RTE system into a minority position.  It is an attractive scenario for some reasons to some people, but ultimately one which will not serve Irish people well.</P>
    <P>The problems are enormous and, quite frankly, in spite of the Minister's skill, I doubt his ability to resolve them within the lifetime of the present Government.  One of the problems, for example, is the question of rights.  I am a members of a trade union, as Senator Mullen knows, and there are very many members of very many trade unions who will not be at all happy at the thoughts of substantial and more or less permanent rebroadcasting of their work to another area without getting very well paid for it. The position is quite simply that the BBC or UTV cannot sell to us what it does not own itself.  It does not own the right to rebroadcast material from artists, performers, and so on, beyond the area which it was established to serve.  The copyright laws may be shaky and out of date, but there are substantial difficulties in the way of achieving the kind of blanket rights <Col N="837" /> agreement that would be called for by the negotiations of an arrangement of this kind.</P>
    <P>One of the obvious other results of this would be a substantial running down, I suspect, in the personnel working in RTE at the moment.  Senator Mullen referred to this and I make no apology for referring to it again, not just because one naturally objects to the prospects of people losing jobs, but because we have here in RTE an industry of very skilled and very competent people&mdash;an industry which did not exist before 1961, an industry which probably employs the better part of 1,000 people.  If we are concerned not just for their jobs and for the money they are bringing into their own homes, but also for the skills they represent and for the potential they represent to other industries like the Irish film industry, we should be very slow to do anything which would tend to undercut their existence or their well-being.</P>
    <P>If the situation is such that the second channel is given over exclusively to a broadcasting service which is totally and wholly devised outside the State, the pressures on RTE will be immense.  It will be forced, effectively, to adopt one of two options, neither of which is in the least bit attractive. In the first place, it could be forced to compete for the mass audience with the incoming channel and gradually erode whatever minority interest programmes, and similar type programmes, that it may have developed over the years in response to its concept of public service broadcasting.  This would mean that the two channels would become more and more similar. It might safeguard employment in RTE to a certain extent, but it would not safeguard the standards which we have come to expect of RTE in broadcasting and to which RTE, with only the occasional exception, has not been too remiss in matching up.</P>
    <P>The other alternative is that RTE would give up the fight.  It would become, effectively, a provincial local broadcasting station within the general archipelago formed by the British Isles. This is something I do not particularly like, and I do not think anybody <Col N="838" /> else should like.  It would be all very nice to have RTE as a sort of cultural preserve, where we would have our Irish programmes, our minority interest programmes, reports of the GAA matches which you could not persuade the BBC to re-broadcast, and things like that; but ultimately it would be a total emasculation of a national broadcasting service to reduce it to this kind of role, with maybe 20 per cent or 25 per cent of the audience, and not even that at times.  I see the introduction of a second channel imported wholesale from outside as leading inevitably to either one of those situations, and I cannot see that either of them is something that the Minister should welcome, or that we should welcome.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning of this comparison that I was assuming, for the moment, that the costs were irrelevant, that it did not really matter in cost terms which service we imported or set up.  Of course, it does matter. Which will cost more: the Minister's concept or the other concept I have described?  I have seen no serious attempt anywhere to cost the alternative and, when we are talking about resources&mdash;as Senator FitzGerald said, we must be very conscious all the time that we are talking about resources&mdash; we must keep these costs permanently in mind.  I can identify at least the elements of costs.  My sums may be right or wrong, I do not know.  I would be very glad if the Minister would comment on this.</P>
    <P>Let us cost, for a moment, the option of importing a single wholesale channel from outside&mdash;BBC 1 or UTV. The items of the cost of this service can be broken down roughly into several areas.  First of all, there is the capital cost.  This, to a certain extent, would be the same as if a second national channel were set up. If a second national channel were set up there would, of course, be more additional capital cost to help to pay for programming facilities.  The second element of cost is the rights cost.  It is arguable that, in terms of paying for rights and rebroadcasts, the huge complications involved in buying something wholesale from the BBC would not make it an inexpensive <Col N="839" /> matter.  I doubt very much that you could get away with anything under a couple of million pounds for the sort of rights we are talking about.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, we set up a second national channel, there would also be a rights question but it would be a rights question which the present broadcasting service is already coping with.  It can arrange at a moment's notice to broadcast simultaneously, or nearly simultaneously, virtually any material which is available to us, and this is a practice which could be followed up without very much difficulty at all if a second national channel were established.  We would probably pay less for rights if we had a second national channel if only because we would be using a certain amount of home produced material and this, while costing money on its own account, would reduce the amount of money we would have to pay on rights.</P>
    <P>The next element of costs we should pay attention to is advertising revenue.  If we import a second channel wholesale, and if this succeeds in attracting a vast number of the audience away from the single national station, it is obvious that advertisement revenue on that national station will fall.  I do not know what the figures are, but I suspect that RTE budgeting at the moment is rather like that of Aer Lingus.  They have to balance two, relatively speaking, very large sums of money.  The tiniest of factors can contribute to making a marginal loss or a marginal profit.  In that kind of situation, the less that is done to disturb that particular balance, the better.  I can see a substantial fall in advertising revenue as a result of the introduction of a second channel purchased completely from another source.  I can see this as causing serious problems for the philosophy under which the station is run.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to what the Minister said in the Dáil and what he quoted for us again today. He talked about defending the standard of service by RTE as against outside competition.  He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> I believe also in permitting more outside competition.  I agree that it increases the financial burden on RTE.  I think the State should meet that burden in order to support not merely present standards but an improvement of the standards.</P>
    <P>At first sight this is a very admirable statement by the Minister.  The idea that RTE should be supported is admirable.  But if he is here suggesting that we need to support RTE by way of direct Government subsidy in order to enable it to compete more effectively with outside channels, I must ask him to consider whether he is not importing something very serious into the concept of effectively non-subsidised broadcasting which we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>For the past few years, taking one year with another, RTE has managed to exist, broadly speaking, without the Government having to pick up the tab every five minutes.  This has been important for its independence.  It has been important for the philosophy of broadcasting on which it is based. If we put RTE into a subsidy situation, if we put RTE into a situation in which it has got to go to the Government with its cap in its hand every six months or every year, we are importing a fundamental change into the relationship between Government and broadcasting as it has existed up to now.  It may be that this change is thought to be desirable or not to be harmful, but we should not talk about it as if it did not mean anything at all, and as if we did not need to examine it very closely.  All these things are extremely important, and I would urge the Minister's attention to them.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which the subsidy concept could be avoided without very much difficulty, not least because the total cost of either service which could easily be in the £5 million bracket, will have very substantial implications for the licence fees from people who have television sets.  Here again, I draw a useful comparison about these implications for the benefit of the House.  If it is the case that licence fees will have to be increased substantially to pay <Col N="841" /> either for the introduction of a second national television service or for the rebroadcasting of BBC 1 or BBC 2, and if the increase is of the order of £7, £8, £9, £10 per licence, what will be the public reaction to that? I am not saying that one should&mdash;no more than the Minister does&mdash;justify one's actions solely on the grounds of whether or not the public reaction will be favourable, but this is something which has to be considered.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is asking for another £10 on the licence fee to pay for this new channel, it will be greeted very differently in different parts of the country.  In the present single channel areas, it may be greeted as being a worthwhile cost.  In the present multichannel areas, people will be asked to pay an extra very large sum of money for something which they are receiving free already.  I am bringing it to the notice of the Minister that this presents him with some very serious political problems.  If we have that type of situation, I can see the already scandalous rate of licence fee evasion increasing even further.  I would ask the Minister&mdash;I do not think he needs the support of this legislation to do it but, if it needs to be written in, we could do that with a heart and a half&mdash;to consider ways of improving the present licence collection system.</P>
    <P>At the moment the administrative cost of collecting television licences is inordinately high.  I am quite sure the Minister has the exact figures because his Department do the collecting.  I would ask him to consider whether or not some more efficient method of collecting the licences could be devised, and whether they could not be a great deal more efficiently collected by RTE.  At the moment, anything up to £1 million in the current year is outstanding on unpaid licence fees. This is a scandalous situation and it is doubly scandalous if it is threatening the independence of the public broadcasting service and the independence of the trusteeship arrangement under which it operates.  Some time ago a previous Government lost a very valuable opportunity to contribute substantially to the revenues of the national broadcasting service by giving it <Col N="842" /> a monopoly of the cable television system. That opportunity has now been lost, but there is still an opportunity to rectify the present financial situation with regard to licence fees and I would urge the Minister very strongly to take this opportunity.</P>
    <P>I seem to have strayed a bit from open broadcasting but, before I move on, I should like to outline what I believe to be a different concept of open broadcasting from that evidenced by the Minister.  To my way of thinking, open broadcasting does not mean that areas should be divided up between services or shared between services in the way Africa was divided up at the end of the last century, the way suzerainty was established over one State or another, the way joint dominions have been established in some areas.  This is not open broadcasting as I see it.  I see open broadcasting as a constant move and pressure to open the air waves and the facilities of broadcasting services everywhere to people who are ready, willing and able to use them constructively and creatively for the people they are serving.</P>
    <P>In this country at the moment there is a community of people who have the sort of experience which is necessary. They are probably willing and able to carry out what needs to be done.  If we are talking in particular of open broadcasting between this part of Ireland and the North of Ireland, I believe that can be done much more effectively by establishing a relationship based on joint productions, co-productions and common ventures, than with the sort of arrangement envisaged in simply rebroadcasting a second channel.  The aim of open broadcasting should be to extend communities of broadcasters and to extend the relationships between broadcasting communities in different countries. Simply to re-broadcast a channel from country A in country B institutionalises the apartheid and sense of competition between the broadcasters of the two communities concerned.</P>
    <P>In one of his own statements on open broadcasting in Galway on 28th February the Minister said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> This Government has lifted the restriction on cable television imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government. Unlike some members of Fianna Fáil, including the Deputy Leader, Deputy Joe Brennan, it has no ideological objections to letting the people of the west see British television.</P>
    <P>I should like to pull us back beyond that point.  We are not talking here about ideological objections.  I have no particular knowledge of why Fianna Fáil may have done this, that, or the other thing.  The people of the west, and of all parts of Ireland, already see British television in a substantial measure, and they see American television as well.  They see all sorts of television.  Simply offering them more does not match up to the basic editorial responsibility which fundamentally, in my belief, lies with the RTE Authority.  We have to underwrite the Authority's responsibility and power to act in an editorial capacity. I believe it has the willingness and the capacity to do this.</P>
    <P>There are people in the present single channel areas who talk rather slightingly of Dublin and, indeed, on this one can readily sympathise with them.  They say: &ldquo;We do not want a censor sitting on the switch in Dublin.&rdquo;  I should like to point out to them&mdash;and I think someone else should point out to them as well&mdash; that if we get a type of open broadcasting based simply on rebroadcasts of UTV or BBC1, their censor will be sitting not in Dublin but in Belfast or even London.  If we are to have censors I should prefer them to be local ones.</P>
    <P>There is a grace note to this whole discussion which is of course that, if we buy one of these programmes wholesale from the North, we will also be landed with a great deal of material in which proportionately to the amount of air time available to us nationally, we will have no interest at all.  Because of the spread of the air waves in Britain, very often they are able to include on programmes like BBC1 and BBC2 minority programmes which would have no interest <Col N="844" /> for us in Ireland at all.  I do not want to conjure up a scenario of everyone in Connemara sitting around their sets and trying in a puzzled fashion to work out what Urdu means, or what exactly the Pakistani emigrants in Bradford are trying to say to them, but there is that aspect of it as well. If we buy, we buy everything; and it will be very difficult to justify that, especially when we are forced to take programmes which have no particular relevance to our circumstances at all.</P>
    <P>The question of open broadcasting brings to my mind the whole question of culture, something which has already been referred to in speeches, and something which is referred to very substantially in the Bill.  First, I should like to pay a tribute to the Minister for the work he has done in helping to awaken many people, especially in this part of the country but also indeed in the other part of the country, to the fact that we do not live in a mono-cultural situation.  The Minister has attacked this idea, and the assumptions behind it, with a ferocity which has sometimes been rather startling to watch.  He has sometimes got so far ahead of his own troops that, when you catch up with him, you think you find him in the enemy camp.  It is only that he has got there before you, but you have that impression at times.</P>
    <P>In debates in this House I also have challenged this mono-culturalist set of assumptions, which are all too common down here.  I can remember, during a debate on the Higher Education Authority Bill, having a considerable argument with the Senator Ruairí Brugha on the other side as to what precisely constituted Irish culture.  Needless to say, my point was not accepted, but it is one which has a lot in common with some of the points the Minister has been making during the past few years.</P>
    <P>In the Bill the main section on culture is section 13, which has three subsections.  The first is a general rephrasing of cultural aims and objectives and this, to my mind, has been carried out in a way which is totally unexceptionable. It is a considerable improvement on the standard phrasing <Col N="845" /> about culture and community which has found its way into many pieces of legislation in the past.  Broadly speaking, I find it a good one.  I have some difficulties with the other two subsections of the section.  For example, in paragraph (b) the Authority is enjoined in its programming to:</P>
    <P>...uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution...</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody would disagree with that in one sense.  Yet, it does perhaps point up a slight anomaly.  What is to happen if somebody decides that the Constitution needs to be revised?  Will one be allowed to advocate constitutional revision?  If one has different views about the values enshrined in the Constitution and about the degree to which they could be described as democratic or not, will one be estopped by this section from appearing or talking on programmes put out under the aegis of the Authority?  It is a legalistic point and I do not want to spend the evening being a barrackroom lawyer.  But I must warn the Minister against the insertion into legislation of well-meaning phrases which either mean very little or mean something really inordinately restrictive, especially phrases which contain words which themselves refer to value judgments like &ldquo;democratic values&rdquo;. There is no more value-laden word than the word &ldquo;value&rdquo; itself.  While I sympathise with the motivations behind the assumptions in this subsection, they could create a constitutional anomaly in the future.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (c), the Authority is asked in its programming:</P>
    <P>...To have regard to the desirability of promoting understanding of the values and traditions of countries other than the State, including in particular the values and traditions of such countries which are members of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>Fine, but we might not be in the European Economic Community in five years time, and silly enough that section would look then.  I speak as somebody who voted in favour of our going into the European Economic <Col N="846" /> Community: I think, on balance, it has been a good thing that we have been in, but it is very unwise to write into Bills like this a statement like this which is dependent on political contingencies no one can really predict. In broad terms, while I am favourable to the first subsection in this section, I find that the other two are gilding the lily a bit.  They are not really necessary.  They could create problems and ultimately, perhaps they could look ridiculous.  I do not think it should be the function of legislation to include sections which would look ridiculous.</P>
    <P>On the broader issue of culture, I must confess that I sometimes suspect the Minister of being a culturalist, of believing that culture, as he knows, loves and understands it, is so good that it should be taken by everybody. Part of the problem is that not everybody agrees with this.  If I have misinterpreted the Minister, no doubt he will correct me in due course.  It seems to me that we must accept that, in laying responsibilities on a broadcasting authority with regard to culture, we are talking about the entirety of culture and not just about high culture.  Highly educated people tend to think that high culture is all that matters.  Whether it is the Dublin Grand Opera Society, or history, or music of some other kind, they generally feel there is a hierarchy of values in culture with Beethoven at the top and the Beatles at the bottom.</P>
    <P>This is a very mistaken assumption because it is basically an elitist assumption.  It is an assumption that there is a certain small corps of people in this country, and in every country, who know what is good for themselves and what is good for everybody else and who feel, fundamentally, that they are the sort of people who should be in charge of all the media of communication. It is particularly important that this should not happen in any medium which has a monopoly as indeed, effectively, our broadcasting service has at the moment.  I do not think our broadcasting service operates on these kind of assumptions, although I think all broadcasters and <Col N="847" /> all media people are tempted towards them from time to time.</P>
    <P>While I am making a general statement on culture, I would make a plea for the recognition of the fact that culture is not a single and indivisible entity, any more than the people of a country constitute a single and indivisible entity.  There are all sorts of different cultures.  There are pop cultures, youth cultures, high cultures and low cultures and, once we start talking about them and attempting to define them, we will discover that there are more of them than we will ever recognise, more of them than we will ever have the opportunity to fully identify, and that people can belong simultaneously to more than one culture. So, while in political terms I am grateful to the Minister for his resolute defence of cultural pluralism, we should be careful not to take people out of one box, the political one, in order to put them into another box, the cultural one.</P>
    <P>I turn now to section 4 and the general philosophy of that section.  I have no objection to the institution of some kind of mechanism to deal with the whole question of complaints regarding broadcasters.  There are many mechanisms for complaining against politicians but there are very few mechanisms for complaining against people in the media.  There should be some such mechanism, however little used it may be, if only to show the people that they have some right of reply, some right of access to the often faceless people in the media and that they have some possibility of retribution if they consider that they have been wronged seriously.</P>
    <P>In relation to any complaints mechanism to be set up by statute the first point I would make is that, fundamentally, it should refer only to unsatisfied complaints.  This is not written into the Bill but it was mentioned by the Minister in his speech. Perhaps it should be written into the Bill in order to remove any ambiguity; otherwise, there might be a situation in which any complaints commission, however it might be set up, would be <Col N="848" /> snowed under with an immense amount of trivia which would take years to deal with.</P>
    <P>As a working journalist and an editor I find that 99 per cent of all complaints are satisfied by the people to whom they are directed first in any communications organisation.  The point at which a complaint becomes a libel action, a personal threat or an attempt to have one fired by going to the man upstairs has not arisen in my experience often enough for it to be a real problem.  However, it may arise and may be very serious, but it is an expression of the effectiveness of relations between people in the media and those outside that so many other complaints can be satisfied in this way. The number of complaints which RTE are processing by means of the small sub-committee set up by the Minister is very few.  The BBC have a system which is not similar to the one suggested in this Bill.  There, the members of the complaints commission are appointed by the BBC rather than by the Government.  To my knowledge that commission have handled fewer than half a dozen complaints during the past year.  When we contrast this with the sort of creature we find in this Bill we find ourselves scratching our brows and wondering what precisely has happened.  To deal with a number of complaints which may not run into double figures in any one year we find an immense organisation with people at the top who may be entitled to be paid salaries, who have an immense amount of statutory procedures laid down for them to follow.  This raises the possibility of acquiring large numbers of staff to cope with the inquiries. But if the number of inquiries in any one year is few, in what way are these people to be engaged?  Often enough there are complaints in the media regarding the number of hours that Senators spend earning their salaries. But I suspect that the situation envisaged by this Bill would put even the Seanad into the shade.  This commission will have to invent work, as Deputy FitzGerald said, and we all know how adept organisations are at doing that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> I sympathise with some of the thinking behind the detailed provision. For example, it is obvious that the decision to have the members of the commission appointed by the Government has been taken because the Government do not like RTE to be seen as judge and jury of their own case.  So far as I know, however, there has been no complaint about the BBC Complaints Commission by reason of their being appointed by the BBC.  A very good reason for this is that the people on the commission are highly respected, have proved their independence in other walks of life and could not be accused of being susceptible to pressure.</P>
    <P>I can see the proposal to staff this commission from the public service as being an attempt on the part of the Minister and his draftsmen to avoid a situation in which the commission would be prevented from doing their work by being starved of personnel or funds by RTE.  But it is an extraordinarily complicated way of dealing with something which, fundamentally, is a very simple problem.  What we see in this section of the Bill is an example of elephantiasis&mdash;something like dropsy, which starts in a very small way but grows to the point where its resemblance to the original is only coincidental.</P>
    <P>Later in the Bill there is provision for the establishment of local broadcasting but there is no provision for anybody to have any redress regarding an unsatisfied complaint with a local broadcasting service.  This is an anomaly which should be cleared up. However, I am not so concerned to clear up this anomaly as I am to slim down this gross creature that has been imported into the Bill and which is totally out of proportion to the other provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish now to make a number of points regarding the content of broadcasting as it is treated in the Bill.  The content of broadcasting is something which excites the most controversy.  It has been a critical question since broadcasting was invented.  There is a story about Mark Twain that on the day on which he was informed that the miracles of electronic science now <Col N="850" /> enabled New York to talk to Seattle, he inquired delicately: &ldquo;But what will New York say to Seattle?&rdquo; This very proper focus on the content of broadcasting is something that is with us all the time.  We should never become so involved with the technology of the fact that New York can speak to Seattle that we forget completely about what is said.</P>
    <P>The Government have a responsibility in terms of the content of a public broadcasting service; but the question is how great is that responsibility and what are the appropriate mechanisms for its expression.  I would argue very strongly that the Government's responsibility is minimal and residual, that it is best exercised by the method of dismissing the authority as outlined in the Bill. There are people who disagree with me, even within RTE, and who are willing to accept that the Government should have a power of direction of some kind.  I consider that this is unnecessary and that it can lead to abuses.  Fundamentally, it could tend to induce in broadcasting and broadcasters a sense of self-censorship of a kind that would promote the wrong sort of reaction to Government statements. It is easy for this to happen. It is easy for broadcasters to get a false view of reality and to start making decisions while people are looking over their shoulders all the time.  If someone in the media becomes conscious of someone looking over one's shoulder, one's job becomes much more difficult.</P>
    <P>There is a splendid quotation from May's <i>Constitutional History</i> which expresses my own attitude concisely and accurately.  This is that &ldquo;no circumstance has done more for freedom and good government than the unfettered liberty of reporting&rdquo;. There are risks involved in this unfettered liberty, risks of which broadcasters and journalists are at least as aware as is anybody else.  But the risks we run in a situation of unfettered and responsible broadcasting are far fewer than those in a situation in which a Government consider that their responsibility to the community is embodied best in a series of directives <Col N="851" /> or in legislation which would enable them to issue directives.</P>
    <P>The problem about directives is that they are always there.  Earlier I referred to experiences in Northern Ireland.  It is true that in Northern Ireland they have very many similar experiences to those we have had, some of them perhaps in a different league table of ludicrousness.  For example, Lord Brookeborough, when Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, once managed to prevent the broadcasting of a programme in which Miss Siobhán McKenna said, in an unguarded moment, that some internees who were being released from the Curragh against the advice of the British Government were &ldquo;young idealists&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He also ordered and succeeded in getting the cancellation of a programme on rural electrification in the Republic because he felt that people might think it was about Northern Ireland.  This is the sort of situation in which broadcasters in the North worked for quite some time and with which broadcasters in the South are familiar also.  If I am given the choice of governmental intervention in that fashion, governmental intervention by a telephone call to the head of the division, by the threatening remark, by the innuendo, and government intervention by express direction laid before the House, I have no difficulty in choosing the latter.  Basically, I do not like either of them very much and it is only that I like the latter a little better than I like the former.</P>
    <P>There is one fundamental aspect of the matter of Government direction which has not yet been adequately dealt with but, perhaps, which I could deal with at this time.  It is the concept of disorder as it appears in the Bill.  I have two sets of objections to the use of this word in this way. The first is a constitutional one; the second is an argument based on authorities.</P>
    <P>I have considerable difficulty in working out precisely what is meant by the word &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; in legal terms here.  If we are simply saying <Col N="852" /> that the authority should not break the law and that the Government can issue directions to the authority not to break the law, what are we saying that is of any value?  It seems that most of the things mentioned in the Bill are matters which are punishable at law.  Disorderly conduct is also something which is punishable at law. There is nothing specifically to be gained by telling people not to break the law.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, this document with which we are dealing is itself a law.  Are we here creating a new crime and are we creating a situation in which the judge of whether a crime has been or will be committed ceases to be the courts and becomes the Minister or the Government?  It seems that the major constitutional point here is that only the courts have the authority to decide if a crime has been committed.</P>
    <P>With regard to many of the unpleasant things specified in the Bill I think an action could lie against the authority if they were guilty of any of these things under the ordinary law of the land.  If they were, they would be guilty of conspiracy to commit disorder and conspiracy to incite people to crime.  As far as I know, incitement is still a crime.  If the authority could be shown to have committed this crime, they could be arrainged in any court of the land as easily as any other citizen.  It seems we have a situation in which not the court but the Minister becomes the judge of whether such a conspiracy exists or could be expected to exist.</P>
    <P>I find the pre-emptive aspect of it very strange.  If it is possible to say in advance that broadcasting a certain matter, a matter of a certain class, will cause a crime, this is being pre-emptive. It is putting the Government in a judicial role.  We must maintain the separation of the Judiciary and the Executive and some of these sections tend to fudge that distinction.  Either the section means nothing, apart from what is in the law already, in which case it should not be there, or it means something.  If it means something, it could be something which is not very pleasant or <Col N="853" /> something which has rather strange constitutional implications.</P>
    <P>The second main reason why I am against this sort of provision in the Bill is that many of the authorities of which I am aware are opposed to it also.  I should like to quote, for example, for the benefit of the House a statement made recently by somebody who has made a study of Irish broadcasting.  Mr. Anthony Smith, presently a Fellow of St. Anthony's College, Oxford.  The reference is to an RTE radio programme in which he was asked by the interviewer, Mr. John Bowman what his veiws were on the incorporation in legislation of a provision about disorder and a provision enabling the Minister or the Government to prohibit the broadcasting of any particular class of action.  He said:</P>
    <P>...&ldquo;disorder&rdquo;: that produces very considerable difficulties in the context of the modern kind of news story.  In a difficult industrial situation practically any statement made by a senior shop steward, trade union activist, or indeed by someone on the side of management, could be regarded as promoting disorder in certain circumstances.  It can happen in any modern society that has either political or industrial or economic conflict of a pretty difficult kind.  Most broadcasting constitutions around the world do contain provisions of this kind.  It provides a tool for those who wish at some stage or other to curb freedom of discussion through the broadcast media.  I think it's dangerous to have it in the Act, though it must be said that most broadcasting constitutions do have a provision of this kind.</P>
    <P>Here you have an expert who, because he knows the situation in different countries, is able to say that it is not unique.  There is no particularly and splendidly repressive piece in this Bill we are faced with at the moment. But it is not particularly welcome wherever it exists because, as he said, it does provide a mechanism which can be used in ways that it should not be used.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> Commenting on the idea that the Government should be able to give the authority certain directions, he said:</P>
    <P>Every single broadcasting institution around the world has built into its constitution a provision which enables the Minister or the Government to prohibit the transmission of any particular item or class of items.  This has been invoked in the British context very very seldom.  In other countries it has become a normal practice. Presumably in the Irish context you have a situation of very very serious political difficulty and it's unlikely that a provision of that kind would not be used by the Government&mdash;and there are plenty of precedents for previous Irish governments interfering with content that refers to the IRA.  But what has to be borne in mind is that that same provision can be used in industrial contexts.  It's very very easy for a difficult strike to lead to violence and for people to accuse the broadcasting authority of having transmitted the statements from either side that have led to disorder.  And so it is it seems to me, in the long term, a dangerous provision, although it exists in every broadcasting constitution. What one has to realise with this provision&mdash;as I think with others&mdash;is that it's always much better to have the absolute bare minimum reserve powers in the actual act which governs a broadcasting institution and to allow any other socially necessary habits of restraint to be built into the professional practice rather than into any code of law.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is a reasonably authoritative voice and, as a working journalist, I can certainly underwrite it, especially the last point he makes to the effect that the proper place for this kind of concern is not in an Act but basically in the professional conscience of the people involved.  A related authority, less disinterested perhaps than Mr. Smith but still concerned for standards in broadcasting and the media, is the National Union <Col N="855" /> of journalists.  In the March issue of <i>The Journalist</i>, which is the organ of the union, there is an editorial article commenting in extended detail on the Bill.</P>
    <P>It quotes from the Bill the phrase: &ldquo;Matter likely to promote or incite to crime, or to lead to disorder.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The editorial then says:</P>
    <P>Nobody could reasonably object to the first part of that sentence&mdash; but the rest of it strikes right at the heart of day-to-day reporting.</P>
    <P>Any reporter or sub-editor knows that stories involving some kind of disorder are a major part of his daily diet.  Such stories&mdash;involving students, workers, farmers, left or right wing groups, or just plain nonpolitical barneys&mdash;make front page news more days than not.</P>
    <P>Disorder of a limited and largely conventional kind has become part of the repertoire of the political process.  Workers occupy factories threatened with closure, farmers blockade imports of commodities in surplus, students jostle visiting Ministers, housewives sit down on through-roads&mdash;all these are doubtless against the law, but they happen every day, and more often than not, the responsible authority thinks it wiser not to prefer charges.</P>
    <P>A newspaper, which, as policy, banned all reporting of such happenings, would lose credibility overnight.</P>
    <P>But how can you report disorder, and avoid the danger that your report may lead to further disorder?</P>
    <P>This is something that was referred to by the Minister in his speech.</P>
    <P>How can you ask the housewives why they are blocking the traffic without possibly encouraging other housewives who feel the same way to do likewise?  How can you find out whether the occupying workers are militants thirsting for revolution, or ordinary people trying to protect their livelihoods, without running the risk that what they say may encourage more of the same? How can you assess the degree of <Col N="856" /> support and justification for the blockading farmers, without a risk that some people may interpret your assessment as an endorsement?</P>
    <P>The answer is, you can't be sure. You may phrase your questions as neutrally as anyone can, you may delete anything directly inflammatory from the replies, you may preface your report with as many ritual disassociations as you like, but if your report is a fair one, and if there is any sort of genuine grievance at the back of the disturbance you're reporting, you certainly can't guarantee that people&mdash;even reasonable people&mdash;may not be encouraged to lend a hand.</P>
    <P>The situation which is outlined in that editorial is a very commonsensical one. In common with myself, the writer of the editorial would like not to see a situation in which, because of the passage of this Bill there are an infinite number of situations in which the authority and people working under their aegis would feel they were in danger of in some way infringing some section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a bad principle in law&mdash;one which is written into many pieces of our legislation, the Offences Against the State Act being an obvious example&mdash;to create a huge host of technical offences in order to be able to trap the ones that really matter. Every piece of legislation should be concerned to minimise the number of technical offences that are brought into being by the creation of any new category of crime and to maintain a decent proportion between the technical offences that are always created by legislation and the actual offences which are those the legislators are really concerned with.</P>
    <P>If this Bill goes through in its present form we may risk creating a whole set of situations in which people are unaware of or anxious about the possibility of their being in technical breach of the law.  This is a bad situation and it is bad for the kind of flexibility and fluidity that a broadcasting service, above all, needs.</P>
    <P>Finally I should like to quote, on the question of disorder as opposed to <Col N="857" /> the question of directions, a statement by the Minister himself.  In 1968, the Minister, who was writing about Northern Ireland in the 24th October issue of <i>The Listener</i>, ended his article with a very perceptive quotation. He had been talking about the civil rights struggle in a context in which he compared it to the old Greek tragedy of Antigone, the girl who disobeyed the law because of some higher moral imperative, I quote:</P>
    <P>We should be safer without the troublemaker from Thebes.  And that which would be lost, if she could be eliminated, is quite intangible: no more, perhaps, than a way of imagining and dramatising man's dignity.  It is true that this way may express the essence of what man's dignity actually is.  In losing it, man might gain peace at the price of his soul.</P>
    <P>Four years later, when he quoted that in his book <i>States of Ireland</i> the Minister said that he was not now so sure that he agreed with the particular position he had taken up.  It was honest of him to say publicly that he now had second thoughts about that very powerful and compelling passage. But I would ask him to have third thoughts and to think whether his first thoughts were the better ones because the context in which he wrote his first set of thoughts was something very complicated, very intense.  I suspect that he changed his mind largely because of the horrors of the four years which followed the year in which he penned those words.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> It is one thing to say that and it is another to argue that the horrors of the four years between 1968 and 1972 were caused by the action of Antigone.  One could argue equally strongly that they were not, and that this intangible thing that he was talking about&mdash;the protest that in certain points in time goes outside the law&mdash; is something that we do not have to support by the law but something which we should be very careful to criticise and to attempt to eradicate in such a blanket fashion.</P>
    <P>There is one technical point on the matter of direction which I should also bring to the attention of the House.  Under the Bill as it stands the Minister's direction will stand unless it is annulled by resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas within a certain number of sitting days after the direction has been made.  If you look at the worst possible situation from the point of view of the broadcasting authority, that the Minister at the end of the last sitting day of the summer session of Dáil Éireann issues a direction with which they disagree, it is possible for that direction to remain unchallenged for anything up to seven months after it has been made.  This period is unnecessarily long.  The Bill should be amended to ensure that there should be a much shorter minimum period in which any direction given under the Act can be challenged.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
