      <P>There is a series of amendments and it is suggested that we take Nos. 2 to 6, when we come to them, together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>

      <P>This amendment has been tabled to meet the wishes of a number of Senators who suggested on Committee Stage that it was undesirable that the exercise of ministerial discretion in this respect should be restricted.  It was put to me that it would be more desirable to have the matter left flexible so that a person who was arrested could be brought before any court in the country rather than confined except for reasons of health to the Dublin Metropolitan District.</P>
      <P>I made the case that in the Dublin Metropolitan District, there was a court available all the time and that that was the purpose of it.  On reconsideration. I considered that it was better to have it more flexible and I decided do amend the section which now reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person has been arrested in pursuance of a warrant issued under section 26 or 27 the Minister may by order direct that the case be heard before a justice assigned to the district named in the order and, in that case, the person arrested <Col N="233" /> shall be brought before such justice. That leaves it completely open so that a person can be brought before whatever district court is mentioned in the order.  I think that meets the case.</P>

      <P>These amendments are teally all on the one principle, which was urged very strongly particularly by Senator O'Quigley, that it should emphasise that only warrants issued by a judicial authority will be backed by the Commissioner.  Therefore, in a number of places, in sections 43, 49, 54 and 55, we are inserting &ldquo;by a judicial authority&rdquo;.  It is made clear that every warrant must be based on the signature of the judicial authority. This was urged very strongly and I think it is a good point that we spell out that the procedure must be started by a judicial authority.  Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 spell this out.</P>

      <P>I should like to associate myself in congratulating the Minister on his attitude in the matter of these amendments.  If I may say so, with respect, a good Minister is one who shows that he is prepared to listen to reason.  The present Minister of course had a good training in this House originally and I think it is a matter for which he shoald be congratulated in that he has flexibility of mind in considering useful amendments and accepting them.  This matter should be commented on in the hope that the Minister will continue in this attitude.</P>

      <P>I wonder should we have a separate discussion on the amendments and a separate decision?  Even if the first amendment is not accepted, the second one could be accepted.

      <P>The proposal in the amendment is in contrast to the Government's proposal which would remove the section altogether and enable a gratuity of half a year's salary to be paid to a retiring Attorney General in any circumstance.</P>
      <P>The Minister present on the last occasion, the Minister for Agriculture, acting for the Minister for Finance, contended that this provision was in line with the general principle enshrined in this Bill on pension abatement. I gave my view the last day and today I intend to substantiate that view.  It is shown very conclusively by the debates on the Act of 1938, in column 400 of the debates of Seanad Éireann, volume 22 of 1938.  The Bill was introduced by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, as a result of a Commission of Inquiry into ministerial and other salaries.  The Commission reported in 1937, and its report was referred to as the Shanley Report.  Amongst other things, it investigated the office of the Attorney General and in connection with this, I wish to quote from page 20 of the report, which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principles which we have enunciated in regard to the remuneration of Ministers do not quite fit the case of the Attorney General.  While to some extent his rank is equivalent to that of a Minister, he is a specialist who is employed so that the Government, in dealing with the legal aspects of administration, may have the benefit of his knowledge and experience.  In considering his remuneration, therefore, regard must be had to the value of the services which he renders to the Government and to the inducements which should reasonably be offered to a man of high standing in the legal profession.  However, it must <Col N="236" /> be remembered that the salary attaching to the post is not the only material reward of the Attorney General because he may reasonably look forward to the possibility of promotion to the Bench and, if he returns to practice on completion of his period of office, the standing and prestige which he has gained as Leader of the Bar may be expected to place him eventually in a more lucrative position than was his before he became Attorney General.</P>
    <P>We conceive that three important points fall to be determined in relation to the Attorney General, viz.: whether he should be permitted to engage in private practice, whether he should be remunerated on the basis of a fixed salary for his advisory services, with additional fees at the ordinary professional rates in respect of appearances in court on behalf of the State, and what scale of salary should be allowed to him on the assumption that his services to the State must be wholetime and must not be supplemented by professional fees.  We take the view that if the Attorney General is to perform efficiently all the duties of his office, the State should have the first and only demand upon his services and that accordingly he should be regarded as employed in a full-time capacity and precluded from engaging in private practice.</P>
    <P>That is the foundation.  The Commission recommended that the Attorney General should be a full-time employee and on the same basis as a Minister. The Government refused to accept that recommendation, and in the Bill introduced in Dáil Éireann on 30th November, 1938&mdash;I quote from column 1145 of volume 73 of the Dáil Debates&mdash;Deputy MacEntee said that the Government had refused to accept the recommendation that the Attorney General be put on a level with a Minister, but after the Second Reading debate, in which pleas were made to reconsider the position, the Minister for Finance moved the amendment which we are now seeking to delete, the amendment which provided that a gratuity of a half-year's salary would <Col N="237" /> be paid to a retiring Attorney General who had more than three years service, provided he was not appointed to a position of more than £1,000 a year at that period; in other words, promoted to the Bench or some senior appointment in the giving of the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee in introducing this amendment to the House said in column 1147:</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill, I pointed out that the Government had not been able to accept the recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry in so far as the recommendations related to the office of Attorney General.  In the course of the Debate on the Second Reading of the Bill, the attention of the Government was drawn to the fact that the Attorney General was in rather a different position even to that of a Minister, that while it was quite true that he had not wholly severed his associations with his profession, and while he did in fact continue to practice that profession during his term of office, nevertheless the practice was limited and circumscribed to purely Government business, and that, in the proper discharge of his duty as Attorney General he, like the Ministers, had to interrupt completely his former professional connections.  We have considered the position, and the Government is of opinion that there is something to be said for that point of view, and that, accordingly, if a person for any reason retires from the office of Attorney General having served three years in that position, he ought to be given an opportunity to try to make good some of the professional loss which he, undoubtedly, sustained by reason of the fact that, as I have said, he had to sever what was his purely personal and private professional connection.  In pursuance of that, the Government have put down this amendment which would give to any person who has held the office of Attorney General for three years and who retires from that office and does not, in the ensuing twelve months after his retirement, <Col N="238" /> receive an appointment to any wholetime office the remuneration of which exceeds £1,000 per annum and either is charged on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof or is payable directly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, or is appointed on the nomination of the Government or a Minister of State to any office the remuneration of which exceeds £1,000 per annum&mdash; that, in the case of an Attorney General he does not receive an appointment of the nature specified and prescribed in this amendment, he should be given a gratuity of one-half of the salary he held on retirement from office.  That, I think, is as far as the Government finds itself, in the circumstances, able to go to meet the point of view that was advocated here.</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Dr. O'Higgins in a few sentences accepted that.  He said:</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the fact that some recognition has been given to the fact that the Attorney General, to a greater or lesser extent, has lost coniact with his business, and that, necessarily, when he goes back to ordinary life, he finds himself in the position that it takes a number of years at least before he gets back to anything like the professional position he was in before he took office as Attorney General.  I accept the fact that provision is made here for that, although it is not exactly making the Attorney General equivalent to a Minister in the pensionable capacity; but it is doing something to meet the case.</P>
    <P>When the Bill came to the Seanad, Deputy MacEntee in his Second Reading speech said, at column 400, Volume 22:</P>
    <P>The Government is unable to accept the recommendation of the Shanley Committee to make the post of Attorney General a pensionable one, and, as I said already in the other House, they did not reach that conclusion without much hesitation.  We have, however, amended the Bill as originally introduced, following the representations made in the debate <Col N="239" /> on the Second Stage of the Bill, so as to make provision by way of gratuity for an Attorney General who has ceased or shall in future cease to hold office by reason of a change of Government, provided he has not less than four years' service in office.  The amount of the gratuity is equal to one-half of a year's salary, and is intended to tide the ex-Attorney General over the period after the cesser of office during which he will be gradually taking up again the threads of his professional career.</P>
    <P>I do not need to spell it out any further.</P>
    <P>The principle is crystal-clear and the provision is simply to tie the man, who, in the words of the Shanley Report has not received the type of promotion or advancement he might regard as being due to his appotntment as Attorney General, promotion to the bench.  When promotion to the bench is given at a salary which is considerably in excess of the salary of the Attorney General, at least his official salary, then there is no reason for this Minister or the Government to suggest that the man has got anything but first-class promotion or that there is any question of there being difficulties while he catches up on his professional career.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I appeal to the Government at this time of crisis not to set the bad example of giving a golden handshake of this kind.  Above all, I object very strongly to seeing this provision slipped into a Bill from which it differs radically in principle.  We all accept the principle of the Pensions (Abatement) Bill.  It was something which commended itself to justice and fair play because the pensions had been earned by the people concerned. There had been no deductions made from their salaries over the years but contributions were made by the State. They were in every sense the real earnings of the people concerned. There is no suggestion, whatsoever, in the quotation I have given of any ministerial approach to this that there is any analogy between that and <Col N="240" /> between giving an ex-Attorney General a gratuity to enable him to pick up again the threads of his office if he comes back to a professional career.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government, if they want to give a gratuity willy-nilly to the Attorney General and everybody else, then bring that into the House as a separate Bill.  Let us discuss the principle behind this large gesture and let us face it as a separate issue but please do not slip it&mdash;that is the only word I can use&mdash;into this one innocuous line at the end of this Bill which merely sets out the section that is being repealed.</P>
    <P>I had to do considerable homework before I saw the import of this.  It brings home do us the vital necessity in this Chamber, and elsewhere, of scrutinising every line of legislation that comes before us and not taking anything for granted because right here we have what I might say is an abolition of legislation, this slipping of things through.</P>
    <P>There is no case to be made against the amendment and consequenetly I ask the Minister to accept it.  I had hoped on this occasion, we would have had the senior Minister of the Government, the Minister for Finance, present, do speak on this amendment.  Unfortunately he is not here.  The principle is one that should commend itself above all to a Minister with the sense of openness which the Minister for Justice has shown do this House and which was commented on a few minutes ago. I appeal do him to accept this amendment which should be agreed to by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated during the debate on the previous Stage of this Bill, I find myself very largely in agreement with Senator Quinlan on this point.  I need not take up much time of the House in elaborating on the case made for this amendment but it is important that we should all understand quite clearly that there is a certain significance attached to the inclusion of a provision of this kind in the Bill before us.  As Senator Quinlan has quite rightly pointed out, it is quite obvious that the Ministerial <Col N="241" /> and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938 envisaged, and had very clearly in view, very different terms of appointment applicable to the office of Attorney General from those applied to that office today.  In addition to that, I want to point out that there is in fact a very radical difference in principle between the purposes and the general intent of this Bill and the provisions enshrined originally in the 1938 Act.</P>
      <P>I do not consider there is any case whatever for this type of golden handshake, as it has been quite rightly described.  It is most unfortunate that the Minister and the Government should have let it come before any House of the Oireachtas at the present time and expect us to sit here quite calmly and passive, when, at the same time, we have everybody from the Taoiseach down appealing for caution and restraint by the workers of the country and every other section who are expected do tighten their belts. They are expected to be satisfied with less than the minimum necessary to sustain a reasonable standard of living</P>
      <P>The case made here by Senator Quinlan, I quite frankly think, is unanswerable.  The Government will not only be doing justice, but will be adopting a very sensible and reasonable approach to a proper solution of this problem by following the advice tendered from this side of the House to remove this section.  I do not want to say any more about it at this stage except to say I am in full agreement with Senator Quinlan in the case he has made.  I urge the Minister to realise the sensible case he has made.  Any reasonable Minister would listen to it. I appeal to him to take back the section and to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinlan, on the last occasion, made reference to the fact that this gratuity was to enable the Attorney General to re-establish himself in the office in which he had been engaged before he assumed the post of Attorney General. Despite the fact that he has spelled out very slowly for us today the debates which dook place on that <Col N="242" /> occasion, we heard no reference in anything he spelled out to the fact that there was no question of reestablishing the Attorney General in office because, by the nature of the employment of the Attorney General, that of a barrister in prachice, there is no office to which he can re-establish himself when he has ceased to be Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General is a man who has reached&mdash;and I feel this is true in the case of most of the Attorneys General we have seen&mdash;the pinnacle of his profession and, by virtue of his profession, he is a man who depends exclusively on his own private associations and the private contacts be makes with his colleagues in the solicitors' profession.  By devoting himself to the office of Attorney General and by accepting that post, he excludes himself&mdash;let there be no doubt about this &mdash;for the duration of his office from all his professional associations and, in doing so, he relinquishes all the contacts he established over the years, contacts which, in fact, took him some time to establish.</P>
      <P>As I said, he is at the pinnacle of his profession.  Whatever our views may be on individual cases, I feel the Government should have the benefit of the best legal advice available.  The Attorney General should be highly qualified in all respects to assume that post, and I do not think we could rightly expect him, or ask him, to relinquish all the contacts he had established in the years he spent in that very slow and painful progression, and to start again without some compensation and, without doubt, some small compensation, for the loss he will incur.  Senator Quinlan may reply that there is this golden handshake, and that he can expect a reward or his political efforts by, being appointed in due course to the bench.  There is no guarantee whatsoever that he will be appointed in due course to the Bench.</P>

      <P>What about a change of Government?  At present there is a very distinguished former Attorney General practising at the bar who did not enjoy that golden handshake. It can be said from this side of the House that that is a perfect example of a case where a man by accepting that onus and that responsibility lost, and lost substantially.  It would be churlish of us to refer to a particular office when, in fact, we are trying to encourage the best type of mind and the most highly qualified person to accept the post.  We should consider also and concern ourselves with the obvious case of men who relinquished much to contribute to the Government and to the legal policy of the Government.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinlan has resurrected in my mind the whole history of this matter.  I had a lot to do with it in 1938.  In 1937 we started this business of pensions for Ministers. I should like to remind the House that the practice of the Attorney General confining his services to the Government was departed from in a Coalition Government.  As a matter of fact, one Attorney General actually appeared against the State while he was Attorney General.  He continued an action in which he had been engaged for the Wicklow County Council, or Bray, so far as my recollection goes. He broke entirely with the precedent we thought had been established and would always be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel Senator Quinlan has made a very good point.  The Attorney General is the leader of his profession. Undoubtedly, he loses some of his practice, and to make provision for that we gave him half his salary to enable him to get back into his stride again.  If there was a vacancy for a High Court judge he got it.  His position was enhanced.  I think the Government would be well advised to listen to the case which has been made. I am very familiar with all this because I had a lot to do with it.  We set up a Commission and there was general agreement in that Commission, but at the last moment the representative of one Party got cold feet and <Col N="244" /> would not sign.  It had reached the stage of being drafted when he decided that he would not sign it. However, that is ancient history.  We gave the Attorney General half his salary.  I think he was paid £3,000 at that time, so he got £1,500.  The sum is probably bigger now because the value of money has changed cansiderably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinlan has made what appears to be a very strong case, but I think he has omitted certain points.  In the ordinary course of events if a person occupies the position of Minister for a number of years&mdash; three, four, five or six; I forget the number&mdash;he automatically becomes entitled to a pension, not a gratuity, for the remainder of his life.  The principle was enunciated on Second Reading of this Bill that such a pension should not abate, because the person took further employment, the reason being that otherwise we would lose the benefit of the experience and knowledge of various people.</P>
      <P>Either we adopt that principle or we do not.  If we adopt the principle that this pension should not abate, this means that if a person who has been an officer in the Army takes employment with a local authority as an accountant, he does not lose his Army pension.  A Minister who was formerly a secretary of a county council, or who held some other position under the Government, could go back into that position and he would not lose the pension he would get as Minister.  As I understand it, that is the principle of the Bill, and if we are to adopt that principle, and to support it wholeheartedly, we must adopt it for everyone.  We cannot make an exclusion.  During the course of the discussions on Second Reading it was stated that this pension was a form of deferred payment.  A person taking up an appointment at a lower salary than he might expect in private employment or in business on his own took that employment at a lower salary because he knew he would get a pension which was a deferred payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can visualise that for many persons at the Bar what they would be paid <Col N="245" /> as Attorney General&mdash;I think it is something round £3,000&mdash;would be considerably less than what they could hope to earn at the Bar.  The fact that they are appointed Attorney General does not necessarily mean that they will be promoted to the Bench.  Perhaps the appointment to the Bench is not one to which he would be completely adaptable when he is taking on the employment as Attorney General.  If we are to agree on the principle that it is a deferred payment&mdash;he does not get a pension whether he lives ten years after he retires as Attorney General or whether he laves 30 years&mdash;he gets one lump sum in place of this pension which could be described as a deferred payment.  If we adopt the principle that it is a deferred payment, surely in the Attorney General's case as in the case of all other civil servants he should not be refused it.</P>
    <P>I can visualise cases were grave hardship could come about if Senator Quinlan's amendments were adopted. I take the case of a man who is Attorney General.  Let us assume that six or eight months after he retires as Attorney General, he is appointed a judge; he then dies within 12 months or two years, or, perhaps, has come to retiring age and gets another pension as a judge and has to forfeit it.  If we once adopt the principle that a pension is a deferred payment, that it is something a man bears in mind when taking on the appointment in the first instance, then the gratuity in that case is a deferred payment.</P>
    <P>While I sympathise with Professor Quinlan's wishes, nevertheless, I feel you can describe it in either of two ways.  You can raise an outcry by describing the pension or gratuity as a golden handshake.  We talk about compulsory Irish, the poor man's pint but if you describe it, as it should be described, as a deferred payment I think that is only right and proper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Nash has just referred to descriptions such as golden handshakes.  That is not the sort of remark I would expect in the Seanad in regard to the very important position of Law Officer to the Government, no matter what Government <Col N="246" /> it is.  That sort of cheapjack phrase is not in my view the sort of phrase that should be used in this House and certainly does not set a proper headline.  What we are concerned with in this amendment is whether or not the Attorney General's office, no matter who occupies it, is to be excluded from the pension abatement provisions which we are making for all public servants and to which no objection has been taken. We are providing for our Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and Attorneys General, in the plural, in addition to other public servants and the case sought to be made in the amendment is that we should for some reason exclude the Attorney General from these provisions.  This is what the amendments amount to here.  Has a case been made in that respect?  In my view the answer is no.  It is unfair and wrong that any particular official or officer should be excluded from any range of pensions or benefits which may be sought to be brought in. It appears to me on the face of it that the question of personality may enter into this.  On the basis of clear rational thinking, is it right or proper that one particular office should be excepted from all others, particularly when that office is the important one of Attorney General where any Government must have as its Law Officer the most competent and able person who in its wisdom the Government thinks is the proper person to advise them on legal matters?</P>
      <P>That is precisely the thinking behind the criticism made by the former Deputy Dr. O'Higgins during the Second Stage Reading of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices bill which came before the Dáil in 1938. In that Bill, as it was originally framed, the Government did not include the Attorney General.  In my view Dr. O'Higgins properly made the point that there should be no discrimination against the Attorney General&mdash;I refer to columns 901 and 902 of the Dáil Debates of the 23rd November, 1938, and it was adopted by the Government.  I quote therefrom:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see justification for discriminating between the Attorney <Col N="247" /> General and any other member of the Government.  In fact, we all know that he is a member of the Government, carrying, perhaps, greater responsibility than any of the others, because he is the adviser of all in a crisis, sitting as a member of the Executive Council in all but voting.  In every sense of the word his task is equal to that of the others, and on leaving his plight is, at least, as bad as any of the other members of the Government.  On every matter there is a certain amount of division of opinion, but I strongly urge that there should not be discrimination against one individual. A Government is a team.</P>
    <P>In my view the question of where the Attorney General goes after he leaves his job is irrelevant.  The point is that this is a deferred payment award for his job as a member of a Government team.  It would be a very wrong principle for Oireachtas Éireann to establish that one member of that team should be discriminated against and, indeed, Dr. O'Higgins's remarks on that occasion were taken very fully into account by the Government and they decided to include a provision for the Attorney General under that particular Bill.  I agree fully with Dr. O'Higgins's remarks on that occasion in that the Attorney General is a member of the team; indeed, he is a very important member of any Government team because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that the Attorney General sits in on every Government meeting; he does not participate in voting on any Government decision but he is the person on whom the Government leans very heavily for legal advice in regard to any particular matter.  He sits in as a member of the Government team; he is a party to all discussions but does not vote on any Government decision and does not participate unless asked to do so.  In <Col N="248" /> my view, it would be completely wrong to exclude him and I can only suggest that the reason why this particular exclusion is sought at this stage is for some personal reason or other.</P>

      <P>I cannot see the rationality behind it.  When I hear phrases like &ldquo;golden handshakes&rdquo; being used I think they denigrate a public office, they denigrate Parliament, in fact they denigrate everything we are seeking to establish in this country. That sort of cheapjack phrase is nothing less than denigration.  I see no reason why this House should adopt this particular amendment.  The matter was not even raised in the other House.  The Dáil saw no good reason why the Attorney General should be excluded&mdash;no matter what Attorney General it is&mdash;from whatever provisions are brought in for gratuities or pensions.  The matter has been raised here in a strange fashion.  I speak not alone as a Minister but for all my colleagues in asking the House to reject these amendments as introducing an undesirable discriminatory provision against one particular officer charged with certain serious responsibilities and the onus of advising the Government over a period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of the Attorney General is in many respects an anomalous one.  It is probably inevitable that every time his position is discussed in connection with legislation difficulties will arise, and difficulties have arisen in this particular case.  Before going on to deal with the matter, I think it is unfortunate that the Minister in his speech should have suggested that there is anything in the nature of private motives in regard to this, and also that he should have suggested that, just because matters are not raised in Dáil Éireann, Seanad Éireann is not free to start <i>ab initio</i> a discussion on the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties here has <Col N="249" /> been whether the position of Attorney General is analogous to that of a civil servant who leaves a post and afterwards comes back to another. On this point, we must distinguish two cases.  Either the Attorney General becomes a judge or he does not.  If the Attorney General does not become a judge within twelve months, this amendment leaves him in exactly the same position as anybody else who retires from a public post.</P>
    <P>If the Attorney General does not become a judge and returns to practice or returns to any other office, provided it is not over £3,000 a year he gets his gratuity.  The amendment leaves that intact.  The point at issue is what should be done in the case where an Attorney General becomes a judge. What is at issue here is whether or not the Attorney General who becomes a judge, can be considered as in an analogous position to any other person who retires from the public service.</P>
    <P>A fair case has been made and can be maintained, that an Attorney General who becomes a judge is not retiring; he is being promoted.  This is a step in the career of this particular individual.  It is not a step of resigning from a job in order to retire and, perhaps, coming back to some other type of work.  It is, in fact, part of the weaving of this man's career.  It is on this point that the Seanad should make up their minds.  There is no doubt if he has to return to practice a special provision is there.  If he is like any other civil servant leaving a job, or like a Minister going out of office back to private life, the amendment gives him his gratutity.  The amendment is not allowing the gratuity if he goes from the office of Attorney General to that of the Bench.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that this particular section was included in the Bill.  It is doubly unfortunate in the fact that, since the Bill is a retrospective measure, it covers the case of somebody who has now, retired as an Attorney General.  These are not matters that should be allowed to cloud the general issue in regard to the position, or what Seanad Éireann <Col N="250" /> thinks should be the position, when a man leaves the job of Attorney General and goes on to the Bench.  The Seanad is being asked whether this is analogous to a public servant retiring, or whether, even though technically he goes from one job to another and technically he goes from one branch of employment to another in fact this is normal promotion in the course of his career.</P>
    <P>A good case has been made and I do not think that anything the Minister has said has rebutted the case which has been made on this ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what has been said and I find myself rather in the position of agreeing with the amendment that is not before us, which we would have to pass if we passed this one, but not agreeing with this particular amendment.  I am surprised at the suggestion by the Minister that Senator Quinlan's amendment seeks to set up a new position.  It seems to me that it is the Bill which seeks to set up a new position.</P>
      <P>If I understand the position correctly, apart from the repeal of subsections (4) and (5) of section 15 of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, and without that repeal which we ask for agreement for here, the situation would obtain as it was of yore.  In other words the new element is not being introduced by Senator Quinlan but by the Bill and, therefore, I do not think it is quite fair to suggest that Senator Quinlan is trying to discriminate against one man or anything of that kind.  What he is trying to do is have continued a practice which was regarded as just in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooge's point is that passing from Attorney General to a judgeship cannot really be regarded as retiring from one post requiring a pension and going on to something totally different. It seems to me as a layman that it is, in fact, promotion.  If I understand it correctly, this amendment merely means that coupled with the following amendment the present situation will obtain except for the fact that the <Col N="251" /> figure, as it were, will be raised to £3,000 instead of £1,000.  I feel that £1,000, or, perhaps, £2,000 would be plenty.</P>
    <P>I think I should say here that at present money values, most lawyers are grossly overpaid.  This will be agreed to by those of us who are not lawyers.  My heart does not bleed for the barrister who goes out of practice and has to live on the mere pittance he gets as Attorney General, and then we have to hand out a pension.  Under the Bill before us he is now to get his pension and proceed to a more highly paid position.  I would feel more at one with this amendment if it were raised, perhaps, in a time of decreasing money value from £1,000 to £2,000, but I would feel strongly in favour of the next amendment no matter what happens to this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, some of the Senators who spoke, such as Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Nash, did not seem to comprehend the situation or had not read the section.  Senator O'Kennedy seems to take up the line that a man has no guarantee of promotion.  This is the very point here.  He gets the gratuity, the half year's salary, if he is not promoted within a year, so Senator O'Kennedy was completely wrong in his premises.  Then be speaks of men who have relinquished quite a lot to serve the State.  Many of them do not think of the question of gratuity. I would feel far kinder towards it if it were a question of gratuity to some retiring Ministers who had served long and nobly and I would much prefer if the question of gratuity were faced as an issue and if we had Government thinking on it and not have discrimination&mdash;that is the word which was employed&mdash;used to give it to one particular person and nobody else. That is the type of inverse discrimination that is recommended in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, Senator Nash got the issue completely befuddled between pensions and gratuities.  Surely the Government of the period of 1938 were crystal clear that this was not a pension in any sense of the word.  It was simply to <Col N="252" /> enable the retiring Attorney General if he did not get on to the Bench within twelve months to take up his practice again.  That is a very reasonable and salutary process.  All I have to add here is that the money values concerned obviously need to be modernised.</P>
    <P>Then Senator Nash spoke about our taking something from someone that he had in his terms of appointment, but that is precisely the issue.  We are not taking anything.  We are seeking to preserve the <i>status quo</i>, the terms on which all former Attorneys General since 1938 accepted the office.  Again, Senator Nash was completely wrong in that.  Neither the present nor the former Attorney General when he accepted the office had any idea that they could both aspire to going on the Bench and at the same time get a golden handshake of £2,000 a year. I do nor apologise to anyone for using that term because we have to speak in the terms that people understand. They understand what a golden handshake means and it is not altogether very pleasant.</P>

I hope that when we are ever found lacking in courage, we will remember Senator Boland and then speak and make a stand for what we believe.  When I look back on public life, there are a couple of figures who really stand out.  One is Senator Boland and the other is Senator Moylan.  I I regret that such people are becoming all too rare and I hope that the future <Col N="253" /> will throw up their likes.  It is a real privilege to be in the same Chamber with men such as those and I congratulate the Taoiseach on the most outstanding nomination he made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister just did not attempt to deal with the case at all.  His whole case was that it is, and I quote him, &ldquo;irrelevant where the Attorney General goes afterwards.&rdquo; The Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, when he got the Dáil to agree to this, was very specific and the words used were extremely legal and had only one interpretation.  Perhaps it might be well to quote again for the Minister's benefit and see the contrast. He said &ldquo;...and is intended to tide the ex-Attorney General over the period after cesser of office during which he will be gradually taking up again the threads of his professional career&rdquo;.  That stands in sharp contrast to the Minister's approach, and also was fully and strongly endorsed by Senator Boland who said that that was their view in 1938.</P>
      <P>Senator Boland quite rightly made the point there that it was a great pity that a departure had been made regarding the office, that the man was excluded from private practice.  If the Minister wishes to place the Attorney General on the same level as Ministers, surely the first and obvious step, if he is looking for such equality, is to insist on full time service?  We have it every way.  We have a gratuity that was brought in on the assumption that the man concerned would really sever his connections with the legal profession, and then the situation emerges where those connections are scarcely severed at all, and now we are back to the situation in which the golden handshake is required to follow such a measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would much prefer to see the Minister do something to lift the discrimination against Ministers, of which he is one, because surely they are a group in this country who are totally underpaid and frequently uncared for. It shows a great lack of moral courage <Col N="254" /> on the part of the Government that they have not faced up to this issue long before now.  To accuse me of discrimination against the Attorney General in looking for parity with Ministers is about the strangest joke I have heard in a long time, as if one could say that there was parity between those two positions.  The Minister by his smile says that he acknowledges that fact as well as I and everybody else.</P>

      <P>Again the Minister said that by using the term &ldquo;golden handshake&rdquo;, I have denigrated the Government and public life-I leave the people to decide on that. They know what I mean by &ldquo;goklen handshake&rdquo; and they can decide, but I will insist on calling it a golden handshake.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge very rightly made the point that this was normal in the way of promotion and going to higher posts at almost double salary.  Surely nobody in any walk of life feels he experiences hardship in having such discrimination exerted against his promotion upstairs, and nobody expects a handout in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the grave objections I see against the present suggestion is the innocuous way it has been slipped into the Bill here.  It is totally out of spirit and out of principle with the Bill.  It has no connection whatsoever with the idea of pension abatement and it should not have been put into the Bill. It is an object lesson to the Seanad that we cannot take anything for granted. We have to scrutinise the measures as they come and satisfy ourselves that things are what they are supposed to be.  In this case it was only because I happened to see a reference in the White Paper that I followed it up and found what was behind it.  It is some justification of the Seanad here that we have unearthed this, and even if we do not succeed in stopping it now, because after all if the Minister decides that he is going to railroad it through, there is <Col N="255" /> nothing we can do about it when heads are counted, at least we will have vindicated our right and shown that we are on the watch here, and other Ministers will think twice in future before they try to slip a fast one through here such as what is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have little else to say, except that at this twelfth hour, I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment, leaving the <i>status quo</i> prevail, bring money values up to date, and if he wants to speak of gratuities to any retiring officer, start with Ministers first.  You can give the Attorney General any equality you wish with Ministers in that but let us debate the <Col N="256" /> principle in full.  Let us see the full justice for it and not have simply one officer made a favourite over all the others.</P>
    <P>I conclude by appealing to the Minister to show us that he is as big a man as Senator Boland who spoke from the back bench so that when a case is made on its merits, a case that is unanswerable, he is big enough to accept it and take it back and ask the Government to be big enough to accept it, too, because that is the spirit of Senator Boland, the spirit of the late Senator Moylan, the spirit of our President, Mr. de Valera, himself, and of the fathers of the State, Griffith, Collins and others.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend and extend the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited Acts, 1959 to 1963.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to provide for the further financing of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited by extending the limits on investment contained in the current legislation.  The Bill provides for:</P>
      <P>(1) An increase from £4,000,000 to £6,000,000 in the aggregate of the amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares of the company;</P>
      <P>(2) An increase from £2,000,000 to £3,000 000 in the aggregate amount of grants, voted annually, which may be made to the company, and</P>
      <P>(3) An increase from £2,000,000 to £3,000,000 in the existing statutory limit on repayable advances by the Minister for Finance for the provision of houses and community services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> The Development Company was set up to promote the increased use of Shannon Airport for passenger and freight traffic and for tourist, commercial and industrial purposes.  The main activities of the company have been the attraction of industries to the airport and more recently the development of Shannon as an international warehousing centre.</P>
    <P>Share capital subscribed to the company is used for the provision of factory buildings.  These are normally rented to the occupiers but factory bays may also be purchased outright or may be built on sites leased from the company.  Repayable advances are used for the provision of dwellings and community services for the purposes of the Industrial Estate.  The houses are provided by the company at reasonable rents or to purchase, and developed sites are also made available for persons wishing to build their own houses, and for speculative building.  The grant-in-aid moneys are applied towards meeting the company's running expenses and providing financial assistance to industries including grants towards factory buildings, new machinery and the training of workers.</P>
    <P>The finances provided to the company under existing legislation up to 31st March, 1965, were as follows:</P>

    <P>It is expected that these balances will be exhausted at an early date and it is necessary, therefore, to promote amending legislation to provide for the further financing of the company so as to enable it to plan ahead and to enter into commitments with industrialists and others.  The revised limits proposed under the new legislation should suffice until about 1968 when it is proposed to afford the House a further opportunity of reviewing the progress made by the company.</P>
    <P>The company has been making <Col N="259" /> steady progress in attracting new industries to Shannon.  At 3lst March, 1965, there were 14 manufacturing and ten trading concerns in operation at the Airport.  Thirty-two standard bays and three small bays were occupied by these firms on a rental basis and two firms were in occupation of their own factories&mdash;one built with the aid of a grant from the company and the other purchased from the company after allowance bad been made for the equivalent of a building grant from the company.  The output of the existing factories, practically all of which is exported, includes pianos and floor maintenance equipment, jersey fabric and fashion garments, office machines and equipment, diamond drilling equipment and electronic components, and the range of services provided includes warehousing and freight forwarding, data processing, public relations and management consultancy.</P>
    <P>Eight warehousing units of 3,750 sq. ft. each have been constructed and two more are being constructed as part of the company's plan to encourage warehousing, freight consolidation, freight forwarding and redistribution of goods at the airport and to establish Shannon as a centre for the distribution of goods in international trade.  At 3lst March, 1965, three of the units were occupied and five were allocated to prospective tenants, three of which were previously located in temporary premises at the airport.  Although terminal freight at the airport in 1964 rose by 31 per cent to 4,182 tons from 3,196 tons in 1963, freight generated by the Industrial Estate&mdash;which was about one-fifth of the total&mdash;was down by about nine per cent compared with 1963. However, in the first three months of this year Industrial Estate freight was up by nearly 70 per cent compared with the first quarter of 1964.  The development of terminal freight traffic is difficult mainly because of the great disparity at present existing between air and surface rates but as this gap narrows it is expected that the volume of air shipments will increase substantially. The encouragement of warehousing is expected to give a <Col N="260" /> considerable fillip to air cargo shipments. The company is also active in securing improved cargo rates, improved services and speedy clearance at destinations and in the publicising of the facilities available by air.</P>
    <P>Employment has been growing at a satisfactory rate since the Industrial Estate was set up.  From a figure of 453 at the end of March, 1961, it rose to 1,151 at March 1962, to 1,542 at March, 1963, and to 2,109 at March, 1964.  At 3lst March, 1965 employment had risen to 2,927, of whom 1,538 were male, and the increase of over 800 in the past year is most satisfactory.  The <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> envisages that about 5,000 persons will be employed in the Industrial Estate by 1970.  On the basis of progress to date this target should be achieved always provided, of course, that a sufficient labour force continues to be available.  No immediate difficulties are anticipated in finding male employees as trainees or unskilled workers though some problems are being experienced in finding men in suitable age groups. Skilled men who have emigrated are being attracted to return.  Special consideration is being given to the provision of accommodation for female workers who may wish to reside at ihe airport.  Industries employing predominantly male labour are those which are most encouraged and the projected community development should ensure the establishment of families in the estate.  A notable feature in the development of the Industrial Estate has been the rapid rate of expansion of some of the firms and, in fact, the four major established firms have been mainly responsible for the inerease in employment.  Many of the firms have plans for further expansion and one of them now employing about 780 people envisages a work force of up to 2,000 by 1969.</P>
    <P>So far, the importance of the Shannon project has been seen principally in the employment which it has provided and which continues to grow, and in the increasing business at the airport itself, where once the indications seemed to be that traffic might <Col N="261" /> decline to a level which would mean virtual closure of the airport and widespread unemployment.  Another aspect of its great national importance can now be measured because Córas Tráchtála recently completed a study of exports from the Shannon Free Airport Industrial Estate during 1964.  During the calendar year 1964 £14m.  worth of manufactured goods were exported&mdash;equivalent to 20 per cent of total Irish manufactured exports or to 25 per cent of total manufactured exports from the rest of the country outside Shannon.  It is clear also that the rate of output in Shannon is rising more rapidly than in the country as a whole, so that this proportion can confidently be expected to increase.  From this aspect alone&mdash;the contribution it is making to the national balance of trade&mdash;the Shannon project merits full support.</P>
    <P>Although the rate of introduction of new firms has not been as great as the rate of expansion of established ones there has been no decrease in the number of inquiries being received by the company from industrial interests. While a certain amount of factory accommodation must be provided in anticipation of actual demand, factories are built on the basis of likely demand and building programme are sanctioned on this basis.  The company's factory building programme as incorporated in the Second Programme envisages a construction rate of eight factory bays each year to 1969-70. The company's programme to attract new industries is being promoted in the US, heretofore the most fruitful market, the UK and Europe.  Because of their dependence on export markets, the success and expansion possibilities of industries are particularly susceptible to changes in international trading conditions, particularly the imposition of new tariffs such as the 15 per cent UK levy or restrictions imposed by other countries on investment abroad.  While every effort is made to ensure that industries establishing at Shannon will be viable, there is no absolute safeguard against the risk of a set-back arising out of circumstances beyond control of the company and of the industries themselves.  To cater for the <Col N="262" /> smaller company with perhaps limited capital, the company has arranged for the construction of a number of small factory units.  It is, of course, impossible to foresee with any certainty the extent of future development but the proposed increase in the share capital to £6m. should be sufficient for the next two or three years.</P>
    <P>As the Industrial Estate expands, the demand for accommodation both for married and single people at the airport grows and the company is meeting this demand by providing houses to rent or purchase and also by providing developed sites for speculative building or on which persons may build their own houses. It is necessary to strike a balance between over-ambitious planning and under-planning.  It is important that workers should not be discouraged from taking up employment at the airport because of lack of suitable accommodation.  This is especially so in the case of key workers in new industries.  It has been the policy to provide housing at the airport in line with likely demand and the company's housing schemes are planned on this basis.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that community development must be maintained in line with development on the industrial side.  The present resident population at Shannon is about 1,200 and the amenities include shops, primary schools, banking and postal facilities, a recreation centre and a public house. Shannon has been selected as a location for one of the new comprehensive schools.  It is estimated that the population will have risen to about 3,700 by 1970 and the company's building programme is proceeding on this basis. This programme is incorporated in the Second Programme which envisages a construction rate of about 80 houses a year.</P>
    <P>Up to 3lst March, 1965, expenditure on housing amounted to £1.82m., all of which had been provided by way of repayable advances.  292 houses and 137 flats had been completed.  Almost all of these houses and flats were either occupied or allocated.  A further 26 houses were under construction. Rents are fixed in relation to what <Col N="263" /> the tenants can reasonably be expected to pay and a subsidy is provided from the annual Transport and Power Vote to meet the difference between the rent paid and the economic rent.  The economic rents are calculated on the full cost of construction after deduction of the equivalent of the normal housing grants available to private persons under the Housing Acts.  Provision is made in the rental agreements for inereases in the rents as wages generally increase thus reducing the amount of subsidy required.  In June, 1964, the rents were increased by seven per cent.  Tenants desiring to buy their own houses are encouraged to do so.</P>
    <P>In addition to houses provided by the company for rent and sale, 20 sites have been developed by the company for private construction of executive type houses and building has commenced on six of these sites.  A significant advance is the undertaking by a private builder of a scheme of about sixty three and four-bedroomed houses for private sale on a site provided by the company and this is one of the most encouraging signs of the establishment of a permanent community at Shannon.  However, the bulk of the housing requirements of workers on the Industrial Estate will have to be financed out of State funds for some years to come.</P>
    <P>The company have been authorised to purchase additional land in pursuance of their development plans as embodied in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> The additional land which also provides for planned expansion beyond 1970 will be used for the building of houses, a town centre (commercial and shopping, civic and cultural and car parking), the provison of educational and institutional facilities and open parkland containing recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>The company are co-operating fully with the planning authorities in the co-ordination of development plans for the Limerick/Clare region in which Shannon plays such a significant part and the company's own plans will be dovetailed into the overall planning for the region as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> The success of the company&rdquo;s tourism promotion activities in conjuuction with other promoting bodies including Bord Fáilte, the Mid-Western Tourism Organisation, and the air companies is reflected in the increase in terminal air traffic at the airport in 1964.  The growth in this traffic more than offset the decrease in transit passenger traffic so that the combined total rose by almost 50,000 to 380,000, an increase of 13 per cent over the previous year.  New services on the Shannon-Paris, Shannon-Manchester and Shannon-London routes, the new transatlantic turn-round service being introduced by Trans World Airlines and increased frequencies by Aerlínte and other operators should also provide a very considerable fillip to the growth of passenger traffic through the airport.</P>
    <P>During 1964 the company's Mediaeval Tour and Banquet attracted 20,000 people, the great majority of whom were tourists, including North American visitors to Europe encouraged to stop over at Shannon.  So successful has the Mediaeval Banquet become that capacity at Bunratty is now nearing saturation point and the company has been forced to look around for other venues to cater for the overflow. The establishment of the Folk Village beside Bunratty has added greatly to the attractions of the Castle and 62,000 people visited the Castle and Folk Park in 1964.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for an increase from £2m. to £3m. in the aggregate amount of grant-in-aid which may be paid to the company. These grants provide for the running expenses of the company and also enable the company to pay grants to industrialists for buildings, machinery and the training of workers.  Grants paid to the company to 3lst March, 1965 amounted to £1,605,500.  In addition the company received £654,000 by way of rents and other income. £1,387,000 was used by the company for promotion and administrative expenses and grants were made to industrialists as follows:</P>

      <Col N="265" /> It will be seen that the confidence which I expressed in the continued I progress of the company when recommending the 1963 legislation for the approval of the House has been fully justified and that in fact it has become necessary to inerease the finances provided for in the 1963 Act earlier than was then contemplated.  The increase in the limits proposed is necessary to enable the company to fulfil its obligations under the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> The company must have adequate finances to proceed with its programme and it is accordingly necessary to promote amending legislation to enable these finances to be provided.  The outline which I have given of the progress made by the company to date affords ample proof of the continuing value to the national economy of the Shannon enterprise and I am convinced that the additional finances now sought will prove to be a prudent investment in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is general agreement on the fact thai the Shannon project has been generally a success.  It has not perhaps been a success quite in the way originally envisaged.  The project of establishing this company and developing industry there was thought of originally as a means of trying to preserve Shannon Airport, and particularly its terminal freight and passenger traffic, from running down as the transit traffic tended to disappear with the development of jet aircraft.  This was the original somewhat defensive approach. It quickly became clear, however, that almost without realising or intending it, this concern had hit on something that had a great potential.  As we have seen since, though despite the figures the Minister has given, up to this year, the terminal freight traffic has not developed as had been hoped, the development of industry and employment there, even though not using air transport facilities to as great an extent as was expected, has been encouraging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is generally realised <Col N="266" /> how substantial an enterprise Shannon is and it is only in looking over some of the facts and figures in connection with this debate that I realised fully what is involved.  If one takes into account the employment given at the airport by the airport activities themselves, and the employment in construction which is a continuing process at this place, the total number of people at work is something like 5 300. There are, in fact, only seven large towns in Ireland in which there are more people at work than in Shannon. In terms of employment, it has become the eighth largest centre, offering more employment than Sligo or Bray or any other town of that size.  It is encouraging to see from the figures the Minister has given that the growth of employment over the year 1964 has been moving even more rapidly than previously, with an increase of 800 in the industrial employment there.</P>
    <P>The housing side of this project did at an early stage give rise to difficulties. I would be interested to hear from the Minister whether he is happy that the supply of houses and accommodation has caught up with demand. At the beginning, although the very fact of launching this project showed imagination, this imagination did not run originally on the part of the Government to the provision of houses as well as factories.  I think the company realised this in the early stages and tried to persuade the Government that if they were to have substantial numbers of people employed, it would be necessary to have some housing there additional to that in Limerick or Ennis.  A long time elapsed, however, in regard to this housing project.  For a period there was a bottleneck threatening to hold up the development of industrial employment there. There are now about 450 dwellings available with about 1,200 people in them.  I should like to hear from the Minister whether he is happy with the position now, and that there is no longer danger of a battleneck in regard to houses.</P>
    <P>The finances of this project are extremely complex and not at all easy to understand.  There are, in fact, <Col N="267" /> four different methods by which the Government help to finance it.  One of these is the provision of a special grant by the Minister's Department in lieu of housing subsidies, which the Minister has referred to in his speech. This grant-in-aid, if I understand the Minister correctly, is the equivalent of the subsidy which the local authority would be paid for housing purposes.</P>
    <P>I am wondering whether we have yet reached the stage where it is possible to evaluate the Shannon project, its results and its costs, on the basis of comparability with similar developments elsewhere.  Owing to the fact that it is not a local authority itself and that those who are promoting and running it and building the houses are not in receipt of rates, owing to the complexity of the finances by way of share capital and two different types of grant-in-aid; and owing to the fact that it has developed rapidly it is difficult to evaluate the cost of the actual employment given.  Because some of the cost is in relation to employment not yet available, it is hard for anybody without inside knowledge to assess how costly this project is.  There is an impression that it is a relatively costly way to provide employment in Ireland and people have criticised it on this ground.  Personally, I would not be inclined to take that line.  A project of this kind which creates a new type of employment that might not have come to Ireland otherwise is worth paying something more for than would be warranted in other cases.  As far as I can judge from the figures available in the company's report and in the Minister's speech, it is not possible to be clear yet as to how this compares with the cost of industrial development in a traditional way in any town or village elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <P>There is one feature of Shannon which gives it an interest as an example for other purposes.  This company promoted its own development. It is unique in this respect.  I am afraid none of our local authorities has yet turned itself into a development corporation, just as our Government Departments have not <Col N="268" /> yet taken up the Taoiseach's call to become development corporations. Even less than Government Departments, have local authorities been able to adapt themselves to this new role so far.  The Shannon company is unique in the role it is playing in developing the wealth of this whole area.</P>
    <P>It is arguable that, in fact, although its problems are in some respects unique, it has provided a useful precedent for the kind of authority that might be needed and might be useful, if we are to develop our countryside, and particularly our areas outside Dublin, by means of the establishment of industrial development centres.  This is something which has been before the Government for a long time, and one would have thought that in view of the evident success of Shannon, the Government would have been sympathetic to this idea of development centres, would have taken it up and pushed it ahead, particularly as it is now, I think, three years&mdash;certainly two years&mdash;since the proposal to establish development centres at places other than Shannon was endorsed unanimously by a committee comprising representatives of the Department of Finance, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the trade unions, the Federated Union of Employers, the Federation of Irish Industries and the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>In fact, despite that unanimous recommendation&mdash;and there must be very few things upon which it has been possible to get such unanimity&mdash;the Government hastily referred it to another committee which after several years reported to the Government and the Government's first reaction to that report, which has not yet been published, was to say equally hastily that it would take a long time to consider it, This gives rise to the legitimate suspicion that the second recommendation has been made to the Government along the same lines as the first but that the Government are still not prepared to draw the logical conclasion from the success of the Shannon experiment and approve the development of industrial centres elsewhere which would help in the long-term <Col N="269" /> decentralisation which everyone would like to see but which we have not yet been able to achieve.</P>
    <P>One figure in the Minister's speech struck me very forcibly and I must admit it is a figure I find very surprising. When I saw it first, I thought it must be a mistake but it obviously must be correct, as it is in the Minister's speech&mdash;it is, the figure of £14 million exposts from Shannon. That is the figure which emerged from a survey conducted by Córas Tráchtála, and it was when I saw it in the Córas Tráchtála report that I thought it was a mistake.  Apart from that and from the work dane by the Limerick Junior Chamber of Commerce which compiled some extremely useful reports, no data are available from any other source, but it had appeared that the value of the exports was something of the order of £5 million.  It is certainly astonishing to find that it has jumped to the figure of £14 million which as the Minister says is more than one-fifth of the total Industrial exports of the country.</P>
    <P>I wonder is there anything artificial about this figure, taking it to be correct?  I know that one industry there is doing something with industrial diamonds.  To what extent, I wonder, is that figure swollen by the high value of the input and output of diamonds, whereas the value of the percentage added at Shannon might not be all that great?  I wonder if the Minister could give some indication of the order of magnitude of the value added or the net output of those industries, which is the only true measure of economic activity.  Figures of gross output and sales can be very misleading because of the enormous variations there can be.</P>
    <P>It is important to have some idea of how big a role Shannon is playing in our industrial activity.  This is something we may not get accurately from this figure.  The very fact that we have not had a figure until now for exports from Shannon is one of the more disturbing features of this operation. It is extraordinary to think that as regards one-fifth of the value of exports from our country, there are no statistics and we are in no position to <Col N="270" /> estimate them.  Unless somebody, either Córas Tráchtála or the Limerick Junior Chamber of Commerce, does a survey, we do not know what the exports are.</P>
    <P>One of the attractions of Shannon, as is pointed out to industrialists, is that it is a place where there is no red tape, no documentation, and you do not have to fill in any forms.  This is obviously a point of attraction and it is not a thing that we would like to get away from.  I would not wish to try to introduce red tape where we have in one instance managed to avoid it, but I do not think it is satisfactory in connection with the Second Programme that in respect of large elements in our exports, there are no statistics available, and that our export statistics as published in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> do not include Shannon, unless the goods in fact move in transit through Limerick, when they come in as goods in transit.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what progress has been made in this matter.  It is considerably disturbing, and not encouraging to any economic programme, not to have these statistics available.  Has any progress been made towards finding a solution which would not take away from the advantage of Shannon as a place where industrialists do not have to fill up endless forms but which would enable us to know what our exports are?  It is ludicrous at this stage of our whole economic development, which so greatly depends on our industrial exports, that we are the only country in the world which does not know what it is exporting unless somebody does a special survey from time to time.  This is something which we need to look at.</P>
    <P>In the case of some Irish industries, it is impossible to get any picture of the overall performance of the industry because of this problem of Shannon. I know of one industry where the output of a firm in Shannon is included in the output figures of the entire industry but not in the export figures. The result is that the figures one thus gets for consumption in Ireland are completely inaccurate.  Industries are in a position where they are not able <Col N="271" /> to evaluate their own contribution to the Second Programme because the information is not available.  This needs to be looked at and I would be very much interested to hear what the Minister has to say upon that point.</P>
    <P>One aspect of Shannon which is a little unsatisfactory is the reports from time to time that certain foreign firms have not been prepared to work with trade unions in the way in which employers in this country are used to doing.  It is understandable that foreign firms establishing themselves at Shannon or elsewhere may find some of our customs different from theirs but at Shannon in particular there seem to be several cases of firms, excellent employers&mdash;I do not think there can be any criticism of them as employers&mdash; whose attitude is paternalist and who in fact almost seemed to be prepared to overpay the workers in order to get out of having anything to do with trade unions.  This is somewhat unsatisfactory, and I wonder if anything has been done to encourage those firms to adapt themselves to Irish circumstances in which trade unions play an active, and in many respects, extremely useful role and to work with them and secure much better results as regards productivity than can be achieved by working against them.</P>
    <P>Those are the only points I would like to make on this.  It is a pleasure to support this measure.  I had some association with this project in its early stages and I am naturally delighted to see that it is a continuing success.  It is a fact that if any industry at Shannon gets into difficulties or disappears, as is bound to happen from time to time, this gets large headlines, which seem to be much larger than the ones it got when it came.  That, I suppose, is natural.  Any figures that the Minister has been able to give us for the increasing employment in the development estate make it clear that it is a success.  I would urge him to draw from this the logical conclusion and press the Government not to hold up any longer, as in fact they have been doing over the past two years, further industrial expansion by being unwilling, <Col N="272" /> for reasons not explained, to face up to the possibility of exploiting through the establishment of development centres the potentialities for industrial and commercial growth held by other areas&mdash;a method recognised in all the other countries where this matter has been looked into, especially in many European countries, and which have been recognised in this country by all the interests involved, but which the Government alone seem unable to see and unwilling to face up to.  The logical conclusion should be drawn from the success of Shannon, and I hope the Minister will persuade the Government to draw that conclusion very soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot pretend to have any very direct knowledge of this scheme, certainly nothing like the knowledge of Senator FitzGerald, but I agree with much of what he has said.  I was interested in the Minister's opening remarks, some of which were not only informative but exciting.  It seems to me that we have here a lot of experiment in what might be called State capitalism, or indirect State capitalism, which ought, if it is properly used, to prove extremely useful later on for the practice and experience of the future socialisation of the area and, one would hope, of the various successful factories built up here.</P>
      <P>There are some points on which I should like some amplification.  I notice the Minister said that the company is buying further land and I think he mentioned the acreage.  I would like to ask him, if he would not mind giving it, to give the full figure of the present acreage involved and the amount of the area that is to be added. I would also be interested in knowing whether any option will be taken on land outside the area which it is intended immediately to purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One frequently finds in this country and in other countries that fringe land goes up in value by reason of community effort which has nothing to do with the owners of the land at all. It is regarded as quite normal for the owners of land outside a piece of <Col N="273" /> community development to see the price they can expect to get for their land go soaring up and being quite unrelated to the actual value of the land or to any effort they have made to increase its value.  In other words, it is perhaps the supreme example in this country and others of unearned increments.  I wonder whether it has been anticipated by the company, as sometimes it should be anticipated, I am sure, by corporations and county councils, that where a community effort is very big, private speculators and private property owners collect large sums in unearned increments.  I should like to see this offset to some extent by allowing for options on property in further areas of land not immediately to be developed.</P>
    <P>I am a little curious about who owns that land that is acquired.  I think I am right in assuming it is the company in whom the land is vested and consequently the buildings built on this land belong to the company.  The company derives rent from it.  I hope I am right in assuming, therefore, that the concept of ground rent is wiped out in this area, that there is no such thing as ground rent.  If I am right in assuming this, this is a very sharp pointer to the rest of the country because one of the evils in this country is the concept of ground rent which continues despite resolutions at ard fheiseanna, county councils and various other bodies for the past 40 years deploring the general effect of ground rent.  I take it, in this part of Ireland, ground tents are unknown.  If that is so, I want to compliment the company on this.  I want to compliment the Minister on his presentation of the company and for the record he gives to us of the general community planning as well as the more specific planning of factories and commercial and industrial development.</P>
    <P>I shall not, unfortunately, be free to take the opportunity kindly given for us to go down next Friday, and see some of what is being done in this area.  I have not got first-hand knowledge of it but I would express the hope that what the Minister has said about general community planning will be developed and increased.  The Minister mentioned primary schools.  He <Col N="274" /> mentioned a recreational hall also.  I think he said, and I would be justified in assuming, there are other recreational facilities, apart from the public house which he also mentioned.  My hope is there will be sports grounds and playgrounds for children.</P>
    <P>We fail, very often, in our ordinary community development, to provide recreational facilities, playgrounds, swimming pools and so on at the same tempo as we do in regard to dwelling houses.  In Dublin we have fallen down badly in regard to matters of this kind.  My hope is that this again is an example for the rest of the country.  I hope the community planning at Shannon Free Airport Development Area will be continued in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>While listening to the Minister, I was reminded of a very exciting experience I had in 1962 when I visited one of the Dutch polder developments in the new town of Emmelord, which was started in 1942.  It seems quite astonishing to me that this piece of land, which came into being in 1942, should look as if it had been planned, designed and developed for 150 years.  Everything was thought of from the beginning.  It was very striking, in 1962, that you could find 20 year old trees growing because they had been set down in 1942 when they first began to develop this land.  I take this as one small symbol of the overall nature of comprehensive planning and design of which the Dutch are masters. This type of community planning could be followed here.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald made a suggestion that when we are developing on community lines in this way, we should go abroad and learn from similar developments in other countries.  I fully agree with him.  Holland is a country, above all other centres, from which we could learn a lot.  Holland has made wonderful community developments in its own territory, without grabbing from its neighbours.  It is really astonishing how successful they have been in the way they have developed for the benefit of the community at large.  I feel we could learn a great deal from the sort of community development that is done there.</P>
    <P>The scale on which they work in <Col N="275" /> Holland is of course much bigger than it is here.  The size of their farms is different from the size of farms here but their towns and villages are somewhat of the same size.  They have been much better developed than we have. When we develop a community centre, we should not have a row of shops, but we should have a very fine desiened shopping centre.  We should not be content merely to have houses thrown higgledy-piggledy but we should have a well thought out community centre right from the start.</P>
    <P>I hope this is what is being done at Shannon.  If that is an over-optimistic hope, I would like to make a plea for further development and planning.  We should take the opportunity, in this situation, of experimenting.  The community development, as Senator FitzGerald has pointed out, which is being carried out at Shannon could be extremely valuable to us in other parts of the Republic.  We should be very glad to salute the Minister and the company in having, so far, seized the chances offered and we should encourage them to go further.  They have had a marvellous chance of trying out and learning about community planning about which we are very far behind in some other parts of Ireland.  We are singularly ignorant in Dublin about community development of this kind.</P>
    <P>I am appalled by some of the so-called developments around the city of Dublin.  I hope we will not be content merely to accept the modern planning at Shannon but we will encourage people to take chances with regard to experiments, not only of their own design but of other free designs.  We should be prepared to encourage our urban and county councils to go down and learn from the mistakes that will have been made at Shannon and, as I said at the beginning, I hope we will encourage further experiment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to mention that I also had the privilege of visiting Holland and I saw the place, Emmelord, mentioned by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  Certainly it is the greatest example I know of community <Col N="276" /> development.  Apart from all the planning that was done, apparently the first thing they built was a clock tower and the town&mdash;or the city of the future, I suppose&mdash;will centre around that clock tower.  It is a remarkable fact that this place, which is a growing town now about 20 years old, is approximately 14 feet below sea level. It has been won back from the sea by the Dutch people who are masters of this technique.  I agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington that when it comes to community planning and development, the Shannon Free Airport area offers possibly more than any other place in Ireland.  We have already seen wonderful progress in Shannon because of the fact, I am sure, that the scope for expansion was unhindered by the red tape associated with development in other areas.</P>
      <P>There are a few points I want to raise with the Minister, and he may be able to give me details when replying.  I am wondering, for instance, what is the area of land surrounding this Shannon Free Airport area which is capable of the kind of industrial development and expansion which is under way at the moment, because if it is substantial, the general plan could be made out even at this stage, I think.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington once more indicated that vested interests in the immediate vicinity of this type of development are inclined to hinder expansion and to interfere with the possibility of worthwhile development. The Shannon Free Airport area is one place where these obstacles are almost nil, and I hope things will continue that way.</P>
      <P>The Minister surprised me when he mentioned the value of the exports put out from this area, particularly in relation to the total value of industrial goods exported from this country.  He has demonstrated that it is certainly a worthwhile contribution to our economy.  We must face the fact, however, that the development which we see under way now is not the type of development which was envisaged at the beginning.  At the beginning, it was intended to be a freight terminal, more or less, to encourage freight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> Now we see industries and enterprises of different types under way.</P>
    <P>What we have seen happening in the Shannon Airport area could, of course, have happened around the town of Ennis or the city of Limerick, as it has now transpired.  As I have said, at first it was hoped that it would be more or less a freight terminal, and that there would be fantastic expansion on that line, but that did not occur.  I should also like to mention that I think the time has come for some planning to be done in relation to Dublin Airport so far as the location of worthwhile factories is concerned. It seems that the only prospect for expansion is at Swords, which is some miles away from Dublin Airport, but I believe there could be some planning in that respect to encourage the establishment of factories nearer to the airport because there is a swing towards air freight and air travel.</P>
    <P>I wonder is the trend at Shannon the same as it has been in our other industries.  We know that the net volume of output from industry has fallen down to about four per cent compared with the 12 per cent some years ago.  Similarly the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> envisaged that by 1970 the number of persons at work would be approximately 1,330,000.  That would require an increase of approximately 12,000 per year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just wondering is the trend at Shannon Airport in relation to industrial expansion so far as net output is concerned keeping in line with the trend which statistics show in relation to industry in general. A number of people have left the agricultural industry&mdash;approximately 38,000 in the past few years&mdash;and only 1,000 have gone into the industrial side.  When the Minister is replying, I hope he will give us some idea of the possibilities in relation to Shannon Airport so far as the acreage available for this expansion is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have calculated roughly that it has cost approximately £2,250 to put each <Col N="278" /> worker into employment in this industrial development at Shannon Airport. I should be interesied to know whether the figure for putting workers into employment in industry in the remainder of the country is as high. Mine is an approximate figure, averaging out the details we have been given.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I think we should be disappointed by the fact that at Shannon we have not attracted the kind of industry which involves a high proportion of male labour.  At the moment the proportion of male and female labour at Shannon is 50-50 or thereabouts, which indicates clearly that the type of industry there is not on average heavy industry involving male labour.</P>
    <P>When the Minister gave the number of enterprises, the number of factories established, the bays available for hire or rent, he did not give the nationalities of the promoters which would indicate to what extent we have Irish enterprise and to what extent we have foreign enterprise there.  Such information, I believe, would give us an idea of the measure of attraction&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;this scheme has for outside interests.  I had the pleasure of visiting this place some years ago and was greatly impressed.  I thought it was certainly a wonderful idea and that there had been great achievement there.  I am sure any of us who will have the privilege of going there on Friday will be further impressed by the development that has taken place since then, considering that the number of people employed there has increased to about six times the number there some years ago when we visited that estate.</P>
    <P>The arrangement whereby a substantial proportion of the money is made available here for the building of factories or bays which can be rented is, I think, excellent.  I believe it is one that should be spread to other parts of the country.  At the moment, of course, some enterprising financial interests have actually built factories which are available for renting to manufacturers and various enterprises. This is a sphere in which the State could take a greater part.  We often notice at the present time the considerable <Col N="279" /> expense to which manufacturers are put in either repairing or renovating their premises, or even building new factories where the old building has become inadequate or outdated in relation to modern needs. I feel the State should step in still further, as they are doing at Shannon Airport, to facilitate people who are prepared to engage in manufacturing industries in this country.</P>
    <P>I believe, so far as the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is concerned, that this enterprise at Shannon Free Airport will be held up as an example of what can be achieved by planned development and careful financing, in the absence of impediments in relation to development which arise all too often in relation to these projects.  I think the cost of sites and the tax elements which enter into development, particularly when there has already been some worthwhile community development, are actually hindering progress.  It is difficult to envisage how a stop can be put to that kind of attitude because we have it, not alone in relation to industrial development and sites for factories, but in relation to housing in a far more acute state at the present time.  At the same time, we may have to consider introducing some kind of legislation which will ensure that progress and community development, in either the industrial or domestic sphere, will not be interfered with by vested interests which take advantage of the successes which have already been achieved by some of these enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to comparatively recent times, the only worthwhile exports we had in this country were cattle and beef.  It is good to know that this is changing.  Perhaps no single centre in this country has made a bigger or more rapid contribution to that change than the Shannon Free Airport zone.  For that reason alone, any support which this House, or any <Col N="280" /> member thereof, could give to the further development of that area is something well worth giving.  It is unfortunate in an undeveloped country of this type that we are often inclined to lend our eyes and ears to the kind of thing one finds on the back of the front page of the Sunday newspapers. If one were for one moment to accept that kind of thing, we would have no development at Shannon or indeed development in any other part of the country, either.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from the question of an export trade, which is a very important matter, there is today the very important requirement of having a team of trained personnel within a restricted area where, should it happen that one type of industry goes out of business or closes down, the expansion within that area would be capable of taking on the people who became unemployed and capable also of utilising the services of trained personnel.</P>
      <P>People coming to this country, especially industrialists, seem just to give us a call&mdash;something,in the line of going into a wake; going in and getting out as fast as one can.  As matters stand today in a rapidly changing world where time is so valuable, people have not the time to travel throughout the country and see for themselves what we as a people are capable of doing.  I feel any steps we could take to develop further the industries at Shannon would be steps well taken.  There should be examples of our own type of native industry which could be seen by those people who just come in and pay us a fleeting visit.  Even if they did not purchase, it would at least be a tremendous advertisement for us and people calling would see what we are capable of doing.  In the minds of many foreigners we have a pretty bad name which we do not deserve, because, when we go to other countries, we show our true methods and value.  We have shown that in England, America, Australia and other countries and we are quite capable of doing it in this country under proper direction and management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this modern age when air transport <Col N="281" /> is a thing of the present and definitely a thing, of the future, it is important that we should have at Shannon a much greater development and that it should be the show-piece of our entire industrial development. We should be capable of demonstrating there in limited time to foreigners who come along to see our country, either for business purposes or purely as tourists, what we are capable of doing. That is something which would contribute enormously in the long run to our whole economic structure.</P>
    <P>Nobody raises any objection at all as far as I know to people running out of the country to England, America or elsewhere to work for foreigners, but, coming from an area from which there has been an amount of emigration in the past, I have a different attitude.  I think it is a much saner idea to take these foreigners in here and let them see our skill.  That is a very important matter and we have no place more suitable for getting a scheme like that into operation than Shannon. Putting goods on a ship or a train nowadays is like going to Mass on a donkey.  Air travel is developing fast and we are overlooking that fact.  We are not sufficiently progressive at all in our attitude to this matter.  In a few years with the nature of present day inventions it is possible that the great bulk of our transport will be by air. In such a case Shannon is the ideal location for this type of development. Shannon should be a showpiece for all types of Irish industrial concerns, even if we lose money on it.  The money we lose now will pay considerable dividends in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the fact that such development at Shannon would be an attraction for tourists, as well as those passing through our country, it certainly would be a great boost to us as a people.  We are very much inclined to adopt the attitude that everybody else can do better than us.  It is only where these industries can be brought together where they can be seen in competition with one another that people get a clear view of what we are capable of doing.  After all, we can produce, I think, the best drink in the world.  We can produce a great many <Col N="282" /> other things if we go to the trouble. At this stage of our development there is no better place than Shannon to show to the world in general what we are capable of doing.  I certainly ask the Minister to have no hesitation whatever in taking every conceivable step he can towards developing that area as well as other areas in the west and throughout the country, and we will gain substantially from if.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his Department are deserving of congratulation for bringing in this Bill. The necessity for bringing it in indicates the amount of work the development company and the Department have done for Shannon.  It shows the success of their efforts.  The previous speakers and the Minister mentioned the various aspects of the work done at Shannon by the development company and I should like to refer briefly to two with which I am familiar.  They are the Mediaeval Banquet and the Folk Park.  Both of these are highly successful particularly the Mediaeval Banquet.  The Mediaeval Banquet attracted many people and brought thousands of dollars to this country. It has been acclaimed by everybody who went there and saw it.  I was there last weekend with some visitors.  While they were not able to avail of the Banquet because they did not book in time, they were able to watch it from the balcony.  They were amazed at the idea behind it and said that there should be some way by which it should be extended.  Obviously, of course, we will not extend Bunratty Castle, but it would be a good idea in other places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the Folk Park, I should like to mention something with which I am concerned.  There is an ugly building close to the Folk Park.  It is a co-operative creamery and it has become twice as ugly since it was developed.  The building of a new road there has made it very evident to the public.  I know that the creamery should be replaced by a modern building.  The development company are anxious about that, too.  Both are acting in good faith but each is suspicious of the other.  The creamery are snspicious that the development company are <Col N="283" /> forcing them out and the development company are suspicious of the creamery.  Anyway, the suspicion is there and if the Minister intervenes he might be able to bring the negotiations to a conclusion.  The removal of this ugly building would help the general appearance of the entire area.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington mentioned the fact that since the development of building generally there is a necessity for recreation grounds. There is an assembly hall and a recreatien centre for children in the early stages of development.  The mere fact that that has been thought of indicates that they have not been forgotten. I am sure that in any further development the necessity for suitable recreation grounds will not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister said that the development company was originally intended to promote passenger and freight traffic.  In regard to passenger traffic, as the Seanad is aware, there looms on the horizon the threat of Shannon being by-passed and there is the threat of American airlines flying into Dublin direct.  This is something which creates a scare at the airport.  If there is anything calculated to create alarm in the area of Shannon where there are thousands of people working it is that something will happen to threaten the security of their employment.  Although many Senators and the Minister might be satisfied that there is no likelihood of American aircraft being allowed to overfly Shannon, a mere statement does not satisfy the people who work there.  I am sure that everybody welcomes the statement of the Minister for External Affairs in the Dáil that nothing will occur in this regard in the foreseeable future.  The foreseeable future might be a short time.  I do not know whether people think the Minister for External Affairs can see far.  It is not very satisfactory to the people concerned and I hope that the Minister for Transport and Power will issue a stronger statement than that to the effect that these airlines will not be allowed to fly into Dublin Airport direct.  I think the reasonable solution to that problem, if it keeps on recurring <Col N="284" /> with those Atnerican interests is to say to them that if they turn their planes about at Shannon and they in turn make it a terminal airport, the Government will be prepared to make Aerlínte turn about at Shannon.  That would prevent any of those airlines saying that Aerlínte has an undue advantage.  I do not think the present procedure whereby Aerlínte land at Shannon and then continue to Dublin under the fiction that they are chartered to another company has been one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As the Chair has pointed out, the Minister did state that this development company was promoted originally to promote passenger and freight traffic.  I did think that anything that might endanger passenger traffic from Shannon could be mentioned. However, I am sure the Minister has a point and I shall leave it at that.  I would like to congratulate him, the Department and the development company on their very successful work at Shannon.</P>

      <P>I think we can all welcome the Bill as an indication that the Shannon development is going ahead, though indeed we can ask ourselves whether the air freight side of it is doing as well as it was hoped it would do in the early years.  We can ask whether the same amount of money spent in other areas would not have given the same boost to the economy.  What we can read from the success of the effort there is simply that if money and skill are put together and pushed strongly by the Government, with the very strong incentives and efforts to recruit labour which are a prerequisite for success, as is being shown in Shannon, this type of development can be a success in any one <Col N="285" /> of several other centres throughout the country.</P>
      <P>We cannot be over-happy about some aspects of Shannon.  I have got many complaints about the poor wages paid to female labour thare.  I understand from certain vocational teachers that the standard wage is about £4 a week for girls of 18 to 20 years, who very often have to travel from Rathkeale, Newcastlewest and places 30 to 40 miles away and find that the bus company takes 30/- out of the £4.  My information is that many of them are staying at home, feeling that it does not pay them to work for such a low figure.  It is a bit depressing that the female labour content should be so high because after all we are committed to being a family people and want to see the foundation on which the head of the family secures wages to provide for himself and the family&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we approach it in another way, £4 a week paid to a young girl of 18 or 20 is perhaps reasonable, if she is living on the job, but when she has to pay so much by way of bus fare and so on it becomes very poor indeed.  The prospect of travelling over long distances for people in that salary grade is not very attractive.</P>

      <P>I can never fathom why there was such insistence on spending public money on housing development there, because if we look to America and such places, we find that someone living 15 miles from the job as in Limerick or Ennis would be regarded as living on the job.  The expense has been incurred now and we have no option but to go on with the development of the community centre, but I believe it was a mistaken idea from the first and that the community development could have been directed from and associated with two or three neighbouring centres like Ennis, Limerick, Sixmilebridge or some others and would have acted as a real tonic to them.</P>
      <P>I see that it is proposed to erect a comprehensive school there, and again I cannot see any reason for that.  You have very good schools in Ennis, Limerick and such places and with the bus service available there, it would be quite possible for the students to travel that distance.  We were told in connection with the comprehensive schools that if was envisaged there would be a great deal of travel involved.  I cannot see any case that has been made for spending more public money on such a development there.</P>
      <P>Dr. Press of RSPS, one of the most progressive companies in Shannon, had some very critical things to say when he addressed the Engineers Association here last October.  I think the Minister has a copy of his statement.  The main grievance he had was the scarcity of technicians in the development of Shannon. We know that that is so and we are rather worried by the slow steps with which the Government are approaching this problem.  It is a very vital one for the success of Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No consideration of Shannon would be proper without reference to the hard-working and successful development associations they have there which have set a headline in regard to what can be done in other centres. What has been done there has not been a success just because of the airport but because of the money and the knowhow poured into the region, and if we <Col N="287" /> do the same in the rest of the country it will pay similar dividends.</P>
    <P>I do not think the ideal to which the Minister refers is over-dramatic if you look at the numbers involved.  A figure of 380,000 passengers last year is a long way from comparing with the tourist trade in the case of Dublin, Cork, or some of the larger cities.  In other words, proper industrial expansion here or expansion by firms here has still a much greater potential than Shannon is likely to have any time in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by the Senator McHugh was the question of the development of the airport.  He made a very worthwhile suggestion about tumabout. The Minister might very well see how that fits into his plans and his thinking for the future.  On a recent trip I made, the real hardship of crossing from America was forcibly impressed upon me.  You leave New York at 10 o'clock at night and arrive, getting the sun halfway across the Atlantic, without sleep at the start of a new day in Ireland.  It places all incoming passengers to a very poor frame of mind to enjoy the attractions of the country. They are looking at it through bleary eyes.  A turn-around at Shannon would make it quite possible to reverse that schedule.  This would mean that if you leave New York at 10 o'clock, you could be in Shannon at 12 noon Irish time.  If you had a different turn-about, you could be back again at 7 or 8 o'clock Irish time.  If you had a quick turn-round at Shannon, you would be back again in New York at around 10.30 or 11 o'clock that night.  That would make it possible to avoid losing a night's sleep.</P>
    <P>You cannot do that now, due to travel difficulties, if you run into Dublin.  If you have the turn-round at Shannon, the tourist would get into Shannon just ready for a night's sleep. This would attract very many more tourists to the country and they would have a very good first impression.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I wish to thank the Seanad for the very constructive and friendly way in which they discussed the Bill.  Senator Fitzgerald made a most constructive contribution for which I thank him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now to deal with the questions asked during the course of the debate.  First of all, I shall deal with housing. Housing requirements at Shannon are <Col N="289" /> now reasonably well advanced, and it cannot be said that Shannon development is being held up through lack of housing, although it is essential to make progress as rapidly as possible. While the financial questions associated with housing, as the Senator said, are complex in some ways, the company has given a once for all grant for each house equivalent to that made available by the Department of Local Government to those who build their own houses.  It has also been given a subsidy representing the difference between the economic rent, after all the calculations are made, including costs of site and development, and the rent that could be reasonably charged to workers and others who will live there.</P>
    <P>As I said in introducing the Bill, the rents are based on what these people can reasonably be expected to pay.  We have investigated the costs of housing, and having made a detailed examination of the comparative costs of building houses at Shannon and in and around Limerick city, I am quite satisfied that the costs are reasonable, allowing for the additional costs of site development and the actual character of the land on which each house is built and allowing for the fact that the houses that have been built and are being built in what is virtually a new community have to have certain attractions for workers.  They must be of a form of architecture which will be attractive to workers coming to live in Shannon and which will relate to the creation of what is an entirely new Irish community.</P>
    <P>With regard to subsidies paid, there again it is difficult to make comparisons with a local authority because the subsidy in the case of the Shannon houses is on a flat rate basis, whereas in the case of Limerick, the subsidies are based on a differential rent system. But if a comparison is made, an allowance is provided for the difference between the costs of building at Shannon and the costs of building at Limerick so it can equally be said that the subsidy is reasonable and is not excessive or extravagant in any way.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators asked whether the cost of developing the industrial <Col N="290" /> estate, when related to the employment of each worker, can be compared with the capital cost of providing employment in other areas of the country and in other circumstances. It is almost impossible again to make an exact comparison.  I think it can be said that having made the calculation in various ways, none of which is entirely satisfactory, the cost per worker does not exceed the average cost of providing a person with employment, as a result of grants received from An Foras Tionscal.  There are many ways of doing this calculation. One suggestion was that the cost is £2,250.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In particular circumstances, it might be £2,400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Some international agency suggested that even £3,000 per worker was not excessive on an average for giving employment in industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is not an excessive cost.  There is no element of luxury spending by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I think it will be found that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company comes very well out of the examination, if it is ever possible for us to establish some norms of calculation so that we can make a comparison with the cost of giving employment through other agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald referred to the question of the very high export figure from the Shannon Industrial Estate.  I understand that the Central Statistics Office are satisfied with the method of calculation.  Of course, when he refers to the added value to production as being the real method of calculating the value of production in this country he is perfectly correct. We have been accustomed to the ordinary conventional manner of assessing our exports, and calculating them in relation to our imports, whereas, in fact, if it were again possible to do so it would be better to express them in the form of the value added to materials and in that way we would have a better idea of the <Col N="291" /> effectiveness of each million pounds worth in the country.  The higher the labour content the more the value added, the greater the saving on imports and the greater the returns in exports.  Senator FitzGerald referred to the export of diamonds and suggested that that might swell our export figures.  No doubt it does.  I can only say that the total wage bill at Shannon varies from £2½ million and £3 million in the year and that in itself has some relation to added value and indicates the value of the exports from the estate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the wage bill in the estate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Senator Rooney asked whether the rate of expansion is below or above the national average.  I understand that in the best period, at least in 1964 and at present, the rate of expansion is above the national average at Shannon.  I hope that will continue and I hope the national average will rise.  This represents a challenge to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators referred to female labour at Shannon.  At present 1,538 males and 1,389 females are employed there.  The object of the company is to have a balanced community there. Having allowed for those who normally live in Limerick and Ennis and those who usually live at Shannon, the employment must conform to the requirements of family life in the area. It is desirable to employ as many men as women.  Quite obviously, there are some industries which lend themselves to air freight where the proportion of females may be higher than would be desirable in the ultimate.  I think the company have a balanced point of view in regard to that.  They are constantly looking for the kind of engineering industries which require male labour and they will continue to do so.  At the same time, when one reads reports about rural life in Ireland it is very important to consider the problem in this way.  It is a common feature of the Netherlands that the small farms exist through wages coming in in any form, either earned by the daughters <Col N="292" /> or by the sons.  It is very important to increase the incomes of small farmers by enabling some of their family, whether boys or girls, to work in an industry.  It is desirable to have as many men as possible employed but equally the money brought home by girls is of very great importance.</P>
    <P>I mention that because Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to development in the Netherlands.  When I was there, I found development which I think can be found also in Great Britain, but which is very prevalent in the Netherlands.  It is the extent to which people work a half day in industry and another half day on the farm. That is quite an unusual form of double employment.  One knows that there has been short time work for married women in England but the half day working is something of a novel character.  It has not been developed here to any considerable degree.  I merely mention that to show the importance of having an industrial community adjacent to a small farming community.</P>
    <P>Senator Rooney asked whether there were any Irish-based firms at Shannon. The answer is that the Irish firms are concerned with forwarding and warehousing services.  The remainder of the firms are run by foreign concerns.</P>
    <P>Senator Rooney and Senator Quinlan raised the question of whether we could not have started this kind of industrial estate anywhere, particularly at Ennis or Limerick.  Whatever controversy there may be regarding the desirability of starting regional industrial centres, this is a very special community.  The attraction of the Shannon Industrial Estate consists, first of all, in the existence of a customs free zone and, secondly, in the proximity of the Estate to the airport. No doubt handling is required from the factory to the air freight plane. One-fifth of the freight at Shannon comes from the Industrial Estate and there are firms there which completely depend on air freight because it suits their kind of business.  For example the piano industry finds it best to send heavy pianos by air because of the reduced packing and the low liability to damage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> A great deal of work done in this country is in the nature of speculative expansion, in the sense that we cannot be aware of what will happen in the future here or in any other country. Looking at the development of air transport in this country in the past ten years, I believe there will be a breakthrough in air freight.  I believe that with the new types of aircraft the cost of air freight will be reduced.  A time will come when more of the air companies will allot their most brilliant executives to the air freight business rather than to passengers.  Two or three years ago when I asked our own company to devote attention to this they turned over some of the best of their staff to the air freight business. To promote an industrial estate along such lines at the airport is a good thing because there is a great future for air freight.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the International Air Transport Association agreed to reduce transatlantic air freight rates. The air freight rates between New York and Shannon in contrast to those between New York and London or Paris were reduced.  That, together with special commodity bulk rates, affected Shannon favourably.  I hope that kind of change will continue to the advantage of Shannon.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to the payment of workers.  He corrected himself when he said what he really meant was that, although the workers might be paid trade union rates according to their years of service, some of them might be badly paid because of the long distances they had to travel.  Everything is being done to expedite the building of houses for family workers at Shannon.  I have pressed the company to go ahead with this plan.  I agree that in the case of some of these workers the wage is small when the bus fare is deducted.  Nevertheless, it is what might be regarded as initiating an industrial tradition in an area of the country where there was absolutely no employment at all.  I hope that girls will be encouraged to come to live at Shannon when there are community arrangements for them and that they will marry some of the men working there.  We hope to have <Col N="294" /> houses provided for them and, indeed, they are being provided for them.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan also referred to one or two firms at Shannon which had not accepted trade union relationship with their workers.  This comes of some tradition common to them in America, or whatever country they came from, and it is not unique at Shannon.  In other words, these firms have not had trade union relationship with their workers in other places.  It has been pointed out to them tactfully that they should accept the idea of trade unionism wholeheartedly.  We have not been successful so far in getting them to adopt that attitude but in all cases they have been paying wages above trade union rates.  Productivity in the area is satisfactory and I think it can be said that the trade unions operate successfully in the area.  I think they object to the attitude of firms which do not permit trade unions to operate within the factory.  Nevertheless, they understand the position and they have adopted a restrained and tactful attitude.</P>
    <P>What the future will bring I cannot say.  It would be wrong for me to intervene in that matter.  It is better left to commonsense and to the goodwill of everybody concerned.  Those in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company do concern themselves with the happiness of the workers, recruiting, training, and so on.  I do not think this constitutes what can be described as a serious problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington inquired about the Shannon Free Airport Development Company property.  Part of the lands was sold by me, as Minister for Transport and Power, to the Company and part was sold by private owner to the company in fee simple. Because of that no ground rents arose, or will arise.</P>
    <P>Senator Rooney asked me to state the number of acres that were to be acquired as part of the extension of the community area.  I would ask the Senator not to press me on that.  Some deals have been closed.  Others have not been closed.  It would be wrong for me while these negotiations are going on, to give the full amount of <Col N="295" /> the land.  The land is necessary to ensure the growth of the housing community and it will enable proper planning to be undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have enough land for considerable expansion.  We have enough land at present to envisage a community of 3,000-4,000 people living at Shannon.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington entered into a sociological controversy about the value of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company community work.  I do not intend to follow him along that line.  When speaking of the growth of regional centres, we have to remember that the Planning Act of 1963 is an absolutely socialist piece of legislation, involving thousands of private landowners who may not in many cases freely dispose of their properties.  This is part of modern civilisation.</P>
      <P>In the case of Shannon, there are no people in the area or in the community who do have the tremendously conservative outlook of people living in other areas.  This is an entirely new community run by absolutely first class executives.  I hope it will be one of the showpieces of Ireland.  I hope the standard of architecture will be as high as possible.  I have done everything I possibly could to ensure that the standard of architecture will be high and have advocated the use of colour where suitable to get away from that horrible dull grey that prevails in so much of the country in the housing areas.  I hope we will be really proud of the new Shannon town as it grows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add also in connection with what Senator Lenehan said when he advocated the continual growth of Shannon that, of course, the growth of Shannon is relative to the rest of the community in the area.  The form <Col N="296" /> of the community must relate to the future development of Limerick, Ennis and other neighbouring towns.  The regional consultant appointed by the Minister for Local Government and recruited through the National Institute for Physical Planning is in the area, and he will be presenting an interim plan to the Minister for Local Government in which he will make some preliminary proposals for the planning of the area, and in that connection will be examining what is happening in Shannon and making proposals as to the relationship of the Shannon community to those of Limerick and Ennis.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear to Senator Quinlan, who said that all the people of the Shannon Industrial Estate could live in either Limerick or Ennis, that I think he was not speaking correctly. One of the most difficult things which the directors of the company have had to undertake is to try to predict how many people in a growing industrial community want to live close to the place when there are towns adjacent. They have taken advice from many experts.  They have even brought over foreign experts who have gone to Shannon to help them in this very difficult work.  They have investigated the feeling in the community; they have studied the development of the town of Crawley in England; they have met Dutch representatives, taken advice from Irish architects and so forth.</P>
    <P>At the moment it is reckoned that about one-sixth of the workers will want to live at Shannon and the others will be content to live at Limerick, Ennis or the neighbouring little villages or houses in the rural areas.  That is the assumption, and I think it is fair and correct, but, of course, it is a matter of personal wish and it is a difficult thing to calculate.  The same thing would hold in any other area in the world wherever a new community was started 15 or 20 miles from other towns.  This calculation will have to be made particularly with a view to not trying to rival Ennis or Limerick.  This is a complicated planning matter in which the company, I think, is acting very wisely and sensibly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> Senator McHugh paid some tributes to the Mediaeval Banquets.  I am always delighted to hear that, because it was I who recommended that the Mediaeval Banquets should be held.  I also suggested the construction of the Folk Village, and might I add for the benefit of Senators that the historical experts now say that the Folk Village is going to be far more than a mere attraction to tourists?  The old houses are disappearing so rapidly that we desperately need a few folk villages around the country with all the implements, house decoration and furniture used during various historical periods, if we are to preserve as museum pieces part of our heritage.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan raised the question of a comprehensive school being established at Shannon.  The answer is that that matter is in the hands of the Minister for Education who felt that the growth of the Shannon community was sufficiently important and its relation to other urban areas such that there could be a comprehensive school there.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald asked me about the failure to provide proper statistics relating to the production at Shannon and in the rest of the community.  This is a very complicated matter and all that I can say to the Senator is that it is still being studied by the Statistics Office and I hope that good results will come from that study.  The difficulty arises particularly from the fact that it is a customs-free area and it was felt desirable to reduce paper work to the minimum.  The Central Statistics Office are studying the problem and apart from other considerations, the concerns involved are quite happy to cooperate.  This matter is receiving the most careful attention.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered every question that has been asked and I should thank the House again for their very favourable attitude to the Bill.</P>

With regard to the grant-in-aid provided for housing purposes, am I right in thinking this is under a different section from section 8 of the Principal Act and that in fact the provision is not exhausted and is not being increased?

      <P>The main purposes of the Bill are to authorise increased capital expenditure by the Electricity Supply Board for general purposes and for rural electrification, and to provide <Col N="299" /> for the continuance of State subsidy for rural electrification.</P>
      <P>Section 2 proposes to raise the limit of capital expenditure by the Electricity Supply Board for general purposes, that is to say, for all purposes other than the electrification of rural areas, from the present limit of £160 million, which was set by the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1963, to £225 million.  Actual capital expenditure is still far short of the existing limit&mdash;at 31st March, 1965 it was about £117 million but commitments entered into by the Board for additional generating capacity and for improvement of the transmission and distribution systems at that date were about £35 million bringing the total for expenditure and commitments to about £152 million.</P>
      <P>At 31st March, 1965, the Board's total generating capacity was 10009.5 megawatts made up as follows:</P>

    <P>Commitments entered into provided for the addition of another 400 megawatts by 1969-70.  These commitments comprise an additional 40 megawatts at the milled peat-fired station at Lanesboro, County Longford; an additional 120 megawatts of oil fired capacity at Ringsend, Dublin, 60 megawatts of which has just been commissioned, and the new oil-fired stations at Great Island, County Wexford and Tarbert, County Kerry each with a capacity of 120 megawatts.</P>
    <P>The additional set at Lanesboro is expected to be commissioned this year. The only further addition to turf-fired capacity possible with our present methods of bog development is a second generating set planned for Shannonbridge.  With the installation of further oil-fired capacity, turf is now beginning to decline in relative importance as a fuel for electricity generation. The year 1964/65 was a rather good hydro year and 25.2 per cent of our electricity came from water power; 31.7 per cent came from peat; 2.7 per cent from native coal and the balance of 40.4 per cent came from oil.  All the <Col N="300" /> best of our water power is already being exploited for electricity generation, and no further significant addition to generating capacity can be expected from hydro stations.  Indeed at the present high interest rates the hydro-electric development of the remaining few small rivers would be quite uneconomic.  It seems unlikely at present that a nuclear generating station will be economic in our circumstances for at least about ten years.</P>
    <P>Demand for electricity is increasing very rapidly.  This is, of course, a mark of expanding economic activity and of improving living standards in the country.  For the past four years, the increase in consumption compared with the previous year has been:</P>
    <P>1961-1962&mdash;7.6 per cent</P>
    <P>1962-1963&mdash;11.6 per cent (This was an exceptionally severe winter)</P>
    <P>1963-1964&mdash;6.1 per cent (This was a mild winter)</P>
    <P>1964-1965&mdash;12.9 per cent</P>
    <P>This represents an average increase over the period of about 9½ per cent and a total increase for the four years of about 44 per cent.  During these four years consumption for motive power increased by 38 per cent, for domestic purposes by 46 per cent and for all other purposes by 47 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Board's long term plans related to the period of the Second Programme are based on an average growth rate of 9 per cent per annum, which is 2 per cent above the European average rate.  To meet expected growth in demand in the years after 1970 the Board expect, during the next five years, to have to approve the construction of 720 megawatts of further generating capacity estimated to cost £47 million.  This would bring total generating capacity to over 2,100 megawatts or more than double the existing capacity.  Further improvements of the transmission and distribution network costing an estimated £30 million are also expected to arise for approval over the next five years.  It is proposed that the limit of the Board's authorised expenditure should now be raised to £225 million.  Further authority will probably require to be sought <Col N="301" /> in 1969 to cover further expansion likely to arise for approval in 1970 and the following years.  The present North-South discussions may, of course, suggest some alterations and economies in the programme of capital investment in electricity generation and distribution equipment for which the Bill proposes to provide, but we cannot anticipate them.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill authorises the Electricity Supply Board to spend an additional £5 million on rural electrification, bringing the total authorised expenditure to £42 million.  This expenditure should for practical purposes complete the scheme, and as the completion of the scheme is in sight, I should like to give a short synopsis of it.</P>
    <P>A report on the electrification of rural areas was prepared in 1944 on the basis of experience in four trial areas.  It was estimated that if 50 per cent of the capital cost were given by the Government as subsidy, supply could be offered at standard rates of charge to about 85 per cent of rural premises, that 80 per cent of these or about 70 per cent of the total would accept and that the scheme would be economic.  To achieve this, supply was to be offered at standard rates to any premises, the annual return from the standard fixed charges on which would be at least 6.25 per cent of the capital cost of connecting the premises.</P>
    <P>By the time the scheme had actually commenced, capital costs had increased, but the ESB adjusted the figure of 6.25 per cent downwards so that connection of about 70 per cent at standard rates of charge could be achieved.  As, however, the more economic areas were connected first the loss to the ESB in the early years of the scheme was not great and indeed in the year ended 31st March, 1955 there was a profit.</P>
    <P>From 1955 to 1958 the ESB paid the full cost of rural electrification and this, together with increasing costs initiated a loss on sales in rural areas which has continued since that time.</P>
    <P>By 1962 practically all areas had had an opportunity to take supply <Col N="302" /> under the Rural Electrification Scheme. Under the 1962 Act, the Government provided a special grant of £90,000 to enable the ESB to extend the scheme on the original terms to some areas which otherwise would have been completely uneconomic and could not have supply at all.  In that Act the Legislature also authorised the new subsidy arrangement in respect of houses which had not been able to accept supply on the occasion of the initial development of the areas in which they were situated.  The subsidy, instead of 50 per cent flat, as under the initial scheme, became 75 per cent with a maximum of £75 per house.  It was expected that the new subsidy would enable the ESB without incurring any loss, to offer connection at standard rates of charge to about 70 per cent of those still unconnected.  The ESB initiated a planned post-development scheme which will cover the entire country by 1968 and at the end of which it is estimated that there will be about 340,000 rural consumers.</P>
    <P>In any case where the return from the fixed charges would be below the minimum percentage currently in force, the ESB rather than refuse supply, have been prepared to connect a premises if the owner was prepared to pay an extra charge sufficient to bring his return up to the minimum percentage. The minimum percentage return was not, of course, an economic return.  In fact it was well below the economic return.  This is the origin of special service charges in the rural electrification scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the present post-development scheme some 70 per cent of the houses to be connected can be offered supply at standard rates of charge and a further 20 per cent can be offered supply at special service charges of not more than 50 per cent of their normal fixed charges.  For a small farmhouse, a typical fixed charge without any special supplement amounts to about 4½d. per day and this together with unit charges compares favourably with charges abroad.  The remaining houses, which represent little more than three per cent of all the rural premises in the country, would <Col N="303" /> be so costly to connect that special service charges of more than 100 per cent of the normal fixed charge&mdash;very much more in many cases&mdash;would be required to enable them to show an economic return.  It is a physical fact that in rural Ireland where houses tend to be scattered singly over the country it is impossible to design a network which will enable supply to be brought at a moderate charge to every premises, and the ESB have had to design the network as best they could to cater for those prepared to accept supply when it was offered.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure on rural electrification up to the end of April this year was £36½ million.  It is expected that the statutory limit of £37 million will be reached in July and that the extra cost of completing the scheme, including the cost of necessary improvements to the distribution system, will be about £5 million.  Section 6 of the Bill proposes, therefore, that the ESB should be authorised to incur expenditure up to £42 million, that is, an additional £5 million, on the rural electrification scheme.  The degree of rural electrification which will by 1968 have been achieved, 90 per cent, compares favourably with other European countries in a similar state of economic development. Electricity has been persistently demanded by rural dwellers and the Government have gone as far as reasonably practicable to ensure that that demand is met.  It is now our hope that those for whom the service has been provided at such substantial cost will recognise and exploit its many potentialities for increasing their productivity and improving their incomes.</P>
    <P>The total loss on rural consumers for the year ended 31st March, 1964, the last for which the accounts have been published, was £900,000 and it is expected that when the present post-development scheme is completed in 1968 it will be about £1.2 million per annum.  This loss is in practice made good mainly from the surplus revenue from urban domestic consumers.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the continuation of the present rural electrification <Col N="304" /> subsidy until the limit of £42 million is reached.  By then it is expected that the total State subsidy for rural electrification will have exceeded £12 million. The time limit of five years from the 17th April, 1962, for payment of subsidy is being dropped because it will take until 1968 before the post-development scheme can be completed in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention, at this point, that the ESB are covering the country with the post-development scheme in an orderly fashion, just as they completed original development in an orderly fashion.  This is necessary so that new connections may be made as cheaply as possible and the charges which the new consumers must pay kept to a minimum.  If particular houses or areas were taken out of turn, the scheme would be disrupted and the cost of making connections would increase with resulting increases in charges.  The ESB local office is now usually in a position to inform interested parties about when the turn of any particular area will come around.</P>
    <P>The consumption of electricity per consumer in rural areas has increased by 30 per cent approximately since 1960-61.  The use of electricity for farm production is illustrated by the following percentage increases in the numbers of electrically-operated equipment since 1959:</P>

    <P>Sections 3, 4 and 5 are included in the Bill for the purpose of bringing the ESB into line with the State <Col N="305" /> companies covered by the State Guarantees Acts, 1954 and 1964. These sections will enable the ESB to borrow and the Minister for Finance to guarantee their borrowings in currencies other than Irish currency. Section 3 establishes the method of calculating the equivalent in Irish currency of borrowings in foreign currency.  The rules for conversion follow those in the State Guarantees (Amendment) Act, 1964.  Such conversion is necessary to determine the value of the Board's borrowings for the purpose of section 2 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1954, which is the basis for Parliamentary control of the capital expenditure of the ESB.  Section 4 is the section extending the power of the ESB to borrow, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport and Power, to include borrowing in foreign currencies.  Section 5 extends the temporary borrowing powers of the ESB to include borrowing in foreign currencies.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill is merely to give explicit sanction to a clause in the superannuation scheme for full-time members of the Board of the ESB whereby any dispute as to the applicability of the scheme or the amount of superannuation granted is decided by the Minister for Finance and his decision is final.  While the clause does not conflict with any existing legislation it is thought better to regularise it by a provision in the parent statute.  The Turf Development Act, 1953, has such a provision in respect of the superannuation scheme for full-time members of the Board of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend this Bill to the House.  The Electricity Supply Board are one of the most effective of our State-sponsored bodies.  They have always maintained a high standard of service and have in no small measure contributed to the economic progress of the country.  The enactment of the Bill will enable the Board to continue their service to the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is fortunate in that the Bills which he has brought to this House in the <Col N="306" /> brief time since I joined it have been uncontroversial Bills which have received a warm welcome.  This is true of this Bill as it was of the others we have had before us.</P>
      <P>In the discussion on an earlier Bill a fortnight ago relating to turf development, I raised some questions and the Minister, in replying, did advert to some of the points I made.  I used the word &ldquo;advert&rdquo; with deliberation as I am not sure that he answered them.</P>
      <P>I should like to return to a major issue I raised then and also as I think I am entitled to do now to broaden it somewhat.  In that debate I raised the question of the appropriateness of charging the electricity consumer with the cost of the turf development programme, the further development of which was to be financed by that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that we are talking about the ESB, one can include a further social activity with the cost of which the ESB are charged, that is, rual electrification.  I think I mentioned on the previous occasion that the extra cost to the ESB consumers arising from the turf development programme is something of the order of £1,000,000 to £1,250,000 per year.  The loss on rural electrification is running at £800,000 or £900,000 but the cost of it has to be borne by the non-rural consumer.  Taking these two together then, the total increase in the cost of electricity to the non-rural consumer, as a result of these two social activities which he is called upon to finance, exceeds £2 million per year.  In other words, the cost of electricity to these consumers is, on average, increased by something over ten per cent.  If these costs were not borne by the ESB but were charged to general taxation&mdash;as I think they ought to be&mdash;you could reduce electricity charges generally by ten per cent.  If the benefits of this were passed exclusively to the industrial consumer, whether State industries or private industries, who take about one-third of the total output of the ESB, it would be possible to reduce the cost of electricity to industry by something like one-third.  To put it the other way round, the Government's failure to <Col N="307" /> adopt such a policy and their policy of charging these costs in this hidden way is increasing the burden on the electricity consumer generally by ten per cent, or by one-third or more in the case of industry.  The cost of electricity to industry could be reduced by that amount if the cost of these social developments were charged to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned a fortnight ago, the Minister said in the Dáil&mdash;I think it was on the Turf Development Bill&mdash; that our electricity costs are comparable with and no higher than those in Britain.  In the debate here, I challenged this point and asked the Minister what were the grounds for this statement.  His reply I found somewhat unconvincing.  My experience of State bodies, both outside and inside, is that they make the best case for thgmselves from the public relations point of view.  I would not accept merely <i>ex parte</i> statements from the ESB as adequate proof that electricity costs in Ireland are the same as those in Britain but it may be that the ESB have some backing for this.</P>
    <P>Since that last debate, I have looked into this matter further.  Then I quoted figures for the year 1955 which I thought were rather disturbing in that they showed that only three out of 11 countries in Europe had an average electricity cost higher than ours and that we compared very unfavourably indeed with Britain.  Since then, I have had an opportunity to look into the British charges in more detail and I find that for a much later year, 1962-63, the average cost per unit in Britain was 1.58 pence as against 2.08 pence in Ireland; in other words, a quarter lower.  The cost in Britain varied a good deal from area to area.  The price was 1.370 pence in Yorkshire and in one of the most expensive areas in London it was 1.874 pence, which was still substantially lower than in this country.  The industrial rate in Britain was 1.342 pence per unit, in other words 15 per cent below the average rate.  These figures confirm the accuracy of the comparison for the year 1955 which I mentioned previously. <Col N="308" /> The figures I have given now for Britain and Ireland in 1962/63 show an increase of about ten per cent by comparison with the 1955 figure and I am sure the rates in the other countries have not changed radically in that time.</P>
    <P>It seems then that electricity in Ireland, on average, is substantially dearer than elsewhere.  Discounting Sweden which has an abnormal rate, our electricity costs were between 30 per cent and 55 per cent dearer than those in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Austria, Italy and the United States in 1955.  Our electricity costs were also dearer than the Netherlands and France.</P>
    <P>All of this difference in cost is not, of course, due to the turf development or rural electrification schemes, or to the Government's unfortunate policy of charging the cost of these schemes to the electricity consumer.  The small size of the country, and the small amount of total consumption involves the ESB in the use of small units which are uneconomic; but the fact is that the difficulties inherent in producing electricity cheaply in this country have been deliberately aggravated by the Government's policy of charging the cost of these social developments to non-rural electricity consumers.  I should be interested to hear from the Minister a fuller explanation of the reason why he stated in the Dáil that the cost of electricity here is comparable with that in Britain.</P>
    <P>If I have perhaps unwittingly produced comparisons which are false, I am quite prepared to be convinced of that, but the information I have now got from different sources seems to show the same picture.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said, in defending the Government's position, that there was no evidence that new industries had been deterred from coming here as a result of electricity charges.  That was the only point he made on that aspect, but the fact that there is no apparent evidence of this is not conclusive. Major industries do not even think of coming to a country like Ireland which is such an expensive <Col N="309" /> producer of electricity.  I know personally of one case of an industrialist who came and looked at the country but did not look very long when he discovered that the ESB charges were much higher than elsewhere.  So the mere fact that we are getting a stream of industries coming here and going away disappointed proves nothing more than the fact that they know, as everybody, I think, interested in industrial development knows, that this is not a country to come to for cheap power.</P>
    <P>The important thing is not so much whether or not new industries are being discouraged, but whether our existing industries are being impeded by the high cost of power and the high cost of the other basic requirements of industry, steel and transport.  In relation to these two commodities also, the Government have adopted the policy of making them dearer because they are not prepared to impose the cost of their social policies on the taxpayer, but wrongly impose it on industry, to the detriment of our economic expansion.</P>
    <P>The truth is, I think from all the evidence, that the Government still does not think in terms of economic expansion, in terms of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> designed to develop the country's economy rapidly by keeping costs down and making economic expansion easy to achieve.  Their thinking is still back in the 1950's, in the period of stagnation. They are still thinking in terms of redistribution of income to be carried out in the way least expensive to the taxpayer.  The Government's policy is completely out of tune with the whole thinking of the Second Programme. This is a basic problem at the present time: neither the Government itself nor many Government Departments are in tune with the Second Programme or really understand what it is all about.</P>
    <P>This is something which quite evidently is causing concern to the National Industrial Economic Council which last week published a report in which its &ldquo;concern&rdquo; was brought out very clearly.  I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> The need for steps to ensure that all departments of the public service and State enterprises play their full part in implementing the programme is reinforced by the priority given to the attainment of economic growth in the Second Programme.  The implication of this development and the need for a realignment of policies and administrative machinery may not be completely realised as yet in some parts of the public service and in all the State enterprises.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In our view, existing administrative arrangements should be developed and extended to secure a continuing overall appraisal of the policies and actions of the public service and of State enterprises, so as to ensure that they are in keeping with the objectives of the programme especially in such areas as manpower policy and... there is s clear indication of their concern here, I think... Policies which affect the level of casts of basic materials and services used by industry or agriculture.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite clear that the National Industrial Economic Council takes the view that the Government and Government Departments do not understand what the Second Programme is about and have not attuned themselves to the requirements of economic expansion.  The Council is concerned that there should be changes in policy and administrative procedures if we are to achieve the progress we should achieve.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>This will require continued development of the co-ordinating role of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>It also says that the Council should review progress periodically.  It adds:</P>
    <P>It is of interest that same commentators on French planning believe that some of the main obstacles to effective planning lie in the public sector... We quote these views to emphasise the fact that it would be best if such problems <Col N="311" /> were not allowed to arise here. French experience of nearly twenty years of economic planning suggests that when such problems do appear they can be very intractable.</P>
    <P>That is a good principle to apply to the Government here.</P>
    <P>Again, later on, the report comes back to this in another part.  It says:</P>
    <P>The experience of other countries where democratic economic planning is practised would suggest that paradoxically it is within the public sector itself that the guidelines which an economic plan provides are least often followed, and that targets&mdash; especially for capital expenditure&mdash; are most often revised.  Whatever the reasons for this, there can be no escape from the conclusion that an economic plan which is soundly based on available resources cannot succeed unless the public section obeys its precepts.</P>
    <P>It is quite evident from this that the Council is unhappy with Government policies, with the intractability of Government policies in this matter. Power is one of the most important areas so far as this question is concerned. I would plead with the Minister to think again about this matter and to take it up again with the Government.</P>
    <P>It is notable that this report was accompanied by a statement by the Government that:</P>
    <P>In so far as recommendations made in the report effect Government Departments and State agencies, steps will be taken to give effect to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for only one part of this but it will be interesting to hear what steps the Government are taking towards the realisation of the changes called for by the Council, and which are required if we are to make economic progress.</P>
    <P>There is one point I should like to put to the Minister in coming back to this question of power itself.  I mentioned earlier that, apart from the <Col N="312" /> problems off rural electrification and the cost of the turf programme, there are other factors pushing the cost of electricity so much above the level in Britain and other countries.  One of these is the problem I mentioned of the small size of the units of production, turbines and sets.  One reason for this is that the ESB has followed a policy of increasing its electric power capacity by a succession of small steps and not jumping ahead of consumption to any degree.  There are, perhaps, historical reasons for this.  If was in the fifties forced by Government policy, and most unwisely, to over-expand, and it has not psychologically recovered yet from the effect of Government policies at that time, which had such an unfortunate effect on the ESB finances for a period of years.  I have a feeling that the ESB may still be influenced too much by its reaction against Government policy at that time and the damage done by it, and that it is too much concerned to move ahead by small steps and to make sure &mdash;and this itself is a laudable ambition &mdash;that supply and demand be kept closely in harmony with each other. The policy of proceeding by small steps and keeping them m harmony and ensuring that at no time is there excess capacity such as there was in the fifties can, however, lead to raising the cost of electricity because all the individual units are so small whereas if the ESB were to decide in any given year that instead of installing a 30 megawatt or 60 megawatt unit it should should build a larger unit, knowing that it would have excess capacity for a year or 18 months or two years, the extra cost might be more than recovered by the reduction in the production cost in all the subsequent years during which the more economic units were used.  I would be very interested to hear from the Minister what has been done to study this problem.  Has any adequate economic analysis been made of the relative advantage of small or large jumps when you have the potential advantage of lower costs from larger units?</P>
    <P>In this connection the question of co-operation with Northern Ireland is very important.  I understand, in fact, that if we can achieve agreement with <Col N="313" /> Northern Ireland to integrate our two electricity systems this would enable both of us, perhaps, to double the size of the individual units introduced at any given point of time even if policy were not changed along the lines that I have been discussing.  That would involve significant economies in both areas.  In the short term there is no area in which such large practical economies can be achieved through North-South co-operation as in electric power.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he can foresee the possibility of some I agreement along these lines fairly soon, to what extent the ESB programme up to 1970 can be adjusted to gain the benefits of such an agreement by modifying their existing plans and introducing in co-operation with the Northern authorities larger units which would yield lower costs.  Will we have to wait, even if we get agreement with Northern Ireland now, until the next decade before we begin to reap the benefits of it because the time scale on which the ESB has to plan is so long that it may not be possible to change the plans at this stage?</P>
    <P>One final point concerns the clause in relation to borrowing abroad.  We have been told that these provisions are introduced to bring the ESB into line with other State bodies.  I would like to know whether, in fact, there is any intention to have any borrowing abroad by the Board.  I know that it has been done by Aer Lingus, very appropriately, because it is a substantial earner of foreign currency and has no difficulty in remunerating borrowings abroad out of foreign currency earned.  The same would not necessarily be true of the ESB and a policy of borrowing abroad might be economically less sound or less appropriate for this concern.  I wonder whether the introduction of these clauses suggests that the Government is thinking in terms of actually going abroad to borrow for the ESB, because this is something that we should know about if it were intended.</P>
    <P>Having made these comments which I think are not in any way critical of the ESB even though they are critical of Government policy, I reiterate that <Col N="314" /> this is a Bill which we all welcome on this side of the House and we are glad to see the ESB expanding its output in this way.  There was a period when the ESB was so influenced by its reaction against the policy of the fifties which led to over-expansion that at the end of the fifties and in the early sixties it failed to respond immediately to the recovery in our economy.  There was a time when there was almost a danger of having inadequate electric power because of their slow reaction in consequence of their reaction to earlier Government policy, but since 1960 they have responded and have revised their plans upwards again and again and increased the rate of growth to a more realistic level in tune with the kind of economic expansion we have been having and to which we can reasonably look forward.  This Bill is yet a further stage in this development. The Minister, indeed, indicated in his remarks that it is going to play its part in the continuing growth of our economy which we hope will not be interrupted by whatever economic difficulties lie immediately ahead of us.</P>

      <P>This Electricity Supply Bill follows the pattern of recent Bills of this type.  There is authority for extension of expenditure and extension of borrowing; there are sections dealing with rural electrification, and there is, as happens from time to time, a section dealing with superannuation matters.  On the occasion when an Electricity Supply Bill was last before this House I raised the matter of one particular superannuation difficulty which has arisen in the ESB, and on that occasion the Minister indicated that if a memorandum were submitted to him on this point, the point being the position of those under 40 when the superannuation scheme came in, he would consider the matter.  Since then I understand that such a memorandum has been submitted and that the staff and the Board appear to be in agreement as to what should be done, but I understand that no decision has been made in time for this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to discuss the matter at length, but merely to remind the <Col N="315" /> Seanad that the ESB had no superannuation scheme for 15 years.  A scheme came into operation in 1942.  Then men over 40 were given their prior service and those who were under 40 years of age were not allowed their prior service and have been at a disadvantage ever since.  They were given the doubtful offer of being able to purchase their previous service to pay for it.  If we remember this scheme came in 1942 at a time when there was a wages stand-still order, in the middle of the war, when these people who served the ESB during the heat of the day were people between 30 and 40 when the commitments of such officers with wives and growing children would be at a maximum, we can realise the reason why virtually none of them felt in a position to purchase. The position is that the Board are willing to pay whatever is required to give those loyal long-time servants of the Board their complete service.</P>
    <P>These officers will shortly be retiring. I do not wish to deal with this matter at length.  I do not even wish the Minister to tell us in his reply to this debate what he thinks of it, but I want to urge on the Minister that this is a matter which should not be postponed very much longer and to express the hope that when the next Electricity Supply Bill comes before the House the Minister and the Minister for Finance will have bean able to agree with the Board and the Board's officers on this matter that this is something which did discriminate against a particular class in 1942 and that this discriminiation should now be removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill but there are just a couple of small points that I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister. In his speech the Minister said that it was proposed to grant subsidies totalling £12 million for rural electrification and it is hoped to extend the service to some 75 per cent of our rural community.  The present system of levying the bimensal charge has operated from the start and no effort was made at any time to streamline <Col N="316" /> it or make it just or equal in its application to all.  I find that in cases where the Land Commission divide estates the unfortunate applicant who is granted the mansion or big house is virtually barred from availing of the rural electrification because of the exorbitant bimensal charge calculated on the floor area.  Surely in a State body it should be possible to have an upper limit fixed connected in some way with the acreage and the capacity of the holding.  I know of one particular farm in Laois of 25 acres where the bimensal charge annually was around £40, whereas the rateable valuation was only £15 on the same buildings.  There are lots of these cases.  Surely it is within the competence of the Board to come to some terms with those unfortunate people. I consider that a farmer who would not have at his disposal the use of electrical equipment is at a grave disadvantage nowadays.  The Board could come to some agreement or at least set up a top bimensal charge.</P>
      <P>I know of another similar case where there are 14 cottages built on the lawn of a mansion.  The 14 cottages together have a smaller bimensal charge than the one family living in the big house.  That is really a situation that is uncalled for, where people are denied the service that the State was subsidising to 70 per cent of the public. I find, too, that in many rural areas where it has been uneconomic to extend the connection those people are offered the ten years gas subsidy or some such scheme.  Now that the Board has almost completed the rural electrification scheme a last effort should be made to extend the service to every rural householder who applies for and wants it, seeing that the Government are spending £12 million on it.  An extra £1 million should go on, and I do not think that there would be that much of an outcry over it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has decided to bring in this Bill and thereby extend the service still further.  The progress made by the Board and their staff throughout the country has been remarkable and I wish to congratulate, the Board on its activities.  Coming from the constituency of Laois-Offaly that has many ESB installations, I feel <Col N="317" /> that I am in a position to see the ESB and its officers from very close quarters and I have only the highest of praise for the excellent service that the vast majority of those servants of the Board give to the public.</P>
    <P>There is one point that has been worrying me, and that is in cases where rural electrification has been in existence with some farmers and when they wish to instal perhaps corn-crushers or some heavier pieces of machinery there is a difficulty sometimes about the line capacity or the transformers.  I should like to ask the Minister if it is the custom that the customers have to bear some of the increased capital costs of providing heavier transformers in order to supply the farmers with sufficient voltage to use a grinder or some other piece of machinery?</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House any further.  I consider the bimensal charge very unfair in many cases.  I would again urge the Minister, and the Board, to set some upper figure and to relate it in some way to the acreage and earning capacity of the farmers. There are very small farmers with big houses and they are paying more for their electricity than are other men who are better off in small cottages or bungalows.  That is very unfair and it is something the Board should be interested in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator FitzGerald has said, this is a non-contentious Bill.  It gives us an opportunity to say something about the electricity supply in Ireland.  Most of what we have to say is in praise of the Board.  We can be satisfied with, and even proud of what has been achieved in this field in Ireland over the past 40 years by successive administrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some points of criticism nevertheless.  Some of them are minor and some of them, as Senator Fitzgerald has said, are of a major kind. They are not so much matters for the ESB as they are matters of general policy decisions.  There are minor failures with regard to the ESB because they have not so far sufficiently standardised fittings, plugs and sockets.  I do not know how many sizes and types are available in this country but there always seems to me to be plenty <Col N="318" /> of variety.  A single electricity authority ought really to be able to do something in this matter and to have improved it more than it has been.</P>
    <P>I agree quite frankly with what Senator FitzGerald has said in his very effective speech.  There is one point I should like to deal with, that is, what he called the over-production in the 1950s.  I can remember that being referred to when I was in this House earlier but it seemed to me then that there was exaggerated fear on the part of the people that perhaps the demand for electricity might not keep up with the increased growth of about ten per cent year by year.  I thought at that time that there was a bit of panic in that we might over-produce.  It seems to me Senator FitzGerald was trying to have it both ways, in recognising some justification by using the very word over-expansion in the 1950s and at the same time, deploring the state of fear which produced, perhaps, under expansion in later years.  We will have to recognise if we want to avoid under expansion and under production that we will have to accept what we might technically call a measure of over production.  In other words, it is betteto have too rouch available for a basic power supply than too little.</P>
    <P>There is another point which has not been mentioned but which I consider should have been mentioned.  I am sure the Minister is a person who will be concerned with this kind of thing.  Are we entirely satisfied with the aesthetic aspect of the new development in the power house at Ringsend. for instance, and other places?  Are we satisfied that Dublin Bay, the amenities of Dublin and the approaches to Dublin, are not being over-ridden, to some extent, by industrial squalor from the aesthetic point of view?  I recognise the necessity for the proximity of oil-burning plant to a deepsea port, and so on, but I wonder is it absolutely necessary to have the new buildings and the new power houses quite so objectionable. They are very ugly on the horizon.  We all value the appearance of Dublin and the appearance of the bay.  I am afraid that, on both sides of the river, and at <Col N="319" /> the mouth, industry is taking over in an unnecessarily ugly way.  I should like to hear the sympathetic response which I would expect from the Minister on this particular aspect.</P>
    <P>There is another question I should like to ask, although I am afraid the answer is likely to be less sympathetic. Has there really been established the difference in cost between overhead and underground cable for the main network throughout the country?  Is this so vast that we could not contemplate laying underground cable?  I realise that the underground cable, basically, may be considerably more expensive but I would also guess than the maintenance cost would be perceptively less than the maintenance cost of overhead cable.</P>
    <P>The aesthetic aspect enters into this also.  There is no question that if Ireland is to be criss-crossed with cables and pylons, we will lose something which is very valuable, that is, the scenic beauty of Ireland itself.  If the answer is likely to be less sympathetic than the answer to the previous point, that the difference in basic costs is so enormous, then, of course, we will have to bear with the unsightly pylons. Have we calculated, over a sufficient number of years, the saving in maintenance costs by laying underground cables, at least where feasible?  Perhaps it is feasible more often than we actually apply it.</P>
    <P>I am not clear as to just how the production costs of electricity are calculated.  For instance, it is obvious there are off-peak periods.  The ESB can be proud by reason of the fact that they were ahead of Britain in the launching on a large scale of the system of storage heating which is now being taken up in a big way in Britain.  The ESB were many years ahead of them in that.  This was based on the cuts there were for electricity in off-peak hours.  Again, I wonder whether the rates for off-peak electricity have not remained rather too high?</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether it would not be feasible and better to use the maximum in off-period electricity and so reduce <Col N="320" /> the cost for this type of electricity for storage heating which can be extremely valuable at least as background heating, not only for domestic use but for industrial use also.  I am not quite sure how the cost is related.  If in fact you have electricity you are not using, then it seems that if you are charging so much that it is not being used to capacity, you are losing money by-reason of the fact that you are charging too much.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald made a very strong case against the concealed subsidisation of rural electricity and of the use of turf far making electricity. He suggested, and I think it should be quite frankly admitted, that it should be a charge upon the taxpayers, not merely the national taxpayers but the ratepayers an rural development, rather concealed in an artificially high basic price for electricity.  I would suggest, nevertheless, that there is a distinction here between the necessity in our attitude towards rural development of electricity and the use of turf for making electricity, because however we subsidise it, there is no question that the production of electricity from turf, even though it be at the moment more expensive than from oil, is from the point of view of possible emergency in this country, of absolute basic necessity.  There is no question that if in 1939-40 we had the turf development and electricity production from turf that we now have, we would have been considerably less dependent upon outside sources of supply.</P>
    <P>If the analogy is not a bit far-fetched, I think in a sense it is a bit like the subsidisation through price of production of sugar from sugar-beet which, from the international point of view is uneconomic, but from the point of view of giving us our own national reserve from our potentiality for producing our own sugar, is justified.  The same applies to the production of electricity from turf if there is any danger that the oil supply might be increased in price or cut off completely.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am misquoting the Minister when I say that he said rural <Col N="321" /> electrification is being paid for largely from the surplus revenue from ordinary consumers.  That is not quite logical.  Why should it be to such a large extent the urban consumer who subsidises the rural consumer?  I think it should be a national charge.  If it increases the amenities of the countryside why should it not be to some extent an increased charge on the local ratepayers, and subsidised more generously by the taxpayers?  A very obvious advantage, as Senator FitzGerald pointed out, would be a reduction in the basic price of electricity which would affect the whole community. Similarly, with turf.  I would be in favour of Senator Fitzgerald's suggestion that if it must be subsidised&mdash;and I think it must&mdash;it should be done nationally through the nation's funds, through the taxpayers, rather than as a charge upon the consumers of electricity.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say much more on this Bill which is non-contentious, except to support what has been said very cogently and usefully by Senator Fitzgerald in relation to the necessity of keeping as cheap as possible the price of our basic utilities and services, power, transport and communications. It is folly to raise our postal charges, to make it more difficult to acquire telephones, to raise telephone charges and to raise electricity charges, instead of, artificially if necessary, keeping them as low as possible.  It is Government policy rather than ESB policy which is keeping them higher than they need be.  The warning gently issued by Senator Fitzgerald is extremely useful, and I should like to support him in it:</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Ronney Mr. Ronney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ronney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is more or less an enabling Bill to provide approximately £45 million extra towards the expansion of electrification and the demand for electricity.  We have seen that apparently the ESB have been a highly efficient and successful unit in our economy.  No one will deny the fact that electricity has made the greatest contribution to our industrial and economic expansion, and also towards raising the standard of domestic living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> The report we got this evening raises some questions in relation to the source of power.  We have seen that the power goes into the grid through our hydro schemes, our peat schemes, and a small proportion from coal and a large proportion from oil.  It seems from the report that the prospect for the future is that we must depend more and more on oil for the production of electricity. Apparently the possibility of obtaining further electric power from the hydro schemes daes not exist.  There are very few rivers or streams now which could be harnessed economically to provide electric power, mainly because this country has not the high mountains and large valleys which other countries have.</P>
    <P>Apparently we have harnessed all the turf areas also which could be economically developed for the purpose of providing electricity.  I notice in the report that it is possible that one more peat station may be established at the Shannonbridge turf area in order to get electricity into our grid; but it would be a very limited amount.  I wonder whether the possibility of harnessing tidal pressures has been examined I presume it has.  We have not got the type of fiords and inlets they have in Norway and Sweden and apparently the possibility of harnessing tidal power almost does not exist, so for the future, anyway, it seems that we must depend on oil until such time as we may be able to avail of nuclear power.</P>
    <P>At this stage I should like to give a quotation which shows very clearly what our prospects are so far as power is concerned.  As reported at column 879 of the Official Report of 15th June, 1965, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>With the installation of further oil-fired capacity, turf is now beginning to decline in relative importance as a fuel for electricity generation.</P>
    <P>The possibilities from the point of view of the hydro schemes, the peat schemes, native coal and anthracite seem to be exhausted, leaving only the prospect of getting electricity from oil or possibly from imported coal which, of course, would involve very high costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> I was disappointed to see in the report that we may have to wait another ten years before nuclear power may be a practical proposition.  I hope we will have it sooner than that.  There was some talk of co-operation between North and South for the purpose of setting up a nuclear power station.  I believe that idea should be explored. Taking all things into consideration, including the fact that we are now faced with the necessity of depending further on oil, it is possible that it may be found that we should go ahead even at this stage with plans for the provision of a nuclear power station paid for by the consumers in the North and South.  We had an example of North-South co-operation already in the Erne hydro electric scheme which enabled Northern Ireland and the Republic to co-operate in providing further electric power.</P>
    <P>We had some discussion here regarding the fact that the urban consumers are contributing heavily towards the losses incurred in providing rural electrification.  It is no harm to make the facts known to all the people in order to show them how they stand because, of course, the same situation applies so far as transport is concerned.  The urban community of Dublin city contributes very much more in the form of costs and fares than would be necessary for them to contribute but for the losses incurred in the rural areas in our national transport system.</P>
    <P>It was noticeable from the report that an increasine amount of electricity is being used on our farms.  That, of course, is associated with the decline in the number of persons working on the land.  In the past three years something like 38,000 fewer people were working on the land which means that whatever output was associated aith these people must be made up by mechanisation. We have noticed also in the report that there was an inerease of 98 per cent in consumption relative to milking machines.  Similarly, boilers associated with the dairying industry also increased by 77 per cent in consumption, <Col N="324" /> Grain grinders increased by 92 per cent.  In the rural houses we find the housewives have increased the percentage of electricity consumption by 79 per cent since 1959 in the use of electric irons and a similar amount in relation to electric kettles.  Apparently cookers have been considered too expensive. I would not mind washing-machines so much because not many people have them but, apparently, there has not been any significant swing-over to cookers in the rural areas due possibly to the cost of electricity in relation to them.</P>
    <P>It was significant to hear the case made by Senator FitzGerald which, in fact meant that this country is fourth in the list of electric costs, one of the other countries being Turkey, which is a huge underdeveloped country and would probably be involved in long lines of communication as far as electricity purposes are concerned and possibly also in very great development. Similarly you have the high cost of coal in Belgium affecting the price of electricity there, and you have it to some extent in Germany.</P>
    <P>However, we have noticed here now that the ESB have done a very good job in respect of electrification and that almost 90 per cent of the population&mdash;I think that is what it is&mdash;now have electricity available io them and the most expensive portion still remains to be connected.  They are the people in remote rural areas.  I feel. as has already been suggested, that it. would be too much for the existing consumers to pay for installation in the remote areas and it should be made a national charge.  We know, of course, that a subsidy is being paid to the ESB at the moment.  Arrangements were made to subsidise the ESB until 1967 but now it has been decided to give them a subsidy for a further year&mdash; up to 1968.  When we see a subsidy being made available to the ESB, when, in fact, at one time there was no necessity for any subsidy at all and when there was over-production of electrical power, I think it is only fair to suggest that it might be possible now for the State to step in, having regard to the high cost of the unit.  The <Col N="325" /> State should subsidise the extra cost of providing rural electrification for the remaining consumers in the country who must be facilitated.  Many consumers is the rural areas are paying heavy special service charges.  They had hoped that the day would come when the country would be completely covered by the network and that they would not be required to continue paying this rather heavy charge.</P>
    <P>It may be argued, of course, that the urban consumers could not possibly pay any more than they are at present but I do feel some scheme should be devised whereby this very heavy charge or penalty on same of the consumers could be abolished and that the charge could be levelled out, when it would be the same for one as another. So far as paying for the service is concerned by way of a meter charge, this is the basic method of applying a charge for the service as far as the ESB is concerned.  There is a feeling throughout the country that everybody should pay the same meter charge for electricity and that it should not be cheaper for one than another.  Most people who were obliged to pay the fixed charges in the rural areas which were based on the floor space of their farm houses and sheds felt that when the whole country would be provided with this service, charges could then be levelled out and no matter where you live you paid the same amount as a meter charge and the balance was paid in the form of a charge on the unit consumption.</P>
    <P>When we arrive at the stage that we can have nuclear power I think it may be possible to bring down costs on this basis which would seem to be the fairest basis for all our citizens considering that every man considers he should receive equal treatment with his neighbour and that the neighbour I should not have preference over him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find at this late stage in the debate that many of the points I had hoped to advance have already been put on record by other speakers.  As there is no advantage to be gained by repetition, I should merely like to say that I welcome the Bill as further evidence of the potential which <Col N="326" /> the ESB have in relation to the future of the country.  We can look back with pride on the achievements of the Board back to the early days of the State.  I regard the establishment of the Shannon Scheme a, a courageous and wonderful venture which we can now record with pride and glory for the courage and authority of the men who launched it.  It was with regret I noticed at some recent function where some large development was being celebrated &mdash;I do not know whether it was a mere omission or otherwise&mdash;that some of the men happily alive today who were at the initiatson of the scheme had not been invited.  I would suggest to the Minister that, if he has some capital works as well to perform in extending the operations of the scheme, he should favourably consider placing some concrete momentum for posterity in one of these schemes.  The ESB is now regarded by all sections of the community as an essential service, providing agriculture and industry with the necessary power and all the amenities that now have become accepted as an integral part of our society.</P>
      <P>I am glad to learn from the Minister that we now envisage the end of rural electrification and that we can see the date by which we will have provided, with the exception of a few, a service for all our rural community. This question of rural electrification unfortunately was not really tackled until after the last war.  If it had been embarked upon and had advanced to any extent before the last world conflict, it could have been done at far less cost and we should not have the problems we have today relative to the amount involved, in providing this service for the rural community.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with those who have complained regarding the imposition rural electrification puts on them and the awful cost of it to the rural community. But, if we were to apply that to all facets of administration, we would find some anomalies working the other way.  It is a fact that 65 per cent of the houses built under State subsidy were built in Dublin and the rural population have been paying in taxation for the substantial grants, perhaps inadequate in many eyes, given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> It is the same in the administration of the Department of Justice.  We find Garda stations closing down and we find increased demand for Garda services in the city of Dublin.  It has been suggested that the cost will be rapresented in the rates of the local communities in those areas.  No doubt the urban dweller would shoulder a share if it were suggested that the cost of the additional Garda services should be borne by increases in rates.  If we look into it we will find examples where the rural dweller is constrained to pay for services enjoyed by the urban dweller. If this is an example of where the urban dweller is called upon to pay something towards the subsidisation of an essential service in our society for those who are unfortunate enough to be compelled to reside in inaccessible areas, we should not grumble with it.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what success has attended the novel idea introduced some time ago regarding the provision of bottled gas in areas or regions where there is not an electricity service. Before I depart from the question of the financing of rural electrification, I should like to mention that the Minister said that ultimately a figure of some millions of pounds per annum might be involved in the financing of it.  Yet, last year the Government secured an income of £128,000 in turnover tax levied on the electricity consumers of the country.  So that, far from subsidising this service the Government are actually, taxing it. It is in the form of a sum exacted from industry and all users in the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether he is satisfied, in relation to the protection of our fishery interests, regarding the problems that have arisen in the matter of fish passes in some of the dams.  The Minister is aware of the detrimental effect the establishment of the Lee dam had on the Lee valley.  The points at issue between the interests involved concern the efficacy of the fish passes.  This is a serious matter and one about which I should like the Minister to appeal to the Board.  He should ask the Board to give sympathy and consideration towards overcoming these difficulties. <Col N="328" /> Finally, I should like to refer to a long standing grievance regarding the activity of the Board.  I admit, as I did at the beginning, the wonderful work the Board has done and will do for our people but there are certain matters relating to its activities that call for criticism.  I refer to the practice of the Board in coming into the retail trade, and taking the livelihood from some of our people in the small towns who are engaged in the servicing of electrical equipment.  The Board have a most unfair advantage over people who have overheads to meet which the Board have not.  Those people have not the machinery at their disposal to cover costs which the Board has.  These people have to meet increases in the cost of living, increases in rates, increases relative to the maintenance of their premises and the conduct of their businesses, but yet here we have a semi-Sate body engaged in the retail business to the detriment of many families engaged in business in our rural towns.</P>

Perhaps, Senator Sheehy Skeffington is right that the consumer is gaining but I do feel that the people who have overheads to face are at an unfair advantage in competition with the Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>One always feels a certain amount of diffidence in taking on an expert economist such as Senator Garret FitzGerald but I am bound to do it.  I do not think that Senator FitzGerald has done his homework on the question of the comparative cost of power here and in other countries. To begin, it is extremely difficult to compare electricity charges as between one country and another.  A study was carried out in 1962 and it was found <Col N="329" /> that with a wide range of industries the average cost of energy was 3 per cent of production.  I know that there may be industries where even if the cost rises to 3.1 or 3.2 per cent of the total cost of production it may be impossible for those industries to start. But, from what I know of the cost of production in industry generally, I can hardly believe that so slight a difference would have the result of preveating an industry starting.</P>
      <P>As Senator FitzGerald knows, there is a very wide difference in productivity as between one factory and a group of industries and the difference can be as great at 3 to 1.  He knows of the study that has been made in regard to that.  Those in which energy costs are 5 per cent of cost of production or more are non-ferrous metals, wood sawing and furniture, the vegetable oil industry and oil processing. In these industries a very material increase in cost here might affect their chances of operating in this country.</P>
      <P>Before I go further I might deal with the allegation anade by Senator Fitzgerald that, in fact, power costs more here than in other countries.  I have to rely for this information, at least to some extent, on the Electricity Supply Board.  I doubt if the Board would deliberately falsify figures or misinterpret figures or even give a strongly optimistic slant to figures when they were asked by their Minister specific questions with regard to cost of electricity here and in other countries.  We worked out the cost, the rates of charge per annum for our farms.  I do not think that I need go into this in detail, but it showed that for the 30 acre farm in this country and in three areas in Great Britain the average cost, the amount charged per annum for electricity, was more favourable here than in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, of course, it is true that British farmers get higher subsidies than ours because of the enormous availability of the subsidy there and the comparatively low proportion of resources in England devoted to farming and the high proportion of resources concected with industry and <Col N="330" /> the ease with which transfers can be made from one to the other.  Nevertheless, all the facts I could gather on that subject indicate that the charges are quite reasonable here.  I came to the conclusion that we are quite sincerely bound to try to make comparisons, to try to find some logical comparison between our charges and those of other countries.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald should be Interested to know that a group of expects of the Common Market countries attempted a comparison in those countries in 1962 but decided that the struotural differences made it impossible to compare them.  The ESB has made attempts to calculate a corresponding figure for Ireland.  This comparison is quite favourable to Ireland.  It has been difficult even to get full information on the basis upon which one can work.  As far as I can gather, to make a real comparison we would have to find a consumer of one supply authority and an exactly similar consumer of another supply authority. in 1962 an effort was made by the Common Market countries to compare average unit prices for domestic and agricultural consumers in those countries and the ESB calculated their charges to make comparisons possible.</P>
    <P>I believe that the ESB will act quite scrupulously in this regard.  From my experience of them I can completely believe them and that they would not try to put an optimistic gloss on their unit charges to make them appear mere favourable compared with other countries.  I am not going to read out all the figures for the benefit of the Seanad, because it would take too long, but I will give just one example of what is described as a medium domestic type of consumption, the unit charges expressed in pence for 1962 ware for Belgium 4.01 pence, Germany 3 pence.  France 2.72 to 3.67, Italy 3.24 to 3.57, The Netherlands 2.37 to 2.61 and Ireland 2.22 to 2.61, so that the comparative price in Ireland was reasonably favourable compared with those of other countries.  That is also shown in the comparison of prices charged to farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> As I have said, apparently there is no real way of making a comparison, but, nevertheless, as far as we can gather from all the examination we can make the price of power here appears to be reasonably satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Senator launched an attack on the Government suggesting that there is lack of co-ordination between the various officers and experts who are activating the economic programme for expansion or attempting to secure its success.  I cannot agree with him. I myself happen to know what is going on in the whole work of the Second Programme because my Department co-ordinates with other Departments, officers of my Department meet officers of others to discuss various matters where different factors are involved in securing increases in production, and I myself think that the Government is fully alive to the need for coordinated planning.  However, we canndt discuss that at length here tonight, quite obviously, but I should make it clear that I have had no complaints either from industrial development associations throughout the country, from prospective industrialists or promoters of industry, nor has a complaint come to me either directly or indirectly from the Industrial Development Authority or from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the cost of electricity is having an effect on the number of enterprises that are being initiated here.  That is a fact, and I know of one particular case where some years ago there was a proposal to start an aluminium factory.  I consulted some of the promotors of this factory and the prospective Irish directors and I said to them: &ldquo;If ever there is a question of a really big aluminium factory starting here you must come and tell me if the ultimate question is what would be the price of electricity, because there I know it could be a crucial factor.&rdquo;  I learned later that the project was not regarded as possible, but that it was not because of the refusal of the ESB to make a special charge for electricity or of my refusal to engage with the Government in a discussion as to whether under the circumstances something <Col N="332" /> should be done about it.  There were other reasons for the factory not coming here.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator FitzGerald that if I ever receive news of the possibility of large scale industrial development, something really worthwhile, the Government would consider it because of the importance of establishing large scale industries in this country, but as I have said I understand that the cost of electricity amounts to 3 per cent of the total cost of production of most goods with the exception of certain industries.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald has suggested the provision of some kind of operating deficit subsidy by the Government or the taxpayer so that the cost of electricity could be kept down, and he suggested that the taxpayer should be made to pay a general charge every year to balance the accounts of the ESB in so far as charges could be reduced arising from the use of turf and arising from the subsidisation of the rural consumers by the urban consumers. As I indicated previously during the debate on Bord na Móna, I utterly disagree with him on that proposal. I dread the thought of operating deficit subsidies.  I absolutely loathe the concept of them.  I accept every one that has to be accepted with the greatest misgivings because I believe that they are breeders of inefficiency. It is a totally different thing to provide the ESB with a capital subsidy once and for all to help it discharge its obligation to provide electricity in the country and to say: &ldquo;We will balance your books so as to keep the cost of electricity from going above point A to point B&rdquo;.  It would be appalling for the mentality of our people where the Government is paying out so much money one way or another, and we must be tremendously careful that we do not get people to believe that we can do things because the Government will jump in and pay the difference. This tendency to seek Government subsidy for everything is due to the necessary manifold injections of capital by the Government and to the payment of certain subsidies that are absolutely unavoidable.</P>
    <P>There is another way out of this <Col N="333" /> which I indicated before in connection with Bord na Móna.  It is the option to provide capital grants in order to provide sufficient capital compensation to enable industry to operate here economically.  It would be even possible for the Government to make some slight allowance in depreciation in connection with taxation to encourage industry if the Government found certain costs were excessive.  I would much prefer that kind of capital assistance rather than assistance by way of subsidy to cover a slight deficit. I am not going into politics about this to any great extent.  I think it would be advisable, perhaps, if I reminded the House that the Coalition Government cut off the subsidy on rural electrification in 1955.  It was restored by our Government in 1958 and the consumers of electricity are paying over £500,000 a year because that capital subsidy was cut off by the Coalition Government.  I need say no more about that.</P>

      <P>The Rural Electrification subvention is a capital subsidy and this makes a great difference.  The same thing is true in connection with agriculture.  I much prefer capital grants than paying farmers direct subsidies on their annual production based on any form of accounts that they present to the local officer.  There is a very great psychological distinction between one practice and another. I notice if you go into the more modern countries in Europe, on the whole, the people who run them agree with my view and that of the Government, that the operation of subsidies should be reduced to a minimum.</P>

      <P>At the moment the actual position is, in relation to rural electricity, that the urban consumer is financing the rural consumer to the tune of about £900,000 a year.  That kind of trans-subsidisation within a particular service is quite common in other directions.  It can be found in other industries.  It can be found in a wide variety of practices.  The taxpayer is paying at the moment on a capital charge, which will eventually disappear, £500,000, for the interest and principal in order that the capital subsidy may be afforded to the ESB of 75 per cent of the cost of providing rural electricity for the maximum of £75 per dwelling.  That is the actual position and I do not think I need say any more on this subject.</P>
      <P>I am absolutely certain that if industries had over a large number of years refused to come here because of excessive ESB charges I would have heard long ago about it and so would the Government.  There may be individual cases of which Senator FitzGerald has knowledge but it would surely have been ringing in my ears during the last four years if it had been important and we would have had to make a decision if the matter had become serious, as to whether we should ask consumers to pay more in order to finance industrial power.  There are different ways of doing it but the subject has not so far arisen.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked a number of questions.  The ESB has no power in law to standardise equipment in the form of plugs and so forth. When the ESB do installations they use standard plugs but they have no power to standardise the use of an individual type of plug.  I understand that Irish plugs and equipment are being used to a great extent by the ESB.  If this industry can be expanded they should be able to supply all the equipment necessary.</P>

      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to the development of Ringsend.  I do not think the area looks squalid but, nevertheless, I know what he meant when he was speaking about the general development in that direction.  This is a matter of long-term planning by Dublin Corporation. I understand, in connection with the industries contemplated in that area, this one way of overcoming the objections of the people who live in Sandymount may be the construction of a park with trees at a place which will hide most of these industrial buildings.  That is not my responsibility.  It is the responsibility of Dublin Corporation and the Minister for Local Government under the new Planning Act of 1963.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked about the difference in the cost between overhead pylons and cables.  I am afraid to say that the cost is between ten and fifteen times as much to lay the underground cables as by the construction of pylons.  I understand from ihe British Electricity Authority that in the case of some of the connections, where hugh quantities of power are passing, the underground cable could cost as much as £1 million per mile.  All I can say at this stage is that we will try to make an effort where some of the really priceless scenic areas of the country are involved.  One could not permit a pylon system of cable to go over the Lady's View at Killarney.  That would really be blasphemy.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that lower maintenance costs do not compensate for the difference in cost.  I have been asked about the off-peak rate for storage heating.  I asked the ESB about that and they claim they cannot reduce the cost any more. Senator Rooney asked a question about tidal power.  The ESB examined tidal waters around St. Malo and they also looked at a particular bay in Donegal.  They found that the drop in the rise of the tide is not sufficient to make it an economic proposition. Senator O'Sullivan objected to the Board selling electrical equipment.  I think the Board has to lead in this matter in the country.  It has to advertise the use of electricity.  By so doing it actually encourages more lively and energetic private contractors. I have had no complaints in this connection from any association abaut the Board's activities.  Probably the reason is that the Board make arrangements with approved contractors who are able to do the work well and offer hire purchase terma through collecting instalments as ESB accounts.  This is quite a bit of help to the private contractors, and I have had no complaints.  I certainly had an assurance from the ESB that all the appropriate overheads and incidental costs of selling equipment are charged to the equipment sales account.  They are not subsidised on that side of their activity.</P>

      <P>This section raises the limit to £225 million.  I should like to deal with some of the points the Minister made.  I found his <Col N="337" /> presentation of the figures in relation to the cost of electricity singularly unconvincing when carefully analysed. He pohrted out that three per cent is the average proportionate cost of electricity for industry as a whole.  We are not concerned with industry as a whole but with individual industries, and this three per cent is a smoke-screen rather than anything else.  It covers up the realities that lie underneath it.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave a comparison with Britain in relation to farms of 30 acres and said the average cost was more favourable here.  The second comparison he gave was with European countries in respect of domestic charges.  He said the EEC had found it impossible to make industrial comparisons because of structural difficulties.  That is not the issue. The fact is that we have a higher overall average unit cost than they have in Britain.  If the Minister is right &mdash;and I presume he is right&mdash;when he says that farm and domestic charges are not so much out of line, that only makes it more clear that the comparison in relation to industrial charges must be much more unfavourable. As regards the effect on new enterprises, I do not know why so much effort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>An Explanatory Memorandum has been circulated for the information of Senators.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm three (3) Orders, numbered 143, 144, and 145, made during 1964, two of them under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, and the Finance Aat, 1962, and the third under the former Act only.  It is a statutory requirement that such Orders must be confirmed not later than the end of the calendar year following that in which they are made, if they are not to cease to have statutory effect on the expiration of that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Order No. 143 provided for (a) the reimposition of customs duty on metal domestic ornaments, metal cuff-links and polyethene film, (b) removal of the customs duty applicable to certain paper felt and (c) the deletion of certain Notes to the chapter of the Customs and Excise Tariff of Ireland which deals with the duties on tools, <Col N="339" /> implements, cutlery, spoons aud forks. The need for these amendments arose as a result of the transposition of the old tariff to the Brussels Nomenclature form of customs classification.</P>
    <P>Order No. 144 was made by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Agriculture.  It provided for the imposition of a customs duty of 5/- per lb on all imports of certain preparations, derived partly from meat, and materials for the manufacture of such preparations.  The need for this amendment also arose as a result of the change in customs classification.</P>
    <P>Order No. 145 was made by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance.  It enabled that Minister to assign to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to the Minister for Agriculture, as appropriate, the power to issue licences direct to applicants for the remission of protective duties. Previously that power had been vested in the Revenue Commissioners.  The change was introduced as part of the effort being made to streamline and expedite the procedures for customs clearance.</P>

      <P>As regards the third item involving expediting procedure, I do not think anyone will do anything except welcome it and wish it had been done sooner.  As regards the meat preparations item, I understand from the explanatory memorandum that this is something that arose out of the introduction of the Brussels Nomenclature and that it is merely restoring the position that existed previously which was inadvertently changed in the change-over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording in the explanatory memorandum in regard to the first item is a bit different.  It says that these amendments arose as a result of the transposition of import duties.  It does not offer the same kind of assurance as does the explanatory memorandum in relation to No. 144-that there is no <Col N="340" /> change involved here in the situation that existed previously or that there is not any introduction of duty for things which were not previously subject to tariff.  It may be that this is simply the wording of the explanatory memorandum.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could give us an assurance that this is merely a tidying-up measure.  When the Brussels Nomenclature took effect an assurance was given at that time that the changes were purely technical in character.  I do recall, however, that some of the representatives of other countries here did not take the view that these changes were as technical as was suggested, and they felt that a little bit of tightening up had gone on in the process of these technical changes.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to say whether or not he can give the same kind of assurance in relation to No. 143 as exists in regard to No. 144.</P>

      <P>It used to be my practice when I was in this House before to speak rather a lot about these Imposition of Duties Bills. I am very pleased to find that, on the face of it at any rate, they have changed considerably for the better.  It is with very great relief, but not without a feeling of some suspicion that there might be something else around the corner, that I rise to welcome the provisions of these three Orders.  I see that No. 143 is simply for the purpose of bringing customs duty into line with the proposals in the Brussels Nomenclature. There is just one question I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary which arises out of the provision for duty free imports, that is, how licences can be issued ? I should like to know what considerations are taken into account by the Minister when he decides to issue a licence? I should not like to feel that some applicants would have access to duty-free import licences and that others might not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no comment to make on Order No. 144.  Order No. 145 is obviously a very good one.  It is for the purpose of simplification and it is a very good thing that individual Ministers&mdash;the Minister for Industry and <Col N="341" /> Commerce or the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;should have the power directly to issue these duty free import licences. I should like to put a question there as to the basis on which, say, character A would be given such a licence or that character B would be refused one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

      <P>I must thank Senator FitzGerald and Senator Sheehy Skeffington for their remarks on these Orders.  Like Senator FitzGerald, I have a rather suspicious mind myself and I spent some time digging through these Orders to see if anything was being put across me.  With regard to Order No. 143 I should like to point out, first of all, that the purpose of the Order is ratification of the existing duty on certain paper felt, so that we are actually removing a duty in one instance as well as restoring it in another.  This is because ordinary carpeting felt is not manufactured in this country and is, therefore, as a result of this Order, imported duty free.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other items, metal cuff-links and so on, and the duty-free licences on them, a lot depends on whether or not and to what extent the particular article in respect of which a duty-free licence is sought is made in this country.  So far as fully manufactured cuff-links are concerned, I understand that no licences for these are ever granted because they are manufactured here. A similar position obtains with regard to polyethylene film, unless documentary evidence is produced to show that home manufactured film is not available; otherwise the duty-free facility will not be granted.  In that connection I should add that most types of film are, in fact, manufactured in this country and, therefore, the volume of licensing there is very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Duty-free licences are freely granted for articles of brass and other metallics and also for metal domestic ornaments and wrought iron articles for domestic use but, here again, only on the production of the necessary documentary evidence that home manufacturers&mdash;which involves 16 firms&mdash;are unable to supply the goods, or reasonable alternative articles therefor.  The volume of licensino, therefore varies <Col N="342" /> with regard to the individual items covered by the Order, having regard to the home production situation in regard to each.</P>
    <P>With regard to the deletion of notes 5 and 6 which deal with metal tools and ornaments, I can only say that I have not read these notes myself and I am, to that extent, open to the charge made by Senator Fitzgerald that something may be slipped in.  I want Senators to accept my assurance that this is not so.  However, if the House would like me to look further into that, I should gladly do so but I do not thing it is of very considerable importance.  It was felt there was rather a contradiction between some of the paragraphs in the Schedule and that it would clear up the situation if these notes were deleted.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general suspicion that the change involved by the adoption of the Brussels Nomenclature may have been used as an opportunity for tightening up here and there, I think, as I have already said, this is something that only a wily mind could think of and might use.  If the House would like any further information on that, we can postpone the further Stages of this Bill until a later occasion.</P>

      <P>Subject to what I have already said that it also includes the abolition of a duty which was found to be unnecessary, I understand it merely restores the position to what it had been previously.  As regards polyethylene film, does this apply to all polyethylene film or merely <Col N="344" /> to polyethylene film of certain measurements?  I had the impression that it only applied to certain measures.</P>
