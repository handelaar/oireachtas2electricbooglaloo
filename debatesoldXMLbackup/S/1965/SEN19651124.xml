      <P>I feel I am interpreting the wishes of the House by departing from precedent today to refer to the passing of Mr. William T. Cosgrave, solas na bhflaitheas dó, which occurred since our last meeting. He was present at the birth of the Irish Volunteers and in the battle lines of Easter Week.  His long and distinguished career of public service, embracing the Dublin City Council, the Department of Local Government of the First Dáil, the leadership of the Government and subsequently of the Opposition, ensures him a permanent place in the history of our times.</P>
      <P>William T. Cosgrave and many others of that select and gallant company who blazed the trail to freedom will not be with us to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of the Rising but he and they will be remembered in our prayers when the trumpets sound the Last Post at the GPO and wherever Irish people gather on that historic occasion.</P>
      <P>May I ask you, a Chathaoirleach, to convey to his son, Deputy Liam Cosgrave and to the other members of his family, the sincere sympathy of the Members of Seanad Éireann?</P>

      <P>Throughout his long public life, which Senator Ó Maoláin has outlined for us, W. T. Cosgrave applied himself to each successive task which he faced with courage and with vision.  Naturally, his life and work carry different meanings, a different significance, for each <Col N="516" /> Senator.  Some of us here differed from him politically; others of us were separated from him by a generation. Yet, all who participate in the work of this Parliament are indebted to the man who was, above all, the chief architect of our democratic institutions. The fact that we can all join in tribute to him here today and the manner in which the whole nation paid tribute to him last week, provide the final proof that his work for Ireland was well and wisely done.  The best way in which we, as Senators, can acknowledge his contribution to national affairs is to imitate the manner in which he carried out his public duties, with diligence and devotion without the slightest hint of fear or favour, looking beyond the interest of any individual group and beyond the immediate needs of his own generation to the eventual establishment of a stable, prosperous and well-ordered society.  May his soul rest in peace.  May his life's work endure.</P>

      <P>It is right that we should depart from precedent on this occasion to express our condolences on the death of the former President of the Executive Council, William T. Cosgrave.  As the Leader of the House said, William T. Cosgrave was a courageous man.  He was willing, with many others, to lay down his life in the cause of Irish freedom.  I think we will remember him better, however, for his quiet courage in terribly difficult days and for persisting in his efforts to establish parliamentary democracy in this country.  On behalf of the Labour Party in this House, I join in this tribute and in the expression of condolences on the death of William T. Cosgrave.</P>

      <P>I should like to have the honour of being associated with this tribute to one of the great figures in our country's history.  I am sure the great majority of the graduates of the university which I happen to represent will wish me to speak on their behalf, and I know that I will be speaking on behalf of the religious minority in this country.  At a time of grave stress and strain, Mr. Cosgrave stood firm.  He preserved his integrity. He steered the ship of State on its <Col N="517" /> course for ten vital years.  In my opinion, one of the best tributes ever paid to him was by an American journalist who was present at the Treaty debates in 1922.  I quote from memory but what he said was something like this, when he heard Mr. Cosgrave speaking at those debates: &ldquo;This guy is a good guy; he tries to keep people together.&rdquo;  In a country much divided in the past, and still somewhat divided at present, one could hardly aspire to a better epitaph.  So I gladly offer this tribute to the memory of a great man,&mdash;all the greater for being a quiet, unpretentious man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Order is to increase from £6 million to £6,700,000 the maximum amount of borrowings by Aer Lingus that may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance under the State Guarantees Act, 1954, as amended by the State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) (No. 2) Order, 1964, and the State Guarantees (Amendment) Act, 1964.  Aer Lingus have arranged short-term borrowing in Britain to meet the final payments of approximately £1,250,000 on two short-haul jet aircraft already delivered.  This arrangement is subject to the issue of a State guarantee and £636,000 of the borrowing relating to one of these aircraft has been guaranteed under the State Guarantees Act, 1954, bringing the total amount guaranteed under that Act in respect of Aer Lingus to £5,993,000 approximately.  To enable a State guarantee to be given in respect of the borrowing for the second aircraft it is necessary to increase the limit of £6,000,000 to £6,700,000.</P>
      <P>The Air Companies Bill, 1965 which has been introduced in the Dáil provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for future borrowings of the air companies and for guarantees by the State of such borrowings so that the machinery of the State Guarantees Act will not have to be availed of in respect of future borrowing transactions by Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this proposal.  I think perhaps it is a pity that a copy of the Order was not circulated beforehand. I am aware that it is available in the Library of the House but it would be helpful to Senators to know what it is about because the title of the Order is not, to someone unfamiliar with esoteric details, very meaningful.  I wonder whether, in future, copies of the Order could be circulated beforehand so that we would not have to look for them in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has no difficulty in welcoming this proposal in so far as it relates to the financing of aircraft for Aer Lingus <Col N="519" /> in respect of their European services. One would merely wish to note that the proposal involves postponing payments for these aircraft and that this is something which seems to form part of the arrangements the Government have made to deal with the capital shortage.  I presume that the postponement of a payment of this kind &mdash; the Minister might say if this is correct &mdash; involves the payment of interest.  That is part of the price to be paid for capital shortage.  However, it is obviously the right thing to do to seek to make arrangements of this kind rather than to hold up a development which will be helpful.  The aircraft already purchased have, I gather, been successful and already have substantially increased the business of Aer Lingus on the routes this year. For that reason, I should like to welcome this Order and to support it.</P>

    <Title>Rules for National Schools: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Seanad would welcome a reconsideration by the Minister for Education of recent changes made by him in the Rules for National Schools.</P>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset, that, as the House will remember, I tried to raise this matter on the Adjournment and it was suggested that it would be better to take it in the form of a motion.  My only fear was that this would not be discussed within a reasonable time.  I should just like to start, therefore, by expressing my gratitude to the Chair and to the Leader of the House for allowing this motion to come forward within reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me, a motion is better than raising matters on the Adjournment, not only because it enables a wider debate to be held on a topic, but also, I must confess, because it enables me to say a little bit more than I could say if I were confined to 20 minutes, which I am afraid I shall exceed today. I hear a groan in front of me but I think it is due to the cold <Col N="520" /> weather rather than to the impact of my words.  The Senator has followed our brave example by putting on his overcoat.  I recommend the bravery to others, too, particularly if the Whip is put on in this crucial debate, because it hurts a lot more if you have not your overcoat on.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention also that the form of the motion, which, of course, I accept, is not quite the form in which I had put it.  I had said &ldquo;the recent changes made by the Department of Education.&rdquo; My reason for doing this was that I did not want to name the present Minister and I did not want to name his predecessor as being fully responsible.  Although I fully realise that the changes in the Rules were not, in fact, made by him, of course he is nominally responsible for them, and he has, since then, underwritten them completely in the Dáil.  Therefore, no injustice is done by saying he made the change though, in fact, the new Rules were signed by his predecessor in office, Deputy Dr. Hillery, on 22nd January, 1965.  They were printed, as the Seanad will remember, early in July of this year when there was not a newspaper to be had in Dublin and consequently there was not very much knowledge of the changes, really, until about a month ago.</P>
    <P>I think the Seanad will agree that the terms of my motion are moderate. I am not demanding that the Minister change everything or that all the Rules be altered.</P>
    <P>I notice, too, that although my motion refers to a reconsideration of &ldquo;the recent changes&rdquo;, it has been assumed by everybody that the only Rules that have been changed or that interest me are the Rules on corporal punishment.  These are the ones that interest me primarily, but there have been a number of other changes in the Rules, and I propose to mention one or two of them before coming to the question of corporal punishment for which the changes are, I think, particularly regrettable.  I find first of all, then, for instance, in Chapter 2 of the new Rules, page 11, that the 10th rule reads, and this is the form in which it was previously also:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> No child may be refused admission to a national school on account of the social position of its parents nor may any pupil be kept apart from other pupils on the grounds of social distinction.</P>
    <P>The original reading, from which this is an excerpt as it were, contained the words:</P>
    <P>... shall not be kept apart from ordinary pupils on the ground of the payment of school fees where chargeable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and so on.  Now this part is omitted in the new Rule, and it is rather a pity.  I regard the Rule, as it stands, as a good one, but the reference to fees here is omitted.  Does it mean that no primary school takes any fees or what exactly is the meaning of this particular change?</P>
    <P>I feel also that this is a Rule, a good rule, which is not always applied.  I have a strong suspicion that some of our national schools do, in fact, apply a test of wealth or poverty or social position before admitting children.  I see schools which are nearer to the homes of poor children being passed by those poor children on the way to a more distant school, for reasons that are not apparent unless they be grounds of poverty or social class distinction.</P>
    <P>I pass on then to page 12.  I notice the 15th Rule deals with the manager. The new Rule says:</P>
    <P>Every person or body of persons on first recognition as manager must give an undertaking in writing that the rules for national schools shall be complied with.</P>
    <P>I notice that this is a change from the previous Rule about the manager, clause 3 of Rule 14, which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Before finally sanctioning the appointment of a manager who has not been previously recognised as such, an undertaking in writing is required that the rules and regulations for national schools shall be complied with.</P>
    <P>You might say that, essentially, this is the same, but there is this difference. <Col N="522" /> A manager can not be &ldquo;sanctioned&rdquo; at all unless he gives an undertaking in writing that the Rules for national schools shall be complied with.  This phrase &ldquo;before finally sanctioning his appointment&rdquo; is omitted from the new Rule.  I do not think that is an improvement. I think the old Rule read better.</P>
    <P>On page 14 of the new Rules, I notice Rule 20&mdash;I want to make just an incidental point about this one&mdash; which reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister desires to urge upon the managers the desirability of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and then follow several good things &mdash;providing a small liabrary; stimulating the school children to greater industry by a system of prizes and so on.  I should like to ask the question why there was not included in this, since the Rule was being slightly modified, the desirability of urging managers to form parent-teacher groups or for parent-teacher meetings in the schools.  The Minister who actually signed these, and who came into the House when we had a motion here about the desirability of fostering the formation of parent-teacher groups in the national schools, Deputy Dr. Hillery, said then that he was in favour of doing this but that he did not think it was the function of the Minister to do anything about it.  I made the specific point that he should not order or command or demand but that he should take &ldquo;fostering action&rdquo;.  I suggested that he might issue in his Rules or circulars something which would urge the desirability of it, and I now regret that the opportunity has not been taken to change the Rule in this respect also.</P>
    <P>I feel convinced that the present Minister agrees with me on this because he himself, on several occasions, has made it clear that he feels that parent-teacher groups are a good thing, and that parents should be consulted. In support of this view of my own, I quote from an interview, details of which were published in the <i>Irish Press</i> in early May, 1964, which Miss Miriam Hederman had with the present Minister before he became Minister <Col N="523" /> for Education, and entitled &ldquo;Ideals of the Young Politicians&rdquo;&mdash; George Colley, T.D.  The question she asked was: &ldquo;Are you happy about the attitude to parents in educational circles in this country?&rdquo;  The present Minister's answer was: &ldquo;I certainly am not.&rdquo;  He went on: &ldquo;Would you mind if I quoted from my own speech in the Dáil here,&rdquo; and then he said&mdash; and this is a quotation within a quotation&mdash;&ldquo;In my opinion, a lot of lip service is paid to the primary rights and duties in regard to education.  I do not think it unfair to say that interest by parents in education is actively discouraged by the teachers, the churches and the Department.  I feel the Minister should take active steps to encourage the foundation of parents' committees.&rdquo; That was the view of the Minister before he became a Minister, the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>I feel justified in quoting from that, and in presuming that, now that he is Minister, he would still be in favour of taking active steps to encourage the foundation of parents' committees. This is one reason why I should like the Minister to reconsider these rules and regulations and to add, perhaps, at this juncture the desirability of certain things being laid before the managers, certainly the desirability of founding parent-teacher committees in accordance with the Minister's views, as stated before he became Minister. It was not his fault that they are not included in these old Rules but it will be his fault if he does not take action and not be content, as he accused others of being, with lip service.</P>
    <P>On page 18 of the new Rules I should like to mention what seems to me to be a marked improvement that might go even further.  It is in Rule 31 which says:</P>
    <P>Fifteen square feet of floor space should be provided for each pupil...</P>
    <P>This used to be 11 square feet and, as I have mentioned, the change is a distinct improvement.  It is, of course, linked up with what we found on page 23 at subparagraph (3) of Rule 44 which says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> A floor area of approximately 600 square feet is normally allowed for each classroom.  In special cases the floor area may be varied with the Minister's approval.</P>
    <P>Six hundred square feet, if you take 15 square feet per pupil, means that anything more than 40 pupils in a classroom are too many in the view of the framers of these Rules.  I should like to feel that this will be implemented, and that the Minister will no longer tolerate more than 40 in such a classroom, or in any one class.  I mention these points to indicate that some of the changes in these Rules are good and would, perhaps, merit further consideration from the point of view of wondering how best they can be implemented.</P>
    <P>I turn then to page 39 where I find a Rule which I do not think has been noticed by those who have looked at the new Rules.  It is Rule 71, subparagraph (3), which deals with the instruction to infants' classes and gives some indication as to the way in which Irish and the speaking of Irish should be encouraged in these classes.  I might say, as a linguist, it seems to me essential and admirable if you are going to encourage children to learn by ear properly that this should be done in the infant classes.  I do not necessarily mean by teaching other subjects through Irish.  I mean by encouraging children to hear and speak Irish early on.  Subparagraph (3) of Rule 71, however, says:</P>
    <P>English may be taught as an optional subject for one half-hour a day.</P>
    <P>It is rather absurd, in view of the linguistic situation in this country, to have official Rules which say, in a largely English-speaking country, that English may be taught as an optional subject for one half-hour a day, or may not.  I feel that this, too, is a Rule which would merit reconsideration or, perhaps, reframing.</P>
    <P>Another subparagraph on page 71 of the new Rules refers to a number of things which shall be made available. It refers back, in a sense, to a Rule which has been changed in the old Rules.  I refer to Chapter XIV, Rule <Col N="525" /> 121, of the new Rules.  What used to be said in the old Rule&mdash;and for the purposes of reference the old Rule was 95, section (5)&mdash;was that it was necessary:</P>
    <P>To keep the following tablets and pamphlets suspended conspicuously in their schoolrooms, and to make themselves thoroughly acquainted with their contents.</P>
    <P>This remains unchanged in the new Rules, except that one thing is left out. In the new Rules it is no longer necessary to have the rules and regulations of the Department conspicuously suspended in each classroom.  Would it not be a good thing if the Departmental Rules were hung in every classroom as used to be required?  The intention of the old Rule was that they should be hung up, though it was often in another sense that the Rules were &ldquo;conspicuously suspended&rdquo;.  The wording of the new Rule at subparagraph (7) of Rule 121 is:</P>
    <P>A copy of the Rules for National Schools should be retained in the schools and teachers should make themselves thoroughly acquainted with these Rules.</P>
    <P>The change here is that instead of having it so that children themselves would know under what Rules they are being guided, or the teachers in the classroom, a copy of the Rules is merely &ldquo;retained&rdquo; somewhere in the school.</P>
    <P>Having made these preliminary remarks about certain changes, I should like now to turn to the point which interests me primarily and, I think, public opinion primarily, and that is in relation to the changes in Rules on the question of school discipline or punishment.  I find here things which are very disconcerting.  This is Rule 130 on page 74 of the new Rules and, if I remember correctly, it was Rule 96 in the old Rules.  In the old Rules the first subparagraph of Rule 96 said:</P>
    <P>Corporal punishment should be administered only for grave transgression. In no circumstances should corporal punishment be administered for mere failure at lessons.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;grave transgression&rdquo; are <Col N="526" /> changed in the new Rules to &ldquo;serious misbehaviour&rdquo;.  I can only conclude that this is a widening of the scope to beat children, because quite clearly &ldquo;grave transgression&rdquo; is a far stronger misdemeanour than &ldquo;serious misbehaviour&rdquo;.  I notice that in a recent court case a witness for the defendant used the words &ldquo;serious misbehaviour&rdquo;.  It is quite clear that if a child can be beaten for &ldquo;serious misbehaviour&rdquo; and there is no longer a need for its being for a &ldquo;grave transgression&rdquo;, then the Rule dealing with corporal punishment is weakened. &ldquo;Grave transgression&rdquo; in the old Rule becomes &ldquo;serious misbehaviour&rdquo; in the new Rules.  The old Rule said:</P>
    <P>In no circumstances should corporal punishment be administered for mere failure at lessons.</P>
    <P>The second paragraph of the new Rule says:</P>
    <P>Corporal punishment should be administered only in cases of serious misbehaviour and should not be administered for mere failure at lessons.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully rightly asked in the Dáil: why do you not say &ldquo;must not&rdquo; be administered?  Even &ldquo;must not be administered&rdquo; is not quite so strong in emphasis as the old phrase, now gone, &ldquo;in no circumstances&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister whether he is wise to allow this to be thus weakened?  The second part of the old Rule remains intact.</P>
    <P>Only the principal teacher or such other member of the staff as may be duly authorised by the manager for the purpose, should inflict corporal punishment.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the old Rule have disappeared.  Paragraph 3 was:</P>
    <P>Only a light cane or rod may be used for the purpose of corporal punishment which should be inflicted only on the open hand.</P>
    <P>Here you have a Rule, a law or a regulation in operation which gives a specific instruction.  Now there is a fresh amendment to remove that instruction and there is no question but that you are, in certain circumstances <Col N="527" /> at least, permitting a thing previously prohibited.  In the Dáil the Minister was challenged on the point.  He was asked whether boxing a boy's ears constituted, under the new Rules, a breach of the regulations.  The Minister was forced to say that in some circumstances it would not.  He admitted teachers sometimes might be allowed to box a child's ears, which previously they would not have been allowed to do.</P>
    <P>The light rod or cane which used to be specified can now be replaced by any implement, though I recognise that the Minister has a safeguard because he talks later in the new Rule about punishment not being &ldquo;excessive,&rdquo; but <i>prima facie</i> this is a change for the worse in relation to the beating of children in school.  It is no longer necessary to confine beating to the open hand.  A child may be beaten on the body, the head or the ears and a ruler, a pointer or a strap can be used, all of which were specifically excluded before.  The other portion of paragraph 3 of the old Rule has also disappeared. It says:</P>
    <P>The boxing of children's ears, the pulling of their hair or similar ill-treatment is absolutely forbidden and will be visited with severe penalties.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes this disappear in the new Rule.  The prohibiting of the pulling of hair or boxing of ears is not in the new Rule and the Minister was forced to admit in the Dáil that there are occasions on which he would actually allow this kind of thing.  This is a very serious weakening of the Rule.  This is running away from the duty of the Minister in relation to the protection of children.  Furthermore, paragraph 4 has disappeared.  It said:</P>
    <P>No teacher should carry about a cane or other instrument of punishment.</P>
    <P>Now a teacher can do that.  That was a good Rule.  Surely no good teacher&mdash; and the majority of them are&mdash;will object to being prohibited from carrying about a cane, a strap or an instrument of punishment?  What good <Col N="528" /> teacher wants that?  That was passed over.  It is no longer there.  This would apply in practice only to a small minority but that minority can now parade before a school with an instrument of punishment.  That Rule has gone completely.  Paragraph 5 of Rule 96 has also gone.  It said:</P>
    <P>Frequent recourse to corporal punishment will be considered by the Minister as indicating bad tone and ineffective discipline.</P>
    <P>That, too, has disappeared.  One wonders what the pressure or representation was that made the Minister feel it necessary to do this.  The Minister suggests that what he is doing in the new Rule, or what his predecessor was doing, is adopting a &ldquo;more positive approach&rdquo;.  He says that the opening paragraph of new Rule 130 makes this clear:</P>
    <P>Teachers should have a lively regard for the improvement and general welfare of their pupils, treat them with kindness combined with firmness and should aim at governing them through their affections and reason and not by harshness and severity.</P>
    <P>All of that was already in the regulations. It is not new.  It was not in the old regulation 96, but it was in regulation 95, Para. 3.  It is all there word for word.  There is nothing new in it.  The Minister boasts that he is adopting a positive approach.  Yet this was already there.  There is one thing however added to the Rule, and I welcome it:</P>
    <P>Ridicule, sarcasm or remarks likely to undermine a pupil's self-confidence should be avoided.</P>
    <P>That is the only new element in the Rules on corporal punishment.  I have already mentioned the fact that the punishment can only be given by the principal teacher or other appointed teacher.  The fourth part says:</P>
    <P>Any teacher who inflicts improper or excessive punishment will be regarded as guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher and will be subject to severe disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> That is the only remaining safeguard. The child, to be protected under those Rules, must be in a position to demonstrate that the punishment was improper or excessive.  There is no definition or no guiding lines.  There is no guiding principle to indicate how the parents, the child, the teacher or even a court of law would decide what is improper or excessive in this kind of punishment.</P>
    <P>I should like at this juncture to give my own view on corporal punishment in respect of children, the beating of children.  One of my fellow-Senators, Senator Brosnahan, will remember&mdash; I think it was in 1955 or in 1956, before I raised this matter at all in the Seanad&mdash;that we engaged in a friendly radio debate on corporal punishment. There were two others with us, Dr. Reynolds, the Headmaster of High School Dublin, and Dr. Bob Collis.  Dr. Collis made a case against corporal punishment which seemed to me compelling, and I do not think I could put it better than the way he put it. Those who may not remember Dr. Bob Collis might like to be reminded that he was an international rugger forward.  He was not a softy in any sense.  He was not a man who shrank from physical pain.  He could in no sense be said to be a sentimental fuddy-duddy, but here is his case.  This is what he said.  I cannot guarantee to quote his exact words but this is the gist of his case.</P>
    <P>He said &ldquo;Girls should not be beaten at all.  It always has a coarsening effect on them&rdquo;.  I interject at this point that it will be remembered that I put a motion before the Seanad in 1956 for the modification of the rules on corporal punishment so as to prohibit altogether the administration of corporal punishment to girls in our national schools, and by eight votes to three the Seanad decided that the beating of girls should still continue to be legitimate.  The view of Dr. Collis was: &ldquo;Girls should not be beaten at all.  It always has a coarsening effect on them.&rdquo;  As to boys, he said: &ldquo;While I think it very often does them no harm, I think it never does them any good.  My brother Maurice and I went from Ireland to <Col N="530" /> Rugby School.  There we were beaten by the prefects, we were beaten by the form master, we were beaten by the housemaster, we were beaten by the headmaster, and he had an impressive tower at the corner of the rugby pitch where he did his beating. I do not think all this did us a bit of harm, though it did not do us a scrap of good, and this would be true of 75 per cent of boys.  The other 25 per cent, however, may well be damaged by it, and some of them scarred for life, and I do not mean physically scarred, I mean mentally scarred.  Furthermore, it is not always the toughest sort of boy who will suffer least.  Of all the boys he may be the most vulnerable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And he went on: &ldquo;I defy any teacher or any doctor, or any psychiatrist for that matter, to pick out from 100 boys the 25 per cent who may be permanently harmed by the infliction of corporal punishment.  Therefore, do not beat children.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is my view: I am not one who believes that every child who gets a smack or is hit is permanently damaged, but I am of the opinion that the beating of schoolchildren does no good and is a confession of weakness on the part of teachers.  I shall give in a moment or two some idea as to why this occurs, but in my opinion it does not do good and may do harm, sometimes of a permanent nature.  In relation to this my opinion is that the basic causes for the quantity of corporal punishment that is administered in our primary schools are two&mdash;over-crowded schools, and the presence in ordinary classes of a proportion of slightly backward children who cannot keep up, and the teacher is judged on his or her capacity to control and teach all those children in what are often utterly impossible conditions.  It is small wonder that many of them find themselves resorting to the disciplinary short-cut of corporal punishment, and I agree that most of us would do the same without necessarily feeling particularly proud of ourselves as we hit the children.</P>
    <P>I would contend&mdash;and I have said this before&mdash;that if we value justice and if physical violence is really <Col N="531" /> thought to offer a safe solution to such problems it should be applied not to the helpless victims of these conditions of overcrowding and wide disparity of ability in the classes, but to those responsible for the existence of such conditions and for their continuance. I feel that primarily we as a Parliament are responsible, the Government are responsible, the Minister is responsible. I do not believe that violence is the right method, but if you want it, it should not be directed against the quite innocent victims of a system which all too long has been tolerated in this country.</P>
    <P>Dr. Collis makes the point well that a lot of boys do not get hurt by corporal punishment.  It is sometimes said, and it was suggested in a letter to the <i>Irish Times</i> by my old friend Mr. Bithrie, for whom I have a great affection and regard, the other day, that boys sometimes enjoy the punishment and would rather have the punishment than do their lessons.  I am reminded of the occasion when George Bernard Shaw was lecturing to some group in London on flogging as a punishment, when somebody got up at the back and said that he knew of soldiers in the army who preferred to be flogged, and asked what the lecturer had to say to that.  Shaw replied: &ldquo;The title of my lecture was `Flogging as a punishment, not flogging as a luxury'.&rdquo;  If you enjoy being flogged, all right. There may be children who enjoy it, but I cannot feel that it is a wholly healthy recreation.</P>
    <P>I can claim to know a little bit about physical violence having boxed at welterweight for my university in the junior university championships many years ago, and I know that in boxing, where the object is, in fact, the use of physical violence, there is a very strict rule that you box somebody in your own weight&mdash;and he can hit you back.  If there is a disparity of as much as 10 lbs. between two boxers they are put in different categories, and nobody would think of putting a bantamweight against a cruiserweight, or a heavyweight.  When I see a 12 stone teacher not merely hitting a <Col N="532" /> five or six year old pupil, but having to use an implement to do it, my stomach turns.  If any of us was to see a big man in the street hitting a small boy on the head we would intervene, but our educational system permits a man of 12 stone to hit a little kid of six stone with an implement in front of other children.</P>
    <P>This leads me to a point I want to make, too&mdash;that very often damage is done, particularly to young children of five or six, by their having to witness other children being beaten by an adult.  It may well be something that they have never seen before, the use of an instrument by an adult to beat a child.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether it is a good thing for a class of 50 or 60 children to be allowed to witness the beating of a child by an adult.  I would hold that such a spectacle is a degrading one.  I would say that many children in our primary schools who may never have been beaten themselves have been emotionally stirred and, perhaps, scarred by witnessing big teachers hitting their comrades with sticks or straps or pointers or rulers.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote something on this which seems to put the case against corporal punishment in schools extremely well.  I do not want to quote it at length, because some of it I quoted before, but it is taken from an article appearing in the February 17th 1956 <i>Church of Ireland Gazette</i> by a primary school teacher, Miss Kathleen Heard.  She said this: &ldquo;The teacher must respect her pupils and show them that she does respect them.  She must not first demand respect from them at the point of the bayonet, or with that attitude.  When pupils see that she is worthy of-respect they will give it. Obedience and good discipline achieved by many rules and punishments will not, generally, last when schooldays are over, and I firmly believe that any corporal punishment, however mildly or reluctantly administered, is an evil thing.  It is degrading to pupil and teacher.  The weaker child will obey through fear and the `diehard' will always give trouble if forced to outward submission.  He will take it out of those weaker than himself and <Col N="533" /> is all set to be a `juvenile delinquent' when he leaves.  The `bend over' type of discipline, canes, leather strap, rulers and the human fist, are all weapons of war.  The race conquered by such means is naturally resentful. It is not a fair fight.  The children are not armed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>She goes on: &ldquo;Children must, of course, be trained in self-control, not temporary control from fear of the teacher.  Temporary submission is not self-control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The final quotation I would quote from her is this: &ldquo;Children always describe their teachers as being either quiet or cross as if they were bulls.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I contend that there is something wrong in an educational system where you find the children describing their teachers in such terms, and they do.  I feel that Miss Heard is right in her contention here.</P>
    <P>I should now like to recall an incident which took place when I had this motion down about the modification of the rules so as to prohibit the beating of girls.  This motion of mine remained on the Order Paper, if I remember correctly, for six months, or very nearly so. One evening I came into this House at 7 o'clock, a few minutes before the House reassembled.  There was one Senator here and it was Senator Miss Margaret Pearse.  She called me over.  She asked: &ldquo;Is your motion about corporal punishment for girls coming up this evening?&rdquo;  I said I really did not know, but that my hope was that it would.  I then pointed out that Senator Hayes was just coming into the House&mdash;he was the Leader of the House at that time&mdash;and that he could tell her the position better than I could.  She called him over and she asked him.  He said he was not quite sure, and she said: &ldquo;It is because of it that I have come back here tonight.  I do not usually like to come to the late sessions.  I am not as well as I used to be, but I have stayed in late two or three times now in order to support this motion.  I am not going to make a long speech,&rdquo; said Senator Miss Margaret Pearse.  &ldquo;I am just going to tell what I know.&rdquo;  By the time, nearly four <Col N="534" /> months after that, the motion finally did come up, Senator Miss Pearse was not well and was not in the House. However, it is significant that a Senator with her knowledge and experience and standing and sensitivity felt in this way about the beating of small girls in our schools.  I much regret that it did not prove possible for her to come and as she said, simply &ldquo;tell what she knew.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>By these Rules and by these new changes, the Department of Education are, in my opinion, moving backwards. I remember that, in 1956, the then Minister for Education, General Mulcahy, decided to make a very minor alteration in the Rules.  He decided to alter the Rule which said that corporal punishment shall be administered only with a light cane or rod by adding &ldquo;or a strap&rdquo;.  That is all.  That is the only change he made. The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 1st October, 1956, reported it thus:</P>
    <P>The use of a leather strap for the administration of corporal punishment in national schools has been authorised by the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>The rule on this matter, according to a circular sent to managers and teachers of national schools, has been amended so as to allow the use of the strap in addition to a light cane or rod.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Sunday Press</i> gave the same piece of news with a good deal more noise. The Minister, of course, was not a Fianna Fáil Minister at the time.  The Minister was General Mulcahy.  So you find big headlines in the <i>Sunday Press</i>&ldquo;Leather strap may be used by teachers&rdquo; and then, in leaded type, with an exclamation mark after it &ldquo;Schoolchildren!  In future, teacher may use a leather strap to slap you. And he is quite entitled to do so. In fact, the Minister for Education, General Richard Mulcahy, has given his permission.&rdquo;  A little bit later on, the <i>Sunday Press</i>&mdash;I am quoting now from the <i>Sunday Press</i> of the same day &mdash;states:</P>
    <P>A primary school teacher said yesterday that it is well known that the strap has been used in schools <Col N="535" /> freely for years.  `The inclusion of the strap, as well as the light cane or rod, in the regulations, now brings the &ldquo;outlaws&rdquo; within the law,' he added.</P>
    <P>And this, of course, is what struck many people&mdash;that the change in the Rules then was for the purpose of bringing the &ldquo;outlaws&rdquo; within the law. It seems to me that some of the present changes are due to the same reason.</P>
    <P>There is a failure, or a fear, on the part of the Minister and the Department to see to it that their Rules are applied and to see to it that the written undertaking of every school manager that he will comply with the Rules and regulations is fulfilled and it would seem, since his Rules and regulations are being flouted so widely and since this has been known to so many people, that he has decided that the best action he can take is to change the Rules.  If the Minister for Justice adopted the same method, what would be the position?  If it is difficult to deal with people making poteen, you might decide to change the law and to make it legitimate.  Then you could say that the number of cases of criminal activity in this field has diminished to nothing&mdash;because there is no longer any law against it.  Or take the breaking of the speed limit, for instance.  If you decide that there are far too many cases of breaking the speed limit then, according to the same reasoning, the way to deal with that is to double the speed limit and instead of 30 mph make it 60 mph in a builtup area and then you will be happy that the law is not being broken so often.  The suggestion of the person quoted in the <i>Sunday Press</i> is that the change was made to bring the &ldquo;outlaws&rdquo; Within the law.  I would ask the Minister to examine his conscience in this connection, and to change the Rules more realistically.</P>
    <P>At that time, something happened in Ireland.  There was a big outcry about the introduction of the strap. Many papers took up the matter&mdash; the <i>Irish Times</i>, the <i>Evening Mail</i>, the <i>Irish Press</i>, the <i>Evening Press</i>, the <i>Sunday Press</i> and, in a milder way, the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  The Schoolchildren <Col N="536" /> Protection Association protested with facts and figures.  I should like to say here that I regard them as an admirable and dedicated body of people who are prepared to allow themselves to be subjected to all kinds of abuse in the service of Irish children.  Although I do not fully agree with them on their attitude to corporal punishment, it is essentially respectworthy. They have claimed all along that what they wanted was that the Minister's Rules should be really applied.  Personally, I should have liked to see the Minister's Rule improved, to stop the beating of children altogether, or, at any rate, as a first step, to stop the beating of small girls. They have always held that the application of the Rules would be such a big improvement that this would satisfy them.  The kind of abuse they get for advocating this is such that I think it is time somebody in this House should protest against it.  The result, as I was saying, of all these protests was that the Minister changed his mind.  It was said at the time that he was a big enough man to admit he had made a big mistake.</P>
    <P>I feel it is easier, if you like, for the present Minister not exactly to say so in so many words, but to take steps to make it evident that he does not altogether agree with the changes which have been made and over which he has to stand if he is not to reconsider them.  In the <i>Irish Press</i> of 11th October, 1956, there are banner headlines &ldquo;Strap may&rdquo;&mdash;and, although it is in full headline type, they underline the word&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Not</i> be used by teachers&rdquo;. Then there is a subheading &ldquo;Gen. Mulcahy Changes His Mind.&rdquo;  The first paragraph begins:</P>
    <P>SCHOOLTEACHERS may NOT chastise children with a leather strap. Only a month after including the strap among the instruments of corporal punishment permitted, the Minister for Education, General Mulcahy, has changed his mind and revoked the Order.  He is to tell the managers and teachers that he is doing this because of &ldquo;misinterpretation and misrepresentation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This was upheld by an editorial headed &ldquo;The Strap&rdquo;, in the <i>Evening</i><Col N="537" /><i>Mail</i> of 11th October, 1956, which stated:</P>
    <P>The introduction of the strap has evoked strong opposition, and energetic &mdash; and well-founded &mdash; protests have flowed from many quarters. The latest official announcement, however, contains no indication that the Minister recognises the justice of such feelings; instead, it meanly apologies for his action by ascribing it to the &ldquo;misinterpretation and misrepresentation&rdquo; allegedly arising from his previous decision.  This sort of thing comes strangely from an authority which for years has tolerated a widespread &ldquo;misinterpretation&rdquo;&mdash;and misapplication&mdash;of its own regulations.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say further:</P>
    <P>Why the Minister saw fit, in the first place, to give the strap his blessing is still unexplained.  Everybody in this country, including the Minister himself, must know perfectly well that the strap is no innovation.  It has been used&mdash;in defiance of the department's regulations&mdash;by generations of teachers in many Irish schools.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Times</i> spoke in similar terms in its news columns on 11th October, 1956, under a heading &ldquo;Minister now forbids use of strap in schools&rdquo;.  It quotes Mr. David Kelliher, Secretary of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation:</P>
    <P>...said last night that at no time were the teachers concerned with whether or not the use of the strap was allowed.  They were aware that the use of the strap was a method of corporal punishment traditionally employed in many schools.</P>
    <P>Mr. Kelliher continued:</P>
    <P>Through our organisation we asked the Minister for a clarification of the position as regards the use of the strap.  Now that the amendment has been withdrawn, I take it that its use is now definitely precluded.</P>
    <P>He was right, in theory.  Now, of course, in 1965 the strap is back again and, with it, the ruler, the pointer and, <Col N="538" /> perhaps, the leg of the chair also.  I suggest that, in the light of these things, and harking back to this small backward step in 1956, which was corrected by the Minister under pressure from public opinion, and also under pressure from his own Party, as I happen to know, we are now asked to accept a far more backward step, as I have shown.  Why this backward step?  Is it because the Minister feels he cannot apply the Rules?  Is it because the Rules were being flouted?  I should like to quote a letter I received the other day from a woman in Galway. This arises because of the fact that she saw I intended to raise this matter. She says:</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>May I thank you for your efforts to have a discussion on school punishment.  A recent newspaper report on a discussion with the Minister made me sick.  A few halfhearted queries by Deputies concerning some change he had made in the Rules.  What Rules, may I ask?  When did some of our teachers observe any Rules?  He may as well put his Rules in the fire for all the heed the teachers pay to them. It is such hypocrisy to waste time talking about Rules when we know that our children are brutally beaten day after day for failure at lessons ... and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not have to go further into that but the impression many parents have is that Rules are frequently being flouted.  I ask the Minister again whether it is because he feels the Rules are being flouted that he is changing them, making them weaker and watering them down?</P>
    <P>I shall mention another case which was brought to my notice just the other day, actually, on the 22nd November.  It concerns a little boy in St. Patrick's Training Primary School &mdash;Vincent Perry, a boy of 10 years&mdash; whose head teacher named McAleer found him fooling around with other boys in the school yard with a broken desk.  The head teacher brought him into a junior class and made him stand there.  The boy protested, said <Col N="539" /> he was not responsible and said there were others involved, too, whereupon the teacher clouted him on the ear. The boy had another brother in the class named Brian who is aged 8.  This little boy, who was for nearly a year in Blanchardstown with primary tuberculosis, had recently come back to the school.  He stood up for his elder brother, protested, and he got substantial clouting on the ear as well. The parent in question is Mr. Patrick Perry, of 39 Russell Avenue, Drumcondra. He went to see the manager, quite rightly, and the manager said he believed the teacher and that there was no truth in this at all.  Both of the boys came home trembling with indignation and fear and there was no doubt in the father's mind as to what had happened.  The father, quite rightly, has written to the Minister.  I await with interest news as to what kind of action the Minister will take, or does he consider this type of boxing of the ears of children is what he calls &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; and not excessive punishment?</P>
    <P>When the Minister, any Minister, does actually inquire into a case, he holds the inquiry in private.  You will remember I raised on the Adjournment the Raharoon case in which a girl was beaten severely for being left-handed and persisting in using her left hand.  Nothing could shake either the manager or the teacher, and finally the father having kept his children from school was brought to court and told that if his children did not keep up school attendance they would be committed to an industrial school. What did he do?  He sold his 150 acre farm in Raharoon, West Cork, took his ten children with him, went to London and is now living there.  Only after the family had left was the teacher removed from the school What happened the teacher?  He was sent to the island of Inisheer in the Gaeltacht.  What is the implication there?  Is it that the Gaeltacht is regarded as a Devil's Island to which to send the more brutal teachers?</P>
    <P>In more recent times&mdash;starting last Thursday, in fact&mdash;there was an inquiry into allegations of brutal treatment extending over several years at <Col N="540" /> a school in Brittas, County Dublin.  I wrote to the Minister and I quote my letter dated 14th November, 1965:</P>
    <P>Dear Minister,</P>
    <P>I understand that you are having an injuiry held on Thursday next at the National School of Brittas, County Dublin, arising out of allegations of ill-treatment of children in this school.  I am extremely interested to know just how such inquiries are conducted, and I wish, consequently, to request you to give me permission to be present as an observer at the proceedings. I hope I am right in thinking that you will see no objection to a Member of the Oireachtas being present at an inquiry into a matter in which he is deeply interested, and one which is of great public importance.  You will agree, I trust, that in such matters, as in others, it is of importance that justice shall not only be done but shall be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>I received a reply from the Minister dated 16th November, 1965 which reads:</P>
    <P>A Sheanadóir, a chara,</P>
    <P>With reference to your letter of the 14th inst., and your request to be allowed to be present at the inquiry to be held on Thursday next at Brittas National School, County Dublin, I wish to inform you that the practice has been in the conduct of inquiries such as this that they are conducted in private.  The only persons permitted to be present are the inspectors conducting the inquiry, the school manager, the teacher or teachers concerned, a representative of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, the parents and children concerned, the legal representatives of the parents and teachers and such other persons as are being called as witnesses.  I can see no good reason for altering this practice.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the procedure outlined above will ensure that not only will justice be done but also that it will be seen to be done by the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> Your request to be allowed to be present at the inquiry must, therefore, be refused.</P>
    <P>I should like to make two comments on this.  Firstly, I am not satisfied that it is sufficient that justice be seen to be done merely by the parties concerned. I think it should be seen to be done by the public at large.  I think all parents should know that if there is abuse of regulations it is in fact put right.  I am not satisfied to be told that &ldquo;suitable investigation&rdquo; is made and &ldquo;appropriate action&rdquo; taken, unless I am told the findings of such an inquiry or how it has been conducted and what action was taken.  Secondly, the Minister says that justice will be seen to be done by the parties concerned, but this can only be so if the findings are made known by the parties involved.  Does he intend to have the findings made known, or will he keep them private, as his predecessors have always done?  If he does intend to keep them private, how can be stand over his contention that justice will be seen to be done by the parties concerned?</P>
    <P>I should like to hope in this inquiry that it would not happen as happened at Raharoon in some cases that the children actually in the school would not be heard.  It is said you cannot take the evidence of a child, and the evidence of children who had recently left the school could not be taken because offences alleged by them were too long past.  The evidence of the child was not heard at all in the Raharoon case, and it appears to be similarly private and behind doors in the Brittas National School, County Dublin.</P>
    <P>In 1946 one of the Minister's predecessors, the late Tomás Ó Deirg, introduced modifications in the Rules for corporal punishment and laid down provisions which had not been there before about such things as boxing children's ears, pulling their hair and so on.  He introduced admirable modifications to the Rules.  I think it is a great pity that his successor should introduce such retrograde amendments to the same rules and regulations.  He is taking what the <i>Irish Times,</i> in an <Col N="542" /> excellent editorial, called &ldquo;a backward step&rdquo;.  The editorial of the <i>Irish Times</i> of November 7th, 1965, says, among other things:</P>
    <P>Those who campaign against school punishment are frequently labelled cranks.  Indeed they are; so was Dickens when he exposed the iniquities of child labour; so is any honest and courageous reformer. They are too easily labelled enemies of religion because so many schools in Ireland are clerically controlled. Between the two camps there is little tolerance.  Our opinion is that violence against the young cannot be justified at all; modern psychology warns us that it is often a brutish manifestation of the sexual urge, a perversion.  We would prefer to see corporal punishment banished entirely from schools.  The Minister is an honest and honourable man; if he feels that this cannot be done; one would at least expect that he would be moving forward rather than backward.  As education improves we should surely expect that the tendency would be to limit punishment rather than extend its scope; that the cane might be held as the ultimate deterrent in difficult cases, the last resort.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a further article in another paper.  I shall quote from the <i>Evening Herald</i> of October 29th, 1965.  This article was from the pen of the columnist known as The Inquiring Mind.  The heading is &ldquo;When will we end this rule of fear in our schools?&rdquo;  I shall quote one paragraph:</P>
    <P>We have stepped back a century into the pages of Dickens with this change in the regulations.  With the removal of the restraints imposed by the old rules there is nothing to stop the wrong kind of teacher from imposing a rule of terror on a class &mdash;and without breaking a rule of the Department.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Parents' committees are the way to do this in co-operation with experienced managers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> It also says:</P>
    <P>Too many of us have taken the school system for granted, failing to inquire into our rights as parents.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself in the Dáil emphasised this question of the rights of parents.  He quoted from his predecessor. I now quote from vol. 218, No. 4, column 761, of the Official Report.  The Minister, in quoting the statement of his predecessor of the 4th May, 1961, said&mdash;and this carries the approval of the present Minister since he requoted it&mdash;</P>
    <P>The teacher holds for the time being the place of the parent and so for the time being carries in this matter the right of the parent.  In these circumstances it would be unreasonable for me to forbid the teacher to adopt any deterrent that might be adopted by a just and wise parent.</P>
    <P>In that connection I should like to refer to one more change in the Rules, to which I have not yet referred.  The new Rules quote the Constitution for the first time.  Right at the start, we get quotations from the Constitution and that is another of the changes in the Rules.  It is quite a good thing, of course, in itself.  Article 42 of the Constitution is quoted.  It says:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the word &ldquo;inalienable&rdquo; and I ask him how he interprets it?  I interpret it to mean that which &ldquo;cannot be transferred&rdquo; and I suggest to the Minister that he is wrong in thinking that the parents' rights in this matter are automatically transferred to the teacher or manager by reason of the compulsory School Attendance Act.  I would contend, furthermore, that under this Article of the Constitution any parent has a right to say he does not want his child to be hit and he <Col N="544" /> can invoke Article 42, subsection (1) of the Constitution in which the State guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to protect their children, physically as well as mentally.  I suggest that any parent in any primary school who cares to invoke the Constitution, which is rightly quoted by the Minister in the new Rule, would have a finding in any court in his favour if he wanted to say he did not want his right to have a child beaten, or not to have him beaten, transferred to anybody, because it is his inalienable right according to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I quoted from <i>The Herald</i>.  The Minister may feel <i>The Herald</i> is not exactly a paper that is strongly in favour of the Government.  I shall quote, very briefly, two paragraphs from letters that appeared in yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i>.  Both letters are signed.  One is signed by Mr. Martin Reynolds.  This is what he says at the end of his letter:</P>
    <P>To say that punishment is seldom or ever given in bad temper is indeed to be out of touch with reality. From my own memory I can say it is more likely to be the converse and anyone who is prepared to discuss their experiences frankly will agree that temper, severity and complete lack of justice are frequent companions to punishment in Irish schools.</P>
    <P>He gives his full address in Dublin. The other letter is from John C. Cole, not our fellow Senator, although the name is the same.  He is from County Sligo and in the last paragraph of his letter he says:</P>
    <P>I would agree that punishment is seldom done viciously, but bad temper is not the rare quality Mr. Bithrey thinks it is.  True, our teachers have much to contend with. They are certainly not overpaid, and some of them have to contend with overcrowded classes of fifty and upwards. When the national programme for education moves forward these faults should be remedied. Meanwhile, let us not make the pupil a whipping-boy for the present defects of our educational system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> I quote those two but one could give a dozen more in support of my contention that there is strong public opinion against the changes and in favour of the regulations.</P>

      <P>I have great respect for Senator Ahern.  I remember that he was one of the Government supporters who backed me up when I raised this matter before.  He supported me in the vote.  Those two letters were printed in yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> and the full names and addresses were given.  So the answer to his question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  He can see them for himself in yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> if he wants to see them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come to another signed letter, this time one appearing in the <i>Evening Press</i> of November 18th.  This is a paper which as rule takes a favourable view of Government policy, and this letter is given big prominence on page 13.  Senators can see the heading, which is &ldquo;Mr. Colley should heed his critics in Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  You get a reasonably good photograph of the platform of the Fianna Fáil ÁrdFheis while the present Minister was addressing it.  We see two of our fellow Senators there &mdash; Senator Mrs Ahern and quite a good representation of Senator Tomás Ó Maoláin, looking in a slightly apprehensive way at the photographer.  This is all given by the <i>Evening Press</i> in order to lead up to a signed letter from which I should like to quote.  I am quoting this as an indication that there is a strong feeling not <Col N="546" /> only amongst those who may not always support the Government in everything, but among those also who do support the Government.</P>
    <P>It is from a reader in County Dublin who signs himself P. O'Shea. He writes: &ldquo;I am sure that most wise and just parents will agree with the delegates at the Fianna Fáil ÁrdFheis who criticised the decision to remove all restrictions on school punishment.  By now the Minister for Education must be aware that there is widespread objection to the new regulations and the public at large rather than `certain organs of opinion' is protesting....  In spite of attempts to distort the position the key question involved is the need to satisfy wise and just parents that defined and clear safeguards for their children will be provided in the schools.  The reluctance of the Minister and his department to offer these is disturbing.  For instance, if the Department of Education made a rule that the managers of schools must establish parent-teacher committees all objections would be swept away but in fact this form of co-operation is discouraged.  It is idle to pretend that a large, sincere and informed section of our community do not reject the new regulations, and to ignore this is to create a hostility to the Department of Education that will have nothing but evil results.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He winds up his letter: &ldquo;The Senate debate offers an opportunity to return to sanity and decency.  Mr. Colley can add a great deal to his repute, if he listens to the members of his own party who spoke so eloquently at the Árd-Fheis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I call attention again to the fact that the <i>Evening Press</i> considered it worth while making a feature of this letter, printing it in leaded type, and supplying a photograph not only of the Minister addressing the Árd-Fheis but also of the entire platform at that time.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to agree with the Senator that part of the reason why they published <Col N="547" /> the photograph was probably the beauty of those involved, but I feel that there might have been deeper motives also, apart from motives relating to surface appearances.  I must say that I feel that the worried look on the face of Senator Ó Maoláin in the photograph is due to his conscience troubling him about the change in the regulations.</P>
      <P>I have talked at great length, but I should like to turn back again to what the Minister said in the Dáil in the column I have already quoted.  He was quoting from his predecessor, who said: &ldquo;I will go further and say that I will not countenance any punishment in the schools that goes beyond the limits of adequacy&rdquo;.  This is the present Minister's contention, and I am sure a sincere one, that he does not intend punishment to go beyond the limits of &ldquo;adequacy&rdquo;.  I should like, however, to draw attention to a case that was before the courts twice recently, of a seven and a half year old boy, Keeley, who took action against a teacher whose name was Keegan. The doctor's evidence was that there were ten weals on the back of this boy. Like some of us in this Seanad he was wearing his overcoat, perhaps due to the conditions in the school, but when he was beaten, nevertheless, through the overcoat there were ten weals. The teacher hit him with a stick while the boy was lying on the floor.  The boy had refused to hold out his hand and had either been knocked down or fallen and was beaten on the floor.  The doctor's evidence was that a fortnight later there were ten weals still visible. It was the dispensary doctor who gave evidence to this effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that a doctor for the defence gave evidence and said that the boy was slight and pale and sallow and that this type of boy &ldquo;bruises easily&rdquo;.  This was perhaps unfair on his part.  I notice that in the evidence for the defence of the teacher in this case the school manager came in, Canon Troy, and said that there had been &ldquo;serious misbehaviour&rdquo;, which meant that he was relying on the new Rules to protect him.  He gave strong evidence about the bad language used <Col N="548" /> by this seven and a half year old boy, and said that he was a thoroughly bad character in many ways and was a liar. The mother of the boy gave evidence that she had brought him at once to Canon Troy so that he might see for himself what had been done to him and Canon Troy refused to look at the wounds because he said the boy was a liar.  He also suspended the boy from school, and I wrote at that juncture to the Minister's predecessor and asked has a manager in general a right to suspend any child, and if this is the case will it constitute a legitimate defence under the School Attendance Act, if the parent says that the child has been suspended by the manager.  The Minister's predecessor wrote back to me to say as I remember it: &ldquo;As there is a case <i>sub judice</i> to which this point would be relevant I cannot answer your question&rdquo;.  Although my question was simply a general question, and the case is now over and done with long ago, I have had no indication from the Minister as to whether in fact a manager has or has not a right to suspend a child, and, if he has, whether this is a legitimate defence under our law when parents are being dealt with under the School Attendance Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply telling what happened.  It is very relevant to the question of whether the Minister has it in his power to prevent &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; punishment.  The dispensary doctor said that there were ten weals and the teacher said that he gave &ldquo;three or four strokes&rdquo;.  Sworn evidence was given, furthermore, by both the teacher and Canon Troy that an inspector had investigated the case and had exonerated the teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that he was asked in the Dáil recently by Deputy Ryan whether an inquiry had in fact been held and with what result.  The Minister's answer was that an inquiry had been started but had never been finished because there was a law case on, and would not be finished now, and, consequently, there was no foundation for the statement that the teacher had been exonerated by the inspector.  This meant, in fact, that the judge in the appeal court, Judge Teevan, had sworn to him by Canon Troy and by Mr. Keegan, the teacher, something that was not factually sound, if what the Minister told the Dáil was factually sound.  They cannot both be true: that the inspector investigated the matter and exonerated the teacher, and that the inspector only started an investigation, did not continue it and did not intend to continue it and had exonerated no one.  I do not <Col N="550" /> know within whose responsibility such a situation rests.  I mention the fact because I want to suggest to the Minister that he should not be satisfied that, because a court of law decides an assault case in one direction, what was being tried was the application of his regulations.  I suggest he is neglecting his duty unless he proceeds with the full examination to find out whether his rules and regulations were applied, because it is not the business of the court to decide whether the rules and regulations of the Minister were applied.  The Minister, I think, should not be satisfied with this.</P>
    <P>Canon Troy, in his evidence, said that the boy was guilty of &ldquo;serious misbehaviour&rdquo;.  If this is so, and I grant that the court and the jury found that it was so, under the present Rules the boy could be struck but not excessively, but not under the previous Rules.  Nobody adverted to the fact that this took place not this year but last year, in 1964, and that the previous Rules still applied and that it was not a question of a &ldquo;serious misbehaviour&rdquo; but had to be a &ldquo;grave transgression&rdquo;. Serious misbehaviour would not have been sufficient and consequently the Rules as they applied when the boy was beaten should have been taken into account and not the present changed Rules.</P>
    <P>I have tried the patience of the House, I am afraid, and I am going to bring my remarks to a close but I want again to quote the present Minister when he was making a statement which he issued.  This is printed in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 7th October, 1965.  It is in relation to some of the small schools which may have to be closed.  This is what the Minister says and I think it is sharply relevant to us all here today.  He says:</P>
    <P>The most important group concerned are, of course, the parents and, in the circumstances of our educational system, the only practicable way to consult the parents on a nation-wide basis in such a matter is through their elected representatives in Dáil Éireann.  In the course of the debate in Dáil Éireann this year on the Education Group of Estimates, I announced this policy <Col N="551" /> decision which was welcomed by the Front Bench spokesmen of the two main Opposition Parties.</P>
    <P>The point well made, the point validly made by the Minister there, is one which affects us all.  We are here, I suggest, for the purpose of speaking for the parents and the public at large.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude my remarks, therefore, by appealing to the Minister to reconsider the question.  I am appealing to the Seanad to express the view that this House would welcome a reconsideration of these Rules by the Minister.  I am not laying down some hectoring demands to him.  I am merely asking that the House say they would welcome his reconsideration.  I must say, finally, that I am convinced that physical violence is not the answer to the problems of our schools.  I can hardly be accused of Party political bias, moreover, if I contend that the modification in the Rules for corporal punishment so wisely introduced by the late Mr. Derrig in 1946 when he was Minister for Education was more understanding, and more humane, and sounder educationally than those which have now replaced them in 1965, a generation later.</P>

      <P>I am very cross. When Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to the Schoolchildren Protection Organisation, whoever they are, who protested strongly on the occasion of the introduction of the strap, and said he felt that the kind of abuse they get should be protested against in this Seanad, I should like to protest on the other hand, against the abuse and vilification which the national teachers <Col N="552" /> have been getting not alone from people like Senator Sheehy Skeffington but in a well-organised campaign, for whatever objective it is being organised. I protest strongly against that and I think it is time that the voices of those who take an intelligent interest in what is happening in this country should be raised in defence of a body of people who are being made the target for a new type of attack which is, in its inspiration, foreign to the people of this country.</P>
      <P>One of the most brilliant field commanders of the Irish troops in the War of Independence was General Tom Barry.  Today, I received from him a circular in which it was stated that an appeal is being launched for funds to erect a permanent memorial to the men of the Third Cork Brigade who fell in action at Kilmichael.  I am sure other Senators have received it as well.  Incidentally, it will be next Sunday some 45 years since Kilmichael, which was the most significant Irish victory up to that time since the Battle of Ashbourne in 1916.  The men who fell at Kilmichael and on every other battlefield during the War of Independence were the products of the national schools and of the national teachers who taught them.</P>
      <P>The British press at the time described the Easter Week Rising as a rebellion of schoolmasters because of the number of teachers who took part in it.  They all began in the national schools from which&mdash;let me remind you here in view of a Resolution which we passed earlier today&mdash;came such outstanding Volunteers as Éamon de Valera in Boland's Mill, William T. Cosgrave in the South Dublin Union, Michael Collins and Seán Lemass in the General Post Office.  The story was the same throughout the country, because, and this should not be forgotten, the national teachers were the only source of education for the vast majority of the freedom fighters of the time and for the thousands of others who so successfully operated the political wing of that movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the struggle ended, we had here an educated democracy and the products of the national schools were able to shoulder the responsibilities of national and local Government and man the institutions of a modern State.  As you know, we were among the first of the submerged and occupied nations to regain control of the greater part of our national territory.  The fact that our story since then is happier than that of many of the later arrivals to freedom is due in the main to the work of the national teachers who gave us this educated democracy in spite of the handicap of the British system of education, to which Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred, and under which they had to work.</P>
      <P>The national teachers in this day and age, with the extra responsibility of the Irish language and the big classes to which Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred, are giving worthy and meritorious service and continuing the proud tradition of the teachers of the former generation of which I spoke.  It is noteworthy, incidentally, that the men and women of that great generation who brought us freedom had no campaign against these same teachers and corporal punishment was administered by them when the circumstances required it.  It is also noteworthy&mdash;and I feel keenly about this whole subject which is why I am speaking thus&mdash;that when Cromwell tried to destroy the Irish nation his first target was the teacher and sad to say the ghost of Cromwell walks the land today and it takes many forms. In the days of Cromwell there was a price on the head of the teachers and if they were caught they were deported to the cotton plantations of America. Today, however, the situation has changed.  There is a price on the head of the teacher today, too, a price&mdash; which if this campaign succeeds&mdash;will have to be paid and that is the price of becoming an untouchable social outcast due to the exhortations in this campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to them.  They have national schools, too. I have the feeling there is something deeper in this campaign than meets the eye because it did not begin with Senator Sheehy Skeffington or the critical letters which have continued to appear in our newspapers, nor in the articles which our newspapers have published from time to time attacking this body of men and women who are giving such good service to the people of Ireland.  It began with some of our sacred cows in the theatre a long time ago.  It began even before the late Seán O'Casey in <i>Juno and the Paycock</i> created an immoral schoolmaster as one of the villains of that play.  I do not believe that his prototype ever existed.  That was one of the starting points of this campaign.  It was followed, of course, by the adaptation of James Joyce's work in the play <i>Stephen D.</i> which showed the cruel cleric who chastised a poor little boy, allegedly for breaking his spectacles but, on Joyce's own admission, he played truant from school and was reprimanded for doing so.  The audience in that play was not told, of course, of the kindness of the fathers who provided a free education for the man concerned.  Again, last year in the Dublin Theatre Festival we had the spectacle of another teacher, a most distasteful character, being featured in a play.  Again, he happened to be an <Col N="555" /> immoral teacher.  I do not believe, again, that his prototype ever existed.</P>
      <P>Now we come to the newspapers. Less than a month ago a cartoon in one of our daily newspapers showed a teacher with cap and gown, stick in hand, about to beat severely a classroom full of little children.  This type of scurrility, conveying the idea of a sadistic monster, makes the teacher the butt for ridicule and holds him up to public contumely, disrespect and derision. This was not the first of these cartoons, nor the first of these insinuating articles which appeared.  Newspaper articles continue to appear in the same strain and they do not confine themselves to the lay national teacher. The brothers and nuns are also attacked in a very unfair and subtle manner.  They are not in the same position as the lay teacher.  Because of their circumstances they cannot reply.</P>
      <P>We have all heard complaints about large classes and the shortage of teachers but, in view of this campaign which has been going on for so long, how can we expect to solve the problem? How can we hope that young men or women will choose national teaching as a career, in view of the fact that they know in advance what they will get when they take up their positions as national teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered also that entrance to the training colleges by these young men and women is not easily obtained.  The standard is very high.  They have to be of impeccable character, their background has to be good, they have to have at least seven honours in their leaving certificate examination and they have to pass the test of a very strict interview.  I doubt if a university professor has as much trouble to get into training as a young boy or girl wanting to become a national teacher.  There is no doubt about it that when they become national teachers that is what they will get.  Why should young people choose teaching as a career when they have that in front of them?  The fact remains that these restrictive practices which harass the teachers and hamper discipline in these schools have got to <Col N="556" /> be done away with if we are to achieve the object that should be the objective of any Government and any people to create, as a result of schooling, an educated and disciplined democracy. But no teacher, no matter how good he is, can turn out citizens if he is robbed of his authority and leadership in the schools.</P>
    <P>I am convinced, from my own experience and the experience of many with whom I have discussed this matter, that children need to feel a broad and understanding authority over them.  It is part of their security. The young child&mdash;and I do not think anyone will disagree with this&mdash;has an innate sense of justice and does not object to punishment when he knows it is deserved.  Judicious punishment is remedial as well as corrective and it is a deterrent.  It is much fairer to a child to show him the error of his ways and thus save him from further unpleasant consequences when he leaves school.</P>
    <P>I feel that if the juvenile crime rate in this country has been increasing we can thank the &ldquo;knockers&rdquo; of the teachers for a great deal of it.  There is no doubt in the world also that a child cannot know right from wrong or the right or wrong behaviour unless the teachers, as well as the parents, are able to present it to him and to convince him that it is better for him to be a good citizen than to turn out a delinquent.  The teacher cannot do that and cannot fulfil the role of being a mentor of the child if his authority is questioned and his reputation is sullied by the type of propoganda which has been carried on against them.</P>
    <P>I remember, when I was going to school, we had copybooks which were used to ensure that our writing became good writing.  Today there is no such thing.  There are no headlines.  It was a tragedy, in my opinion, to do away with those headlines because, apart from giving practice in developing a good style of writing, the mottoes in those headline copybooks were excellent and gave the child a good guide-line for his future development as a model citizen.  If we have gone <Col N="557" /> astray in our thinking it is high time we got back to basic and moral principles. A new climate of opinion must be created.  It must be created in order to ensure that the best of our young people, when choosing a career, will consider the career of national teacher. It will not be possible to get suitable recruits for the training colleges if the type of language used in this debate by Senator Sheehy Skeffington is used continually in the press, the radio, television, the stage and Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington, for instance, quoted the case of the Keeley boy which was tried in the High Court by Mr. Justice Teevan.  He gave one side of the story and undoubtedly that is the type of one-sided approach to the matter which is labelling and besmirching the whole profession of teaching in the minds of the people.  They do not see isolated cases.  They hear of Senator Sheehy Skeffington's great effort in the Seanad on behalf of the unfortunate children, or about some anonymous scribe in the Press who has written a letter quoting some sadistic effort on the part of a teacher.  They come to the conclusion, as a result of this continued campaign and harping on the subject, that all teachers are sadistic and savage.  The result is that instead of co-operation and goodwill, hostility is generated against the teachers.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in Senator Sheehy Skeffington's remarks about that case because he omitted to furnish, although he enumerated all the weals alleged to be on the boy's back and all the other sad pieces of information about it, the one thing that was of any value and that was the comment of Mr. Justice Teevan when he summed up the case.  It is only right and proper, since Senator Sheehy Skeffington gave that side of the story, that I should quote what Mr. Justice Teevan said in order to show that everybody does not agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  Here is what he said, as quoted in <i>Múinteoir Náisiúnta</i> this month:</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Teevan giving his decision said that a jury drawn from citizens of Dublin, many of whom were fathers with families, he was <Col N="558" /> sure, had found for the defendant in this case.  If he had been trying the action himself he would have arrived at the same decision.  Without the slightest hesitation he found that the case had not been made out. He could see the complete destruction of all benefits coming from the schooling of young children, were teachers to give in to this type of conduct on the part of the boys.  He could see great danger in the boy's psychological development as a result of this appalling hurt that had been done to his welfare by publishing this incident as his mother had done.  He did not mean that she had done it in bad spirit, but it was a precipitate action.  The suggestion that a boy of seven was entitled not only to hold up a teacher and a principal, but the entire class and frustrate all the efforts of the teacher, bringing discipline to a complete halt by simply not holding out his hand, was needless to say, nonsense.</P>

      <P>That was the opinion of the judge who tried the case. Surely if Senator Sheehy Skeffington gives one side of the story he should give the other.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington, in the course of his remarks, talked continually about, and used the words &ldquo;continual beating of children&rdquo;.  He used the words &ldquo;beating of children&rdquo; right through his speech.  He then quoted the <i>Church of Ireland Gazette</i> article, which had the following sentence in it :</P>
      <P>When pupils see that the teacher is worthy of respect they will give it.</P>
      <P>How can pupils see the teachers are worthy of respect if this continuous assault and attack on their integrity and on their kindness is allowed to go unchallenged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington also said that many children, scarred by witnessing teachers beat their fellow-pupils with straps or sticks, were affected for the rest of their lives.  The Senator said scarred.  Many children in my opinion&mdash;I had experience of <Col N="559" /> both sides of it when I was going to school&mdash;who witness their comrades getting punishment would say to themselves, &ldquo;I will stick to the rules.  I will do what I am told.  I will not take the chance of getting that dose.&rdquo;  Senator Sheehy Skeffington is entirely wrong in that respect.  He, also, after using the word &ldquo;beating&rdquo;, about this situation, quoted from Dr. Bob Collis's description of what happened to him when he went to Rugby School.  Dr. Collis admitted that the beatings he got in school did not do him a bit of harm.  They were beatings.  They were examples of the type of savagery that goes on over there still in certain English public schools.  It may have been the Senator's intention to create the impression of what goes on in our schools.  He gave this one example of what happened in Rugby School.  That is not what goes on in national schools here but that is the interpretation that would be put on this if a public audience were listening to the Senator. The Senator said then if he saw a 12 stone teacher hitting a small child of six stone his stomach would turn, particularly when the teacher was hitting him with an implement in front of other children.</P>
    <P>I say to Senator Sheehy Skeffington that while his intentions may be good and while he may have a great heart and a tender feeling for any kids who have to get slapped or get punished for not obeying the disciplinary code in school, he should ask himself whether this compaign that he has been conducting and the campaign which has been conducted by others, no doubt because of the example which he has given, will achieve any worthwhile objective or on the other hand whether it will not possibly do irreparable damage to the educational system of this country.  I feel that the time has come when we should stop this nonsense and realise that if we are to take off all the disciplinary controls which exist and to namby-pamby children, and if the teachers are to be put in the position that their influence in the schools is discounted, that their control is set at naught and that any attempt by them to exercise discipline in the <Col N="560" /> schools in the reasonable manner provided for by this regulation which Senator Sheehy Skeffington wants reconsidered is banned, then we are going to have here what they have had in another country which was portrayed so ably in the <i>Blackboard Jungle</i> on the screen and on the stage. Educational control and discipline have broken down anywhere that that system was tried, and even in the particular country where they went overboard in petting the kids they have had to reconsider the situation and are, I understand, considering the introduction of more drastic methods to control the effervescence of youth in the schools.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have juvenile delinquency and it has been developing. A contributory cause is the fact that the idea of lawlessness is being engendered in those young people by reason of the fact that teachers have now come to the position where they are afraid to exercise discipline in the schools, where they do not know where they stand in regard to discipline, and if they attempt to exercise discipline and control questions are asked in the Dáil, motions put down in the Seanad and anonymous groups write in the evening papers and represent them as sadistic monsters.  You cannot have proper discipline and control if that compaign will continue. I suggest to Senator Sheehy Skeffington that he should reconsider his attitude towards this.  Rule 130 to which he refers talks of the administration of corporal punishment for serious misbehaviour and lays down that it should not be done for mere failure at lessons or anything of that sort. Surely it is only reasonable to expect that if teachers are expected to turn out good citizens they should have some means by which they can control them.  If punishment when deserved and required is administered for serious misbehaviour I do not see that anybody can have any quarrel with that.  I would be strongly against reconsideration by the Minister of that particular rule because I think it is the one safeguard we have to ensure that children going to school will realise that they must at the very start find out the difference between right <Col N="561" /> and wrong, that if they do wrong they will be punished for it, and ensure that when they leave school they will not become delinquents, breaking the law, because it has been made quite clear to them that wrong-doing does not pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I came into the Seanad today in an unaccustomed condition, that is with an open mind on the issue under discussion.  We have heard two speeches so far and I have to say that they have shifted me somewhat in a certain direction.  This is due to a combination of the eloquence of Senator Sheehy Skeffington and the care with which he made his case and the absurdity of much of what Senator Ó Maoláin has said.  It is, I know, wrong to be influenced by Senator Ó Maoláin's remarks, as many of them have no relation to the motion and should, therefore, be ignored, but it is difficult to avoid allowing oneself to be pulled into the maelstrom which he has stirred up.  Some of his arguments certainly do not bear examination. He tells us that the national schools produced various heroes.  They produced nearly everybody in the country, heroes and criminals alike. The implication which he made of a conspiracy forces one to dismiss everything he says.  People who have this conspiracy mentality and who say that any kind of discussion of an issue or problem is a conspiracy by someone or some society or some group in society are not worthy of serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a complex issue not as simple as it has been put by either Senator Sheehy Skeffington or Senator Ó Maoláin.  There is a serious problem of discipline in schools and it is by no means certain&mdash;the contrary is probably the case&mdash;that discipline can be adequately maintained in some schools at any event if there is no provision for any physical punishment.  Certainly those who seek to abolish it completely have an onus on them to show reasonably clearly and by reference to experience elsewhere in similar conditions that discipline can be maintained without the use of physical punishment. At the same time, it is clearly desirable to limit physical punishment, <Col N="562" /> to set such limits as will ensure the minimum of hardship or harm being done and will also ensure that the teaching profession is not destroyed in the way Senator Ó Maoláin has said when physical punishment has an automatic kind of connection in the mind of teacher and student.</P>
    <P>It is clearly undesirable and a completely absurd and twisted picture of education to think in those terms. Unless physical punishment is limited so that the public are confident and have an assurance that it is restricted to proper use for proper purposes and to a proper degree there is damage to the profession, not because of some conspiracy of some obscure group against teachers or against society but because parents who are cranky about their children and often absurd in their reactions against punishment are liable, if there is no adequate control and it cannot be seen that there is adequate control, to think that it is excessive, and this does not make for good parent-teacher relations or respect for teachers in general.</P>
    <P>Our problem therefore, is, first of all, can a case be made for abolishing physical punishment altogether.  I have not heard it made thought I am prepared to hear such a case made on psychological evidence or other evidence of that kind.  The onus is on those who make this case to prove it. Given, therefore, that we are not yet in a position to justify the abolition of it bearing in mind the difficulties and dangers, then you come to the problem of how to regulate punishment. Hitherto this has been done under a particular rule which has now been changed by the Minister.  The Minister must have reasons for changing the rule.  Knowing the Minister, I know that the reasons must be ones which seem good to him, and I would be interested to hear him develop what he has said on this subject elsewhere because I have a great respect for his judgment, his sincerity and his intelligence in any matters of this kind. Again, I would have thought that the tendency would be to see whether you could restrict still further the use of physical punishment without detrimental <Col N="563" /> effects rather than something which on the face of it appears to open the area up rather wider.</P>
    <P>One thing which concerns me about the form of physical punishment is the practice which prevails at the moment and which it may be difficult to get away from in small schools, that the person who administers the punishment is the person who has been offended, the teacher himself.  I have had experience of physical punishment in various schools and I never liked it. I avoided it when possible and, given the choice between physical punishment and detention, I opted for detention.  However, it was not such as to deter me from activities which led me to a fair amount of it at the time.  Some of it was given in a school where it was administered by the teacher himself and from my experience, whereas I did not resent it I did see its impact on other children, perhaps more sensitive than I, and the impact was very unfavourable on them because the teacher acted on the spur of the moment, in the heat of the moment, in response to irritation or frustration and in a manner which, although it did most children no harm, certainly did some children some harm.</P>
    <P>At the next school I attended, all punishment was given by a person delegated for the purpose.  If you misbehaved yourself, you were sent to him with a note.  You might succeed in justifying yourself and in getting off.  He was an impartial judge.  He listened to your side of the story and, having considered all the facts, he acted accordingly in the cool of the moment and not in the heat of the moment.  That was an excellent disciplinary system.  It avoided the dangers of a system in which the person who was offended was the person to strike.  I think it would be well if we could move in that direction. I see the difficulty in the one-and two-teacher schools.  In the one-and two-teacher school, with which the Minister is endeavouring to do away, it is a bit of a difficulty although perhaps the children there who misbehaved themselves might be referred to the manager, just as, in the secondary <Col N="564" /> school which I attended, a child who misbehaved was referred to the Dean of Studies.  Certainly, we should get away from the situation in which the person who has been offended inflicts the punishment himself.  It is in that direction we should be moving rather than towards a widening of the area, which, on the face of it, appears to do what is being done here, although one recognises that the Minister must have reasons for his action which he will explain to us in due course.</P>
    <P>Whatever about what the Rules should be, one thing that is vital to the respect in which the teaching profession should be held and, indeed, is widely held, is that these Rules should be implemented and be seen to be implemented.  There should be no feeling that those who frequently offend against these Rules and arrogate to themselves the right to decide whether or not the Rules should be applied can get away with it.  Teachers faced with difficult or recalcitrant children may strike them in the heat of the moment: we are all liable to do it, even with our own children at home. Often, they do not mean to do so. They do it on the spur of the moment. A teacher may forget to get the particular implement which the Rules lay down and may inflict the punishment with the flat of his hand.  Nobody can legislate against human nature. Certainly, if this happens in the heat of the moment, it is quite wrong but if no serious injury or damage is done, it is absurd that the particular teacher should be held up to ignominy and account, although he might be warned to be more careful in future.</P>
    <P>However, where a flagrant or persistent breach of the Rules occurs&mdash;the use of some method by which punishment is meted out on a scale out of all proportion to what is normal or necessary in schools&mdash;it is essential that the Rules be applied.  Where there is a flagrant disregard of the rules, I hope the Minister will say they will be applied and that there will be no question of doubts being cast on the implementation of this system and on the whole of the teaching profession because of an unwillingness to deal with any few black sheep there may <Col N="565" /> be among them, and I think they are few enough.  For the sake of the schools system as a whole, it is vital that these Rules be applied and be seen to be applied.</P>
    <P>Whatever the reason, and it is not because of some insidious campaign, there is at the moment a considerable impression among people that the Rules are not being applied.  I am not in a position to verify this impression. I do not know whether that is the case. If that impression exists, it must be got rid of by the Minister's making it clear that he will not tolerate serious and persistent breaches of the Rules.  It undermines the whole system and brings the teaching profession into disrepute.  Whatever the Rules, they must be implemented.  The Minister must make that clear.</P>
    <P>Many of these problems arise because the practice of our school system bears no relationship whatever to the theory of it.  It is a theory, completely in line with the teaching of the Catholic Church on this subject for centuries, that parents are responsible for the education of their children and that the State, the Government, assist them to carry out this function by providing them with schools and paying much of the cost. Any group of parents can get together and appoint a manager who gets a teacher who teaches the children on behalf of the parents whose rights are inalienable, according to the Constitution. But this is not the practice. The school system is not run for and by the parents, as the theory says.</P>
    <P>Divergence between theory and practice happens in all walks of life, but what is absolutely astonishing to my mind is that in proposing to move nearer to the theory of this system and to the approach to education which the Catholic Church has always held to be the true approach, that attitude is regarded as some kind of Communist subversion.  It would seem to me that, to the extent that the ideals of Christian education have been enunciated and I think enunciated in this House, this has been denounced as the product of some subversive minds who want to undermine our school system.  Anybody who has any <Col N="566" /> belief in the Christian ideal of education and Christian teaching should understand the position.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that parent-teacher committees are without their problems.  Of course, you have the problem of the cranky and difficult parents who have a view of their children which no outside person would take&mdash;a very tolerant view, I may say.  It is not easy to introduce the parent into the system.  But it belongs to him.  It is his system.  Nevertheless any effort to introduce him and to have him play his proper part seems to create a reaction that reveals a total failure to understand what the educational system of this country is theoretically about.  A lot of the difficulties we face in regard to physical punishment arise from the exclusion of the parents from the school.</P>

      <P>If the parent feels he has a grievance, he is not in the position of a person in an organisation who can get together with the other members and say to them: &ldquo;There is something wrong and we should get together and have it put right.&rdquo;  He goes to his manager, who is his appointee, to raise the matter but he is not always treated by the manager in a manner appropriate for the manager to deal with the parents, the education of whose children is entrusted by them to him.  When he goes, again, to the teacher, he gets a similar response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parents cannot educate their children. It must be delegated to teachers who are trained to do the job.  The teacher always sees the parent as a bit of a nuisance, as a danger, as a crank who is coming between him and the teaching of the children in an orderly, organised way.  There is a problem. We may minimise it but we do not do so by excluding the parent and, in fact, by behaving as if this were some kind of a communist State in which education is a matter for the State and not for the parents.  This system of totally excluding the parent is dangerously close to the communist system.  We should move to a system more in <Col N="567" /> accordance with that outlined in our Constitution.  If we do that, some of the problems may be solved.  If we have some kind of parent-teacher committee, the cranky parent who is uneasy about his child will get short shrift. Parents, for the most part, are reasonable.</P>

Some of these problems could be solved by closer and better relations between parents and children.  I know the Minister is a thoughtful person and he is determined to achieve progress in education.  I reserve judgment on the particular issue of the amendment of the Rules until I hear the Minister's reply.  I hope he himself has a reasonably open mind on this matter.  I believe he has.  I hope, unlike all his predecessors, he does not become the tool of the system but will maintain his initial desire to approach the problem of education afresh from outside and achieve progress in all the aspects of education where there is so much to be done.  Therefore, I reserve my judgment on this particular issue until I have heard his reply.</P>

      <P>As one of the 12,000 people who are supposed not to be able to conduct themselves when put before a class of children and as one who has the experience of 30 years in national schools both in town and country, I should find myself in a position to add something to the debate here today.  We noticed, when Senator Sheehy Skeffington opened the debate, he started to go over the Rules.  He <Col N="568" /> was confirming with the motion as it stood and he went along through different Rules until he came to a certain page and there he stopped.  It was at page 74.  We all knew he was throwing a smokescreen coming up to page 74 because we knew he would not go any further.  He found not one thing wrong from page 74.  Anyone who Rules.  He found some little things wrong up to page 74.  Anyone who was expecting him to discuss the changes in the Rules, excepting Rule 130, was disappointed.  I was not disappointed because I was certain he would not waste any time getting to Rule 130.</P>
      <P>I have been in this House since 1961 and not a single word has been said about corporal punishment in national schools.  When Senator Sheehy Skeffington was returned in 1965 we could expect he would come along here again and put across what the national teachers know as the O'Connell propaganda.</P>

      <P>Yes, I do not dispute that.  Apparently Senator Sheehy Skeffington intends to continue to put that sort of propaganda across in the future.  I was definitely disappointed in his performance today.  I do not think Senator Ó Maoláin need have any worries whatever about his performance. If he threw away his letters from the <i>Irish Press,</i> the <i>Irish Times,</i> the <i>Evening Herald</i> and the other leading articles he had and we took what he said himself, we would not have anything at all to worry about.  The only thing that might worry us would be that he might have the leg of the chair in his hand when he finished up.  In the past, when Senator Sheehy Skeffington raised these matters in the Seanad, he met little or no opposition because, at that time, there was not a single national teacher in the House.  Now there are four, three who are serving, and one who is an official of the INTO. During that period before 1961 Senator Sheehy Skeffington took every opportunity to attack the national teachers in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>In 1961 the Teachers' Organisation made a strong effort to put a member into Seanad Éireann and they succeeded in putting in Senator Brosnahan.  It came as a sort of disappointment that Senator Sheehy Skeffington did not come back, as we then had somebody to oppose him on any matter he might raise with regard to national teachers or national schools.  I am glad, however, that his action in putting down this motion gives us an opportunity of debating the whole question of corporal punishment.</P>
      <P>The old book of Rules consisted of 146 pages and Rule 165 of the new Rules says :</P>
      <P>These Rules may be altered or rescinded by the Minister with, in the case of Rules involving finance, the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>There were many other vital changes in the Rules in the new book with some of which the teachers do not agree.  In fact, they resent some of the Rules and are very sorry that the Minister did not see his way to amend more of them.  For example, the Rules in connection with the primary school certificate.  The teachers of Ireland would be very glad to see an amendment to that Rule and we hope the Minister will do so in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public are not concerned in the least about the Rules which displease the teachers.  It may be well to let the public know that the Rules are framed by the Civil Service, by the Department of Education without any consultation whatever with the INTO.  We believe, in the framing of Rules for schools, an organisation such as the INTO should get a draft of the Rules and should be asked for their opinion on them.  Some seem to favour Rule 96 of the old Rules.  That is the one which Senator Sheehy Skeffington favours also.  I assure the House that every national teacher in Ireland resented Rule 96, subparagraphs (3), (4) and <Col N="570" /> (5).  No teacher in the country&mdash;and it is the principal teacher who is supposed to inflict punishment in the school&mdash;wants a licence to box children's ears, pull their hair or ill-treat a child in any way in the manner suggested in the Rules as they stood.  One would think it was quite a common practice for teachers to box ears, pull children's hair and so on.  I have been 30 years in schools and I have never had a single parent make any complaint to me.  It is not a regular thing for parents to make complaints in schools.  I am in full agreement with the Minister when he said that the new Rule was to ensure a positive rather than a negative approach to the matter. In both the new and old books of Rules there is adequate protection for the child against a teacher who acts in an unprofessional manner.  In the new Rule 130 subparagraph (4) reads :</P>
    <P>Any teacher who inflicts improper or excessive punishment will be regarded as guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher and will be subject to severe disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>The Minister has adequate power to deal with teachers who might treat children improperly.  The INTO also has rules and its code of etiquette. Teachers who are guilty of any unprofessional practice such as boxing of ears, pulling of hair or other ill-treatment of a child would be adequately dealt with by the INTO.  They would take serious action against that teacher and would expel him from their organisation if they had sufficient evidence that he was behaving in such a way.  We have not only to obey the rules of Parliament but we also have to obey the rules of our organisation. The child has, not only that protection, but he has the protection of the courts. I find that in all the cases that come before the court, with very few exceptions, the child gets the benefit of the doubt.  There are 12,000 teachers in this country and it is a very rare thing to see any case in court.  The persons who may inflict corporal punishment in a national school usually have children of their own.  The fact of the matter is they give their own children more punishment than <Col N="571" /> they give the children who are attending school.  I am a schoolteacher's son myself and I got more punishment than the rest of the children in the school. It did not do me any harm.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, part of the training of teachers consists of courses in child psychology and teachers have a fair idea when corporal punishment would bring about the desired effect or when it might be detrimental to the child.  There are children on whom it is detrimental to inflict corporal punishment.  There are others on whom a slight tap of the stick might not do one bit of harm in the wide world.  In fact, it might do a lot of good.  The suggestion was made that teachers, who cannot control their bad temper, take it out on the pupils. Any teacher who does that should not be placed over children.  If people are going to vent their spleen on small children, just because of bad humour, they should not be placed over children.</P>
      <P>It is not correct that the amendment to the Rule, as was suggested in letters to the papers, would remove all restrictions.  No teacher will interpret the new Rules to mean that he can resort to hair pulling, twisting of ears or inflicting excessive corporal punishment. The Leader of the Labour Party raised the matter in Dáil Éireann and he seemed to be of the opinion that the old Rule 196 should be reintroduced. At the same time, it was most important to note that he made no request that corporal punishment should be abolished in the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a progressive step on the part of the Minister to revise or amend Rule 96, subsections (1) to (5).  It was good for the teachers and indicated that the Minister had confidence in the teachers that they would not abuse the new regulations and resort to boxing of ears and pulling of hair.  The old Rules have been left too long <Col N="572" /> without revision.  The problems of children, when they were introduced, are not the problems of today.  In the past ten years secondary and vocational education is available to a very high percentage of the children in this country.  The scholarship age has been reduced to eleven years and the number of children over 14 years attending national schools must be the lowest ever.  It was uncommon for children in my time to attend school until they were 15 or 16 and schools were more overcrowded than they are today.  It was much more difficult, for that reason, to keep up a good standard of discipline and teachers had, on occasion, to resort to severe measures.  Today, however, due to the activities of the INTO, many changes for the better have taken place.</P>
    <P>The rate system, the report book, conditions of pay, overcrowding of classes, etc., have more or less disappeared or the Minister and his Department are doing something about them.  Almost all the children are under the age of 14 years of age but I can say that the average parent has no objection whatsoever to reasonable corporal punishment.  The parents of today have a great interest in the education of their children and in the matter of excessive corporal punishment.  Parents at the present time see that their children do quite an amount of homework and this leaves the job much easier for many teachers.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington never makes any reference to any school except national schools and national teachers.  Those are the only people he has ever referred to.  He does not refer to the secondary schools at all and there are no rules for them.</P>

      <P>I will say just this much about secondary or vocational schools.  They have a weapon which we have not in the national schools. Children may be expelled from secondary or vocational schools.  It is a very different proposition in a national school.  It is almost impossible to expel a child from a national school.  It would be impossible to expel a child from a national school in a rural area. It might not be impossible to expel a child from a national school in a city because the child would be in the position that he could go to another school.  It would be impossible in a rural area and the teacher has no right whatsoever to expel any child.  He may make a report to the manager. The manager is the only person who has a right to expel a child from a national school.  He is usually the parish priest of the area, as far as we are concerned, and he will put on his considering cap before he expels the child because there is too much involved.  You have the question of parents, relations and everything else and he will avoid expelling a child. If you had not punishment for some types of children, you could not live in the national school.  As I say, most parents have no objection to corporal punishment as long as it is inflicted in such a way that it does not cause injustice and is not administered because of bad temper on the part of teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Irish Press</i> on Wednesday there was a report of Mr. Johnson speaking at the Árd-Fheis, and we see that the professors have certainly left their mark on some of this.  He said that while every country in the world was moving forward in educational psychology our Department of Education was taking a fantastic step backwards. I noticed that Senator Sheehy Skeffington mentioned &ldquo;step backwards&rdquo; several times today.  He said it was a backward step to introduce a rule which permitted corporal punishment not merely on the hands but on any part of the body with any instrument, and that &ldquo;one of the types of punishment which our young Minister for Education is going to allow is known on the Continent as the English <Col N="574" /> perversion.&rdquo;  In his reply to the discussion at the Árd-Fheis the Minister warned the delegates to be on their guard and not to follow certain organs of public opinion which seem to have got the wrong end of the stick.  I am in agreement with the Minister when he said that certain organs of public opinion seem to have done that.  By and large, I am in full agreement with Rule 130 subsections 1, 2, 3 and 4, and I would ask the Minister to stick to his guns and continue to show confidence in the teachers, treating them as a group of professional people, and not to hold the same opinion of them as some of the scribes in the public press, and to refuse to reintroduce Rule 96 subsections 3, 4 or 5.  In so doing, I believe the Minister will have the satisfaction of seeing in years to come that he did a good day's work when he amended Rule 96 and introduced Rule 130.</P>

      <P>I should like to record at the start that the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, of which the vast majority of national teachers are members, was never consulted about the change of Rule relating to corporal punishment. Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked today what pressures were brought to bear on the Minister when he introduced the changes in Rule 96. I should like to emphasise that neither the teachers nor their Organisation exerted any pressure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, if the INTO had been consulted I think that they would be in favour of the change. Teachers are in the same position as members of the Garda, members of the Army, Civil Service and others in the public service.  They are handed <Col N="575" /> a certain code of regulations and they are asked to carry them out.  I should like to reiterate that had we been consulted on this change I think that we would have come down on the side of the Minister but not for the reasons stated by Senator Sheehy Skeffington that the change would give more liberty to teachers in dealing with children.  If one looks at old Rule 96 and examines it analytically one will see that it was an entirely negative rule.  A cold examination of the terms of old Rule 96 is worthwhile. It sets out that corporal punishment should be administered only for grave transgressions.  Who was to decide what was a grave transgression?</P>
      <P>The rule also stated that in no circumstances should corporal punishment be administered for mere failure at lessons, and teachers considered that that was a wise provision.  Paragraph 2 stated that only the principal teacher or teacher appointed or authorised by the manager for the purpose, should inflict corporal punishment.  Paragraph 3 stated that only a light rod or cane should be used.  One often asked oneself the question : How was the cane to be weighed?  What is a light rod or cane?  That section was vague and open to misinterpretation. One person's idea of a light rod or cane might not at all agree with another person's idea of the same thing. Paragraph 4 was also negative in that it stated :</P>
      <P>No teacher should carry about a cane or other instrument of punishment.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 5 was also negative:</P>
      <P>Frequent recourse to corporal punishment will be considered by the Minister as indicating bad tone and ineffective discipline.</P>
      <P>Whereas, if one looks at new Rule 130 which replaces old Rule 96 one observes that it is based on a positive approach to the whole question in that it says :</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers should have a lively regard for the improvement and general welfare of their pupils, treat them with kindness combined with firmness and should aim at governing <Col N="576" /> them through their affection and reason and not through harshness and severity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>That was all in old Rule 95.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now incorporated in new Rule 130 which relates to school discipline.  Paragraph 1 of the new rule also goes on to say something entirely new:</P>
      <P>Ridicule, sarcasm or remarks likely to undermine a pupil's self-confidence should be avoided.</P>
      <P>This is most welcome because I know from my own experience as a teacher, that the harshest form of punishment is that which destroys a child's picture of himself.  Every child has a good opinion of himself, and any effort made to undermine that opinion or destroy a child's self-confidence is an evil action. The incorporation of this new provision is good.  Paragraph 2 of Rule 130 says:</P>
      <P>Corporal punishment should be administered only in cases of serious misbehaviour....</P>
      <P>This gives more discretion to the teacher, a discretion which he had not under the old rule, which limited correction to &ldquo;grave transgression&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2 of the new Rule also incorporates the order that punishment should not be administered for mere failure at lessons.  The Rule also directs that corporal punishment should be administered only by the principal teacher or other member of the school staff authorised by the Manager for the purpose.  Paragraph 4 provides the Minister with a complete answer to all the irresponsible charges which have been made here and there over the last few months.  It says :</P>
      <P>Any teacher who inflicts improper or excessive punishment will be regarded as guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher and shall be subject to severe disciplinary action.</P>
      <P>In changing old Rule 96 the Minister has set aside a completely negative approach and has introduced a positive one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> In Rule 130, paragraph 4, there is a complete safeguard for children.  I think that the public uneasiness to which the Senator has referred must be allayed under that section.</P>
    <P>One further point before leaving this change in old Rule 96.  It is this&mdash;any time a visitor comes to this country to study our system of education one of the first things he asks is for a copy of the Rules upon which the system is founded.  In many cases those old Rule Books were brought away to different countries where a very bad image must have been created by the terms of old Rule 96 which stated that:</P>
    <P>The boxing of children's ears, the pulling of their hair or similar ill treatment was forbidden.</P>
    <P>Those visitors and those to whom they later showed the Rules must have formed the opinion that Irish teachers were so sadistic that it was necessary to have rules incorporated in the code, in order to prevent the ill-treatment referred to.  Old Rule 96 was a slur, not alone on the teaching profession in Ireland but on society in general. Teachers are firmly convinced that it was a good thing on behalf of the status of the teaching profession and of the community in general that this old negative Rule 96 has been altered.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington, in making his case against corporal punishment, based it upon a few notorious cases.  The highlights he introduced were those which have now become known as the Raharoon case and the Ballyfermot case.  Let us examine those two cases.  In 1960 a young teacher was appointed to Raharoon school.  For many years prior to that several teachers had tried to teach in the same school and each one of them was forced to leave because of a pocket of educational and disciplinary resistance among the pupils.  I am not mentioning the teacher's name because I do not think it fair that people's names should be mentioned in a public assembly such as this, as has been done here today. We are here in a privileged position and we should not take advantage of it.  To name people who cannot, because of our privilege, take action against us is a most reprehensible thing. <Col N="578" /> Before going to the school the manager informed the young teacher about what he might expect and he was instructed by the manager to take a firm stand. During his first day in school the pupils acted in a most unruly manner, stamping the floor every time the teacher's back was turned.  He was forced, after warning, to take action against the children.  From that on a few families resented the teacher's discipline and tried the same tactics against him as they had with the other teachers who had taught in that school.</P>
    <P>I think that it is most unfair that a person should adopt a onesided attitude to a matter when making a case. I would like to place it on record that 34 out of 37 families voluntarily signed a statement to the Department of Education that they wished the teacher to continue in the school since they were perfectly satisfied with his behaviour and with his teaching. Because of the attitude of the noisy few and their advisers the teacher thought it advisable that he also should abandon the school and seek employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Senator has stated that the Department banished him to Inisheer. That of course is not true and indicates that the Senator has no idea as to how a teacher is appointed to a school.  A teacher cannot be transferred from one school to another.  He enters employment with a Manager voluntarily and can move freely from school to school without coercion.  The banishment of a teacher does not enter the regulations. The Senator stated that one of the families involved in the case had to sell out and leave the district.  The teacher was not responsible for the cause of their leaving.  Those responsible were the do-gooders who advised in the case, walking a family into trouble the same as they have similarly done in Ballyfermot.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington is very slick in getting away from the whole background of the case <Col N="579" /> which he knows very well.  He also knows the background to the Ballyfermot case since he was one of a group of people advising in both.  He was prepared to adopt an irresponsible attitude in breaking down discipline in the two areas.  The Raharoon teacher has since left Inisheer and is teaching in another school where he is giving satisfactory service without the slightest trouble from parents or children. There would have been no trouble either in Raharoon or Ballyfermot were it not for trouble-makers.</P>
      <P>Now let us examine the Ballyfermot case.  A boy of 7½ years of age used the filthiest language in front of the whole class in defiance of the teacher. The teacher sent for the principal who decided to discipline the child.  The child refused to be disciplined and threw himself on the ground.  The principal felt that the whole discipline of the school would be undermined if he did not deal firmly with this boy.  He dealt firmly with him.  Subsequently, the boy was brought to a doctor and examined and then the whole case hit the headlines.  After that a charge against the teacher was brought before a judge and jury and was dismissed. From that it blithely sailed into the High Court.  It is almost incredible that a boy of 7½ could mislead his mother, the lawyers, Senator Sheehy Skeffington and other people co-operating with him, and lead them into a High Court case on a charge against the teacher which was based on a tissue of lies.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington said here today that Canon Troy suspended the boy from school and accused him of being a liar.  He certainly did both and was entitled to do so as events afterwards proved.  In actual fact it was Canon Troy who proved that this boy was a liar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>The doctor examined them.  In that respect I should like to say that the doctor was guilty of a grave breach of professional etiquette when he described the child's <Col N="580" /> injuries to a representative of a newspaper. It was hardly a responsible thing to do but it indicates the kind of people one is dealing with in an emotionally loaded situation such as surrounded the case.  Who is going to foot the bill incurred in taking this irresponsible High Court action?  The poor woman involved was ill-advised all along the line and she should have known what most parents know, that the word of a child has to be very carefully examined before any hasty conclusion can be arrived at.  By way of illustration on that point let us examine the experience of Alfred Binet, the eminent psychologist who some years ago performed an interesting experiment.  He examined children who had been involved in incidents in schools and he put the same set of questions to each child.  He then put a set of questions to the children's classmates and another set of questions to the teachers.  He continued the experiment to see what pattern would emerge and this is what emerged &mdash;it was clearly shown that in eight out of every ten cases the children involved in the incidents could not, because of emotional involvement in the incident, describe what had happened.  The children could not stand back from the incident and take an objective view and they told their parents what in many cases appeared the truth to them.  Many of the parents concerned were inclined to believe that the children were in actual fact telling the truth, but the children's stories did not agree with what had actually taken place.  The parent in the Ballyfermot case could be described as a parent of one of the &ldquo;eight&rdquo;.  To illustrate this the High Court judge in his judgment stated:</P>
      <P>I think this unhappy proceeding has arisen from a misunderstanding, the parent had too much respect for her son's word and she believed what he said.</P>
      <P>Continuing, the judge said very pointedly :</P>
      <P>We know he is a little liar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ó Maoláin did give fairly extensive quotations from the INTO journal but I have here a verbatim report on the judgment pronounced by the judge of the High Court and I should like to draw the attention of the Senators to a couple of points not referred to by Senator Ó Maoláin.  On the relevance or otherwise of rules and regulations to the charge against the teacher the judge said :</P>
      <P>This is not a case of technicalities falling on one side rather than on another.  It is a question of pure fact, a question of pure justice and of that there can be no doubt that the verdict must be in favour of the defendant.</P>
      <P>The judge also said:</P>
      <P>that the boy's behaviour was serious and of a kind that should be taken in hand.  The teachers were correct in taking it severely in hand.  The boy recognised that himself because when he was openly confronted by Canon Troy and told that it was a lie, when the boy alleged that he did not know his Catechism and had been punished for that, he then said it was for sums and when it was asserted that that too was a lie then the boy admitted that it was for bad conduct.  He knew that his conduct was reprehensible and he had tried to conceal it.  The case will be dismissed.</P>
      <P>A person in a responsible position getting up here in the Seanad trying to build on a case that has been dismissed by judge and jury and subsequently by the High Court must be very lacking in evidence in support of the thesis he is trying to develop and even if those two cases against the teachers had been proven, do two swallows make a summer?  There are half a million children being taught in national schools in this country every day of the week yet how many instances of ill-treatment does one hear of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make the position of the national teachers perfectly clear. We are completely and absolutely <Col N="582" /> against the ill-treatment of any child. We are completely and absolutely against excessive punishment and we will not support any teacher who is clearly convicted of excessive punishment or ill-treatment of a child.  We will defend a person and ensure that he gets a fair hearing at an inquiry. If he desires representation by the INTO, he is entitled to it, since he must be considered innocent until he is proven guilty.  When one hears charges of brutality laid against national teachers we would like to say that their record points in an opposite direction.  In Dublin city when children might be roaming around engaged in all kinds of mischief, the national teachers and also the Christian Brothers bring those children out playing games in all the various parks at their disposal.  They need not do this.  It is not part of their work, yet they are willing to go out in the rain and mud every Saturday morning with those young children.</P>
    <P>As well as that, the INTO was one of the first groups in the field in pinpointing the problem of mental handicap in children.  Recently the Organisation has met the cost of providing under the auspices of the Organisation of Mentally Handicapped of Ireland, 35,000 copies of a pamphlet entitled &ldquo;Notes to Parents of Mentally Handicapped Children&rdquo;, for distribution among parents throughout the country. The first statement of policy in the pamphlet is that: it is intended to be a help for the guidance of parents.  Another pamphlet was also produced under the same auspices and the cost borne by the INTO in order to draw attention to the serious problem of mongolism.  Are these actions those of people who are alleged to be callous in their dealings with children and parents?  The Organisation has nothing to hide one way or another in the matter of dealing with children along sound educational grounds and we do feel that if a case is to be made against corporal punishment it should be based on sound principle and not upon a few discredited charges against teachers.</P>
    <P>It is my own experience and that of many of my colleagues that in several <Col N="583" /> cases like the Ballyfermot case, where the parent has tried to break down the authority of the teacher it is the child who loses out in the long run.  The teacher and the parent are symbols of authority and when they are in conflict the child is confused.  It is a situation which he cannot understand and once the authority of the teacher is broken the next symbol of authority to be attacked is the parent himself. We have observed cases of children backed by their parents against teachers, subsequently causing great trouble to the parents themselves and in many cases assaulting them.  I remember one famous case and it is a more common type of case than Senator Sheehy Skeffington has produced here today of a child beating another child's head against the wall of the school yard; the teacher intervened. He was a very wise and experienced teacher from whom I have learned much.  He took action against the child.  One might say he was interfering with an individual child but one also has to take into consideration the rights of the other children in the class, and also the rights of parents must be respected.  Can a teacher just stand back and leave a child beat another child's head against a wall and not take action?  Later on that day when the teacher's back was turned, the boy who had been disciplined ran out of the school and returned with his mother.  The mother attacked the teacher and as she was about to leave he said to her : &ldquo;Madam, if I am any judge of children he will beat you yet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Three years afterwards she appeared at the door of the school with a gash over her eye.  She had paid the price for destroying the authority of the teacher. She asked the teacher what could be done about the boy and he replied : &ldquo;Madam, it is too late.&rdquo;  That is the type of situation that teachers have found themselves up against.  Would they be justified in standing back from their responsibility in controlling the children and leaving things take their course?  Are they to say: &ldquo;We will leave it to the parents and let society pay the price in the long run?&rdquo;  We <Col N="584" /> feel that that would be abandonment of our obvious duty to society.  It would be the easy way out but we are not prepared to take it.  No matter how great the abuse and no matter how viciously we are maligned, we, as teachers, are determined not to give in to any pressure group.  If and when, however, the parents of this country, expressing their opinion through the proper channels, wish to take over entirely the discipline of their children, inside and outside of school, then and not until then would we be prepared to acquiesce.  In the meantime we refuse to give ground under pressure from a small group since we believe it would be a retrograde step and that society in the long run, would suffer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the whole principle of punishment in the upbringing of children I would like to refer to a standard work <i>Psychology of Character</i> in which the author Rudolph Allers states:</P>
    <P>There can be no greater mistake made by those in charge of children than to divorce punishment from the correction of wrong behaviour.</P>
    <P>In that regard Allers is perfectly sensible and he does not make any particular reference to corporal punishment but to the whole idea of punishment. As Christians we are taught that if one leads a good life one is rewarded, if one leads a bad life one is punished; if one obeys the traffic regulations one has a better chance of avoiding accidents than if one disobeys them.  Similarly, with health, if one looks after one's health one has a reasonable chance of getting by, but if one does not one is heading for trouble, also in work if one does a reasonably good job, one gets on reasonably well, if one does not, one does not get on well. It is as simple as that.  We cannot get away from the principle of reward and punishment in life.  On this and on previous occasions Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to detention and forms of privilege, as forms of punishment. How can one punish by detention in national schools?  If a teacher detains a child he is equally detaining himself. Then the question of the child's right and the rights of the parents arise. <Col N="585" /> What authority has a teacher to imprison a child in school after hours? What would be the attitude of a court if a parent brought an action against a teacher for detaining his child in school against his will and against the will of the parent?  What privileges can be withdrawn from a child attending a day national school?  None, because he has none.</P>

      <P>We should not get excited.  The principle of reward and punishment is there right through life. One simply cannot get away from it. Any parent who endeavours to rear his child in a kind of fairyland atmosphere detached from reality is simply leading his child into trouble in the long run.  When a child leaves school he has to face the realities of life.  He must obey this regulation and that.  He cannot ride rough-shod over them.  If he has always been allowed to do everything he pleased in the home and in the school, he is only heading for trouble later on when he comes face to face with reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Senator Sheehy Skeffington was developing his thesis on the abolition of corporal punishment he built it mainly on two cases which have fallen to the ground, particularly the Ballyfermot case.  If any Senator wants the files on those two cases I can make them available at any time.  Are these cases the highlights of his thesis?  He has been engaged in this campaign for approximately 15 years or so; are these the two best cases he can bring in here to a serious assembly in order to prove that the teachers of this country <Col N="586" /> are guilty of brutality and sadism and that the discretion allowed to them under the regulations in the matter of school discipline should be withdrawn from them?  It is noteworthy that the Senator kept emphasising the word &ldquo;beating&rdquo; not &ldquo;slapping&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He referred in the course of his address to a radio programme on corporal punishment which took place some years ago in which Dr. Sheehy Skeffington, Dr. Bob Collis and Mr. Reynolds and myself participated.  He quoted at length from Dr. Collis.  I also remember that debate and when Dr. Collis spoke against corporal punishment I suggested that he was a very prominent international rugby player and also an eminent member of the medical profession.  I asked him if the flogging he said he received in the tower of Rugby had damaged him physically or mentally.  He replied that it had not but could have damaged others.  It is noteworthy also that Dr. Collis referred to the method of punishment.  He stated that he used be put up on his brother's back and flogged.  There is no analogy between the two situations, whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has nicely trimmed his arguments, just putting in the nice little bits to suit his case but he is not telling the whole story, as, for instance, in the Ballyfermot case. I personally do not think that Senator Sheehy Skeffington has made a very strong case here today in support of his thesis.  I think that he will have to produce more convincing evidence if he wants to establish the point he is trying to to make.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that I know the teachers of this country better than anybody else and it is my belief that they are only too anxious to do everything possible for the children they teach by way of providing, not alone the knowledge they require for their full development but also in the matter of games and recreation.  Many teachers, at their own expense, supply materials to children whose parents state they cannot afford them.  The national teachers of this country have a proud record.  I know that, by and large, their attitude towards corporal punishment <Col N="587" /> is that they will only have recourse to it if they think it is for the good of the children.  One, of course, can produce an odd case here and there like Senator Sheehy Skeffington did here today but such a case or cases are not sufficient to indict 14,000 teachers.</P>
    <P>I agree that it is a most reasonable thing for Senator Sheehy Skeffington or anybody else to come here and say to the Minister : &ldquo;Let us have another look at this or that&rdquo;.  I would agree with such a suggestion but I am voting against this motion on the grounds that I do not believe in Senator Sheehy Skeffington's good faith in this matter.  Neither has he convinced me by the evidence he produced here today that any reasonable person would support the motion.</P>

      <P>I do not intend any disrespect towards Senator Sheehy Skeffington when I say I cannot escape the conclusion that his references to some of the new Rules, other than those dealing with corporal punishment, were in the nature of a smokescreen.  Indeed, I feel that the point made by Senator McAuliffe to the effect that he stopped when he reached that ruling makes this conclusion inescapable.  Therefore, I intend to concentrate on what is the real subject of debate in this motion, the question of corporal punishment, and, in particular, the question of the changes in the Rules of the Department of Education dealing with corporal punishment in the national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In doing that, I want, first of all, to nail one falsehood which appeared, I think, in some newspaper and has steadily been repeated and propagated since until we had it again here today from Senator Sheehy Skeffington. There is a suggestion that these Rules were produced by stealth during the newspaper strike.  The facts of the matter are that the new Rules were issued to school managers and principal teachers in June of this year and they came into force on 1st July, 1965. The newspaper strike commenced on 5th July, 1965.  You can have various explanations as to why they were not referred to in public before that.  Each <Col N="588" /> man is entitled to his own view but let us make it clear that we are talking about views in this matter and not put forward, as an alleged fact, that the Department sneaked these Rules out when there were no newspapers.  That is not true.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I should like to say that I am sure Senator Sheehy Skeffington believes that in approaching this problem he is adopting an impartial and objective viewpoint.  I want to suggest to him that he is deluding himself if he thinks that is what he is doing.  I hope to demonstrate that to him.  It seems to me that his attitude in this matter is unrealistic in something that happened in this House only a few weeks ago I read of in a newspaper report.  According to the report I read, Senator Sheehy Skeffington made a sharp protest in this House and said that the Government should not treat awkward problems such as this by putting them on the long finger.  He said that was not good enough, that this was a matter of urgency and should be dealt with here in this House without delay.  I want to point out, Sir, that in view of the unfavourable publicity which these Rules received I welcome the earliest opportunity to deal with this matter in a way that was not open to me in Dáil Éireann.  Therefore, Senator Sheehy Skeffington can rest assured that there was no intention of delaying this debate any longer than was absolutely necessary.</P>

      <P>I was about to say the Senator did make amends, to some extent today, and in the normal way I would not refer to this.  I want to make a point about this.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington's views at that time were based on the assumption that I was endeavouring to put off the evil day in this matter.  I am putting it to him that this was wrong and, based on the wrong presumption, he arrived at the wrong conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to Senator Sheehy Skeffington that exactly the same thing happened to him in his approach to the change in these Rules when he <Col N="589" /> assumed, for reasons best known to himself, he could not accept that the changes were made in good faith but were made due to pressure from this quarter or that or because the Department could not enforce these Rules and were, therefore, abandoning the position. I think he made these points when speaking here today, because this was his conception of the position.  He went on from there and held up his case on that.  I suggest to him that, had he not been labouring under this delusion, he might have seen&mdash;from a perusal of the Rule itself&mdash;that, with due respect to him, the suggestions he has been making are nonsense.</P>
    <P>I said on another occasion, and was quoted here today as saying so, that certain sections of the public Press had got the wrong end of the stick in this matter.  It was, perhaps, a rather fortunate, or unfortunate, choice of words. As newspapers have to produce their version of it hurriedly, I do not blame them for getting the wrong end of the stick.  I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this having happened, there was an almost Pavlovian reaction to it.  We had various people automatically following on the lines of what had appeared in these newspapers and concluding that these Rules were sneaked out during the newspaper strike which, of course, was not true.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has repeated these misconceptions here today because he started off on a basis that was wrong factually.  He gave two reasons, I think, why the new Rules, compared with the old ones, constituted a step backwards.  He suggested there was a legal principle to the effect that where certain things were specified in some rule, regulation or law and such were repealed or replaced by another one which did not refer to these matters, it could then be taken that what had been prohibited before was now allowed.  I do not think Senator Sheehy Skeffington, if he examined it, would like to push that argument too far.  It has many holes in it, particularly in relation to this matter we are dealing with here.  Let me suggest that if there were substance <Col N="590" /> in this, in all matters of this kind, it would be quite reasonable for me to assume that Senator Sheehy Skeffington in examining the new Rules arrived at new Rule 130 and stopped there, he had no objection whatever to any of the subsequent Rules and approved of them entirely.  I do not think that is true.  If I were to follow the line of argument put forward by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I could make this argument.  If he looks at subparagraph (4) of Rule 130 he will see that it reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Any teacher who inflicts improper or excessive punishment will be regarded as guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher and will be subject to severe disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington suggested today that under this new Rule, not alone may teachers box ears, pull hair and so on but they may do anything, that there is no restriction on them and they can do what they like.  If this is true, what is the improper or excessive punishment which would be regarded as conduct unbefitting a teacher and liable to severe disciplinary action?  Would the teachers have to kill the children in order to incur this penalty?  Is this what the Senator suggests? Surely, it is unrealistic to interpret this Rule as giving unlicensed liberty to teachers to inflict corporal punishment on children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Senator to say that they could use rulers, legs of chairs and certainly the implication of what he said was that there is now no restriction on teachers. Perusal of the Rule in a reasonable fashion, not governed by previous misconceptions, can only lead to the conclusion that there is a restriction on teachers, that the restriction is one which relates to improper or excessive punishment and that, in practice, the person who will now judge what is improper or excessive punishment will be the Minister for Education.  Indeed, the case might have been made and, indeed, may yet be made that this new <Col N="591" /> Rule is quite unfair to teachers in that they do not now know, if they do the things the Senator has referred to, or things less objectionable, whether they will come under this or not.  It seems to me that they can make the case that this is unduly restrictive and unfair on them.  It seems to me that that is a case that might be made by teachers or might even be made by somebody looking at the matter without too many previous prejudices.  I doubt if that thought ever occurred to Senator Sheehy Skeffington.</P>
      <P>He refers to the old Rule as being the greatest protection ever devised for children in the national schools.  This Rule specified certain things which teachers were not to do.  Does anybody here seriously suggest that a teacher, if he were to go by that Rule, could not devise numerous punishments of which we would all disapprove, which are not specifically restricted by that old Rule?  I venture to suggest that there is nobody here who could devise a Rule specifying the things teachers were not to do, which would ensure that there was no ill-treatment of a child in school.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to do it.  Anybody who gives a little thought to the matter will realise that.  Look again at the new Rule in that context.  It has been quoted here at length and I shall not quote it again but if the new Rule is looked at in that context it will be seen that it is positive all the way, except for No. 4, which deals with abuse of the teacher's rights to administer discipline. That, as I have said, can certainly be used to prevent, or at least to deal with, any breach of what one would expect of a good teacher or, indeed, of a good parent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to think about these things in theory but if one thinks about them in practice and tries to draft a Rule it would be very difficult to come up with a better Rule than the new Rule.  It seems to me that in some ways the situation which arises when listening to a debate on this matter, is quite unrealistic.  One would think, listening to some people, that all the children in this country are <Col N="592" /> ideal.  On the other hand, one might believe, when listening to others, that all our teachers are ideal.  Of course, we all know neither proposition is true.  We are dealing with real people of flesh and blood with all the human failings and virtues which exist.  We are dealing with teachers and children. We are dealing with 14,300 teachers and approximately 500,000 children. We are going to get the whole gamut of human failings and virtues.  We know, when we consider this, that there are children, who will have to be dealt with in school, who do not conform to the normally accepted standards.  We also know that there are teachers among that 14,300 who do not conform to the standard we should like to see.  It seems to me a much more realistic approach to this matter to deal with both the matter of recruitment of teachers and also the method of detecting little breaches of what would normally be accepted and how to deal with them.  I shall come to that later but this seems to me to be the constructive approach.</P>
    <P>I thought Senator FitzGerald's approach to be quite constructive and that he very quickly laid his finger on the important aspects of this matter and avoided the more emotional ones. I hope I have demonstrated to the House, in regard to the change in the Rule that, far from it being a retrograde step, it is a step forward and that far from allowing greater licence than heretofore to teachers, it certainly does not.  It may, indeed, allow much less licence.</P>
    <P>When one goes on from there to the question of corporal punishment one has to consider what should be done in regard to corporal punishment in schools.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington said&mdash;I am not sure he said it specifically but I certainly got that impression from what he said&mdash;that he would abolish corporal punishment in schools completely.  Would that be right or a misrepresentation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a position <Col N="593" /> taken up by some people.  I believe them to be a small minority but I respect their views and the reason for their views.  There are very few people who would take the extremely opposite view, which is, that everything is good enough for the ruffians we have in schools.  We sometimes hear that but I doubt if many people would stand over that view.  One really has to deal with the proposition that there should be no corporal punishment in schools whatever.  It is unrealistic and unfair to say this, having regard to our knowledge of what happens in real life.  How many good teachers and how many good parents can say that they never have administered corporal punishment?  I know there are some teachers, good teachers, who have never administered corporal punishment but I venture to suggest the reason is that they have been fortunate in the type of children they were called on to deal with and that it would be possible for Senator Brosnahan, if offered a very good teacher, who never administered corporal punishment, to bring that teacher to a school in the certain belief that he could maintain discipline if he never administered corporal punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also know that the vast majority of parents find it necessary, on occasion, to administer corporal punishment to their children.  Therefore, I say it is unrealistic to suggest that corporal punishment should be abolished completely.  Indeed, there is a good deal of support for this view, internationally, as well as at home. Having said that, let me make my view quite clear on this matter.  It is that corporal punishment in schools should be administered only on rare occasions.  If it occurs regularly, there is something wrong with the teacher. It is only on these rare occasions when what is at stake is the teacher's authority that corporal punishment should be used.  If it is used on a few occasions normally it should not be necessary to use it again.  One must concede, if one is realistic, that there may be circumstances in which a teacher in a certain situation would have to use corporal punishment but, nevertheless, corporal punishment <Col N="594" /> should not be necessary to a good teacher.</P>
    <P>If one takes this view how does one frame regulations to try to ensure that this is the approach in the schools? Senator FitzGerald mentioned one point that he thought very important, that the punishment should not be administered by the teacher who, as he put it, was offended.  I think that is a very good principle myself.  I have sometimes heard it said by would-be psychologists that one should never punish a child except in anger.  I think this is a complete misconception, and that so far as maintaining authority is concerned clearly corporal punishment should not be administered in anger. Senator FitzGerald made the point that one should try to ensure that the punishment was not administered by the teacher who as he said was offended.  He recognised that there are practical difficulties here, and, indeed, there are, particularly in the small schools.  In the one-teacher school there is only one teacher who has to administer it.  He suggested that perhaps the manager might do it but I doubt if this is a feasible proposition. In the two-teacher schools in practice it may work in some but normally you have a lady teacher in charge of the lower classes anyway and sometimes one in charge of higher classes and there could be practical difficulties there, but the principle is a very good one.  Let me point out that it is incorporated in the new rule as it was, indeed, in the old one.  The new rule says that corporal punishment should be administered only by the principal teacher or another member of the school staff authorised by the manager for the purpose.  That is very important.  I would strongly recommend that it be utilised in schools so as to ensure as far as possible that punishment is administered where it is necessary by a teacher other than the teacher decreeing it necessary to administer punishment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the real problem involved in this question is that we have for one reason or another amongst our 14,300 teachers <Col N="595" /> some people who are guilty of what might be described on occasion as sadistic punishment of children.  It should be self-evident that in any such case that person is not fit to be a teacher.  Mind you we have not got very much of it.  Indeed, in so far as any positive evidence is concerned we have virtually none of it having regard to the number of teachers and the number of cases that have to be investigated. I believe that there is a little more than come to light officially for one reason or another but I do not believe that it is widespread or extensive. I do, however, believe that where it exists it is in the interests of the pupils, of the parents and of the other teachers that such people should not be allowed to continue teaching.  Therefore, it seems to me that we ought, if we are really sincere and constructive in this matter, to direct our attention to devising suitable methods of bringing such cases to light and to have them impartially investigated and, if found to be cases of the kind I have mentioned, to ensure that the proper disciplinary action is taken against the teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courses which are open to me as Minister for Education, if there are complaints of ill-treatment of children by a teacher, consist basically of in a minor case the issuing of a warning to the teacher that a recurrence of such conduct will lead to penalties, in a somewhat more serious case the withholding of portion of the teacher's salary, and in other cases either a temporary or a permanent withdrawal of recognition of the teacher, which means that during the period of withdrawal that person cannot teach.  If it is permanently withdrawn he can never teach again.  I have from some things I heard got the impression that some people think these powers have never been exercised, but I want to assure the House that all of them have on occasion been exercised.  I want to make it clear here, as I think Senator FitzGerald asked should be done and is right to do so, that it is a cardinal point in all this, and I want to make it as clear as I possibly can, that while I believe that the number of teachers who indulge <Col N="596" /> in excessive punishment is very small, nevertheless, if cases of this kind of conduct come to light I am determined as Minister for Education to ensure that full disciplinary action will be taken against those teachers whether they are lay or clerical, that vicious or excessive punishment by teachers will not be tolerated as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>One problem that arises is how does one get information about such cases. I want to say that I should like as many parents as possible to know this, that in the first instance the parent should talk to the teacher, and if the matter cannot be sorted out the parent should talk to the manager, and if the parent does not get satisfaction he should say so and then get in touch with the Minister for Education, and I can assure the House that any complaints that are made to the Department of Education in this regard are investigated and we do make every effort to get at the truth, including whether there appears to be any substantial ground for a complaint and the holding of an inquiry of the kind to which Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred which was held last week.</P>
    <P>I do want to make it clear, though, that there are two sides to every complaint, and that it is quite wrong and unfair to accept one side of these matters as being the truth without even hearing the other side. I want to point out also that I, as Minister for Education, have a quasi-judicial function in this matter in that report made to me as a result of such inquiries have to be assessed by me and the steps to be taken, if any, decided by me.  Therefore, I must ensure that the parties to such a complaint get a fair hearing and an opportunity of presenting their side of the story.  This I endeavour to do. If, on the other hand, one of the parties to any such allegation feels that it is important that there should be full publicity for the matter it is open to them to have the case heard in the courts where full publicity will be given, but in many such cases publicity would be disadvantageous and might very well inhibit the making of complaints.  It seems to me that <Col N="597" /> if a parent wishes to have publicity for the allegations made by him or her he or she can do so but it should not be a rule that there would be full publicity to all such inquiries because the net effect could very well be to inhibit the proper investigation and detection of complaints of ill-treatment of children.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington made some references to a case today in which he said there had been ill-treatment by a teacher of two children. He mentioned the names of the children and of the teacher.  The first I heard of this matter was when Senator Sheehy Skeffington mentioned it.  I must say that it was unfair, in my view, of Senator Sheehy Skeffington to mention the names concerned when apparently he has heard only one side of the story and when, as far as I know, there has been no investigation of the complaints and when I also know that a surprisingly high percentage of allegations of this nature, when investigated, turn out to have no foundation in fact but to be founded on things other than those alleged.  I feel that such a course by Senator Sheehy Skeffington was lamentable and that it hardly conforms to the plea he made that not only must justice be done but that it must be seen to be done.  I do not think that either of those requirements was met in his references to that matter here today.</P>
    <P>Indeed, my faith in Senator Sheehy Skeffington took somewhat of a beating today.  I have felt that he is a man of considerable intellectual power and of tremendous intellectual honesty even though I disagree with a number of points of view that he has taken.  But when I see him doing what I have just referred to and when I hear him give a most tendentious version of a jury's verdict in one of the cases to which he referred, I cannot help wondering whether he really believes the case he is making when he finds he has to resort to those kind of tactics.  Perhaps I am wronging him in this.  It may be that he is carried away by the initial prejudice or misconceptions to which I referred earlier.  However, I feel he might have another look at both of <Col N="598" /> these matters in his own mind to see whether he is really doing justice to the case he is making by such actions as this.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that a number of the points Senator Sheehy Skeffington made have been repeated parrot-like by people who got them in the newspapers. Senator Sheehy Skeffington indulged in a little more of this when he quoted a letter which appeared in the <i>Evening Press</i>.  A writer to the <i>Evening Press</i> apparently asked: &ldquo;why does the Minister for Education not listen to his critics?&rdquo;  or else it was headed that way, and it mentioned the delegates &mdash; plural &mdash; to the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis who had criticised his decision in this matter.</P>
    <P>The facts are that one delegate made one reference to it and he was out of order.  He was repeating what he read in the newspapers, too, even to the reference to the English perversion. We got the whole lot &mdash; one man, and it was out of order.  It is interesting to see how this can develop: one misconception or misstatement in a newspaper and suddenly you find people all over the place repeating it as gospel.  It behoves all of us to look at this performance in our society and to see that we are not taken in by it.</P>
    <P>I did say that I felt a constructive approach to this would be directed to suggestions for finding better methods of detecting vicious treatment by teachers of children and of dealing with this.  I have given some throught to the matter.  I have some ideas in my mind which I have not quite worked out yet.  It seems to me that there is room for improvement here.  I would welcome suggestions from Senators on these lines.  In particular, I would welcome such suggestions from Senator Sheehy Skeffington rather than the approach which he has been making. Even if he is still convinced that we should abolish corporal punishment completely, I am sure he recognises he is in a very small minority and that this is not a practical proposition, anyway, and that being so, he might like to direct his efforts to try to improve the position based on retaining corporal punishment.</P>

      <P>It is one suggestion but not by any means a complete answer. The Senator quoted some statements I made, before becoming Minister, on this.  I have not altered my view one iota in regard to the efficacy of such associations.  Of course, I know they have their drawbacks also but this does not mean we must forget about them.  There have recently been some developments in this regard which I am watching with considerable interest. I do feel we might see what develops and encourage it, not let it get off on the wrong foot, and, even if it would ever be advisable to deal with such things in the Rules, which it may not be, but, even if it ever were, it would be premature to do so at this stage. We should try to ensure that they get off to a good start and that we do not spoil the whole idea by mishandling it at the beginning.  I believe that, properly constituted, they can be of considerable benefit to the parents and to the teachers.  There are, however, many pitfalls involved.  Some of the people who would support this motion would not be the best advertisements for parent-teacher associations and, indeed, might be the very people who would spoil the whole idea and cost us the benefits which could accrue to us by a reasonable development of this idea.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has said, there are probably three points of view about this motion which is before the House this evening.  Some of us think that corporal punishment in general is a bad method of punishment and should be abolished or very <Col N="600" /> stringently restricted.  Others take the view that, on the whole, it is a good method of punishment and that the teacher should be given wide freedom in applying it.  Then, there is the third group, to which I personally belong, who take the view that corporal punishment is sometimes a good method and sometimes a bad method and that, consequently, it should be permitted but only under the most careful regulation.  The success or failure of this motion really depends on how that middle group decides this evening.  I can see that the Minister belongs to that group.  I hope that we might pull him a little closer to the left eventually and, if we do that, many of us will be satisfied.</P>
      <P>In considering the matter we should keep one or two distinctions in mind. I mean the distinction between bodily pain and psychological suffering, and the distinction between physical injury and psychological injury.  What I mean by psychological suffering is humiliation, and what I mean by psychological injury is mental unbalance. Previous speakers this evening have already referred to excessive exaggeration.  I shall do my best to be balanced.  I shall not give or quote any actual cases from primary schools because I simply do not know of any such cases.  I shall speak in terms of theory.  I should like the House to consider three theoretical cases, and perhaps it might help to make up our minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the first case.  Suppose a pupil is flagrantly disobedient and the teacher &mdash;rightly I think&mdash;decides on corporal punishment.  Suppose the teacher punishes him immediately with a flexible cane on the hand.  The pupil will feel acute physical pain, there is no doubt about that at all if the teacher knows how to use this cane properly, but the pupil will not feel much psychological suffering.  There will be very little build-up of fear because the punishment comes immediately and there will be no great humiliation.  The risk of physical injury in such circumstances is slight. A flexible rod on the hand is unlikely to damage the bone structure.  I am sorry Senator Jessop is not here this <Col N="601" /> evening to assist us in this matter, but it seems to me that there is very little chance of inflicting serious physical injury and no likelihood at all of inflicting psychological injury in the case I have just mentioned. Nobody's mind will become unbalanced from that kind of treatment. Therefore, I am with the teachers in the proper use of corporal punishment in the right circumstances.</P>
    <P>The second case I should like to mention&mdash;and I have had this on occasion myself &mdash; is a box on the ear.  This has been referred to already this evening.  The physical pain is acute, I know that.  The psychological suffering is slight because the hand goes out very quickly and it is all over in a moment.  But the risk of physical injury is great.  As we know, the ear is a delicate organ.  In fact, I know of two cases, one in particular, when a boy was constantly boxed on the ears during his school days.  When he became a man he suffered from acute ear trouble.  This was inflicted in a secondary school.  He took an action against the school and, I think, failed but many believed that his ear trouble was caused by that kind of punishment. I have another case in mind where a person suffered from acute abscesses as a result of having been boxed on the ear in school.  There is a grave risk that such results may come of that type of treatment.  But in such cases, the psychological injury is small and, if it were not that the teacher might seriously damage the ear, I personally would not be much against a box on the ear.</P>
    <P>Take the third case and this is where the Minister should very seriously reconsider the regulations.  I shall take the worst conditions of all. Suppose the same pupil is flagrantly disobedient &mdash; and I am entirely in agreement with the Minister that physical punishment should not be inflicted for stupidity or mental disability or anything of that kind &mdash; but I do think it is sometimes the best way to deal with flagrant disobedience &mdash; and he receives another kind of punishment, punishment on the back, after having to take up what can only be <Col N="602" /> described as a degrading posture.  Let us consider this.  The physical pain is much the same, but the psychological suffering for a sensitive child is enormously greater.  There is humiliation, there is shame and there is disgrace. That is where the real damage is done &mdash; the risk of subsequent psychological injury in the sense of the child becoming unbalanced in mind or becoming embittered is serious.</P>
    <P>Only last week I was given a copy of a banned book.  I understand it is not illegal to read banned books, so I think I can confess this.  Now it happened that the first chapter of this banned book gave an appalling description or corporal punishment of the kind I have just described.  It brought out in the mind of this sensitive young man a psychological slur. It is arguable, but one cannot prove it, that this boy would not have written this banned book with this appalling picture if he had not had the experience described in the first chapter. That experience was physical punishment in the third way I have described.</P>
    <P>I could quote other examples.  In Joyce's <i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> there are descriptions of that psychological agony &mdash; not the physical pain but the pain of being publicly degraded in that way.  That is the kind of serious consideration we have to keep before us.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the problem I should like to touch on briefly, though this does not occur in primary schools.  It occurs in secondary schools and I regret to say the only example I know of is in one of the schools of the religious minority in this country.  This is the method of delegating the right to inflict corporal punishment to one of the boys, to a prefect or somebody like that.  I should be very greateful, indeed, if the Minister would consider introducing a regulation to prevent that.  Perhaps I am wandering from the topic of debate. Yet I should be immensely grateful to the Minister if he would consider a regulation preventing the infliction of physical punishment in secondary schools by anyone except the teacher. <Col N="603" /> He has this excellent regulation incorporated in the primary schools' rules. Would it not be well to take the example of the primary schools and apply it to the secondary schools?</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House much longer, but I would ask the Minister to think again about the third kind of case I put before him and to think on it, not alone for the sake of the pupils but for the sake of the masters as well. The fact is, as has been said already, there is a streak of cruelty in every one of us.  I am conscious of it myself. If you put a lavish feast before a person inclined to be gluttonous he will become a glutton.  Likewise, if you put alcoholic liquor in front of a man inclined to drink heavily he will become an alcoholic.  I believe the more freedom you give teachers to punish the more likelihood there will be that those very few people amongst our 14,000 odd teachers, whom the Minister has referred to, will take the opportunity, just as the glutton takes the food and the alcoholic man takes the drink.  The teachers need protection as well as the pupils.</P>
    <P>These are very deep moral waters. I shall not dive more deeply into them. My conviction is that while corporal punishment may be beneficial at times it must be inflicted as the result of a very careful regulation in our schools' Rules for the sake of the pupils and teachers.  It is because I believe that the psychological and physical welfare of our country as a whole is concerned in this matter that I second the motion. I still hope the Minister will be persuaded to restore the stricter regulations which I think provided a greater safeguard.</P>

      <P>Senator Sheehy <Col N="604" /> Skeffington has indicated that this in fact is what he would propose.  His motion calls for a reconsideration of the new Rules introduced by the Minister. The Senator's suggestion to this House, if I may refer to it again, is the abolition of corporal punishment in schools.  Without flogging a dead horse at this stage, because the Minister has very adequately answered any objection Senator Sheehy Skeffington has raised &mdash; and possibly, during my absence from the House, Senator Brosnahan did likewise &mdash; I feel that we should treat this subject in a very serious way, as did the seconder of the motion, Senator Stanford, and indeed most of the speakers to whom I have listened.  It must be said that the comparisons Senator Sheehy Skeffington made in the course of his speech were degrading.  I say this, not in defence of primary teachers, or indeed any teachers at all &mdash; I was a teacher myself for a short time&mdash;but in the interest of public morality as a whole.</P>
      <P>First of all, it is an unfortunate suggestion, even in jest, that there must be some young people who get the same pleasure from flogging as some of the Army gentlemen to whom Shaw referred.  Secondly, to look on the whole teacher-student relationship as almost that of a Clay-Liston or Clay-Patterson contest, when one takes into consideration disparity of weight and availability of weapons, is completely contrary to the reality of the situation. A teacher must never be regarded by his pupils or, indeed, by himself, particularly, as being in open combat with his pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to this this evening and I must say, in support of what Senator Ó Maoláin has said, that the whole trend of the Senator's motion and his speech to the House in moving it was in terms of physical violence.  &ldquo;Violence&rdquo; is the word he used much more often than the words &ldquo;corporal punishment&rdquo;. Violence was the main problem he appeared to raise in relation to this corporal punishment discussion and when he did not speak of violence, he spoke in terms of beatings.  It is most unrealistic and quite imprudent to introduce such notes into this debate. <Col N="605" /> The matter has aroused much more public controversy than it should have aroused by reason of the fact that suggestions of that kind have been made and this type of attitude has been allowed to go uncontested.  I must say, that like the Minister, I feel that this opportunity is a happy one for all of us to express with some degree of normal sense what we feel on this whole business of corporal punishment. Possibly, it might never need to have been said, had this hysteria not gone abroad.</P>
    <P>Having said so much, I feel at the same time, that possibly an issue has been raised this evening on this question of corporal punishment and there is very little I can add to what has already been contributed.  There is a matter, however, which I think was touched on by Senator FitzGerald, and which I feel could be elaborated on to some extent, that is, the position of the teacher when he inflicts corporal punishment in comparison with that of the parent when he inflicts corporal punishment.  While on this point, I I should say that Senator FitzGerald quoted the Constitution and the provisions of Article 42 which set out:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
    <P>It guarantees to respect the right and duty to provide for all these aspects of education.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular type of school designated by the State.</P>
    <P>Further on it says:</P>
    <P>The State shall, however, as guardian of the common good, require in view of actual conditions that the children receive a certain minimum education, moral, intellectual and social.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> In subsection (5) it goes even further. It refers to exceptional cases and this is what we are mainly concerned with here this evening.  It states:</P>
    <P>In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
    <P>It is written into our Constitution that where parents fail to provide this fundamental right of the child, the State shall, as guardian of the common good, endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but shall do so always with due regard to the natural rights of the child.  I say this particularly in relation to the suggestion by Senator Sheehy Skeffington that parents should be allowed to come to the schools and state that they do not want corporal punishment inflicted on their children, without any regard for the fact that a parent may not be, himself or herself, a suitable parent as envisaged by the Constitution.  I readily agree that this would apply to a very small minority of cases, but in so far as the interests of teachers and the interests of parents are concerned the child's interests should in all cases be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>A teacher will inflict corporal punishment only where the child is expected to benefit from it and the fact that a parent would come and say his child was to be exempt from corporal punishment might indicate that that parent was incapable or unsuitable in the matter of the disciplining of his child.  We have a problem, nevertheless, and a real problem.  When parents chastise, even to the extent of physical punishment &mdash; the Minister said this and most Senators will agree with it &mdash; they do so because it is necessary and they do it prudently and by virtue of their natural relationship with the child.  The Minister makes it clear that every good parent punishes his child, when necessary, in the interests of the child and also that having done so, he can make some effort to show his natural affection <Col N="607" /> for the child and get him to understand that the punishment was inflicted for his good.  This is an opportunity which a parent has and which a teacher may not have as readily, first of all, by virtue of the fact that the same natural relationship does not exist and, secondly, because he is dealing with a large number.</P>
    <P>Teachers should be extremely careful and mindful of that position when they find it necessary to inflict corporal punishment on their pupils.  They should remember that children do need to understand that it is in their own interest and they should make that clear to the children.  That principle is certainly included in paragraph (1) of the new regulations in Rule 130.  I shall not delay much longer on it.  Rule 3 deals with the matter of my own experience which I mentioned earlier and which Senator FitzGerald also raised, that punishment should not be inflicted where possible at all in the heat of the moment.  It might be more suitable to have a child sent to the principal of the school if such punishment has to be inflicted, but I do not think that I need labour this point at this stage.  It is clearly stated and we know the purpose of it.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which causes me some apprehension in Rule 2, which says that corporal punishment should not be administered for mere failure at lessons.  I am afraid that the experience of most of us, and certainly my own experience, and I have probably more recent experience than most Members of the House, is that it is inflicted for mere failure at lessons.</P>

      <P>It has been said <Col N="608" /> here that most of the pupils are normal pupils and most of the teachers are normal teachers.  If this rule has to be written into the regulations I feel that it applies particularly to pupils who apparently are slow and also and perhaps more regrettably to pupils who coming towards the end of their primary school days are being prepared for scholarships to secondary schools.  Sometimes the incentive they get to work somewhat harder to get higher marks, which may be in their own interests, for the purpose of scholarships, is this stick which the regulations say should not be administered for mere failure at lessons.  These are important matters which should be brought to the attention of the teachers in the various classes.  I have rather an open mind as to how advisable it is, but in so far as the Department have seen fit to write it in, then unless a strong case is made against it this regulation should be honoured and I am afraid that at present it is not being honoured.</P>
      <P>I certainly endorse what Senator Sheehy Skeffington has proposed and what the Minister has apparently accepted now and also, indeed, proposed both before his time as Minister and today in the House &mdash; these parent-teacher associations.  Anybody with a serious interest in education at any level would support that whole-heartedly.  There are obvious objections and some obvious problems but now is not the time for me to review them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter which we should have some regard for is that we have a responsibility also towards the teacher. From my short experience of part-time teaching rather than anything else I know that teaching does lay a stress on the human reactions which most other professions including politics never do.  The teacher is at all times in the limelight in most cases in primary schools before 40 young pupils who are very active and who may try sometimes to exhaust the patience of any reasonable human being.  For this reason men who would otherwise be more than adequately suitable for other professions may find that the stresses and demands that teaching makes on their reactions are rather <Col N="609" /> severe, and sometimes they succumb either by way of losing control or, unfortunately, by imposing severe punishment.</P>
    <P>In so far as they do impose too severe punishment in the circumstances, in the cases that would arise where the teacher is found unsuitable by the Minister and removed from his position as teacher, I think that every effort should be made to ensure that he is found suitable alternative employment, because this is a very special case.  He may be a man who is perfectly fitted for any other walk of life but a man who found that the stresses of educating young children are more than he can support.  I would certainly ask the Minister to consider that should any such regrettable case arise although I think it is highly unlikely that it will.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. What we are asked to consider is not Senator Sheehy Skeffington's good faith or otherwise or his idea or ideals on corporal punishment but the motion that is on the Order Paper.  My approach to this is, I hope, factual.  The question of punishment in schools is inclined to cause a lot of heat.  You have extremists on both sides.  On one side, you have a picture of 14,000 beleaguered national school teachers defending civilisation against half a million young thugs. On the other hand, you have the idea that here you have 14,000 national teachers beating the living daylights out of poor innocent kids.  Both are nonsense. I have had some little experience of teachers and I must say that, apart from my own personal schooling, which were very happy days, I have never <Col N="610" /> come across in recent years any incidents of teachers unduly punishing children.</P>
      <P>I must say that I have the greatest of sympathy for teachers, especially national teachers trying to do their work in circumstances which are very difficult.  This has been mentioned a few times already.  There are great problems facing them because of overcrowded schools and trying to teach children with different capacities.  You have in the one class bright kids and children who are retarded.  The job of the teacher is to bring all that class along.  I certainly would not have the patience myself or the ability to be a schoolteacher.  I have every sympathy with them in trying to do the job they have to do.</P>
      <P>On the other hand I cannot accept that because we have that situation, because you have overcrowded schools and that mixture of children who should be segregated according to their educational capacity or otherwise, there is, therefore, a need for corporal punishment.  I accept, as I must, that severe deliberate disobedience must be visited with corporal punishment.  I am not with Senator Sheehy Skeffington in being against corporal punishment as such.  I think it is necessary to maintain discipline, but we are asked to consider and pressing the Minister to reconsider the changes that have been made in the regulations.</P>
      <P>We have to have regard to what those changes are.  May I stress them again because I am judging this motion, as I said, not on the basis of extremes on both sides but on the basis of the changes that actually have been made.  I find that this previous regulation has now been omitted.  Subparagraph (3), which has been omitted, states:</P>
      <P>Only a light cane or rod may be used for the purpose of corporal punishment which should be inflicted only on the open hand.  The boxing of children's ears, the pulling of their hair or similar ill-treatment is absolutely forbidden and will be visited with severe penalties.</P>
      <P>Do we not all agree that that is a good regulation?</P>

      <P>Do we not all agree that this should be laid down for the guidance of 14,000 schoolteachers?  It is not for simply half a dozen schoolteachers. When you have a big number like that, it is necessary.  Is that, of itself, not a good regulation?  Why has it been omitted?  What is the effect of omitting it?  I was not very clear until I heard the debate here today but it seems to be interpreted by some people that the dropping of that subparagraph gives the power or authority to schoolteachers to use any other methods they may so wish.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in reply to that, mentioned, under subparagraph (4) of the new regulation, any teacher who inflicts improper or excessive punishment.  I ask the Minister to define the word &ldquo;improper&rdquo;. I still do not understand what he means by &ldquo;improper punishment&rdquo;.  If that old subparagraph (3) still stood, we should know what was meant by &ldquo;improper punishment&rdquo;.  Now, we have no opportunity to judge.  I do not believe that the 14,000 schoolteachers are sadists or are out to beat the daylights out of the children under their charge.  I do believe, and this is from judging myself and my own reactions, that it must be very difficult at times for anyone to control himself and to keep his patience when dealing with 30 or 40 young fellows.  I understand that it would be necessary, for the protection of the teacher, that these regulations would clearly be defined so that he would know how far he could go and how far he should not go.</P>
      <P>It is unfair, and I think the Minister is accepting that it is a bit unfair, to schoolteachers that the regulations should be worked like subparagraph (4).  It would be much better if the old subparagraph (3) had been left in the regulations.</P>

My experience, going to school, was of the teacher sliding around with the cane swinging or the leather strap swinging all the time and the student was dodging continuously.

      <P>If the Minister is saying it would be desirable to omit these references to hair pulling and so on, I would go with him there, because that is purely negative, but it said:</P>
      <P>Only a light cane or rod may be used for the purpose of corporal punishment which should be inflicted only on the open hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has now gone.  I think it is a bad <Col N="613" /> thing that it has gone and that is why I am in favour of this motion.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest sympathy not alone with teachers but with the Minister because I think he is constructive. He is here in the House now defending, as it is his job, regulations made prior to his taking over the responsibility of Minister for Education.  I would have hoped he would give an indication here tonight that he would take an early opportunity of looking again at this whole problem.  I do not think this motion has been put down in any way critical of the Minister.  I do not think it would be any loss of face to the Minister.  We already have a lot of respect for him.  We would have greater respect for him if he came along and said: &ldquo;Refer this to me and I will look again at the problem in the light of what has been said in this debate, in the light of opinions expressed in newspapers, and so on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know there are cranks.  Cranks are part of our civilisation and part of our punishment.  However, they are entitled to their cranky views and to express them.  I am sure the Minister would listen to them having regard, of course, to the fact that they may be cranks.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this motion.  There is concern amongst ordinary parents in regard to the situation. The impression has been given that there has been a step backwards and I think it is correct when you look at what the old regulations were, and their sudden drop, and compare them with the new ones.  There is concern that what has happened is a step backwards and not a step forward as we would expect from this Minister.  I would hope the Minister would look again at this whole question and I would also hope he would examine the position, as referred to by the previous speaker, of punishing for mere failure at lessons.</P>
    <P>I know it is sometimes very difficult for a schoolteacher with a large class, who is trying to bring the pupils forward, not to feel annoyed, in view of his great responsibility, but the fact is that children are punished for mere failure at lessons.  On some occasions, the excuse is offered: &ldquo;This is not mere <Col N="614" /> failure at lessons.  This is disobedience. They did not do what they were told to do.  They knew very well what they were supposed to do but they did not do it.&rdquo;  In many other cases, however, it is due to inability on the part of a child to grasp things.  He may have tried his best but he simply has not got the brain capacity.  He goes to school the next day and he has not his exercise done or learned off something and he is slapped as a result.  That is bad enough: it does not help him.  It is bad for the whole pattern of education as such.  I hope the Minister will continue to impress &mdash; as I think he did here tonight&mdash;that it is a bad thing of itself. It is specifically forbidden in the new regulations, as it was in the old, but I am afraid that in many cases it is not observed.</P>
    <P>Another feature of it rather worries me, that is, the provision at subparagraph (3) of Rule 130:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Corporal punishment should be administered only by the principal teacher or other member of the school staff authorised by the manager for the purpose.</P>
    <P>In fact are all the ordinary cases of punishment to be authorised by the school manager?  If that is not so, I think that in many cases teachers&mdash; I may be wrong in this; I hope I am &mdash; feel they have authority to administer the punishment.  It would be a better arrangement if the principal had authority to do this and maybe in large schools he would need help, unfortunately, in this very unpleasant task. It would be to the advantage of the individual teacher that he should not have that responsibility.  I wonder has the Minister any information as to how many of the 14,000 teachers have authority under this regulation to administer corporal punishment?</P>

      <P>It is rather remarkable to note&mdash;if one is to be factual or realistic about it&mdash;that the New Testament could have been dictated and written in longhand in the period <Col N="615" /> today during which Senator Sheehy Skeffington tried to get us to believe that a garsún in Ireland should not get a slap on the backside when at school.</P>
      <P>I suppose that when I got up here most people thought I was 35 years of age.  Unfortunately, I am not: I am 50. When I was at school, I got slapped, not only on the backside, but on the hands and on many other places as well.  I will allow anyone here to examine me and I do not think he will find that there are any marks on me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator was not worth slapping: his IQ was too low. The position is that we must have some control over youngsters.  I agree with people like John B. Keane who say that the parents are the people who should administer the slap on the backside but the point is that they are not always under the parents' control. When they go into school, somebody must control them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never yet heard a complaint about a teacher unless he happened to be a brother-in-law of a TD or some such person.  One would think there was some type of inhuman race here who wished to punish their children in an outlandish fashion.  We do not. I do not subscribe for one moment to the type of stuff we hear of in England of a woman's dog being more important than her husband.  That is the type of stuff that has been put up to us here.  I have never heard of a teacher beating a child unless the child more than merited it and I can assure you that if that child came home to me, he would get twice as much.  You might as well bring in the example of a fellow trying to get a donkey across a gap.  What are you to do? Do you give the donkey a slap on the backside, or do you tramp half a mile for a carrot to entice him across?  Anybody with any type of intelligence will see that that is utter nonsense.  That type of stuff might have gone down 150 years ago but certainly not today. <Col N="616" /> It is a reflection on our people and an effort to hold us up to the world as inhuman people, a degraded nation. We all know we are no such thing.</P>
    <P>I often got a damn good hammering at school and I want to thank the teachers&mdash;they are dead&mdash;who gave it to me.  The point is this, and let us be honest and fair about it, the people who started this racket of no slapping, no punishment and everybody going along happy-go-lucky, are the British. They have the brains of a beetle, of course, and the Beatles they call them. Today we see what has happened there. One cannot walk the streets.  Let there be no doubt about it: it is because these young pups did not get the right punishment at the right time that they are now parading as blackguards in the streets.  If we pursue the same type of policy here, we shall find ourselves in the same position, and in a very short time.  Will we give our young fellows a slap on the backside or not?  My view is that it will do them no harm at all. In America, things are even worse. Those people said: &ldquo;There should be no punishment in the schools; our children should be brought up like little china dolls, rubbed down and so on but never hit&rdquo;.  They now know the result of that.  There is nobody in this House with any bit of commonsense who does not know I am telling the truth.  We all know perfectly well that youngsters have to be moulded.  If the people who mould them are not right, they will not be right.</P>
    <P>I should like to say here publicly&mdash; and there are a number of teachers on this side of the House &mdash; I have never yet heard a complaint about a teacher and in my opinion anything any teacher has done, be it to a girl or a boy, has been done in good faith.  I have never heard of a teacher who deliberately did anything to damage the future prospects of any child.  Anything any teacher has done has been done in the interests of the child.  I want to congratulate the teachers on having done it and I hope they will continue along these lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of this debate, and particularly in the Minister's <Col N="617" /> speech, reference was made to improper or excessive punishment.  I feel those words need to be more definite; they need something by way of definition.  I think, at this stage, the nature of the punishment should be specified.  Rather than leave it to the discretion of teachers, the nature and type of the punishment should, as far as possible, be specified as well as what is excessive punishment.  At some stage or other we will have to find out what is regarded as excessive punishment. It will be found that one teacher punishes a child to a far greater extent than another.  Although there is a great improvement now compared with the old times, the situation is not yet satisfactory.  I consider that corporal punishment is absolutely essential in all schools, until such time as the children are in their teens and have reached the use of reason and ought to be able to heed the admonitions of their teachers without the need for administering corporal punishment.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with corporal punishment in the national schools.  I presume it is because the national schools are not private schools where, of course, the Minister for Education has not a direct function, at least not so direct as he has in the case of the national schools.  The Minister spoke about the question of punishment and said that where a teacher punished a pupil, the case would eventually come before him.  That is not a satisfactory system because, first of all, as Senator Brosnahan mentioned sometimes a child, having been punished at school, will go home believing that he has been punished for something not quite exactly that for which the teacher believed he was punishing the child. There will always be an unsatisfactory situation regarding a teacher and a child as to what the child was punished for, what punishment he received and then the teacher's definition of that punishment.  I do not believe an arbitrary decision by the Minister will be possible, so far as the teacher and child is concerned, if the case comes before him.  That will have to be considered again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose the Minister takes disciplinary <Col N="618" /> action against a teacher, surely the teacher is entitled to come to court, take the Minister to court or have his case thrashed out elsewhere if disciplinary action is to be applied.  Of course, the child and the parents have rights, too.  The point I am making is this, that the question of arbitrary decision by the Minister will not be satisfactory and will not be effective.</P>
    <P>Let us remember this.  Our national teachers have been our nation builders mainly because the vast majority of our children have been educated in our national schools.  Many of them, too, have been sent to the Christian Brothers schools and we should not, in paying tribute to them, omit other teachers who also have been associated with the teaching of our children.  We must realise that the teachers are the people who step into the shoes of the children's parents.  Those children leave home and the discipline of their parents.  They are then under the discipline of the teachers.  We would be very foolish to hand children over to the discipline of the teachers and then harm the teachers by preventing them from exercising effective discipline.</P>
    <P>The only discipline a child knows is some kind of correction associated with, if you like, slight pain or the type of punishment he gets at home.  All teachers are not angels.  All of the 15,000 teachers are not angels.  There is the odd cruel brute among them and, perhaps, the spiteful cat amongst the women teachers.  Similarly, you have many little devils amongst the 500,000 children the 15,000 teachers have to deal with.  Generally speaking, we must face the fact that the regulations we are considering here are designed to deal with those exceptions.  They are designed to deal with the devils among our children or the difficult ones who will not pay attention in class, will not co-operate but will cause disturbance and interfere with the efforts of the teacher to give all the children in that class his best attention.</P>
    <P>That is the situation as far as the correction of the child is concerned. As I see it, the regulations are, in fact, designed for the isolated cases.  The average child is a good child, is obedient <Col N="619" /> and does what he is told and will be guided by the teacher.  Similarly, the average teacher must be a patient person. It is essential that teachers should be patient because they have so many different types of children to deal with in the one class.  There are many different levels of intellect in that class.  The teacher has to bring the children along towards a certain standard of education. We must extend co-operation to the teacher and give him an opportunity to ensure that his efforts will be effective.  He must be given the chance to exercise reasonable corporal punishment.</P>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion that the back of the hand is just about enough for children instead of the brutal, physical beating that some children are subjected to from an impatient or neurotic teacher, who is a person not suited to the teaching of children.  The teacher is associated very much with character formation.  When the child is away from home and is not being supervised by his parents, the teacher is really rearing him, making a good citizen of him and ensuring that the child will conduct himself properly in class and conform to discipline.  If we are going to eliminate corporal punishment in schools, or if we are going to take away a fair measure of discretion from the teacher, we can only expect to have a generation of hooligans, teddy boys, juvenile delinquents, and all those developments associated with non-discipline.  That is why it is most important to give the teacher a fair chance of exercising discipline by the administration of corporal punishment.</P>
    <P>Most of us will agree that many of us have learned what we know because we were afraid we would be punished in school if we did not learn.  Children are given exercises to do at home.  Perhaps they are asked to learn some poetry, do some writing or do a composition. If those children knew that they would not be punished and that the teacher would only smile at them if they did not make an effort to have a poem off by heart of their composition written or exercises done, surely you cannot expect an effort from the childrun <Col N="620" /> to do their home work.  If they know they can go in and just laugh up at the teacher and say that they did not feel like it, instead of coming in and saying: &ldquo;I learned my poetry or did my writting because I was afraid that if I did not do it I would be punished&rdquo;, there will be nothing done in the schools.  I for one am in favour of reasonable punishment for children who miss lessons by their own fault.  I do not mean lack of intelligence, but I mean lack of effort.  If they get instructions to try to learn something and they fail, the teacher will know the child and will know whether he has sufficient intelligence to have been able to do that home work.</P>
    <P>The teacher does a wonderful job considering that there are so many indifferent parents who make no effort at all to bring up their children as good citizens by ensuring that they will be properly punished and corrected at all times and advised about the right thing to do.  These are things the teacher has to do day in day out when the children go to school.  Considering that the accent is on education these days and we are striving in every possible way to raise the standard of education amongst our children and give them the very best in the form of education, we should not forget that the custodian of this effort is the teacher.  We must ensure that in every possible way our teachers will be equipped to give this higher standard of education to our children to bring them on.  Discretion will have to be given to the teachers and, indeed, as I think the Minister has mentioned, the Minister will have to go a little further and specify the nature of the only punishment that will be allowed.  He should not leave all the discretion to some unfortunate teachers who are not suitable for their profession but who will be brutal or cruel with the children just because they are neurotic, impatient or in some other way failing in the relationship between teacher and child.</P>

      <P>Years ago at school whenever the teacher in charge of the English debating society thought that interest was flagging in the society, he always put on a motion that corporal punishment should be abolished <Col N="621" /> Immediately the society blossomed again.  I think it is so, too, with the Seanad.  On deciding that I was going to speak in this debate, I took the liberty of talking to the doctors engaged in child guidance whom I know and asking their opinion on the matter of corporal punishment.  While there were some extremists, the more reasonable ones conceded that corporal punishment was allowable.  They were anxious to specify that it should be reasonable and were adamant that it should be on the open hand.  They did, however, agree that it was allowable and, in fact, rather necessary in the formative process.  This was for reasonable punishment.  They did not want any atmosphere of fear to be associated with it and I think that this can be very easily seen in two classes with different teachers.  In one the punishment will be accepted as a reasonable consequence of not doing one's work properly or of misbehaviour and there will be no evidence of fear and it will be accepted, as Senator Brosnahan said, as a normal everyday consequence just as if you parked your car you pay a fine.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that sarcasm and ridicule are so rigidly excluded in the regulations.  I personally would regard these as being more dangerous weapons than corporal punishment ever was. I know from the Minister's speech and that of Senator Brosnahan that the most important bodies concerned in education are very alive to the problem and we might say that we are not in any great danger in leaving it to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerning excessive punishment I will just make one plea, that if excessive punishment is proved then something is wrong somewhere.  No child wants to be punished and I cannot see any teacher willingly wanting to punish viciously.  Therefore, I feel that the Minister might, perhaps, as well as sending a probably practical inspector down to inquire, consider sending a psychologist down, too, as an observer, because somewhere in the situation something would have gone wrong. There would be a child who was impossible, a household at home that was very difficult and upsetting the child, a group of parents upsetting a <Col N="622" /> group of children &mdash; always you get something that sparks the explosion. On the other hand, it may be a teacher trying to cope with more than he can manage &mdash; big classes, a poor classroom, a cold, wet and draughty classroom, poor health, trouble at home &mdash; something causing shortness of temper that means that things cannot be managed as well as they should.  I do not think any child or any teacher gets himself or herself into trouble voluntarily. Therefore, I feel that the circumstances surrounding the incident will be often more important than the incident.</P>
    <P>I always regret when I see these things occurring in newspapers because I always feel that it is so easy to inflame and upset a group of parents or teachers, and at times I do not think that the press know their power and how in the lack of important world news or the washing of the Wexford railway line into the sea they can magnify trifles into events of national importance.  A lot of harm can be done by this kind of magnification of incidents.  While I agree that Dickens may have opened up and improved the situation, he existed a century ago. I would point out that people and children have not changed since then but circumstances have and conditions have improved.  I have no doubt that as we progress and as teachers are trained to recognise children who are perhaps a bit odd or mentally defective and need special courses or treatment and these are brought away from the average children to be looked after in special ways, the teachers themselves will come to know their aptitudes and will have smaller classes dealing with all grades in more suitable premises.  Then I believe that this problem will disappear and that corporal punishment will no longer be necessary nor will it ever be excessive.</P>

      <P>Most of the points have already been covered by the Minister and by Senator Brosnahan, and I am very glad of the discussion because I hope to goodness it has cleared up once and for all this question of corporal punishment.  This question is, indeed, in the same line as compulsory Irish.  It is one of the hobbyhorses for <Col N="623" /> a minority of our people who have chips on their shoulders and are making far more noise than their numbers entitle them to make.</P>
      <P>The Minister has pointed out the great improvement in the new Rule.  It spells out for the first time the types of mental and psychological punishment that may not be inflicted on children. I believe that mental and psychological punishment is far more dangerous to children than this little slight slapping that all the commotion is being heard about.</P>
      <P>From many of the things Senator Sheehy Skeffington said, we are led to believe that the teaching body is a band of irresponsible brutes roaming up and down the classroom, beating and chastising the children who are, as a result, not learning as much as they might otherwise learn.  It is well to point out that for the one or two teachers who overpunish there are hundreds and hundreds of overpatient teachers.  I have heard far more parents complain that their children were not getting enough lessons and that it was not seen that they did their lessons well enough rather than that they were getting to much of it and that they were overpunished.</P>
      <P>It was pointed out by some speakers that children have an acute sense of justice, and that is true.  Children will lose all respect for a teacher who does not show his authority.  We all know that, in our own days at home, there was always a cane over the mantelpiece, whether or not it was used, and the very fact of the cane being there was in itself a deterrent.  It is well known that the presence of a cane in the school is a deterrent to the bully and that it is a security for the timid child because the timid child knows he will be protected against the bully in the school.  Therefore, I believe that it is a national crime to listen to any criticism in this country that undermines any kind of authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one part in the Rules that says that teachers must have a lively regard for the improvement of the child: I think it goes some way like <Col N="624" /> that.  The only lively regard that I can see that teachers can have is to see that the children do their homework. No teacher has yet been born who can do this homework by remote control and, therefore, the children have to get down to this homework themselves and, as has been pointed out, they must learn their poetry and their lessons. Last week, I inquired from a few teachers how the homework was going. One asked: &ldquo;What do you do to a child who does not do the homework and who says &lsquo;I just did not want to do it&rsquo;?&rdquo;, or &ldquo;What do you do with a child who comes and says &lsquo;I did not do it because I knew you would not hit me&rsquo;?&rdquo;  How are you to deal with those two cases and they are definitely cases that cropped up quite recently?</P>

      <P>We have not yet found a parent who has not had to punish his child.  The teacher takes the place of the parent from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and surely the teacher should have the authority, if the child requires to be punished, to do it.</P>
      <P>Somebody referred to not punishing girls.  I cannot see any difference between the amount of Original Sin in girls and in boys.  I think it is far worse for a girl to grow up undisciplined than to get a few slaps in her early days which would teach her to respect authority.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of parent-teacher associations.  Those of us who live in the country know that this association exists unofficially.  Any parent who is really interested in his or in her child comes regularly to the rural school and finds out how the child is progressing. You may not have this association on paper but you have it in all the rural parts of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point I do not like in the Rules and that is that you have to go to the headmaster to be punished. <Col N="625" /> I think the punishment should take place when the offence is committed because there is nothing more upsetting to a child than deferred punishment. The very fact of going from one room to another takes on an immense proportion for a child, I think.  Even to have to go up to the headmaster to be punished is a punishment in itself. Therefore, I really do not think punishment should be deferred.</P>
    <P>Many times in this House during the past year when anything was spoken on education we were always referred to Scotland with its wonderful rules. Actually, I have a bit of a migraine and I cannot read for the House what they said in Scotland but they have not yet found a way of abolishing the strap.  They said that as soon as somebody invents some other way of keeping discipline in the school, they are prepared to do it.  I have in my hands <i>The Scottish Educational Journal</i> of 15th October, 1965, and, on page 962, there is an article headed &ldquo;Abolishing Corporal Punishment&rdquo;.  Therefore, as somebody suggested, if Senator Sheehy Skeffington had some bright idea in this connection he would do a great service to the Scottish teachers because they have been doing a great research on the problem.  There is a whole article here on it and they have not yet found a way of dealing with the matter.  The last paragraph of that article reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Deprivation, detention, suspension, expulsion&mdash;these, in ascending order of severity, are the main alternatives in countries where corporal punishment <Col N="626" /> has been abolished.  Before they can be expected to throw their straps away, Scottish teachers may fairly claim that they, too, should have the right to deal in this fashion with the small minority of problem children who persistently misbehave; that is, they should have the right to suspend, or even to expel them, in extreme cases.  Such measures are admittedly distasteful.  The question is, are they more, or less distasteful than the strap?</P>
    <P>There is a whole article on it.  The opening sentence of the article is: &ldquo;We agree in principle that the teaching profession should take steps to abolish corporal punishment and to examine in consultation with the Scottish Education Department other possible sanctions that might be used, with a view to determining effective alternatives.&rdquo;  However, while agreeing in principle, they say they cannot do away with the strap in Scotland until they get some better measure.</P>
