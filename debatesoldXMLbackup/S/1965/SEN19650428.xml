    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I come to the substance of the amendment, one of the definitions in the Bill is that &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The particular meaning of &ldquo;Minister for Industry and Commerce&rdquo; has changed since the Second Reading.  I should like to welcome Dr. Hillery on his first occasion here as Minister for Industry and Commerce and to wish him well in his relations with this House in the discharge of his duties.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), line 33, after &ldquo;on&rdquo; to add: &ldquo;otherwise than for the purpose of the working of the mine or quarry&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the position in regard to operations which are carried on at a mine or a quarry and in regard to which there might be some doubt as to whether they should properly be covered by the Mines and Quarries Bill or by the Factories Act.  The position is that, as the section stands, works on manufacturing are excluded through this particular Bill, they being covered by the Factories Act.  The form of amendment which I have put down would amend subsection (3) of section 3 in order to bring certain operations within the scope of this Bill, namely, operations which might otherwise be thought as purely manufacturing operations.  However, where the manufacturing of certain articles for the purpose of mining is concerned, it might be much better to lead to a unified code in regard to mines and quarries if these particular things were clearly under the Mines and Quarries Bill rather than under the factory code. I should be obliged if the Minister would give us his views on the position as it would be under the section as it stands and under the section as amended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment might not be necessary because of the <Col N="1307" /> words &ldquo;subject thereto&rdquo; in line 32 which bring in any procedures ancillary to the processing of mines.  It does what the Senator wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  The Minister, then, is quite satisfied that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;subject thereto&rdquo; gives the clarification which the amendment looks for?</P>

However, there are certain differences on which I should like clarification. There is a definition of &ldquo;parent&rdquo; on page 10, line 16.  The first question I should like to ask is quite a minor one. In the drafting of the section, &ldquo;parent&rdquo; is defined as the person with whom the child is living.  My question is whether it is clear that this defines a specific individual in a case where the child is living with both parents.  Are both parents covered by the definition?  If they are, is there any doubt as to which parent should act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

      <P>The wording is different from the corresponding provision in the British Act and I take it there was good reason for the variation. The definition in the British Act proposes the idea of the person who is receiving a direct benefit from the wages of the young person employed in the mine or quarry.  I am perfectly satisfied with the Minister's assurance on the point.  One other point involves the use of the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo;. What is its meaning in this context? Does it mean prescribed under this Act or prescribed under any other Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 51, to delete &ldquo;(other than a special regulation)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position under section 8 is that the regulations made under the Bill <Col N="1309" /> shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  However, it is provided in section 8 that special regulations need not be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The special regulations to be made under this section are regulations which do not apply to all the mines or all the quarries of a particular class.  There is a reasonable case that these regulations should not be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, that a regulation which might apply only to some minor matter involving some small mine is not a matter which should properly become the concern of both Houses.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, is there not some small danger here in completely excluding all special regulations?  It may well be that if the Minister made a special regulation under the Act which did not cover all mines or all quarries of a particular type, nevertheless it might cover a very large majority of mines and quarries.  He might make special regulations in respect of three-quarters of the mines or quarries of a particular type and would thereby be laying down regulations covering the greater part of the industry.  The reason I put down the amendment is to point out that we may be drawing the line a little hard and a little too far away from parliamentary review of the regulations by excluding all special regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>A special regulation is a regulation applicable to one mine or quarry only, so there would have to be a series of special regulations to bring about the effect the Senator mentioned. As the Senator says, it would be a bit much to ask that both Houses of the Oireachtas should have a copy of every special regulation.  There is a wide arrangement for consultation and, as the Senator knows, every application must be accompanied by a draft, and the Minister must give notice to the person affected of his intention to make the regulation.  He must also make arrangements for the provision of copies of the draft and for facilities for lodging objections.  He must consider objections which are made, and if an objection is made by the owner of a mine or a quarry, there must be an inquiry, so <Col N="1310" /> clearly there is a wide arrangement for full inquiry and consultation.  It is hardly necessary to put in the amendment which the Senator suggests.  Again we go back to the fact that the special regulation applies to one mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appreciates that the necessity for coming to the Dáil and the Seanad could be circumvented by making a series of special regulations.  If a Member of either House thought a special regulation should properly come before the House, I wonder could the Minister give an undertaking that he would be prepared to deal with it expeditiously.</P>

      <P>If the Senator feels strongly that there is any danger that the Minister would use the device of having a series of special regulations made to cover an area of policy rather than an individual mine, I think the amendment could be accepted, but I do not think there is any such danger.</P>

      <P>Section 11 provides for the carrying into operation, on the coming into force of the new Act, of certain provisions in previous Acts, which will be repealed on the commencement of the new Act.  I should like to ask the Minister how does he intend to implement the new Act.  Apparently the position is that on the commencement of the new Act all the regulations now in force in regard to mines and quarries, will become regulations prescribed under the new Act.  We would then have all the regulations coming into force, and they would not have had the benefit of the procedure outlined in the Second <Col N="1311" /> Schedule.  There is a very excellent procedure outlined in the Second Schedule for proper review, and for submissions by all interested parties. In regard to the new procedures, is it intended to have any review, any consultation, and to take advice from interested bodies before the commencement of the new Act, or does the Minister intend to bring in all the existing regulations holus-bolus in their present form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

      <P>The only other point I should like to raise is the question of the great necessity for an informative publication of what precisely the position is when the new Act comes into operation. This is a complex and rather technical measure.  It is difficult to study it and to find out what exactly it means.  I had great difficulty when I was attempting to study it in finding out the position in regard to mines and quarries legislation.  As soon as this Bill comes into force all the regulations will be regulations under the Act.  I think it is highly desirable that there should be a digest of information and a summary of the position under the Act.  In Britain the position in regard to the Mines and Quarries Act, 1954, is very clear.  Actually there are four volumes which give an explanation of the mines and quarries code.  I think we might well follow suit, perhaps not in such detail, but I think a volume should be issued of the new code for mines and quarries which would cover the statutory position and also the regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 38, to delete &ldquo;planned, laid out&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment because as the section now reads it mentions the duty of the owner to secure that the mine or quarry &ldquo;is planned, laid out, managed and worked...&rdquo; I was a little worried that there might be a danger of ambiguity as the section is drafted.  It is drafted as if the words &ldquo;planned&rdquo; and &ldquo;managed&rdquo; were mutually exclusive terms.  I do not think that this is so, and I think it might be well if we could distinguish between planning which is done before the mine is in operation and planning done after the mine comes into operation. It seems to me that planning and laying out done after a mine comes into operation is part of the managing function, and as the part of the managing function should be reserved to the qualified manager appointed under section 13.  As the section stands, there might be some doubt as to the powers of management which are delegated to the qualified manager.  The manager must be qualified; the owner need not be.  If we leave the power of planning to the owner, who need not be a qualified person, there is a danger that a dispute could arise.  It might have to be determined in court whether or not a certain operation after the mine has started to produce was a function of planning or a function of management.  The purpose of the amendment is to clear that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the ambiguity.  I imagine the owner has an overall responsibility for everything to do with the mine.  The manager has prescribed responsibilities under the owner.  I do not see that there can be ambiguity in respect of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>My worry is that there is no doubt that any planning done in advance of the working of the mine before operations start is properly the preserve of the owner.  There is no doubt about that.  What I am worried about is, after a mine has started to operate there might be certain <Col N="1313" /> functions and there could be doubt as to whether these were planning for the continued operation of the mine or management.  A question arises as to whether the owner can intervene over the head of the qualified manager on matters which could be held as planning, since they were long term rather than managing, which might be held to be the day to day operation of the mine.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 4, to delete &ldquo;(if any)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall make a case first in regard to the amendment to section 13.  Subsection (1) of section 13 reads: &ldquo;...no mine shall be worked unless there is a sole manager of the mine, being an individual duly appointed and having such qualifications (if any) as are required under this Part&rdquo;.  There is no doubt that the whole spirit of the Bill is that there should be more close control over the particular qualifications which the manager of a mine should have.  I do not know if there <Col N="1314" /> will be any difficulties on the commencement of the Act in regard to this &mdash; that regulations have not been made.  If there were any difficulty of that sort, I think it is very undesirable that it should be left open as it is now open under this subsection, that there would be no regulations in regard to the qualifications of managers.</P>
    <P>The whole spirit of this particular Bill is that managers must be highly qualified persons.  I know the parliamentary draftsman likes to leave a number of loopholes of this sort by putting in &ldquo;if any&rdquo;?  but I think it would be a most reprehensible position if at any period this Bill were in force as an Act and there were no regulations in regard to the qualifications of mine managers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 15 it is specified that qualifications are required only in places where fourteen persons work underground.  You can have managers who have no academic qualifications or specified qualifications, but in all cases the Minister would require that they would be suitable persons from experience or otherwise. I think the amendment would go against the spirit of section 15 which provides that a mine manager must have qualifications only if more than fourteen persons are employed underground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that there will be, and there has been in the past, different degrees of qualifications for different types and sizes of mines.  It is absolutely reasonable that there should be different qualifications where more than fourteen people are employed than where there are fewer than fourteen people.  I think that is no reason why we should have a position that there is no one single regulation for the qualifications of a person who is going to manage a mine in which twelve people are employed.  I feel, even if there are only half a dozen people employed in a mine, there should be some regulation in this regard. There is no need for us to say that in a small mine a person should have a mining diploma or so many years of experience of mining underground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> I think it is entirely reasonable to say that no mine should be worked in this country unless there is some definition of what the qualification of the manager is.  We should not lose sight of the fact that we will probably find under the operation of this Bill that there may be more accidents and more danger in the smaller mines than in the larger ones.  For the protection of the workmen there should be some qualifications. The Minister has ample power under this Bill to differentiate between the qualifications for the different types and sizes of mines.  I feel it is setting an extremely bad headline if we leave this open.  There should be no class of mine for which there is no qualification.  In other words, an owner can employ anybody.  He can put in his unqualified and perhaps not too competent son as manager of a mine just because not more than fourteen people are employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Dooge on this point. I think it is most important that the manager of a mine should be a fully qualified man.  The question of the number of men has never been specifact is it is a mine, a serious business, and as everybody knows all over the world where mines are operated the number of men have never been specified. I am surprised at the point made by the Minister regarding the small number of men involved.  The fact is it is a mine and men are underground and need to be protected.  We know the greater the number of men the greater the responsibility.  The principle is the same; there should be a qualified man performing a job of that kind.  In most jobs not so serious as this, management generally see that they get a qualified man to run the industry.  The first thing they do is see whether a man is qualified to do a particular job so that everything will go right.  For that reason, I think Senator Dooge has made a very important point.  It is a serious matter to allow a provision such as section 13 go through in the Bill in that way.  An owner might decide that he had not many men employed and it did not <Col N="1316" /> matter who his manager was.  The principle is the same, the dangers are the same and the reasons are the same why we should see that no risks are taken whether it involves one life or a thousand lives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; are not required in the subsection. If no qualifications are prescribed, then there are no qualifications prescribed for the post.  Why should &ldquo;if any&rdquo; be prescribed?  Surely the word &ldquo;qualifications&rdquo; does not mean academic qualifications.  One might be qualified for a post by experience, by apprenticeship or other means.  I think if the Minister took out the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; there would be no difference in the meaning.  If no qualifications are prescribed, then no qualifications are prescribed.  I cannot see any point in having the words &ldquo;(if any)&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if this amendment would achieve what Senator Dooge wants.  Section 15 brings in this question of 14 persons.  A mine employing more than 14 persons below ground requires the manager to have qualifications which may be prescribed. A mine smaller than that does not require these qualifications.  I do not consider the changing of the words &ldquo;(if any)&rdquo; would have any effect.  The point being raised might be raised on section 15.</P>

      <P>Again, I am a little anxious about the position on the commencement of the Act, particularly in regard to the question of qualification. It may be that this is more appropriate to a later section but it is as well to raise the matter at the first available opportunity.  As I read the Bill before us, on the commencement of the operation of the Bill, the Act of 1911 will be withdrawn and the protection in regard to qualifications given under section 2 of that Act will no longer be available.  The Minister has already indicated that as he sees it the Bill will come into force and no new regulations will be made. Therefore, it looks as if there would be an interregnum during which the protection of section 2 of the 1911 Act would have been repealed and the special qualifications made by the procedure under this Act would not yet be in force.  There would therefore be between the period of commencement of the Act and the period of making regulations, in regard to qualifications, no statutory provisions in regard to qualifications of mine managers.</P>

    <P>This amendment is again to cover the transition period between the mines and quarries code which we have at the moment and the new code which we will have on the coming into operation of the regulations under the Bill. If this amendment were accepted, it would mean that the position would be that we would start off with the assurance that we had all the safeguards and all the necessary qualifications laid down which we had under the 1911 Act.  If there happened to be any interregnum between the passing of the Bill and the making of regulations, this amendment would provide that during the interregnum the qualifications which must be held by mining managers would be the qualifications of the repealed section of the 1911 Act.  It would also provide that these would remain in force until such time as they were either modified by extension <Col N="1319" /> or reduction in any respect.  This amendment would be an added safeguard in case the Minister finds himself unable to bring in the Act and the regulations on the same day.  It would also provide that during the interregnum we have the regulations under the 1911 Act carried out.</P>

I should like if the Minister could give some indication as to what his policy will be, in the new regulations, in regard to qualification. It is tremendously important that any new regulations made under section 15, and any qualifications to which section 15 gives effect, should be not less stringent in any way than the regulations set up over 50 years ago under the 1911 Act.

      <P>In this Bill, as it stands here at the moment, it seems to me that there is a presumption that no owner and no manager of a mine will employ a specialised surveyor.

There is no duty on the managers of mines to appoint surveyors because their operations are not covered by the various paragraphs here in section 18 which provides that the managers shall appoint people to secure this, that and the other.

      <P>Section 32 deals with the means of ingress to and <Col N="1326" /> egress from mines.  On comparing this with the provisions of section 22 of the 1954 British Act, the provisions proposed by the Minister here appear to be somewhat more severe than those of a relatively recent Act in Britain.  It seems to me that the provisions here in this respect are a little too severe.  There is a statutory restriction which calls for the fact that there shall be at least two shafts of egress from every seam being worked. On the Second Stage I dwelt at some length on the particular position of mining in this country, on the fact that mining in Ireland very often consists of small seams.  There are many cases in this country where we have several small pits being worked in the same mine.  Under the British code as I read it, these very small pits are part of the same mine and could use a common exit.  However, it appears from this section that small pits, no matter how adjacent, must have separate exits.  Maybe I am reading this as being a little more severe than it actually is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that that will meet it.  It is better to be severe and to give exemptions than to be lax at the beginning.  One other point on the section is the provision that will apply following the accidental closure of an exit.  The position under the section is that the manager is bound to maintain at least two outlets from every seam being worked.  What is the position of the manager in the event of the accidental closure of one?  There is no doubt that work must immediately cease but they have had a great deal of experience in Britain in this field and they are not particularly careless, yet they provide that the manager has discretion, if he posts special notices and sends notice to the Minister's inspector, to allow the shift to be worked out and safety workers to go underground for 24 hours.  This is a case in which special exemption might be made under subsection (7). It would be desirable in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to a similar difficulty earlier in cases where ten or more persons are employed at the same time.  If we have nine we are not compelled to provide two exits. My suggestion is that when there are fewer than ten men working they should not be permitted to work apart or at any great distance from the one exit.  Some distance should be laid down.  It could easily happen that a small number might be scattered and work apart.  It might only be one but there could be 20 or 30 working together and they need not be near an exit.  I am concerned with the principle. There is a great danger and a great risk where the management are free to have only one exit.  The principle appears to be wrong.  The manager is free to extend the area where they work.  Something may happen away from the exit and nine people, or the ten who are allowed under this Bill, may not be near the exit and can easily get lost.  I do not like to have that principle in the section, once it involves more than one, two or three people.</P>

      <Col N="1329" /> Section 145 lays down the procedure in regard to certain notices which inspectors may serve.  This point was discussed on Second Stage.  Section 145 refers to occasions on which an inspector requires an owner or a manager of a mine to do something more than is specifically laid down by statute.  Where an inspector lets off an owner or a manager by giving an exemption, or by requiring something less, there is no need for this appeal procedure.  Under section 37, it seems to me that this is the only section where we can have an increase of standard, and any exemption given under subsection (2) is not an appropriate exemption for the procedure of section 145.  The point of the amendment is that unnecessarily elaborate procedure has been invoked in regard to exemptions under subsection (2).</P>

      <P>I should like to raise a point on which I might well have put down an amendment, but I forbore to do so because the list was becoming rather long.  As it stands, section 38 is identical with the similar provision in the United Kingdom code, but it omits subsection (2) of the corresponding section which allows a statutory defence to a manager or an owner, on the ground that the vehicles have been used on the roads for the sole purpose of repair, or in the case of sudden subsidence.  The position is that the statutory defences which are allowed in the United Kingdom are not allowed here, and I should like to ask the Minister is there any significance in their omission.  Does he agree it is reasonable that certain roads which would not be used during the time of normal mining should be used for the purpose of repair, or might need to be used in the case of sudden subsidence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this because on comparison I found a distinct difference between the section here and the corresponding section of the British code, in that a statutory defence which is allowed on a prosecution under this section in the British code has been omitted from this code.  It seems severe that we do not allow our mine manager in this country to use these <Col N="1331" /> particular roads for the purposes of repair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 136 sets out the different defences.  That is probably the reason for not having it in this subsection. Section 136 is a blanket defence section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a blanket all right but not thick enough to keep the manager warm.  The defence is that it was impracticable to define, or to avoid contravention.  Let us take the case for the purposes of repair, where a manager wishes to allow a particular vehicle to be run on a particular road which is relatively narrow. You have allowed him a defence.  He will contravene section 38 by doing this and the defence you allow him is that it would be impracticable to avoid it.  In Britain, he would be allowed the defence that if he used it not for the purposes of mining but for the purposes of sending in a man to repair, he is then allowed a proper defence.  It is a deliberate act on his part to do it for the purposes of repair. I feel that the blanket defence in section 136 is not quite sufficient and I think the code is rather severe on managers.  I would hope that this provision would not be invoked in practice by the Minister's inspectors, where certain things were done purely for the purposes of repairs.  As I have no amendment, I do not want to press it further.</P>

      <P>This section prescribes certain duties for the manager of a mine in regard to support of the mine.  Certain measures must be taken if there is any movement of the strata. I should like to ask the Minister whether this imposes an obligation on the person who is manager of an idle mine, or a person who would be manager of a mine, parts of which have been abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Senator means is: if the mine ceases to be a working place, does responsibility devolve on the manager?  I think this question arises in the section relating <Col N="1333" /> to abandoned mines.  Part VII of the Bill says that owners must fence abandoned and disused mines.  It is a responsibility of owners of mines not being worked.  As the Senator knows, the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act empowers the sanitary authorities to make dangerous places safe, places such as mine shafts and quarries, whether abandoned or not. I think what the Senator wants done is covered in both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Part VII imposes the onus on the owner to fence an abandoned mine, but section 49 imposes a duty on a person who has been manager of a mine which became idle.  He has a duty to maintain the support within that mine.  There is the instance of a mine, part of which has been abandoned, where unless the manager's authority is revoked, he has a duty to maintain the support in this abandoned mine, or the abandoned parts of a mine.  I raise this particulary because there is no provision in this section for an inspector to give an exemption order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this would give rise to the point the Senator makes.  If a mine is abandoned, it is covered by Part VII which I have mentioned.  If there is an abandoned part of a working mine he has the responsibility to keep the working part of the mine safe and to ensure that the abandoned part would not endanger the working part in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>

      <P>This section deals with the provision for lights and safety lighting in mines.  At the present moment this is not terribly important in regard to mining in this country because we do not have gassy mines here.  I am sure all of us hope that mining will expand as an industry and it may be that in future we will have to deal with the question of gassy <Col N="1335" /> mines.  Therefore, we should deal with this section as if it were equally as relevant as all others.  There is a provision here in regard to safety lamps and similar apparatus but the position is that there is no provision similar to the provision which occurs in the codes of other countries whereby it is an offence to interfere with safety lamps or lighting equipment of any type.  This is a matter of such prime importance in other countries that it is actually made an offence to damage, interfere or tamper in any way with safety lamps which are used in gassy mines.</P>
      <P>During the Second Stage of the Bill there was some discussion as to whether mine managers should be given power to introduce certain regulations on their own or to be able to fine workmen for breaches of the regulations.  The Minister's predecessor felt it would be undesirable to do this. If we do not introduce any ruling here which makes it an offence to interfere with safety lamps or to tamper with them in any way then there is no provision for this.  Amendment 13, which I shall move on section 75, seeks to repair this in some way.  I thought it well to mention this matter on this section.</P>

      <Col N="1338" /> Section 75 deals with the duties of the manager and other persons in the case of danger arising in a particular mine. As the section reads at the moment, if the manager or other authorised person finds out that there is any danger of inflammable or noxious gas he can take certain precautions.  It seems to me that, as the section reads, the manager is asked to take these precautions only if he knows this thing of his own knowledge.  The amendment proposes that the manager may immediately take all the safety precautions that he can, and withdraw all the workmen from the mine and do all the other things necessary to be done as soon as it is reported to him by anybody and that there is no necessity for him to know this thing of his own knowledge.  I think that is what would happen in practice.  There is, I think, a slight danger that a manager who withdrew workmen needlessly might be subject to action by his owner for having done so when he did not personally know there was a real danger.</P>

      <P>The section provides that regulations may require provision for washing and changing, canteen facilities and an adequate supply of drinking water.  It was suggested on the Committee Stage in the Dáil that the provision of some of these amenities should be made a statutory requirement and the Minister undertook to look at the section to see if it would be possible to separate the minimal requirements from the desirable ones.  As a result of the examination which was made, it was considered that the supply of drinking water should be a statutory requirement.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>Before section 95 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where the person in charge of a part of a quarry is of opinion that a danger exists at any place in that part, he shall comply with the following requirements, namely:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  he shall forthwith cause all persons employed in so much of that part as appears to him to be affected (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;affected area&rdquo;) to leave it;</P>
      <P>(b)  unless he is a manager of the quarry, he shall, forthwith ofter complying with the foregoing paragraph, inform his immediate superior or, in a case where he is responsible to two or more immediate superiors, each of them within whose jurisdiction any part of the affected area is situated, that the danger exists;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  so soon after complying with paragraph (b) of this subsection <Col N="1341" /> section (or, in a case where that paragraph does not apply, paragraph (a) of this subsection) as it is possible so to do without undue risk, he shall himself ascertain, or cause some competent person to ascertain, the condition of the affected area and the measures that it is necessary to take for the purpose of rendering it safe.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where, on any occasion, persons have been caused to leave an affected area in pursuance of the foregoing subsection, no person shall thereafter be permitted to enter it so long as the person in charge of it is not satisfied that it is free from all danger:</P>
    <P>Provided that nothing in this subsection shall be taken to prohibit a person from entering an affected area for the purpose of saving life, giving effect to paragraph (c) of the foregoing subsection, rendering that area or any other part of the quarry safe, or ascertaining either the effectiveness of any measures taken for the last-mentioned purpose or whether, apart from this proviso, persons may lawfully be permitted to enter the affected area.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where persons have, on any occasion, been caused to leave an affected area in pursuance of subsection (1) of this section, the person who caused them to leave it shall record in a book to be provided for that purpose by the owner of the quarry particulars of the reason for his causing them to leave that area and of the matters disclosed as a result of giving effect to paragraph (c) of that subsection and subscribe his signature thereto.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is adequate and very good provision in the Bill for the withdrawal of workmen in the case of danger in mines.  There is no provision in the Bill for the withdrawal of workmen from a quarry in the case of danger suddenly arising.  I have sought in this amendment to provide that, in the case of quarries, the manager should have the duty to withdraw the workmen.  If we look at what is happening in this country <Col N="1342" /> at the moment and at what is happening in our mines and quarries we must agree that there is probably greater danger to life and limb in the operation of quarries than mines in the country.  Accordingly, I think this would be a useful provision to have in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator is equating section 75 in relation to mines.  With regard to danger from noxious gases and inflammable gases, it is a danger which does not arise in the case of quarries.  Generally, the dangerous working conditions in quarries can be covered by section 90 and by general regulations.</P>

      <P>My point here is a very minor one.  It seems to me that the provision in paragraph (e) in regard to the people who will have power to appear at an inquest differs from other provisions.  There is no definition of a friend of the deceased person on whom the inquest is being held.  There is a particularly loose provision by comparison with appearances in respect of the workers.  In one instance the provision is very strict whereas elsewhere it is loose.  Here you are restricted to a person appointed in writing by the majority of the persons employed at the mine or quarry, whereas any person may turn up claiming to be a friend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This runs right through the Bill.  The protection of the workers is always on the basis of a majority of the workers in the mine or quarry. Presumably at an inquest which sets out to determine the cause of death, any question concerning the workers <Col N="1343" /> in the mine or the owners of the mine would be in relation to conditions of working.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In line 33, before &ldquo;as&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and maintained&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> We should insist specifically on the responsibility to maintain the abandoned mine in a safe condition. That is the reason for my amendment. It appears to me that there is a possibility the duties under section 105 could be discharged by making the entrance safe once and for all but that there would be no liability to maintain it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be desirable but it would be very hard to enforce it. You can, of course, propose that every abandoned or unused mine be sealed and fenced by the owner but if, after some years, you find that the seal has broken down it might not be possible to put the onus on an individual to maintain it.  I would refer the Senator to another Act of the Oireachtas, the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1964, which empowers the sanitary authorities to undertake the onus to make dangerous places such as mines safe and, if possible, to recoup the cost from the owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to press this point too hard but it seems to me better if we placed the onus under this Bill.  If it became impossible to trace the owner, then the provision could not be enforced.  If an owner is abandoning and closing down a mine he can do certain work.  He can do it in two ways.  He can do a job that might cost more money initially but which would need very little or no maintenance afterwards, or he could do the job at a lesser initial cost but which would need maintenance later. By leaving out the duty to maintain we are encouraging owners to do a skimpy job initially at less cost. It seems to me it would be far better if we put the onus on the owner to maintain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  It involves a matter of life and death.  Some child may enter a mine and lose his life. Even if it is not intended to enforce it on every occasion, it would be better to add here the words suggested in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Seanad to the fact that owners are <Col N="1345" /> required to make an efficient sealing off which will be subject to inspection. If the owner can be found he can be required to contribute to the cost of maintenance under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1964, and I do not think this amendment is, therefore, necessary.  We have an Act under which maintenance can be ensured and we can here require that the first sealing off is efficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor shall we have the advantage of knowing that the person appointed to carry out the inspection on behalf of the Minister to see that the first sealing off is efficient will be a person qualified from the point of view of intimate knowledge of mines and quarries.  The Minister should make things doubly safe.  There may be a case of a child's life and it would be far preferable to have provision under two Acts than that the life of one child should be lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I can guarantee that the intention of the inspector of mines would be to ensure that the first sealing off would be efficient.  I still feel it would not always be possible to implement this. There is another Act under which places can be made safe, and if the owner is able to contribute, or available to contribute, he can be made to contribute under that other Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of inspection. We can guarantee to the Seanad that the first sealing off will be efficient, but to accept the amendment would mean continued inspection by inspectors of the Department of Industry and Commerce, whereas in the other case the onus would be on the local sanitary authority, which would be much more convenient.</P>

      <P>The onus should remain where they are in a better position to know where there are abandoned mines.  All abandoned mines will be known and listed in the Minister's office, in the office of the mining inspector.  Having made the initial inspection, they would be in a position to look at the sealing off and say: &ldquo;This is a good job but it should be inspected in 12 months time.&rdquo;  They may say of another case: &ldquo;This sealing off has been done properly, and it need not be inspected for three years.&rdquo; They would be in a better position than the sanitary inspector of a local authority to judge the condition of the sealing off of the mines.  I do not like to differ from the Minister on this point, but I feel he is being unwise in not accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>This Bill is intended to protect the actual workers in mines and quarries, and still I feel that this matter, which is a very serious matter, has been quite reasonably dealt with under the other Act.  I will undertake to the Seanad to see that the local sanitary authority are always advised where a mine is sealed off within their area by an inspector of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I still feel that disused quarries and mines should come within the sanitary services rather than under a Bill calculated to protect the workers.</P>

      <P>Can we be sure the Minister's successors will do the same thing?  Secondly, why should the section be in the Bill at all if it is not to be a good section?  As it stands, <Col N="1347" /> it does not refer specifically to workers, and the effect of the section is much more likely to be on people wandering around in the district.  There will not be any workers if the mine is disused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Sealing off operations have been the business of the inspector of mines, but accidents which may arise in a disused mine after one, two or three years, can hardly be considered to be the business of the inspector of the conditions of employment in the mines.

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 109 deals with restrictions on the employment of women and young persons.  I understand that the hours of employment which are prescribed here arise from an ILO Convention to which this country was a party.  I also understand the hours which are prescribed in accordance with that ILO Convention will make things extremely awkward for mine owners due to the fact that the hours of shift work here do not suit these particular hours.  As I understand it, the ILO Convention was originally drafted and passed on the basis of shift hours of work in British mines.  The position is that our hours of shift work are different from the hours in British mines.  Accordingly we find ourselves creating a very awkward situation for our mine managers because of our adherence to the ILO Convention.  I would ask the Minister that in future when any ILO Conventions of this type which involve hours of work, are being discussed, to see that extreme care is taken to ensure there are not any circumstances in a particular industry which would make it awkward to apply the Convention here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What redress, if any, has a miner in the event of his being turned down by a mine owner on the basis that he is affected by coal dust? Coming, as I do, from a mining area, I find that a miner affected by coal dust is black-listed.  He goes from one mine to another seeking employment, and fails to get it.  I do not think there was any provision in the old Act for a medical inspection.  It may be said that he is looked after by the mining company through workmen's compensation, but I know of a case recently <Col N="1349" /> where a man did not get workmen's compensation.  He applied to the Department of Social Welfare for unemployment benefit but, according to the Department, he was fit and capable of working, although he had been ostracised and turned down by the various mines.  Unfortunately, there is a black-list.</P>
      <P>There are various degrees of coal dust.  I understand some men may be more affected by it than others.  I also understand a man may have that complaint for years and yet live a normal life.  Some provision should be made in the Bill for people who may be affected by coal dust.  It is a terrible hardship on a man, after working in a mine for 40 years from the age of 16, to find he cannot continue in that employment. I am quoting an actual case.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;( ) In the event of the publication by the Minister of a book containing such portions of the Act, orders and regulations made under the Act as apply to any particular class, the manager shall give a copy of such book (if he has not already done so) to each person of that particular class who is employed in the mine at the time of publication of the book or who is newly employed in the mine after that time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I adverted earlier to the position we <Col N="1351" /> will have when this Bill becomes law. It is a good code in regard to mines and quarries in this country but it will, by the time the Minister has made regulations under the Act, be a complex code.  I think there is a duty on the Minister to publish in a convenient form what the particular code will be. It is in anticipation of the Minister seeing the necessity to publish a book containing certain statutory provisions, orders and regulations under the Act that I move this particular amendment. It ensures that in the event of the Minister providing these publications it would then be the duty of the managers to make them available to the people to whom they apply.  Accordingly, this amendment not only imposes a duty on the manager to make the publications available but in a sense it also looks in the direction of the Minister strongly urging that such publications should be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Bill stands the manager is required to keep copies of the Acts, orders, regulations and rules affecting the mines and to permit employees to read these.  It would be difficult to justify employees being given copies of all these.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to exercise all the commonsense we all know he has.  To make a copy of an Act convenient at all times to a man who is handling explosives underground is not meeting the particular case in this manner.  I think the Minister should not leave completely behind him his zeal for education. What I would envisage being done is that there should be a series of publications so that the man whose job it is to light a fuse underground would be able to have a publication which would tell him the statutory duties appropriate to his particular conditions in the operation of the mine.  It is no use handing a ganger a series of roneoed sheets, which are statutory orders so-and-so, or refer him to <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is a job here not only of laying down a proper code for mines and quarries but also to undertake the <Col N="1352" /> task of making it available.  This has been done in Britain for many years. Every person at every level in operation in Britain can secure details of his particular work.  I should like to state the different volumes which are issued in Britain.  There is a volume issued which applies to the duties of all underground workers.  Volume two applies to the duties of surface workers.  Volume three applies to the duties of winding engine men.  Volume four applies to the duties of mechanics and electricians.  Volume five refers to the duties of deputies and shotfirers. Of course, there are the larger volumes which will specify the duties of managers, deputy managers and the like.  It would be as well if the Minister brought some of his zeal for education into the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Here is an excellent opportunity to lay down a code to educate the members of a team in an industry as to what their duties are so that we can get away from the idea that you can go to the Post Office and look it up provided you go at a particular hour of the day.</P>

      <P>If the Senator undertakes to withdraw the amendment I shall undertake to exercise the commonsense he prescribes for me in informing the workers.  Of course, any such arrangement for giving these publications out would not relieve the manager of making known to the workers what their duties are.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> Before subsection (2) to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) Inspectors appointed for the purposes of this Act to inspect mines and quarries shall have had practical experience as miners or quarriers as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that this should be in the Bill.  No doubt the Minister will make regulations but I think the man appointed should have practical experience. It will put an onus on the inspector that such and such may have to be done.  It might be an emergency. Very probably the manager of a mine might use bad language and he will have to bow to the will of the inspector who may never have had any practical experience.  I feel an inspector should at least have practical experience of mines.  I have no idea what type of man the Minister would appoint but it should be set out in the statute that he shall have practical experience.  We have set it out in section 104 that the employees must have practical experience.  I am sure anybody working in a mine, where perhaps an emergency regulation was about to be made by an inspector, would prefer to work under one who had practical experience of mines or quarries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice to require inspectors to have this type of experience.  I consider this amendment would perhaps restrict the Minister somewhat if it were taken as a matter of course that suitable practical experience would be required of a person who was to be an inspector. I might say it has not been the practice to make the differentiation in the case of mines or quarries.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the provision of inspectors and <Col N="1354" /> I take it that an inspector will have the functions of promoting the prevention of accidents and also the promotion of productivity in mines.  I should like to ask the Minister how many inspectors does he envisage will be appointed and what does he accept will be the average number of inspections per year of a working mine?</P>

      <P>In the first place, I do not think the inspector, under this Act, would have any function in relation to productivity except in so far as safety and the welfare of the workers are concerned.  He would have no direct responsibility for productivity. The position under this Act is that we wish to ensure the safety and welfare of the workers.  With regard to the number of inspections, I shall have to inquire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (d) (i), page 54, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;so&rdquo; in line 37 to the end of the subparagraph and substitute &ldquo;provided that no one shall be required by virtue of this section to answer any question or to give any evidence tending to criminate himself.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill reads:</P>
      <P>so, however, that no answer given by a person in pursuance of a requirement imposed under this subparagraph shall be admissible in evidence against him in any proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of the amendment is, I <Col N="1355" /> think, more usual and has been used in other Bills.  It is, if anything, slightly broader than the words used in the Bill.  This has been used in the Factories Act.  The words as they stand in the Bill might possibly be used in an unfair manner against a person being questioned.  I can think of a conspiracy charge against two people working in a mine.  The evidence of each of them could be used against the other under this subsection.  If those people were charged with conspiracy and both were compelled to answer questions, each of them could give evidence against the other.  The evidence might be unfair against one of them.  I put this amendment down because I do not see why there should be a change in wording from that in previous Bills.  I do not know why the draftsman could not keep to the same wording as has been used in previous Bills.  It would be much more suitable to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention was to put in a phrase additional to that in the Factories Act by saying no answer given would be admissible as evidence. The Factories Act says that a person need not answer a question which may incriminate him.  This leaves an anxiety or responsibility on the person being questioned to determine what might incriminate him and might have the effect of completely wrecking the person's answer because of the fear of incrimination.  As this section is drafted, no answer given by the person questioned can be used in evidence against him.  It would have the effect of protecting him completely and relieving him of the responsibility of determining whether such evidence could incriminate him.  This seems to me to be better than the Factories Act, even though it is a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine if a conspiracy charge arose under the Factories Act, they would have to sign a declaration but a person would avoid answering a question which might incriminate <Col N="1356" /> him.  Under this Bill he need not answer it at all.  His answer is negative or positive.  This is more like a coroner's inquest.  This type of investigation is to find out something rather than incriminate a person.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;( ) If the responsible person objects to the remedy required by the inspector under this section he may within seven days appeal to the Minister in writing stating his objections to the said remedy and the Minister's decision thereon shall be final.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is put down simply to give a person the right to make an appeal to the Minister.  I think that otherwise matters could be held up for a considerable time in a mine if an inspector and a manager-owner disagreed over some important point.  The inspector could indicate a requirement of any kind whatsoever under the section as it stands.  It might take a long time for any change to be made in that requirement if there is no right of immediate appeal to the Minister.  It might hold up the whole working of the mine.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether some immediate method of dealing with perhaps a disputed requirement by an inspector under that section could be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator appreciates what my objection would have been. The appeal machinery already contained in this Bill would be cumbersome and slow.  This section is aimed at a position of imminent danger or disaster which has to be dealt with at once.  An appeal with any slow-moving machinery, at a time like that, would be very undesirable.  But, having once taken action, the owner could then appeal to the Minister.  This is erring on the safe side.  The Senator can see <Col N="1357" /> why it would be more desirable to close down a working, while awaiting the outcome of an appeal, than to allow people to work in imminent danger of catastrophe.</P>

It would be in the event <Col N="1358" /> of some condition of imminent danger or catastrophe or accident that the inspector would do this.

Somebody must then make a decision as to which precaution is the one to take in the immediate time because, as the Minister now says, perhaps there is imminent danger in the mine.
