    <Title>Air Navigation and Transport Bill, 1964&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time:</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The objects of the Bill are stated briefly in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the text. Under the provisions of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, the Warsaw Convention has the force of law in this country in relation to carriage by air between Ireland and other countries to which the Convention applies.  In general terms, the Convention provides that when an accident occurring during international carriage by air causes death or injury to a passenger or damage to cargo there is a presumption of liability on the carrier.  The Convention enables some compensation for death or loss to be obtained, without litigation.  The contracting carrier's liability for each passenger under the Warsaw Convention was limited to 125,000 gold francs, <Col N="1257" /> approximately £3,000.  Under the Hague Protocol to the Convention, which was given effect here by the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1959, the limit was doubled to about £6,000. In any case, however, where wilful neglect or misconduct can be established against the carrier there is no limit to his liability.</P>
      <P>The Warsaw Convention governs only cases where the contracting carrier performs the carriage and does not contain particular rules relating to international carriage by a person who is not a party to the agreement for carriage, such as, for example, the case where a passenger has made an agreement for carriage by one airline and that airline arranges for the passenger to be carried by another airline.</P>
      <P>In order to cover cases of this kind, the Convention, Supplementary to the Warsaw Convention, for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air Performed by a Person other than the Contracting Carrier was concluded at Guadalajara, Mexico, on 18th September, 1961. Under this Convention, if an actual carrier performs the whole or part of carriage which, according to the agreement of the contracting carrier with the passenger or consignor, is carriage subject to the rules of the Warsaw Convention, then he, as well as the contracting carrier, shall be subject to these rules.  The contracting carrier, is subject for the whole of the carriage contemplated in the agreement, the actual carrier solely for the carriage which he performs.  Section 2 of the Bill will apply the Guadalajara Convention to carriage between this country and other contracting states.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Bill reenacts with amendments section 18 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, which concerns the manner in which the liability imposed on the carrier by the Warsaw Convention in respect of the death of a passenger shall be enforceable and contains for the purpose of enforcement a definition of the expression &ldquo;member of a family&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 18 of the 1936 Act was first amended by section 4 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1959, to provide that in deducing any relationship, <Col N="1258" /> a person adopted under the Adoption Act, 1952, shall be considered a lawful child of the adopters and a person <i>in loco parentis</i> to another shall be considered the parent of that other.  The Civil Liability Act, 1961, further amended and replaced section 18.  This amendment was designed to bring the law in regard to fatal air accidents, as far as possible, into line with the general law governing fatal injuries.  The Civil Liability Act, 1964, amended the general law for fatal injuries by repealing the provision in earlier Acts limiting claims for mental distress to three years.  It is desirable to make the same provision in respect of air accidents.  It is also necessary to take account of the Guadalajara Convention in the application of the section.  Rather than introduce a series of amendments in the present Bill it is proposed to reenact the entire section as amended.</P>
    <P>The Warsaw Convention, as amended by the Hague Protocol, can, by section 20 of the 1936 Act and section 8 of the 1959 Act, be applied to internal carriage as well as international carriage by air.  It is desirable that internal carriage should also have the benefits of the Guadalajara Convention and section 5 of the Bill so provides.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation of the present controls over commercial air services is one of the main purposes of the Bill. I must emphasise that the controls referred to regulate air transport from the commercial viewpoint only.  The existing controls over the technical and operational aspects of aviation are not in any way affected by the Bill.  For example, the regulations concerned with ensuring the safety of the public will continue to apply to all aircraft, whether or not those aircraft come within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>At present the Minister's powers in this matter derive from two measures. The first is the Air Navigation (International Lines) Order, 1935.  This Order, which was made under the Air Navigation Act, 1920, was expressed to give effect to certain provisions of the 1919 Paris Convention on aerial navigation.  Under the Convention each contracting State was to make prior <Col N="1259" /> authorisation a condition of the establishment of international airways on its territory.  The Paris Convention has been superseded by the Chicago Convention of 1944 but the International Lines Order was continued in force under section 15 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936.  There are, however, certain doubts as to the validity and efficacy of the Order in present day conditions and its replacement is desirable.</P>
    <P>The Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1946, provided for the bringing into operation of and giving effect to the Convention on International Civil Aviation signed at Chicago in 1944. The Chicago Convention recognises that each contracting State has control of the air space over its territory and consequently proceeds to lay down that no scheduled international air services may be operated over or into the territory of a contracting State except with the special permission or authorisation of the State concerned and then only in accordance with the terms of such permission or authorisation. Contracting States, including Ireland, normally accord this permission or authorisation by way of bilateral air agreement with the State of Registry of the airline concerned.</P>
    <P>Such agreements are based on the premise that the State has control and that the Minister for Transport and Power, acting for the State, may attach any conditions he thinks fit to permissions or authorisations for air services issued by him.  It is thought desirable, therefore, at this stage, by enactment of the present measure, to put beyond doubt the State's control over air services to, from within or over its territory. It should perhaps be made clear that the intention is not to introduce any new or onerous restrictions on international aviation operations but to ensure that the State's powers are clear cut and unequivocal.  It is proposed that this control will be exercised through the provisions of section 6 of the Bill in conjunction with sections 7 and 8.</P>
    <P>The main control authorised by section 6 will be brought into operation <Col N="1260" /> on such day as the Minister may appoint by Order.  This will afford sufficient time for the preparation and publication of the necessary Order under section 7 and authorisations under section 8.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill restricts the operation of air services to, from, within or over the territory of the State unless the service is either covered by an order under section 7 of the Bill or by an authorisation under section 8. The services to be permitted by order under section 7 will include:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the type of services covered by our bilateral air agreements;</P>
    <P>(b)  flights for non-traffic purposes and overflights which may be operated by countries which, like Ireland, are parties to the International Air Services Transit Agreement which ensures between signatories automatic rights to overfly and make stops for non-traffic purposes; and</P>
    <P>(c)  the individual flights or short series of non-scheduled flights permitted by the Multilateral Agreement on Commercial Rights of Non-Scheduled Air Services in Europe.</P>
    <P>These flights are all of a type covered by international agreement, either bilateral or multilateral.  The list is not exhaustive; other categories of flights and extension of the present categories may arise in future.  It would be difficult to delineate and keep up to date all categories of flights in the Bill; authorisation by Order seems, therefore, a more appropriate method of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>In addition to the types of services to be covered by Order a number of air services of various kinds are operated such as charters, inclusive tours, casual non-scheduled flights etc. Control over such services is intended to be operated under section 8 of the Bill.  Under this section the Minister may issue authorisations to operate one or more flights under such provisions and conditions as he thinks appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the sections of the <Col N="1261" /> Bill which authorise control of international services will be used also for control over internal air services and over Irish aviation businesses.  At present under section 84 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, the Minister for Transport and Power may authorise the operation of internal air services only if they are carried on by one of the statutory companies&mdash; Aer Rianta or Aer Lingus or a subsidiary company&mdash;or by a person who is already authorised to establish an international air service, provided such international air service and the internal service are carried on with the same aircraft.</P>
    <P>Conditions have changed to such an extent since 1936 as to justify repeal of section 84 and the introduction of the measures proposed in sections 6 and 8 of the Bill.  This enables the Minister for Transport and Power in his discretion to grant an authorisation to any person to operate an air service within the State.</P>
    <P>Apart from the categories of flights which I have already mentioned, there is in Ireland a certain amount of small aviation business which at present is carried on by virtue of licences granted under Part X of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936.  The work authorised under these licences falls into three categories (i) aviation private hire business; (ii) pleasure flights; (iii) instruction flights.  Private flying as such is not subject to control under this part of the Act, neither is aerial photography or other such aerial work. It is most desirable that our legislation regarding the control of air space should be as compact and consolidated as possible and in view of the generality of sections 6 and 8 of the Bill, it is no longer necessary to retain Parts IX and X of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936.  It is proposed, therefore, to repeal these Parts and to cancel licences issued under Part X.  Fresh authorisations under section 8 of the Bill will be issued to the holders of existing licences and the conditions and provisions attaching to the new authorisations will as far as practicable be in line with those attaching to the existing licences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1262" /> The definition of an air service in this Bill will exclude from the proposed controls private flying, executive type flying and aerial work generally as well as instruction flights.  These excluded categories will, therefore, in future be subject only to the operational control exercised from a technical and safety aspect and will not require a special licence or authorisation under this part of the Bill.  Part X of the 1936 Act contains provisions relating to applications for the grant and renewal of licences, attachment and amendment of conditions, commencement and duration of licences and other similar matters of detail.  It seems more appropriate to deal with these matters of detail by means of regulations rather than by an Act of the Oireachtas and it is so proposed in the Bill.  The fees to be charged for authorisations will be fixed in consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It has already been mentioned that under the Chicago Convention scheduled international air services may be operated over or into the territory of a contracting State only in accordance with the terms of the permission or authorisation given by the State concerned. Here also it is felt desirable, at this stage, to put the position beyond doubt by enacting sections 9 and 10 of the Bill.  Section 9 gives the Minister power to fix by Order rates and fares charged on air services while section 10 gives him the right to approve or refuse to approve of the fares or rates proposed to be charged on such services.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate that the necessity for fixing rates for carriage of passengers, cargo or mail by Order will arise very frequently because the present method of fixing international rates is on the whole working satisfactorily. This method, which is set out in most of our bilateral air agreements, provides that the rates to be charged on the air routes governed by the bi-laterals shall be agreed by the designated airlines of the countries concerned. Agreement shall where possible be reached through the rate-fixing machinery of the International Air Transport Association (IATA).  The <Col N="1263" /> rates so agreed must then be submitted for approval to the aeronautical authorities of the countries concerned. If agreement is not reached the aeronautical authorities themselves shall try to determine the tariffs.  If the aeronautical authorities fail the matter can be referred to arbitration appointed by the parties themselves or in the final analysis by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the present method of fixing international air fares and rates, through the IATA machinery, has on the whole worked quite satisfactorily.  As I have already stated, the IATA arrangements insofar as they affect transport to or from Ireland are subject to my approval.  In these circumstances, it is not likely that use will often be made of the rate fixing powers in the Bill to control scheduled airline operations unless IATA fails to agree on rates.  The fixing powers will of course also be applicable to non-scheduled operations and to non-IATA airlines, so that if necessary, control of these rates, which are not at present subject to any special control, can be effected.</P>
    <P>Sections 11, 15 and 16 of the Bill provide for the making of regulations for the keeping of records and statistics, the production and inspection of these records and the submission of extracts, copies and summaries.  I think Senators will agree that these provisions are desirable.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 of the Bill provide for penalties and detention of aircraft. There are two types of penalties, administrative and legal.  Administrative penalties can take the form of revocation or suspension of the traffic rights of the airline concerned.  The advantage of this type is that it is efficient and can be implemented at once.  The disadvantage is that it is on occasion too strong a sanction and may not then be enforceable in that it would mean an unfair punishment on the travelling public.  Legal penalties as provided in section 12 of the Bill include fines and/or imprisonment.  On summary conviction the fine proposed in section 12 is £100 or imprisonment <Col N="1264" /> for six months or both.  On conviction on indictment the money penalty is raised to £1,000.  These sums are, of course, small as far as airlines are concerned; a more real deterrent is the power of detention of aircraft under section 13 of the Bill.  The ultimate sanction would, of course, be denunciation of the bilateral agreement with the country of registration of the air operator concerned.</P>
    <P>This Bill relates to commercial aviation only and therefore proposes to exclude State aircraft from its scope. The Minister for Transport and Power may, however, by Order, direct that such provisions of the Bill as may be specified in the Order shall apply to State aircraft.  A similar provision appears in the 1936 Act, and it is desirable to repeat it here.</P>
    <P>The usual provision regarding the laying of Orders and Regulations before both Houses of the Oireachtas applies to all Orders and Regulations made under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in this Bill with which anybody could quarrel, at least, insofar as it is designed to give effect to the provisions of the Guadalajara Convention, which has to be done in order to carry out international arrangements between all the airlines and then, of course, there are certain amendments in relation to the Warsaw Convention relating to transport.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Minister is taking certain controls over internal aviation. The international arrangements are by agreement between all airlines.  We all agree that the Minister should have the powers provided in the Bill over the airlines flying internally.  From a safety point of view, that is absolutely essential and as time goes on, there will be increasing need for more and more control of all kinds because of the growth of air traffic.  At present the airlines have an extraordinarily high safety record and it is only by control that that record can be projected into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all agree with the Bill insofar as it gives effect to the Guadalajara Convention but the Second Reading provides <Col N="1265" /> us with an opportunity to say a few words about airlines and about our own airline in particular.</P>
    <P>One feature of international airlines is that there is really no competition because rates are fixed internationally and it is difficult to see how, in the present set-up, there can ever be any competition as regards fares or freight rates.  At present freight rates are too high because of the fact that weight is the real consideration in flying, both in relation to passengers and freight. It was pointed out in the Dáil that for highly valuable goods that do not weigh heavy, air transport is the best, the quickest and perhaps even the safest way to send such merchandise but in the case of goods of a heavier nature, air transport is much too expensive.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the position in that regard will be in the future but there is a proposal at present that certain kinds of heavier type freight will be carried at special rates.  I do not know how far that proposal has gone. It seems to me that the only competition that exists at present is in the matter of service&mdash;if one airline gives better service than others&mdash;and in personnel. Recently there was talk about having films projected in aeroplanes.  I hope that will never happen.  Film shows would be a disturbing factor to those people who do not want to be disturbed in that way and it would be an additional nuisance to the present arrangement allowing people to smoke.</P>
    <P>I suppose that originally smoking was allowed in aeroplanes because people were nervous in the early days of flying and smoking cigarettes relieved tension.  That time has passed. It is a grave imposition, especially now that it is known that smoking can be so detrimental to health, that people should be allowed to impregnate the passenger cabin of an aeroplane with smoke and those who do not want to smoke should be forced to breathe in tobacco fumes.  Personally, I find that most objectionable.  Some passengers may feel ill as a result of a bumpy passage and by the fact that people are puffing cigarettes alongside them.  The question of permitting smoking in aircraft <Col N="1266" /> should be reconsidered.  It is not a great deal to ask people to abstain from smoking for the one and a quarter hour duration of the flight from Dublin to London.  Many passengers would welcome a restriction on smoking.</P>
    <P>The debate on the Bill in the Dáil was availed of for the purpose of eulogising State operations as opposed to private enterprise.  This is not a case in which comparisons should be made between State enterprise and private enterprise or in which a State enterprise can be eulogised because it is as successful as Aer Lingus is.  Aer Lingus is a great success but, in fact, airlines are included in the special kinds of operations that could only be carried out by the State in our particular circumstances.  The capital investment is enormous, as also is the depreciation of equipment of all kinds, especially as newer and faster planes seem to be the order of the day.  It is only a State-operated company that could afford to put up the capital investment necessary and to stand the high charges of operation and the high rate of depreciation.  Nobody quarrels with that.  An airline is one of the operations that simply could not be carried out, in Ireland at any rate, by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>We are all very proud of Aer Lingus but the airline is an expensive operation and we know that it does not, in fact, really make a profit when the capital investment is considered.  It makes an operating surplus.  I have no objection to that.  We are, I think, all very happy with Aer Lingus and our other airlines so far.  As I said at the outset, this Bill is necessary in order to implement international arrangements and we are in full accord on it.</P>

      <P>The Seanad should, I think, agree to the Second Reading of this Bill because it is desirable we should enact as quickly as possible something which has been internationally agreed.  I must say I was surprised to discover the Warsaw Convention did not apply where one changed carriers.  If one bought a ticket on one airline and was switched to another at some point in the flight one <Col N="1267" /> was not covered then by the Warsaw Convention.  It is very necessary, in my opinion, that any other airlines participating in the completion of a flight should be bound by the Warsaw Convention.</P>
      <P>I understand that is one of the matters covered in this Bill.  With increasing traffic between Ireland and the Continent many international airlines participate and it is very desirable that all the participating companies should be similarly covered. Many people would, in fact, prefer to complete their journeys to and from the Continent in Aer Lingus planes, but the flights up to now have not always been suitable.  With the new jets I imagine many more people travelling between this country and continental countries will prefer to take Aer Lingus flights.  I know from my own experience that, if there is any choice, apart from normal patriotism, I prefer to travel by Aer Lingus.  I have always had the impression that one is in better and more capable hands on Aer Lingus flights.  That may be imagination, but the general impression seems to be that Aer Lingus is a very good, efficiently operated nationalised undertaking.  We can all be proud of its success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that under section 7 there would be practically automatic rights to overfly.  In the 1946 Act the authority of the State to control its air space was recognised and it was under that Act, I think, that there was an obligation on planes flying over this country to set down at Shannon.  For some period in our air history that was the position.  If planes wanted to pass over our air space there was an obligation on them to set down at Shannon. One of the purposes of that arrangement was, I think, to compel planes using our air space not merely to set down at Shannon when they found it convenient to do so or when operational or safety purposes dictated it.  I do not know when that changed and I do not know the reason for the change.  I should like the Minister to tell us what the reason is for the change when he comes to reply.  The <Col N="1268" /> practice now is to overfly the southern part of the country and not to set down at Shannon.  Anyone travelling down south sees the trail of the jets passing over almost continuously.  I think only a small fraction of the number which pass over set down at Shannon.  Am I right in thinking there has been a change in the obligation?  If there has been I should like the Minister to tell us why the change has been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is governed largely by international agreements and all we can do is to give it a welcome.  Obviously, we are not free to make changes in its provisions. The Bill provides largely for the regulation of commercial operations.  These are themselves governed by very strict IATA rules.  It always seems to me that these rules are framed to suit the big, independent carriers, such as American Airlines, Trans-World Airlines and so on.  They are rather restrictive on what one might describe as small, national airlines like our own.</P>
      <P>We should not, I think, operate the Convention in a restrictive way because I look on Aer Lingus as the property of the country as a whole. Empty seats mean a loss to the country.  If we could use these seats to boost some other part of our economy, whether it be freight or tourism, we would be to a large extent merely putting the money from one pocket into another.  If, by giving greater grants to Bord Fáilte for the development of tourism, that money finds its way into filling those empty seats on Aer Lingus transport, ultimately it will go into the reserve fund of Aer Lingus for the replacement of aircraft and to that extent the taxpayer will be relieved of a burden he might otherwise have to shoulder.  The Government have the power to tax rates, as they apply to the company as a whole, and the charges with reference to the services provided.  In that way they can get back some of the money, if that is thought desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While our State companies are doing very good work, it seems to me there is a tendency to operate in isolation and on a rather strict bookkeeping basis.  The Government should have <Col N="1269" /> at some point a high level committee to ensure there is a proper taking up of the slack in these services by other services where this merely means a transfer payment from the Exchequer to the first service on to the second service.  In the case of tourism, for instance, there should be more inducements in the way of providing cheap travel for groups of tourists to this country.  That travel, paid for by Bord Fáilte, would in turn boost the coffers of Aer Lingus and achieve the desired result of taking up the empty space and, at the same time, providing for the replacements.  By and large, aircraft modernisation is proceeding so fast and the cost is increasing so rapidly that it is impossible to see in the foreseeable future that our airline would be able through its own efforts to provide the necessary capital to keep in the air navigation race.</P>
    <P>In regard to reciprocity of flights, it seems rather difficult to see why we have not made greater head-way in this regard with the United States.  We have a charter to operate only to New York.  I often wonder why that cannot be extended, even if hard bargaining is necessary, to enable our airline to operate into Chicago and even to the west coast.  When you stand in the airports in Chicago or Los Angeles, one is struck by the number of carriers' flags coming in from all the other countries, but the Irish flag is not present there.  We know there are difficulties, but it is about time we were making some headway in overcoming them.</P>
    <P>I think the welcome accorded to travellers at Shannon is singularly inept. It is just the same as at an airport anywhere else.  You simply get off your plane and make your way in.  There is no suggestion of this wonderful Irish welcome.  There is no suggestion that they have touched down in Ireland, except that the fields around look rather green.  I would have thought a special effort would be made to provide a real Irish welcome at Shannon, and I would ask the Minister to try to do something about it.  Also, the music on the Aer Lingus jets could much more reflect our national character than it does.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> This Bill deals with the commercial operation of aircraft but the other twin problem, the certification of aircraft, is a field into which we are venturing now with the Potez factory. I wonder what the position in that is at the moment?  Have we got a fully equipped certification section ready to perform the functions which will arise in the course of the next year or so?</P>
    <P>There is a provision about overflying. Apparently, very little sanction is required for this.  At the moment it does not cause any inconvenience.  But, seeing the jet trails in the sky, we should begin to think about the nottoo-distant future, perhaps ten years' time, when supersonic aircraft will fly. Unfortunately, their path, as charted at present, leads straight across the southern part of Waterford, Cork and Kerry.  The very disagreeable and dangerous effects of the supersonic boom is something we do not want to have to put up with, if it can be avoided.  No country or part of a country would welcome it.  Consequently, I suggest the passage of supersonic aircraft will have to be treated in a very different way from the passage of the ordinary aircraft we have at present.  Now is the time to begin thinking on this before we are presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> within the next ten years.</P>
    <P>We know the great complexity of booking arrangements and the necessity for their mechanisation.  That calls for very large computer facilities with great storage and considerable access times.  That is likely to prove a very costly undertaking.  I think Aer Lingus are looking at it.  However, I suggest to the Minister that before this becomes in any way finalised, it would be necessary to look on the country as a unit and particularly at Dublin&mdash;look at what computer facilities you want here and arrange those in the most efficient manner possible.  The peak load of airline booking will occur in the ordinary tourist season, whereas in between we are likely to have great surplus capacity.  Arrangements should be made to co-ordinate that so that it will be available in the slack periods for carrying out a census or for doing <Col N="1271" /> many of the other large-scale jobs required today in a modern State.  I suggest the Minister should see that this is co-ordinated and done before any vested interests are brought in to such a degree that at that stage the optimum solution cannot be obtained. The whole thing should be centralised, and the Minister might well consider then renting those facilities to Aer Lingus.  They should be available to the Statistics Office or to any other large-scale user of time on computers.</P>
    <P>I cannot allow the Bill to pass without referring to section 7.  Again, this reflects the modern trend of government by Orders.  I would have thought the Minister could at least have given us some idea of the Orders he will bring in of a restrictive effect.  I would much prefer to see it done by way of positive statutes.  Their very putting down would give rise to a discussion here which might bring forth very valuable ideas appertaining to the regulation of air traffic, reciprocity and the other factors concerned in this.  It is a pity the Minister did not even hold up the Bill for another couple of months until he had advanced to a greater degree with the Orders necessary so that we would have an opportunity to discuss these preliminary draft Orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on this Bill because, as has been remarked already, by and large it is giving effect to an international agreement. I was slightly provoked into saying something by Senator McGuire's remark about prohibiting smoking in aircraft.  If the smoker is expected to give up for an hour, the non-smoker might be expected to do likewise.  I think there is a fallacy in the Senator's argument that people are now accustomed to air travel and do not need the possible soothing effect of a cigarette. I doubt if anyone flying for the first time is at all reassured by the experience of others.  I think people going on a flight for the first time are probably just as nervous as Senator McGuire was on his first flight.  The fact that he has acquired a certain ease and calm is no consolation to other air <Col N="1272" /> travellers.  I do not think the argument is a good one.</P>
      <P>In relation to what has been said by several people about Aer Lingus, I would like to agree.  I have been fortunate to travel with quite a number of airlines, and I do not think any of them is better than Aer Lingus from the point of view of comfort, care and attention.  I have not been quite as lucky as Senator Murphy.  Apparently, he got into the hands of the staff; I never got quite so far.  It is an extremely well run airline, and I have heard this remark passed by non-nationals. It is not, as Senator Murphy said, a matter merely of patriotism.  Quite a number of people in England have remarked to me on how very pleasant it is to travel by Aer Lingus rather than by another company which I need not mention.</P>
      <P>I was fascinated by a theory propounded by Senator Quinlan that the public would prefer to pay taxes to subsidise Bord Fáilte rather than to subsidise the airlines which seem to be on the point of using Bord Fáilte money to buy up space&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were a hidden subsidy to Aer Lingus, the taxpayer might get suspicious at being encouraged to pay money towards a good enterprise like Bord Fáilte.  I should not like to see that sort of development at all.  When money is voted for a certain purpose, then, if it is not needed, let it go back to the Exchequer. Reconsideration the next year may show that less should go to one service and more to another but I should not like to see it given to one service and then passed on to another.</P>
      <P>I trust that the Minister will not listen to Senator Quinlan when he looks for this Irish welcome at Shannon or anywhere else.  I could not imagine anything worse.  After an air journey, my idea is to get out of the place as quickly as possible.  I look forward with horror to being received at Shannon or any other airport with someone else's idea of a traditional welcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Seanad for accepting this Bill so kindly. Senator McGuire referred to the still high air freight rates.  As he knows, there are reductions for bulk consignments and a great deal is being done to consolidate and alter and amend the commodity rates with a view to getting more traffic.  It is a process that is fairly continuous.  We are in an intermediate stage with regard to air freight progress.  Air freight is increasing all over the world, but in certain areas, where distances are shorter, the container traffic service, even for quite small unit loads, provides rates which offer terrific competition to the airlines, particularly when a container service carried across the Irish Sea can be delivered to the consignee within 24 to 36 hours.  I hope there will be further consideration of air freight rates in the future, just as there have been in respect of passenger rates.</P>
      <P>In the past ten years, the <i>élite</i> of the airlines and the <i>élite</i> of aeroplane designers have been concentrating on passenger or military planes.  I think some companies have been changing that in order to give those airlines in charge of freight facilities as high a capacity as those in charge of the passengers. I asked Aerlínte some years ago to make sure that the best possible people were employed in the air freight field.  It is equally true that not very many special air freight planes have been designed and often they are suitable only for certain types of traffic.  I hope that will change and that we shall have the same kind of positive thought about increasing the volume of air freight as has taken place in connection with passengers.</P>
      <P>The volume of air traffic across the Atlantic is such that we hope it will benefit Shannon as a depot, an <i>entrepôt</i> for freight there.  It is interesting to note that all the warehouses built by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company have already been rented by various companies so that the air freight business there should show an improvement, although it has been affected by the coming of jet planes which fly across the Atlantic without stopping at Shannon.  There has been that effect on the traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" /> Senator McGuire and some other Senators spoke about the financial position of the air company.  I want to make quite sure that nobody can accuse me of trying to conceal the facts, as I have been so accused particularly by members of the main Opposition Party.  About £10 million of the air company's capital is not remunerated: the interest on principal is therefore paid by the taxpayer. However, for £14 million of capital to be invested from, say, about two years ago until 1968, all but £2 million will be remunerated by the air company. Therefore, this is a company which, in the past, has not remunerated its capital but is now doing so, as I believe it should.</P>
    <P>The reason for the non-remuneration of the earlier capital invested in the air lines is simple.  If Aer Lingus had started as a company that was obliged to pay its way, it would have run air services probably only to Birmingham and London until it had accumulated sufficient profits to buy the planes to run air services to Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and so on.  The Minister of the day naturally believed we should expand the traffic at the greatest possible rate for tourist purposes and because many people of our own country living in Great Britain wish to return for holidays, but, above all, to bring the people of Northern England, particularly, and the people of Scotland as close to our country as possible because we believe they would benefit the tourist business, so that the air company is a company of a mixed policy&mdash;partial non-remuneration and partial remuneration of its total capital.</P>
    <P>I think the decision is wise.  It is based purely on reasons of a practical character.  Any Minister in charge of aviation would always have to look at each new injection of capital on its merits to see what the relationship of the capital to the taxpayer should be. I am satisfied that at the moment the air company is doing well enough to get into the position in regard to its new capital of remunerating it in one way or another.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy asked why international <Col N="1275" /> air services no longer require to land at Shannon.  The answer is that this requirement ended in 1957.  It was quite inevitable because of the growth of jet air traffic and aeroplanes designed to fly far greater distances than would be required in the ordinary way so we made the inevitable change.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan raised the question of various methods of encouraging tourist traffic to this country.  I think the best scheme is for Bord Fáilte to make use of its general promotional funds to encourage traffic to come to Ireland by all the means of transport available.  The estimated expenditure in the Budget for Bord Fáilte in 1956/57 was £398,000 and this coming year it is £2,600,000 and Bord Fáilte is entering in a bigger way into the United States promotion field, into the European field, while at the same time recognising that the great majority of tourists coming to this country will come from Great Britain, our nearest neighbour.</P>
    <P>He also raised various questions in regard to empty seats on Aer Lingus and Aerlínte.  The position is that Aer Lingus and Aerlínte have a very high load factor, that is, the percentage of seat-mile capacity available to seat-mile capacity sold.  They have had a particularly high air load factor on the Atlantic; in fact, I think they hold the record for two years.  There is no chance of the company becoming wealthy.  It will need every penny for depreciation and for development expenses so the question of the air company accumulating large reserves does not arise, and is unlikely to arise in the future.  There are also overhead costs, labour costs, depreciation and maintenance costs, and the costs of fuel.</P>
    <P>The load factor relates to the length of the season.  The longer the season the better for the Air Company, and the shorter the season the more difficult it is to provide aircraft which will be flying only for a few months of the year.  Unless one can hire aircraft from countries with a different tourist season, that can be a very expensive <Col N="1276" /> operation.  It has been found that cheaper fares increase the off season traffic.  The cheaper fares across the Atlantic which have been arranged, after a lot of negotiation and trouble, have increased the total traffic of Aerlínte. Aer Lingus have also arranged group flights, charter flights and late night flights, at lower fares, with the permission of IATA.  The European air fares across the Irish Sea are a little lower than the prevailing international fares so the fares in relation to the general IATA structure are a little lower.</P>
    <P>Fares have been increased and reduced at various times depending on the total financial calculation at the moment.  This is a difficult calculation to make because we have to make quite certain that if we have cheaper fares we will get the traffic in the off season, and are not merely inviting enormous numbers of people to come here over a period of six or eight weeks when, in fact, there would not be hotel accommodation for them.  As I have said, it is a difficult calculation to make and one could speak on it for a long time, but I think I have explained it sufficiently for the House to appreciate the problem, and my attitude and that of the air company.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to our American rights.  We have rights to Boston and New York, and we have rights to Chicago which we shall be exercising in the near future.  Senator Quinlan also referred to the Irish welcome at Shannon.  I think the best thing we can do is to have the place looking attractive, to have Irish goods on display, and to make sure the staff are kindly and welcoming, which I am absolutely certain they are.  The staff in the neighbouring hotels and hostels are equally welcoming. All the people I know in Shannon are very pleasant people.  The taxi drivers are all very pleasant, and I have talked with quite a number of them.  The people who greet travellers at Shannon are very nice to meet. When passengers have recovered from the effects of the flight&mdash;as Senator Sheldon suggested, fatigue and lack of sleep&mdash;they can join a medieval tour <Col N="1277" /> which is now really world famous. There were something like 21,000 medieval dinners during the past year. There is also native dancing and music and they can go to a typical Irish hosterly, or have a typical Irish tea in an Irish cottage, or go to a medieval castle for 16th century entertainment. That is a unique type of tour even by European comparisons.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to supersonic boom.  I agree that is a matter of great importance.  I should like to be able to say we could prevent supersonic boom.  One difficulty is that under the international convention we cannot actually control air space at more than the distance of the territorial waters around our coasts, so that planes can fly happily ten or 12 miles off the Irish coast, and not fly over the country, but cause the most terrific boom.  A question is now being asked by various countries using up-to-date measurements of what constitutes supersonic boom: if one could confine it to what sounded like the faintest far-off thunder on a summer's day, would that be tolerable as apart from the maximum crack and explosion that break windows and shake ceilings? All that will have to be studied in order to preserve the tranquility and peace of the countryside.  There is one country which I shall not mention whose Minister told me he had made a decision that there would be no supersonic boom of any kind over his country but, as I have said, if the design of the plane is one which gives a kind of silvery faint thunder which would not be noticed if the wind were blowing, would that constitute boom? This has to be studied technically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am also glad to be able to tell Senator Quinlan that we have formed a State companies committee to study the use of computer capacity, and to make sure that computers are not idle but used to their full capacity where that is technically feasible.  At present Aer Lingus are studying the best method of carrying this out.  I am sure Senator Quinian knows that buying computers is <Col N="1278" /> like buying aeroplanes.  When you decide to order one, you hear that another will be ready on three months from a certain date, which will be better and cheaper that the one you are about to order.  Quite obviously the air company will have to make up their minds and make the order.  It may be a gamble but they must make up their minds.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be practicable to discuss all the Orders and Regulations made under the various sections of the Bill dealing with the control of transport.  They are very comprehensive and detailed.  The answer is that very many of the Orders are simply a repetition of those already in existence, and there has been no great criticism in regard to them.  I think I have answered all the questions put to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the restrictions imposed by IATA on the commercial regulation of the air company perhaps I might try to put my earlier proposition to the Minister in a slightly more concrete form.  It is simply this: If, as the Minister said, the air company will find it difficult to meet its own capital requirements in the future with all the development there may be and so on&mdash;if we all agree on that&mdash;therefore, if it was foreseen now that in six years' time, say, the air company would need a grant equivalent to £1 million or £2 million to modernise its fleet over and above what it had from its own resources, that could be an outright grant or, if you give a low interest loan, it is effectively equivalent to a grant.  If that position is foreseen, the proposition I was making is that that £2 million could be used in the intervening period through the agency of other State companies <Col N="1279" /> to buy up some of the vacant seats in Aer Lingus aircraft during that period.  The money would still pass into Aer Lingus and would be available to them for their capitalisation and at the same time it would have given a boost to tourism or commercial freight or for whatever purpose it was used in that period.  I think we can get a double use out of money used in that way.</P>
      <P>In raising that point I did not in any way wish to indicate that Aer Lingus had more vacant seats than any other airline.  We are proud that it has not. Still it has about 40 per cent vacant seats and I think there should be some means of putting those seats to work for our economy as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of vacant seats is a most complex one. There are some cases in which no matter what one does one could not get seats filled by the injection of any given amount of money.  For example, there is the Christmas traffic of Aer Lingus.  While it is true that more people are going from this country to visit relatives now because of the economic travel, on the whole traffic is still mainly to Ireland before Christmas and from Ireland after Christmas. The load factor of that period calculated on the basis of flights east and west is not therefore as high as one might expect.</P>
      <P>A similar traffic exodus takes place from England at the time of the summer season.  There are all sorts of reasons for empty seats that might not necessarily be filled by the injection of money from another source.  I think the best way of dealing with this is to make quite sure that the capital structure of the air company is composed in the best way and if some emergency arose where it was quite obvious you had a great chance of securing masses of traffic but for the time being it might not be wise to ask Aer Lingus or Aerlínte to remunerate capital in full and interest or to repay capital over a short period, we could devise systems of payment of interest which would enable the aircraft to be flown economically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> Again, all of this depends upon what the passenger rate structure is likely to be in the future.  All I can say is that we shall examine the situation at all times with a view to finding what is the best that can be done.  One way out of the difficulty is that sometimes it is possible for Aer Lingus to hire aircraft which are not being used in a country where the low season does not correspond to ours and equally to let aircraft during our low season when they are having a high season in other places.  There are many ways of doing this but I would not be prepared to commit myself to the desirability of providing a grant from public sources in order to fill the seats of the air company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The season I have in mind, of course, is the off-season. Nobody is suggesting that we should boost traffic during the peak season.  We are always being told of the necessity to increase traffic during the off-season, and if the grant succeeded in providing attractive free seats on Aer Lingus or assisted passages through Bord Fáilte, I think it would benefit both the tourist industry and Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>It simply lays down that an order or regulation made by the Minister may authorise him to make regulations and give directions for the purpose of carrying out the purposes of the measure in question, in order to have it put into effect.  It is the usual drafting phrase to enable the Minister to do everything he needs to do in making regulations.</P>

    <Title>Post-Primary Education: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann would welcome <Col N="1282" /> a statement from the Minister for Education on post-primary education.  &mdash;(Senator Quinlan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which this motion was discussed, I suggested to the Seanad that even though we lacked certain information which will be available when reports on investment in education are published, nevertheless it was useful that we should have a debate that would concentrate on general principles rather than on the statistical position in regard to post-primary education.  I suggested there were three main objectives in education, namely, the development of the individual, the handing on of a certain culture and the training of the future work force. Although on first appearance, these objectives might seem contradictory and at times perhaps antagonistic, a closer and more thorough examination reveals that these three separate objectives could be harmonised.  Indeed, it is now becoming evident that, properly handled, these three objectives cannot only be harmonised but can be used to reinforce one another.  It is this harmony and this interaction that should be the main purpose of educational policy and educational planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we approach this question of devising a policy and a plan for education, we become immediately struck by the fact that a policy for post-primary education is in itself a relatively new thing, and to plan deliberately for post-primary education is certainly a new thing.  While today we discuss the question of post-primary education for all and the quickest way in which we can achieve it and while we are naturally impatient with the fact that we are not progressing more quickly towards it, it is well to remember that we have in regard to secondary education come quite some distance in the past 25 years, and certainly some distance in the past 50 years.  If we look back to the position in the 19th century, we are struck immediately by the narrowness of the education of that time.  This struck me particularly strongly some years ago when, in the course of some research on the history of engineering in Ireland <Col N="1283" /> in the 19th century, I was examining the private papers of a very eminent engineer in this country, a very prominent man whose fame went all around the world.  Among the private papers was a list of the various expenses he incurred from year to year and I remember being particularly struck by the amount of money he spent on the education of his children.  He spent a very large amount of money on the education of his eldest son, a small amount of money on the education of his other sons, a very small amount indeed, and practically nothing at all on the education of his daughter.</P>
    <P>When we come to look at the whole debate about education today, we realise how education has suddenly blossomed into a universal thing and it is not only that the working classes are now able in some respects to get post-primary education but that not 50 years ago, actually in the middle and professional classes, secondary education was by no means a universal thing.  There is no doubt that the most striking development throughout the world in post-primary education has been the making of that education available to persons absolutely irrespective of the financial circumstances of their homes.  Indeed, in education, it can be truly said in the words of a now forgotten American politician that this is the century of the common man. Now we are faced with this problem of universal post-primary education and how we can achieve it.  We must realise here that we have come a long way and certainly have a fair way to go, but we should also realise that this will probably be a never ending problem.</P>
    <P>It was well said some years ago by Anthony Crossland who has become Minister for Education in England that when we had solved the problem of equality of education in education, we would have to solve it all over again.  He went on to distinguish the weak equality of opportunity and the strong equality of opportunity in education and in making this distinction, he drew up a very vital point.  He said that <Col N="1284" /> the first stage in equality of education is when we get to the stage&mdash;and it is the stage which we are facing now in Ireland&mdash;when we see that every child capable of benefiting from education and who can be judged to be capable of benefiting, can receive education up to the limit of his capacity. This of course was the basis developed in England in post-war times whereby children were separated into different streams and educated to the best of their capacity.</P>
    <P>But Mr. Crossland went on to say that this was only a half-way stage, and if we look at education and at what can be done and is being done, we can see another target ahead, the target which he called the target of the strong equality of opportunity.  This he said was a situation in which not only children who showed themselves in early life to be capable of being educated to a high standard were educated but that children would be trained in such a way as to overcome the deficiencies which were apparent in them at this stage.  This is something which is becoming more and more acceptable in educational circumstances, that every child is capable of post-primary education for quite a long period, and that no amount of sifting it and no amount of settling in the streams will solve this particular problem.</P>
    <P>As I said when I was speaking the last day, this is not something utopian, not something that can be laid aside. Modern technology, which makes universal education possible, by its effect on economic growth, also requires universal education.  Unless we take the plunge in this direction and move positively in the direction of universal education, we will never be able to afford to do the thing.  It is like the situation in which I suppose many of us found ourselves when we were trying to decide whether we had enough money to get married.  The situation is if you wait till you have enough money to get married in comfort, you will never get married at all.</P>
    <P>That is true of education in this country.  If we wait for economic development when money will be available <Col N="1285" /> without effort, and without squeezing something else for education, the position is we may be waiting forever. The day may never come when economic growth will keep up the pace of acceleration unless we first of all start to invest in universal education.</P>
    <P>That is not a matter of taking some people to the top.  It is a matter of training every person in the community to be better than he would be if we had not made such an intensive drive in regard to education.</P>
    <P>If we are to adopt this objective of the spread of universal education in our country, certain consequences inevitably follow.  I for one am convinced if we are to have universal education of the type we need to support the economic progress of the country, this will only be possible if the State intervenes. I think, further, if the State is to intervene in education, it should not intervene in a haphazard manner, but in accordance with a certain plan. It need not be rigid and, indeed, if it is to succeed, it should be a flexible plan.  If the State is to plan in regard to education, it should plan only on the basis of adequate surveys and adequate projections as to what will happen in the future.</P>
    <P>A start has been made in regard to the project of investment in education, but I want to emphasise here that if the State is to play a vital role in the promotion of universal education, then surveys of this type must be continuous. It is absolutely no use having a project which lasts for two years, a report which is discussed and left at that.  Unless the work of surveying and planning is absolutely continuous, the educational plan will falter and the fruits we look to it for will not be available.</P>
    <P>It is of course really pointless to discuss further as to how these surveys should be done until we see the results of the preliminary survey on investment in education.  The likelihood is that the main value of such a report will be to indicate, not the solution of a problem, but how the solution can be found.  In the problem then facing us in drawing up any plan for education, there are certain key questions that must be answered, certain things <Col N="1286" /> on which we have to make up our minds.  It is as well to bring them to mind now, not that we can discuss them in any great detail until we have facts and figures before us.  But they are the problems we have to face.</P>
    <P>We will have to place before ourselves the question of what percentage of national income we are prepared to spend on education of all types.  In that regard, I think we all agree that in this country we will have to spend at least the same proportion as other countries spend in this particular matter.  I for one think we will have to spend more, because in this country we depend for our development on our natural resources and the greatest natural resources we have in this country is brains.  This is the great resource from which we will have to draw if we are to keep pace with the development of the countries of the remainder of Europe.  So we face the question that we in this country will have to spend a higher percentage of our national income on education than any of our partners in the OECD.  If we do spend this amount and spend it well, I think the effect will be self-compensatory.</P>
    <P>When we have decided how much we will spend, there comes the difficult problem of how this expenditure will be allocated.  I think we are entitled to ask the Minister in the terms of this motion to give us some indication of what his views are on this particular topic.  We have to allocate this expenditure between primary education, post-primary education and higher education.  These are problems which must be solved and solved explicitly.  They are targets which must be specifically determined before an educational plan is worthy of the name.</P>
    <P>Again, we have to decide where our concentration is to be.  Are we to concentrate on the abler children or shall we concentrate, as I believe we should, on all of our children?  In regard to post-primary education, we have the extremely difficult problem of how our resources should be divided between the 10/15-year olds and the 15/18-year olds.  Even if we have decided on the <Col N="1287" /> branch of education on which we wish to spend a certain amount of money, again we have to decide whether we shall spend this money on scholarships, on school facilities or on the training and the adequate remuneration of the teachers.</P>
    <P>We have to decide for ourselves how our economic plan will be carried out, what would be the emphasis in education on what I might call verbal subjects and what will be the proportion of education in practical subjects.  We have to decide whether the schools which will be the basis of our effort in post-primary education should be comprehensive schools or separate schools.  We have to make up our minds firmly on what are to be our curricula and our examinations.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given some idea of his thinking in this regard, but, as I said on the last day, I think he has given too little information on this and we ask him for more.  In 1963, the Minister announced that on the basis of the principle that there should be some post-primary education for all, he proposed to introduce the idea of comprehensive schools, to set up technological colleges and to reform the certificate examinations.  That is practically two years ago and it is reasonable to expect that these ideas should have been worked out in some detail.  Accordingly, I think it only reasonable that we should ask the Minister how far this planning has gone.</P>
    <P>Since 1963 the Minister has in the course of certain speeches in the Dáil given some additional information.  He spoke of the committees which would run the comprehensive schools.  He mentioned these schools would be responsible for something like 25 subjects and he gave an indication of the location of the ten regional colleges.  I should like to ask if he would not, when replying to this debate, give us further information in regard to this.  I think it has been evident during the debate that all of us in this House wish to have more information from him in regard to the comprehensive schools. There are certain questions which I would put to the Minister on this point. <Col N="1288" /> Some of them have been directed to him already.</P>
    <P>Firstly, in his original statement of May, 1963 the Minister indicated he proposed comprehensive schools for certain type areas in which no school was available.  I quote from what the Minister said on that occasion:</P>
    <P>Provision needs to be made for those for whom neither secondary nor vocational schools will be available and that provision should contain such variety as would offer the best curricula.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some change of attitude on the Minister's part in this regard.  I should like to ask the Minister, specifically, if he still intends comprehensive schools should be located in those areas where no other school is available or has he, since May, 1963, altered his ideas on this?  Does he now propose to have these comprehensive schools integrated with existing schools and in some way connected with them?</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, specifically, whether he still looks on these comprehensive schools as serving the areas which originally served a radius of ten miles?  At various times, in discussions, the Minister has spoken of these schools as containing 150 pupils and at other times of containing 225 pupils or more.  I should like to ask if the Minister would indicate his considered view on this particular point?</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of transport charges and the charging of small fees.  Again, I consider we would not be unreasonable in asking the Minister to be more specific on this particular point.</P>
    <P>There is another point in regard to the comprehensive schools that I should like to put to the Minister.  May I say I have no objection, in principle, to comprehensive schools but I consider it would be advisable in the first case that the comprehensive schools should be treated rather as an experiment and that the Minister should not put, as it were, all his hopes for post-primary education in the comprehensive schools.  I should like if the Minister <Col N="1289" /> would give some indication as to whether he is treating these comprehensive schools as merely one direction in which he intends to move.  If he does he should, at the same time, inform us how he proposes to provide schools outside the comprehensive system.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of natural unrest that these comprehensive schools may attract all the vocational support which is going to be given to post-primary education under the proposals which the Minister is now making. Again, reading through what he said in 1963 and what he said in the Dáil since, it is very difficult to get an idea of the curriculum of these comprehensive schools.  The Minister has said they are going to do everything which is at present done in the secondary schools and they are going to do everything which is at present done in the technical schools.  Does the Minister really mean this?  Does the Minister intend that subjects such as Greek and Hebrew will be put on the curriculum of comprehensive schools?  These subjects are on the curriculum of secondary schools and are subjects for the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the curriculum of the comprehensive schools will consist of 25 subjects.  The Minister should be far more specific on this.  It seems to me that these schools, if they are to work efficiently, certainly should have some subjects which traditionally belong to the secondary schools and some which traditionally belong to the technical schools.  It seems to me that all the subjects which are taught in both these schools were added up and it was said: &ldquo;You have got to do all these subjects.&rdquo;  That does not seem to be very good curriculum planning.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, in regard to broadening the intermediate certificate, that the subjects to be taken will be Irish, English, mathematics and two or three other subjects.  I should like to ask the Minister, in the planning of these comprehensive schools, how many subjects does he think on an average will be taken in the schools and how many subjects, on an average, <Col N="1290" /> does he anticipate will be taken in the intermediate certificate examination by pupils in these schools?  As I said before I have no objection, in principle, to these comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>There are amongst post-primary scholars different aptitudes.  Up to this these aptitudes have been served in the ordinary secondary and technical schools.  There has been in these schools an amount of scholastic class distinction.  I consider, in general, it would be a good thing to see students integrated in a system where there is no distinction between the different type of scholars.  More important than that there is a necessity that some of the students, scholars and pupils, at any time, should be able to cross over from one academic stream to the other. This is a vital point in regard to any scheme of post-primary education which is to be developed in this country. Every pupil differs and some of them develop in different ways.  Therefore, there should be complete freedom, at any time, for a pupil to be taken from one type of course or one group of subjects to another, which now appears more suitable for him. The best way of doing that is to allow this flexible cross-over and to organise the whole of our post-primary school system in this way.  I consider that there is an onus on the Minister, if he is going to rely heavily on comprehensive schools, to prove to us that this is the best way in which to allow this cross-over to take place.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I should like to mention, now that we have this opportunity of debating them.  The Minister, on some occasion, I understand, indicated there would be no entrance examination to these comprehensive schools, that nobody would be prevented from entering them.  Does this not create some sort of difficulty? There is an entrance examination to almost every secondary school.  Part of the Minister's scheme is that there will be a common intermediate certificate examination to be taken by secondary schools, to which there is an entrance examination on entering, and by comprehensive schools, to which there will be no entrance examination. <Col N="1291" /> It seems to me that this will create some difficulty.  These are, perhaps, minor points but I consider, on this occasion, that it is as well they should be mentioned.</P>
    <P>The second proposal which the Minister made in his press conference of May, 1963 was in regard to the technological colleges.  As I understand it, he proposes something like ten or 12 regional colleges and that they would be concerned largely with the training of technicians and with the age group from, say, 15 to 18.</P>
    <P>Again, here, when we read what the Minister has had to say on this, we see that he has indicated that in these technological colleges there will be a core course of English, Irish and modern continental languages, mathematics, physics and chemistry and, in addition, two further subjects.  This, indeed, appears to be a very heavy course and I would like to ask the Minister what is the difference between the course which would be taken by somebody at a technological college and the course that would be taken in a secondary school on the science side because the Minister has indicated that it is intended that the leaving certificate which would be taken by a student at a technological college should be comparable to the present secondary leaving certificate, that it should be the basis of matriculation and that it should be a preparation for the university.</P>
    <P>In particular, it has been indicated that the training in some of these technological colleges would be a very suitable method of training and that the leaving certificate would be a very suitable form of matriculation for certain university faculties.</P>
    <P>In this regard I take it that one of the faculties most concerned would be the faculty of engineering and I would like to ask the Minister whether this is what he means when he speaks of the preparation in the technological colleges being the basis for entry into certain faculties in the university.</P>
    <P>On this point there has been, as far as I know, no consultation with the engineering schools of the university <Col N="1292" /> nor with the Council of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland, which is the controlling body of the profession from the point of view of professional standards.</P>
    <P>I think there is a danger here that there would not be realisation of the type of preparation which the university looks for in regard to students coming up today into its technological faculties because, in the university, technology as such is not taught in modern engineering schools until the third and fourth year of the four year course. The technology, the practical aspects of engineering, are not taught until a solid foundation of science has been laid down on which the applied science of engineering can be built and it is no benefit to a student to have learned anything in regard to mechanical engineering practice or electrical engineering practice before coming to the university if he has learned this at the expense of taking time away from his fundamental mathematics, his physics or his chemistry.  The scientific foundation is the proper bottom foundation course and any idea that the technological faculties would welcome a purely technological slant in technical school children is wrong.  I for one wish to state here quite categorically that we do not wish for that. What we wish for is that the students should be trained broadly and generally in both liberal subjects and pure science and it is on the foundation of this latter that their technology can safely rest.</P>
    <P>Of course, I have been speaking, say, of those who would pass from a technological college for further professional training but I would like before I conclude to say something about the education of technicians.  This is a subject which has been very much in the minds of those of us in the engineering profession who for the past ten years or so have been concerned with the problem of the engineering work force and the contribution the engineering work force can make to economic development in this country.  At last, I think our work in this regard is bearing fruit and many others outside the engineering profession have realised that here we have a key problem in <Col N="1293" /> economic development, that here is one of the great stumbling blocks in our economy at the moment, one of the main factors which are hindering greater advancement.  I would just like to say a few words about this particular problem.  It is a vital need but it is a need that is often very imperfectly understood.</P>
    <P>For the past year or two, the word &ldquo;technician&rdquo; has begun to appear in the newspapers and it has been the subject of discussion at seminars, <i>et cetera</i>, but, even so, there still is a lack of clear understanding of what a technician is.  I would describe the function of a technician and the idea of a technician to the House somewhat in this way: a technician is a person with a scientific training in a specialised field who applies proven and tried techniques to some particular operation.  Since he has his scientific training, he is quite distinct from the skilled craftsman whom he is now replacing in the modern industrial economy.  He is also distinct from the professional technologist, whether professional engineer, professional physicist, professional chemist, in that he is trained in a specialised field whereas the applied chemist, the applied physicist or engineer has been trained over a broad area and has been trained over a broad area in order that he can develop new techniques or can adapt new techniques from outside the country to the particular needs of this country.</P>
    <P>The technical function of the technician lies somewhere between the design of the product and its actual production by the skilled worker. Though he is trained in a narrow field, he needs quite a broad education.  He must be educated in science; he must be educated in his own technology; he must have a good general education or he is incapable of keeping himself up to date, and he must be well trained in regard to the human factors which are all-important in industry.</P>
    <P>The position is that in modern industry in Europe and throughout the world, ten per cent of all employees fall into this particular class.  Roughly speaking, if we take modern industry, <Col N="1294" /> the managerial group will account for about one per cent; technologists will account for about two per cent; the technicians will account for about ten per cent; clerical workers for ten per cent; skilled operatives for about 65 per cent and general workers for about ten per cent and this is the type of team which runs modern industry in every developed country in the world.  This is the sort of team which runs modern advancing industry in all our competitors on the export market.</P>
    <P>Where do we stand?  If we were to be level with them, about 10 per cent of our employees should be technicians. Our actual position is that something more like one per cent of our employees in our transportable goods industries are technicians.  We have here one of our most tremendous shortages.  We have here one of the results of the failure down through the years to have a proper manpower policy, to be able to foresee what would be the key needs in regard to special types of workers and be able to fill the deficit.  The engineering profession has since the year 1956 been making repeated submissions to various commissions and to the Government on this particular point.  Having put forward that in regard to technicians, there must be, if we are to bring Irish Industry into its proper competitive position, a complete policy in regard to this.</P>
    <P>While not all of this policy is the concern of the Minister for Education, a great deal of it is.  If we are to solve this problem, there must be, of course, a proper policy in relation to manpower. Once we know the manpower, there must be a proper policy in regard to training.  When technicians are trained there must be a proper policy in relation to their utilisation. Above all, there must be the framing of these policies in such a way that the technicians will have a proper and a separate status in the community. One of our greatest failures, I think, has been in regard to the technicians we have.  We do not understand what their function is and, therefore, such technicians as exist are not recognised as playing a special and a distinctive role in industrial production.  If we are <Col N="1295" /> to give them their proper status I suggest there must be some properly organised national council which will issue for the whole country and for all classes of technicians in all trades and assisting all professions a universally acknowledged diploma which will carry in relation to technicians the same status as a university degree carries in regard to the professional technologist in industry.</P>
    <P>Such a policy has been put forward repeatedly over the past few years by Cumann na nInnealteoirí, the Engineers Association, by the Institute of Civil Engineers, by the Institute of Electrical Engineers and by various other bodies.  Unless this problem is solved a great deal of the effort that will go into the technological colleges in the training of technicians will be largely wasted.  The social problem must be solved if the educational effort is to be worthwhile.  I suggest, therefore, that in this particular regard in the colleges of technology the technicians the country needs so badly could be most excellently trained.  We could, I think, produce the particular men we want by training them in the colleges of technology up to a technical leaving certificate standard on a broad basis, to be followed by two years' full-time or four years' part-time, at the end of the period giving them a national diploma.</P>
    <P>There is one further point that should not be forgotten in all this.  When we plan for the future and when we decide how we will change our system of post-primary education in order that the generation about to start post-primary education will be better trained for the future both as individuals and members of the community, we must not forget the position of those who have already left school.  This must be a vital part of any policy and any plan in relation to education.  It is vital for all of the three objectives of education I have mentioned.  We should not neglect them because, if we treat education as the development of the individual, then these individuals have a right to share in the reform of education.  The reform should not be only for the generation that is coming up.  Those <Col N="1296" /> people who, through our failure in education policy in the past, have not been raised to their full development have a right to share in the reform of education.</P>
    <P>The second objective I gave as being the handing on of culture.  Too many of our people have left school without receiving either an outline of our national culture or European culture, of which we form a part, and, more seriously still, without the ability or the motivation to absorb that culture during their adult life.  Here, again, these must not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>The third objective I gave is the training of the work force.  We will not solve our problem of training a work force that will sustain continuing economic development merely by training the new recruits to industry. There is no doubt that we shall improve matters if we make sure that the new recruits to industry, and other walks of life too, are better trained than those who preceded them but there still remain those who have already entered the work force and they must not be either neglected or abandoned in any educational plan. This is a very special and a very particular problem.  We may think we have in our present technical schools the means of developing these people further.  There is no doubt that we have in our present schools very excellent courses, but these courses are not of the type suitable for the full and proper education of these people in the future.  We must remember that these people who are already out working, who left school at 14, 15 and 16, have a right in educational reform and we must not look upon their future education and their share in that educational reform as something that is in the nature of a hobby, something part-time.  There are difficulties.</P>
    <P>If these people are to be re-adapted and given some more education than they have had and more adaptability than they possess they cannot be trained as children are trained.  The same scheme that we use in regard to the training of children cannot be used in regard to them.  We could, I think, well follow the example of many of the experiments which have been carried <Col N="1297" /> out in France in this regard, experiments in which people in their twenties, thirties, forties and fifties have been retrained. Very often this has been done voluntarily by industry and local groups.  I do not think there is any need to discuss these things in detail.  I merely indicate that if we are to have an educational policy that is really worthwhile, then we will have to take care of these as well as of everybody else.</P>
    <P>There is one final point upon which I should like some information from the Minister.  It is a point that has been neglected so far in all his speeches.  What are his proposals in regard to the recruitment and training of teachers to supply the manpower for this policy?  If the question of how many teachers will be needed and how they will be trained is not thought out in detail everything else will be worthless. Summarising, if we remember the three aims of education, and if we examine, we can, I think, harmonise these aims.  We can do that if we survey the situation carefully and continuously and plan for education, and if we plan in detail and not merely an item here and an item there, thinking up a principle here and a slogan there. It must be done in detail.  While we cannot expect the Minister to give us his plan in detail in advance of the report of the inquiry into Investment in Education, I think we can rightfully expect far more detail than we have had in the past few years and, before we go ahead, following the publication of the report to which I have referred, we should in this House have a worthwhile debate on the whole subject.</P>

      <P>A statement was made here on the last occasion that there was evidence from teachers in vocational schools of considerable backwardness among children leaving national schools.  A statement was further made that overcrowding of classes was the main factor responsible for this situation.  While that is a factor, the largest factor, which is conveniently ignored, arises from the fact that 16 per cent of any population have an IQ between 80 and 90.  That is an average of ten points under the normal IQ.  Because of that, in every class of 50 children, there are eight children who cannot benefit under normal conditions.  This has not been taken into consideration at all.</P>

      <P>Would the Senator come to the statement he wants to make?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am developing the statement.  I am leaving out entirely all children moderately or very severely handicapped.  The point is, therefore, that one must anticipate that school leavers will have this educational backwardness, no matter what the conditions in which they are taught, except conditions of special education.  But, in the normal conditions in which they are taught in national schools at present, with large classes and the neglect of special education, this type of result must be evident.</P>

      <P>The Senator asked to make a statement in reference to something which happened the last day.  So far, he has not done so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the point.  The explanation for the backwardness in children has not been entirely given.  The statement was repeated publicly afterwards with a considerable amount of publicity.  It is most unfair to the schools that such a statement should be allowed to go unanswered. That is why I am intruding on the time of the House.  Another point is this.  Results in secondary schools show&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot allow the Senator to go <Col N="1299" /> any further than merely refer to the statement he wished to controvert and then to say something about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">

      <P>Finally, I wish to say that a generalised statement about backwardness amongst school-leavers from national schools is most unfair, and an indictment of both the whole teaching personnel and the Minister and the Department of Education.  All factors must be taken into consideration when such a statement is made in an outburst in this House.</P>

      <P>I move the adjournment of the debate.  I informed the House at 3 o'clock that that was the position.  The Minister was here from about 3.30 p.m. on.  He said he would have to leave shortly after 4.30 p.m.  He has waited now over the time he had intended to wait.</P>

      <P>I was one of those who protested about the Minister not coming in before.  I should like to express my appreciation of his coming in on this occasion.  We all know it is extremely difficult for him, for reasons well known to the House.  If the Minister is kind enough to say he will come in again when we are dealing with the Mines and Quarries Bill, the House will appreciate that.  It would be fruitless to go on without the Minister being present.</P>
