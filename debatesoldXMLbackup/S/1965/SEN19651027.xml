      <P>I have considered the application from Senator Sheehy Skeffington to raise, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House tonight, the following matter:</P>
      <P>The changes recently made by the Department of Education in the Rules for National Schools.</P>
      <P>I consider that this matter is one of such a nature that it should not come forward for discussion on the Adjournment but rather by way of substantive motion.  Such questions cannot be regarded as proper subjects for the Adjournment owing to the inadequacy of the debate and the lack of provision for coming to a decision.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I rule that the application is disallowed.</P>
      <P>I have notified Senator Sheehy Skeffington of my decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling but I should just like to plead with you to reconsider your decision in view of the fact that it is perfectly possible, as has been shown in the past, to raise matters on the Adjournment such as corporal punishment, the export of horses for slaughter, the Fethard-on-Sea boycott, the behaviour of a District Justice in Killaloe, the Raharoon school inquiry or matters of that sort, all of which I successfully raised on the Adjournment and several of which gave rise, subsequently, to a motion.</P>
      <P>It seems to me we are losing something in the Seanad if our power to raise matters on the Adjournment is thus to be restricted.  If we raise matters on the Adjournment it does not prevent anybody putting down a motion but such a motion may not be discussed for six months or more. I would plead with you to reconsider this matter, and I would plead with the House to consider whether we are not, in fact, losing a privilege and diminishing our status in not being able to raise such matters on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>From the point of view of the status of the House I support Senator Sheehy Skeffington in this matter.  We could have had it both ways very advantageously.  This matter could have been dealt with very expeditiously on the Adjournment and again it could have been developed further in the subsequent motion.  The matter which Senator Sheehy Skeffington wants to raise is one of national interest and urgency at the moment.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Senator Sheehy Skeffington on the <Col N="3" /> matter of the status of the House and the very inadequate use that has been made in the past of this time for motions on the Adjournment.  It is a pity this matter could not be raised.  It could, perhaps, have been followed later by a motion.</P>

      <P>On a point of order I should just like to say that when I raised the matter of corporal punishment, the then Minister, General Mulcahy came in and replied to me. Senator T. J. O'Connell, who was a teacher, reproached me for not putting down a motion on the matter.  I did then put down a motion, which came up for discussion six months later.  I was the only Senator who spoke on the motion.  No other Senator said anything. This is what happened when a motion was, in fact, put down for general discussion.</P>

      <P>There is just one point I should like to raise and I think I am in order in raising it at this juncture.  I think many Senators will agree that we were a bit disappointed at the way in which the Official Reports of the Dáil debates have been allowed to jump the queue. <Col N="4" /> We have not yet got in hands the Report of our debates of last July, but the Dáil have got the Report of their debates of last week.  The only debate in the Oireachtas so far on the projected Free Trade Area with Britain took place in this House last July and we have not yet got the Official Report in hands.  I feel we should call this to the attention of those responsible.  I know the Editor of Debates is extremely over-worked, but we should not allow this to go by without some reference to it.  The Dáil Official Reports are out for the 15th July and for last week but we have not yet got the Official Reports of any Seanad debates of last July.  We are still awaiting the Reports, three or four months after the debate.  I think we have a right in this matter not to be out-paced or out-stripped by the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall start at the beginning, if I may.  The Bill provides for provisions similar to those contained in sections 97, 98 and 99 of the Housing Bill, 1965, which is at present before the Dáil.  Under section 2 of the Bill a county council will be enabled during the payment period to waive the statutory restrictions imposed by sections 17 and 21 of the Labourers Act, 1936, on the charging, mortgaging, sub-division or alienation of a cottage or plot.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill will enable a cottage purchase annuity, at the discretion of the appropriate county council, to be redeemed by payment to them of an amount approved by the Minister.  I may mention that the amount to be paid for redemption will not be the current value of the annuity as mathematically calculated but rather an amount related to the current market value of the relevant interest in the cottage or plot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides that if an annuity is redeemed in full or the cottage and plot are acquired by the county council, all of the restrictions <Col N="7" /> applicable during the payment period as respects a cottage, by virtue of the Labourers Act, 1936, shall cease to apply.  If the annuity is redeemed in part, the restrictions will cease to apply to the extent determined by the county council.  These restrictions include, <i>inter alia,</i> a restrictions on mortgaging, charging, subdivision, the removal from the plot of sand, soil, etc.</P>
    <P>The early enactment of the Bill is desirable to facilitate the operating company at Silvermines, County Tipperary, in the raising of the necessary finance for the development of certain mining operations.  Negotiations are going forward, on behalf of the mining company to provide a sum of 22,000,000 dollars which will be required for the purpose of developing and bringing the mine into production. In order to be able to raise the necessary finance the company would, <i>inter alia,</i> have to give a debenture secured on all the property.  The land held by the company contains a vested labourer's cottage which the company bought from the former vested owner. Since this cottage and plot are held subject to restrictions on mortgages and charging under the 1936 Act, the company would not be able to give a debenture on all the property.  In addition, the company would be hampered in their operations by the restriction on the removal of soil, sand, etc., from the plot.  Existing legislation does not give the necessary power to waive the restrictions.</P>
    <P>We could, of course, await the enactment of the Housing Bill, which contains the necessary provisions, but to do so might delay the operations of the company unnecessarily.  I am sure that the House would agree that this would be undesirable in view of the considerable investment and employment which would result in the area from the mining project.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that it is my intention to retain the provisions of the present Bill in the Housing Bill. This will not, of course, affect anything done under the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I command the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Col N="8" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the Minister was so shy in introducing this Bill because I am sure he anticipates it is one which will command itself to all sections of the House.  It has been a very wise procedure on the part of the Minister to agree to taking these sections out of the present Housing Bill and enacting them in this way.  When I heard this first, I was wondering whether or not there would be in the year 1965 two pieces of legislation dealing with houses.  I am glad to see that it is the Minister's intention to leave the existing sections in the Housing Bill and I take it that these will then be repealed in the Housing Bill.  I am sure that is so because it is very desirable to have the whole of the legislative provisions relating to housing in one enactment.  I do not think anything much needs to be said upon the Bill.  Obviously there was the difficulty in which county councils and county managers found themselves in when they had not got power to waive the restriction on mortgaging and it is desirable that that authority should be vested in them.  Of course, the county councils still held the right to retain whatever other restrictions they like in respect of these houses which will be vested in the tenants.</P>
      <P>Just one matter occurs to me.  I am quite certain it is right, but it appears that it is only county councils that build cottages under the Labourers Acts.  I would ask the Minister to confirm that that is so.</P>
      <P>Another point arises under section 3 and perhaps the Minister might deal with it in his reply.  Upon the redemption of an annuity, on receipt by the council of the amount of the annuity, the property will stand freed and discharged from the payment of the annuity.  I am wondering if any further formality is required to discharge the property in question from the annuity, whether any instrument has to be executed by the county council to indicate that the property is discharged from the payment of the annuity.  The section seems to suggest that as soon as the county council receives the money, then the burden on the property is discharged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I should like to support the Bill.  It is very desirable that the Bill be passed at this time rather than, as the Minister pointed out, that we should await the enactment of the 1965 Housing Bill.  I should like to ask the Minister if he could elaborate a little further on section 3 dealing with the redemption of annuities because during the discussion on this Bill in the Dáil information was disclosed that this section would appear to give extraordinary powers to the county managers in the event of redemption of annuities.  I had hoped that the redemption of the annuity contained in the Housing Act of 1965 would mean the paying off of the amount for the period within which the house was on the annuity basis, but it appears from what we have discovered on the discussion of this Bill in the Dáil that that is not so; rather it is to be on the up-to-date valuation of the property. That, to my mind, will nullify any effect the redemption of the annuities and the making of the labourers' cottages freehold would have.  It would appear that only those with a very good bank account will be enabled to redeem the annuity and make the property freehold.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would also explain what effect this section is likely to have on the subdivision of vested cottage plots because in the 1965 Housing Bill provision is made for the subdivision of vested labourers' cottages.  Will this section have any effect, or will it mean that the county manager or the local authority can say to the owner or the vested tenant of a cottage: &ldquo;You can only sell or sub-divide that plot provided you pay the market value which I am about to place on it.&rdquo;  I should be glad if the Minister would clear up those few points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly (Longford) Mr. P. O'Reilly (Longford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> While I realise this is a piece of <i>ad hoc</i> legislation in relation to a specific case, I take it it will remain part of the permanent legislation on this matter.  I wonder if the operation of this section will not create a situation whereby county council cottages built under the Labourers <Col N="10" /> Acts and vested in tenants under a purchase annuity can pass out of the hands of the type of people for whom they were originally intended.  To some extent, I am inclined to hold the view that this has happened already.  I realise that the principles of the legislation were hard to achieve at any time.  I always regarded it difficult to marry two principles that were not easily marriageable, that is, the right of the tenant purchaser to acquire ownership of the house and the desire on the part of the local authority to preserve that particular house for the type of person for whom it was originally intended.  Because of pressure in housing and so on, a situation has arisen whereby a person with very little vested interest in a very short time after a vesting order can succeed in getting fairly substantial sums by way of saying to another person: &ldquo;The local authority, or the manager acting for the local authority, has the duty of ensuring that the sale is made only to a person who would normally be entitled to be housed by the housing authority, during the period of the currency of the annuity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Because of that fact, I am wondering if this piece of legislation will make it easier for people who own or who enjoy a vested interest in a county council cottage to sell it advantageously and at the same time sell it to a type of person or to an undertaking for that matter, in this case it is a business undertaking, I understand, and achieve a situation that the house would pass to the sort of person or to an undertaking that it was never intended for.  As things are, when a person who has a vested interest in a county council house and during the currency of the purchase and payment of the annuity, that person can sell it but it must ultimately devolve to a sort of person for whom the county council would have responsibility for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see in that a certain amount of danger because it was so hard to make an Act like that work in practice for the reason I pointed out originally, that it is very hard to achieve a situation whereby the house will only pass by way of sale of the vested interest to <Col N="11" /> the person who should be housed by the housing authority, a person who the housing authority would normally have responsibility for housing, and at the same time to achieve the principle of ownership in a county council house by way of a vest.  I should like the Minister to say something on this matter because I feel that this is a means whereby subsidised houses built substantially at public expense, when becoming vested, will ultimately pass, that a large number might pass through this avenue of escape into the hands of people who have no real interest in them except to get them for convenience purposes.  It might be a company in one case.  Everybody seems to agree on the desirability of this particular issue.</P>
    <P>I can see situations develop where a very large farmer who might regard such a house as a nuisance could acquire ownership of a house if we allow this form of thinking to develop. I think there is a principle involved here that we should just have a close look at the direction we are going and how far we are prepared to go in this direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is more or less an emergency measure in anticipation of the Housing Bill which is before the Dáil at present.  It has come in by reason of the very important mining enterprise which has gone under way recently and, of course, the cottage which was more or less the subject of this Bill was in the very centre of the site&mdash;the most important position on the site where they intended to set up their plant and machinery.  The 1936 Act did not permit the demolition or the removal of the cottage from that site in order that these mining people could carry out their plan and carry out the development, using this plot, of course, as a portion of the general plant to be established there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested to know from the Minister whether, in fact, or what the position was before the 1936 Act was introduced.  Apparently it was as a result of the 1936 Act that the <Col N="12" /> emergency measure now before us was necessary to bring in.  Of course, I know that the Housing Bill, coming before us very soon, is going to deal with that very situation created by the 1936 Act.  It would be interesting to know why it was considered in 1936 to bring in the clause which we now find it necessary to remove.  This measure, of course, is in anticipation of the Housing Bill.  A very big enterprise is concerned here.  We are hoping that if the project is successful a large number of people will be employed and, whether or not they are, we know that a large amount of capital will be invested in seeking the minerals from this land which would bring success to the proposed mining enterprise.</P>
    <P>Several points arise here.  First of all, the question of selling the cottage over the head of the tenant arises and also the rights of the tenant and the rights of the local authority.  If the tenant had not taken steps to have the cottage vested for him, I am sure that the decision would be different.  The law might not be much different but the position in relation to compensation would be different than if the tenant had, in fact, taken steps to, what they call, buy out his house.  He would at that stage have a vested interest.  Cottages are subject to different periods for purchase&mdash;in relation, of course, to the cost and the Act under which they have been built.  You have a situation, I would be interested to know from the Minister here exactly what was the vested interest of the tenant. For example, was it a 75 per cent vested interest?  Supposing it was only four years or 20 years on the cottages to go: his vested interest in one case would be lower than in another.  I should be interested to know the position from the Minister.  Supposing this plot had not been vested in the tenant, would he have a right of compensation apart from disturbance and rehousing?  I presume he would have a right to rehousing and compensation for disturbance.  If he had a substantial vested interest here, in what way would the compensation be divided? Would the local authority be entitled to a proportion of the compensation <Col N="13" /> paid for the site in which this mining firm is interested and a proportion, of course, to the tenant in relation to his vested interest?</P>
    <P>It also raises a point here in the case of land which is owned by a local authority where a tenant is not entitled to have his vested interest measured, such as the site on which a corporation dwelling house stands.  I should be very interested to know from the Minister whether provision is made in the Housing Bill for an adjustment with that corporation, particularly Dublin Corporation, because I am not sure that the same situation arises in connection with all corporations such as Limerick Corporation, Galway Corporation and Waterford Corporation where houses under the Labourers Act and under the Working Classes Act have been erected.  These are various points that would be useful to clear at this stage.  In the course of what Senator O'Reilly had to say, he brought up the question about portion of the plot.  Supposing only a portion of the plot was being taken away from the vested tenant or from the land authority, whoever happens to have the right of ownership there, would arrangements be made in relation to the remainder of the plot?</P>
    <P>This measure, of course, is agreed and acceptable.  It is meeting the demands of the present time and meeting problems which are confronting us.  The previous Senator, I think, expressed a view or a fear that if we are to accept this type of legislation we may have a situation where a farmer might go to the county council and says he wants to buy a cottage over the head of some local tenant who might not be a farm labourer but would be a tenant of a particular cottage, the farmer stating that he wanted a farm labourer to reside near him and that this particular man was working in a factory and was not working on the land and pointing out that the cottage was built under the Labourers Act.</P>
    <P>There is another situation.  If the county council decided to take possession for reasons other than the reason we have in mind now, could they take the cottage from a farm <Col N="14" /> labourer, put him out and hand the cottage, for instance, to an engineer just because they wanted the engineer to live in that particular locality?  Does the Housing Bill give power to the county council to put out a man, compensate him and re-house him in order that the county council can use the cottage themselves for other purposes? Generally speaking, I believe the measure before us now is designed to meet a situation where demolition of the cottage is required in order that the earth underneath it may be utilised for the removal of sand, gravel or material.  These are some of the points I would like the Minister to deal with in his reply.</P>

      <P>Some Senators mentioned <i>ad hoc</i> legislation and emergency legislation.  It seems it might be emergency but it certainly is not <i>ad hoc</i> in that it merely refers to the Housing Bill which was before the Dáil prior to the recess.  It has now reached the Committee Stage.  It is a long Bill and the sections dealing with this matter are sections 97, 98 and 99.  As the matter is urgent, we have merely taken out those three sections which are well suited to this particular case and have put them into this smaller Bill, which is before the Seanad, to facilitate the operation of Silvermines.  It will have application to all other cases in the interim.  When those particular sections are agreed to they will become law but we will not have, as mentioned by Senator O'Quigley, two 1965 enactments dealing with this matter.  We will merely have the Housing Bill and this smaller Bill containing those three sections, which will be repealed and contained in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Housing Bill was before the Dáil before this matter arose.  Senator O'Quigley asked whether it was only county councils who were concerned with this matter.  That is so.  They are the only people who are interested in this particular enactment.  He also asked whether anything else is required to clear the case, to make it freehold.  The plain straight answer is that there is nothing else required but it may well be that Senator O'Quigley may have had something further in <Col N="15" /> mind when he asked about that.  If he has we might hear further from him on the section.</P>
    <P>Senator J. Fitzgerald and, indeed, Senator O'Reilly raised the matter of the calculation of annuities.  Senator Fitzgerald raised this directly and Senator O'Reilly as to the effect of what we are proposing to do.  I do not think both Senators were heading in the same direction but they were certainly talking about the same thing. As of now there is no way in which an annuity can be redeemed if it is expired before it runs its full course. The reason for this twist in the section is that we are not only giving this right but we are also saying in the calculation of the amount to be paid it need not necessarily follow it is a purely mathematical calculation or multiplication of the annuity by the number of years yet to run.  This is for the straight purpose of ensuring that the fears of Senator O'Reilly are not realised to the degree he foresees.  It is intended that this would be used for the purpose of not allowing any commercial venture, company or other source to get their hands on property, to extract from the real owner of the property their property without due compensation. In other words, the annuity outstanding must be calculated as more than the actual value in order to compensate for taking over the property.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable that we should seek from the new owner or the developer who is going to make something out of this property and make it very much worth his while that the council should get back as much as they can within reason so that they will be enabled, financially, to replace the house which has gone out of their jurisdiction.  They will be enabled to replace this house by the money they receive without any undue cost to the ratepayers who originally provided the cottage and contributed towards its cost.  If the house is merely for some family settlement or convenience or something like that and the cottage will be retained within the family or near relatives, then clearly the mathematical calculation would be the one which would be operated on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> The other possibility is there for the reason that we do not agree that the property on which the cottage and plot now exist, and which were provided by the State, should be given to a new owner without compensation.  If five years of the annuity have to run and the annuity is £2 per year, then the value that will be placed on it by the council would be £10, whereas it might be worth £2,000 or £3,000.  If a petrol company wanted a cottage whose frontage was sited on a road they should be required to pay much more than the value of the annuity. It would be very advantageous to them as a petrol filling station and would be of great interest to them.  It would be unlikely that the owner of the cottage would sell it unless he was fully compensated for it.  There is no reason, if this is what the cottage will be used for, why some of that money should not go back to the council which provided the house in the first instance.  The house will disappear as a dwelling and the money could go to the local council to provide another house.  There could be a business and it could be objected that you may have a cottage and a plot adjoining this business which may have grown up through hard work by a private individual. It could well be that there is no reason why the particular cottage or plot of land adjoining that shop might not be passed on by virtue of what we are proposing now.  It might be passed on to another person, or indeed, utilised by the existing occupant or tenant, who is the vested owner.</P>
    <P>He would really have available to him subsidised property to compete with his neighbour who had helped to subsidise it by rates and taxes over the years.  He could go into competition with his neighbour who by his own hard work had built up his business, and to take it to the extreme conclusion he might possibly in the last analysis put his neighbour out of business.  That is the sort of circumstance we have to take into account in talking about a departure from mathematical calculations.</P>
    <P>Senator J. Fitzgerald does not seem to agree with this, and I do not expect <Col N="17" /> that everyone does agree with it, but I think the fears expressed by the Senator as to the implication this may have in restricting the freedom and goodwill that may be said to be now reposing in the long term tenant or the vested owner or purchaser, will not be realised in its actual operation. In the case of a person who for genuine reasons redeems his annuity or subdivides his plot so that his son or his daughter or his son-in-law may build another house, I think the Senator can take it that his fears will be groundless.  If I thought otherwise and if I were not able to give that assurance in this type of case, I would look at it again to see if there were not another way of doing this.  I have no fears that any damage will be done, or that there will be any loss to these people who may feel that while we are giving with one hand we are taking back with both hands.  That is not so.  The real intention is to avoid this taking with two hands what is provided by the ratepayers and the taxpayers for the housing of the people under the Labourers Act, 1936.</P>
    <P>Senator Rooney raised a number of other questions which, as he said himself, are directed towards the Housing Bill.  He asked whether we are providing this, that or the other. I think we will probably have a long stint on the Housing Bill in this House eventually, so perhaps the questions raised by Senator Rooney might be left over until then.  I do not intend to reflect on the wisdom of the questions, but I think we should keep to what we are discussing at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his attempted assurance but I am not altogether satisfied with it.  The Minister spoke about specific cases but I do not think the petrol companies will be interested in labourers' cottages.  They may be in a very, very, few instances.  I do not think a situation will arise in which a mining company will be interested in a labourer's cottage.  In the exceptional circumstances referred to by the Minister, if a cottage were about to be demolished, I would have no objection to the local authority getting the money to replace that cottage.  I am concerned with the ordinary individual who for family settlement purposes would like to redeem the annuity and have it freehold.  In the rural areas the Land Commission can take over a cottage from a local authority and consolidate it with a holding.  This has been done by two State Departments.  I do not think it is right that anyone should put a valuation on a cottage that was built 70 years ago for £100 and say: &ldquo;Your cottage is worth £1,000 today.  You paid £50 by way of annuity, and you have another £50 to pay.  We will charge £1,000 for the cottage.&rdquo;  I do not think we are conferring any great favour on the tenant of a cottage who wants to redeem his annuity on a basis of that kind.</P>
      <P>To come back to subdivision of a vested cottage plot, we have no assurance that there will not be a visit from an executive of a local authority to put a valuation on a rood or a half acre of land that a person wants to subdivide to provide for his son or his son-in-law, or his neighbour for that matter.  He can be told:  &ldquo;We will value this at £200.  You have already paid £50.&rdquo;  I would like an assurance on that matter.</P>

      <P>That is not quite so. I have already covered that and although the Senator said he does not feel assured by the assurance I gave, I cannot go any further except to say that in the case of these outside interests being concerned or interested commercially in such cottage plots we are not here providing for something I think will happen.  I know of a number of specific cases that have already arisen where these commercial enterprises have been seeking to get cottages and cottage plots for commercial ventures.  This is not confined to petrol companies only.  I have had cases of public houses and licensed houses before me where the cottage and land in question were required by those people for commercial purposes of various natures.  That has been my experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as subdivision is concerned, it will not be necessary under this provision for the vested owner of a cottage plot to redeem it in order to have subdivision take place.  It would be the normal way and probably the most straightforward way, but he need not necessarily do so.  In the case of sub-division for the purpose of providing a second house for a member of the family or a near-relative, I imagine the mathematical calculation would be the calculation that would apply in that case, but that is not to say that, in fact, the local authority may not decide some further safeguard is required in certain cases or in all such cases that some covenant would have to be devised and entered into that the house so redeemed before its time would not for so many years thereafter be used for other than residence.  This would be to keep everybody honest and, if it were honest, then nobody would be losing anything.  That type of undertaking would be understandable where the pure mathematical calculation of the annuity would be the cost of the redemption.  Where it was not so and where it was needed for other purposes, then I can see no reason why the local authority should not get back some of <Col N="20" /> the value that this site has grown into; which they provided with ratepayers' and taxpayers' money over the years. But we should keep in mind at this juncture that nobody is forcing the vested owner to redeem.  If he is redeeming for other than family reasons then he is doing so for a commercial gain.  I take it the total commercial gain would not be going to the local council.  In other words, in those circumstances, if the vested owner were not getting something out of it he would not redeem.  The only thing I can say is that the local council is entitled to something out of it in circumstances such as those.  In any formal arrangement and so on I feel the local council's decision would be the mathematical calculation, possibly with a safeguard that for so many years afterwards the property may not be used for other than a residence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> Before section 2 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>2.  This Act shall come into operation not later than the 1st day of July, 1966, but the Minister may by order or orders fix an earlier day or days for the operation of different provisions of this Act.</P>
    <P>The general intention was that this Bill should not come into operation until 1st July, 1966 and I think that was the intention when it was expected that the Bill would be law by this time.  Because of the far-reaching changes made in regard to the legal right issue in Parts IX and X it has, of course, been necessary that some time should be allowed so that testators who have made their wills could have an opportunity of revising them in accordance with whatever will be the law when this Bill comes into operation.  It occurs to me&mdash;and I think the Minister might give this sympathetic consideration&mdash;that there are certain sections of the Bill which would be immediately beneficial and which would cause no inconvenience to anybody.  I have in mind, in particular, Part VIII which seems to me to clarify the law considerably in regard to the wills of persons made abroad and the wills of foreigners. There does not seem to me to be any reason why this particular Part should not come into operation almost on the passage of the Bill; it certainly could on the 1st January next.  I think, therefore, that section 2, as it stands, should be amended so as to enable the Minister to bring that Part of the Bill into operation if he thought it proper to do so.  There is constant difficulty about the wills of people made abroad and Part VIII of the Bill brings some clarity into the law in relation to these wills.</P>
    <P>It also strikes me that Part XI of the Bill could equally be brought into operation without creating any inconvenience to anybody.  There might also be other sections of the Bill which might be brought into operation at different times.  From the point of view of the legal profession it seems to me that a new measure of this kind will require a great deal of study and <Col N="22" /> if it is brought in in different phases it will give them an opportunity of getting down to study one part now and another again and not have it all coming in at the one time.  I think a phased operations of the Bill would be useful.  I am immediately concerned with Part VIII of the Bill which deals with the conflict of laws relating to testamentary dispositions.  That Part seems to me to be non-controversial and it would be desirable that it should come into operation at the earliest possible date.</P>

No doubt it would facilitate the legal profession and be in the public interest if certain non-controversial provisions were to come into operation and be applicable to estates of persons dying before the commencement date of this section.

      <P>Section 3 is to my mind an extremely important one because it contains the definitions of certain words and phrases used throughout the Bill.  I confess I speak with a certain amount of diffidence on this particular section and, indeed, on the whole Bill because there are so many shades of meaning and so many different definitions that it is impossible to have them all present in one's mind at any particular time.  The first definition with which I am concerned relates to the expression &ldquo;full valuable consideration&rdquo; which is defined as meaning &ldquo;such valuable consideration as amounts or approximates to the <Col N="23" /> value of that for which it is given&rdquo;. That is fair enough as far as it goes but, in a Bill of this kind, it seems to me that once you introduce a phrase of that kind the phrase should be continued throughout the Bill.  That seems to me to be a simple canon of draftsmanship. It may be that there is an explanation for a departure from that particular phrase in the definition of &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo; that is on page 7. &ldquo;Purchaser&rdquo; means a grantee, lessee, assignee, mortgagee, chargeant or other person who in good faith acquires an estate or interest in property for valuable consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I confess I do not know why in the one case you have a definition for full valuable consideration and that then you have, under the definition &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo; merely the phrase, &ldquo;valuable consideration&rdquo;: why is the &ldquo;full&rdquo; left out?  One could take it that an assignee of the property would be buying it for full consideration.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with these definitions one by one.  I wonder why the difference exists, why &ldquo;full&rdquo; is left out in the definition of &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It would certainly be rather a revolutionary thing but we may be able to clear it up later. Another matter arises.  It is not contained in the definition section, and it has caused me some thought or, perhaps, I should say I have given some consideration to it: how valuable it has been, I do not know.  In looking at other provisions of the Bill, &ldquo;property&rdquo; includes all property both real and personal.  That is defined at line 19.  Then, when you come to section 4, you have real estate defined as including &ldquo;chattels real, and land in possession, remainder, or reversion,...&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Land&rdquo; itself is not defined in the Bill.  The ready explanation for that, of course, is that land is defined in the Interpretation Act 1937 but it seems to me that land as defined in the Interpretation Act means &ldquo;messuages, tenements, and hereditaments, houses and buildings, of any tenure&rdquo; that seems to indicate that what is in contemplation in the Interpretation Act is freehold land, held in fee simple or under a fee farm grant because &ldquo;tenure&rdquo; is used in the definition and the use of the word &ldquo;tenure&rdquo; in the law of property to me, connotes a freehold interest.  I am wondering whether or not when we use &ldquo;land&rdquo; simpliciter in various sections of the Bill we are referring to land which is freehold land, whether it is registered land, or ordinary fee simple, fee farm grants, and so on, or whether we intend to included in the term &ldquo;land&rdquo; leasehold property.</P>

      <P>This is a very desirable section to clarify the position where people die in an air crash or get drowned at sea.  This is one of the things which has created a great deal of trouble but I am not so sure it solves the problem.  The section now provides that where people die and the circumstances are such that it is uncertain which of them survives the other, for the purposes of the distribution of the estate of any of them they shall all be deemed to have died simultaneously.  This would be particularly important in regard to the payment of death duties.  If a person has property for his life and then it goes to somebody else on his death, and if the death takes place within a specified period, there is under the death duties code a quick succession allowance so that the property will not have to bear the full rate of death duties upon the two deaths.  If, in fact, the section is going to provide that they died simultaneously it seems to me that you cannot have a quick succession allowance because you cannot say in respect of which death the allowance should be made.  I consider that will create a genuine problem under the Finance Acts but I consider that it is more proper to be dealt with here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the same point as Senator Cole.  As I understand the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act the position is that a Circuit Court judge has jurisdiction only within his particular circuit in relation to land situate within his particular circuit.  He has jurisdiction in relation to a person who resides, <Col N="29" /> within that circuit.  That principle is carried through in minute detail in the Third Schedule to the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961. In the Third Schedule the particular type of action is first defined and then the jurisdiction is shown.  One finds that in connection with an action in relation to the contract for example, that the Circuit judge who has jurisdiction is at the election of the plaintiff (a) the judge of the circuit within which the contract was made or (b) the judge of the circuit where the defendants or one of the defendants resides or carries on business must plead.  Locality is extremely important in determining jurisdiction. The Circuit Court or Circuit Court judge, normally speaking has no jurisdiction outside his own territorial area.  The provisions as to jurisdiction in relation to the kind of action that would come close to this Bill&mdash;proceeding for the administration of the estate of the deceased person&mdash;are laid down: the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is to be exercised by a judge of the circuit wherein the testator at the time of his death had a fixed place of abode.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the position under the 1961 Act and that is repeated in section 6, subsection (4) of this Bill: that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court shall be exercised by the judge of the circuit where the deceased, at the time of his death, had a fixed place of abode.  The position, certainly up to 1961, was that the jurisdiction was exercisable by a judge not only if the deceased had a fixed place of abode within his jurisdiction but if he had no fixed place of abode but had land within his circuit area.  That kind of situation is arising all the time where you have somebody who has land and who is working in England.  His permanent place of abode is in England.  He may, in fact, have no house at all on his land or he may have let it fall into a state of disrepair.  Up to the 1961 Act, at any rate, because the land was situate within the locality of a particular circuit then that circuit judge had jurisdiction over the administration of that estate.  That provision seems to still apply under the County <Col N="30" /> Officers and Courts of Ireland Act, 1897, section 40, but it seems to have been repealed in relation to administration proceedings.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in this Bill we would want to go further and not alone provide that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court shall be exercised by the judge of the area where the deceased at the time of his death had an abode but that if the administrator resides within the circuit area or if the deceased had assets there the Circuit Court should have jurisdiction.  There might be an explanation for this limitation but I do not readily understand it any more than Senator Cole and I thought that the Minister might answer the point.</P>

      <P>The position is that where administration is granted no person shall have power to bring any action or otherwise as successor in respect of the estate until a grant has been recalled, revoked or has expired. The situation could and frequently does arise where a person applies to the court and obtains a grant of administration because there are no known next of kin, or none available. There may be in a case from 20 to 40 cousins who might be entitled on the death of the deceased intestate, and it quite frequently happens that when the appropriate advertisements are under order of the court inserted in the newspapers a nephew or, perhaps, a brother or sister of the deceased turns up. Under the present law and the rules of the High Court relating to probate and administration it seems that at that stage the grant becomes, if not void, certainly a grant which it is improper for the applicant to retain any longer. The very purpose of the suit would have been to ascertain what next of kin there were, but immediately the next of in are discovered the grant is gone and further expense and unnecessary delay is incurred in lodging that grant to be cancelled or revoked and in somebody else being appointed to take out administration.  I wonder whether, perhaps, in cases of this kind instead of recalling or revoking the grant where the proceedings are taken for the express purpose of ascertaining the next of kin the original applicant would be given a prior right to continue the proceedings, because he has been acting <i>bona fide</i> all the time and he will be administering the entire estate under an order of the court.  I wonder if this section could be amended in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been something of a surprise to me that to administer an estate, people have to enter into bonds and have to go through all classes of solemnities in order to become administrators, and very frequently have to spend quite substantial sums on premiums from insurance companies, but when they get a grant and become subject to the <Col N="35" /> court in the administration of the estate in accordance with the law, and the courts appear to have no further function in relation to the administration of the estate which they have taken such adequate safeguards to prevent from being wasted, and to ensure that it gets in the proper hands.</P>
      <P>I should hate to see a position reached where we would have more court functionaries examining the affairs of private individuals, and have more official inspections, but a great deal of injustice has been done by the failure of people who take out grants to take any further steps to administer the estates.  The estate is left there, and perhaps years later administration proceedings have to be instituted in court, with a great loss to the ultimate beneficiary, because the person who got the grant of administration had not administered the estate in accordance with his oath and his duty.  I am wondering to what extent consideration has been given to that kind of situation.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that it would not be unreasonable after a year or two years had passed, for the Probate Office to write to the administrator and ask him had he administered the estate, and tell him to file an account indicating that the assets had been distributed in accordance with the law, and to produce receipts.  That would seem to be the logical outcome of entering into administration bonds, and it would ensure a great deal more justice for people who on an intestacy had come into some property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I considered whether I should put down an amendment to this section to have some kind of rule like that introduced. I did not put down an amendment because of my abhorrence of extending what I regard as interference by State authorities in the affairs of private individuals, but it is, to my mind, something that could properly be done.  It would leave the administrator of an estate without any grievance, because if he is doing his job he will have administered the estate at the end of two years, unless some insuperable problems have arisen in which event it would probably be the subject of administrative proceedings. <Col N="36" /> I should like to know the Minister's views on this.  Has any consideration been given to failure by administrators to administer estates in accordance with their oath?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator O'Quigley answered his own point when he referred to the undesirability of extending inspection into the administration of people's estates. There is also the fact that administrative complexities would arise if there were an attempt to enforce such a scheme.  The best thing that can be done is to have an administration bond, and the next of kin, the legatee or the beneficiary who feels that he is not being properly dealt with has a right of action in the courts to compel the personal representative to administer the estate.</P>
      <P>I do not see how much further you could go beyond this.  If one does attempt to go further it becomes very difficult to avoid the question of State interference in the affairs of the individual. We have provided in section 125 a limited period of six years in the case of anybody remaining on in the estate so that anybody claiming under an estate has six years in which to do so and after six years the title resides in the person who has remained on in possession.  I think that this is desirable in certain circumstances, particularly in rural Ireland.  Any attempt to go further would be an extension of State interference in administration activities.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the application for grants which may be made either in the general Probate Office or in the District Probate Registry and the application may be made either in person or through a solicitor.  I do not know why in this day and age and at the state of literacy we have reached an individual with or without the aid of a solicitor in making application for a grant cannot do so through the post.  It seems to me that he will be required to attend at all times.</P>

      <P>Actually, under this section of the Bill we are extending the right of personal application by making it specific that this right may be exercised by the individual irrespective of whether or not he or she has a solicitor.  At the present time an application can be made only in the Central Probate Office or in a limited number of district probate registries. We are now extending this right of personal application to every Circuit Court office in every town and county so that each person will have the right to go into his own county town and make the application in person.  I think it is desirable in this type of case that the matter should be dealt with personally by the applicant.  We are extending it considerably to apply to every county in the country which, in my view, is a very progressive measure.</P>

      <P>On the question of calendars of grants, some years ago when a time and motion study became the rage and procedures of that kind came into vogue the Department of Justice apparently carried out a survey of the Probate Registry.  In the course of their survey they apparently came upon the calendar of grants and this, which had stood the test of time being thumbed over day after day, they converted into some kind of calendar with sheets that did not stand the test of even a few years but became all dog-eared and torn.  That was the last I saw of them in the Probate Registry. This apparently was the result of some inspection by a methods officer or somebody like that from the Department of Justice.  In general there were complaints about the difficulty of thumbing through these calendars of grants in order to ascertain whether or not a grant had been extracted in regard to a particular case.  I am wondering what is the present position in regard to these because the complaints I heard at that time were numerous and loud.  When I looked up the matter myself I could see it was quite impossible to get through these calendars of grants.  These ought to be prepared in such a way that they can readily be used by members of the public and the legal profession who may have to have recourse to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which I should like to ask the Minister about. It is a matter of practice with which I am not familiar but I should like to know whether there is any procedure whereby a person, wanting to ascertain in respect of a person who died intestate whether or not a grant was taken out, can get an official certificate from some person in the Probate Office.  One often sees in the course of one's practice that a search has been made but it may not be correct: it is not like the searches in the Land Registry where, if you pay a fee, you <Col N="39" /> can make an official search, and everybody accepts that practice.  I wonder if such a search could be made to ascertain whether or not a grant had been taken out in the Probate Registry.</P>

      <P>This is one of the more important sections of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (6) of this section provides that: The position now will be that whereas at the present time, upon intestacy, a widow, where the deceased leaves her and the children of the marriage surviving, becomes entitled to one third and the other next of kin a two third share, under the provisions of this subsection, she will become entitled to something different on intestacy merely to a claim against the assets of the estate to a sum equal to the value of her share.  It seems to me that this is not a wise provision and I believe it will give rise to a great many complications when this section comes to take effect.  At the present time, in the case of a farm or a shop, the widow is entitled to a one-third share as tenant in common and this gives her an estate in the property. She is the owner of an undivided one-third share.  Under this provision, <Col N="40" /> under subsection (6) of this section, she will not be an owner.  She will have no estate in the property but she will have a kind of claim which is nebulously defined as &ldquo;against the assets equal to the value of what her one third share amounts to.&rdquo;  I can see some difficulty in administering estates.  Supposing a widow and children decide, when the widow takes out a grant, that she assents to her own share under section 66, of two thirds and also that of the children who, presumably, would also be entitled to a claim, against the assets, at that stage, if that assent is made it does not seem to me that then any asset is vested in anybody; that can happen and at the time that might suit everybody concerned for the time being.  If, then, somebody wants to get a grant in order to build a house and one of the children has gone away or cannot be traced or located, it will be extremely difficult to make title.</P>
    <P>We saw here this evening that we had to pass a special piece of legislation to deal with the position of labourers cottages under the Labourers Act in relation to a small plot of ground held under the Labourers Act and to which proper title could not be made.  Banks are always extremely sensitive about this kind of thing.  If the widow is to be undoubtedly entitled, as everybody agrees she should be, to a definite share, it would be better if she held that particular share as a tenant in common with other persons entitled because then she has vested interest and she and the others can deal with it.  I think, furthermore, that the claim against the assets to a sum equal to the value of the share necessarily involves either a sale of the assets or, if that is not done, getting some valuation from auctioneers or maybe two auctioneers or an agreed auctioneer and this, again, involves more expense.  When it comes to sales of property if a person wants to protect his or her right, they will perhaps have to charge the property with the amount of the value of the legal rights share and, frankly, I think it will create a considerable difficulty. In the ordinary day to day business of raising loans, selling land, people who <Col N="41" /> have been accepted as guarantors, have been able to go into a bank and show they are a tenant in common as to one third.  They go in and say: I am entitled to a one third share as tenant in common.  In future they will only be able to show a claim to a legal right to the value of one third, whatever the value of that is in money. They will not go in as an owner of property but as somebody with a claim upon it.  The difference between the two is quite substantial in the eyes of anybody who wants to deal with a property owner.  Would the Minister reconsider subsection (6) of this section?  Whatever consequential amendments are necessary in the remainder of the Bill could be dealt with on the Report Stage because this subsection governs intestacy and the legal right share in Part IX.  It would be far preferable that the person entitled to a share in property, certainly land or houses, where there are documents of title&mdash;I do not mind the position in regard to personal estates that can be sold and realised readily but, in relation to the purpose of this Bill, they would have an estate in it corresponding to a share as a tenant in common.  It would be far easier for all interests to deal with the estate and it would involve them in a great deal less expense.  I do not see any justification for making it a claim against the assets of a sum equal to the value of a share when you can equally well give them the same protection by giving them an estate corresponding to the legal share in the property itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this particular aspect, I have very strong views.  In section 124, we are abolishing tenancies in common.  They have been a confusion in the law so far and we are providing for acquisition under the Statute of Limitations on the basis of joint tenancies: the Senator has an amendment on that.  I fail to see how giving the surviving widow a tenancy in common would add anything to her creditworthiness.  The present subsection is a restatement of the existing law in regard to intestacy.  The purpose of the subsection is to define or to <Col N="42" /> spell out that the existing law in regard to intestacy will also apply in the case of the legal right and that, just as at the moment a claim to an intestate share is a claim against the assets of the estate, so also will a claim to a legal right share be of a similar nature in the future.  Half the successions in this country arise on intestacy.  So far, there has been no development such as Senator O'Quigley fears in regard to creditworthiness or ability or capacity of people to raise money on property passing on intestacy.</P>
      <P>I think the scares in regard to the legal rights system will not come about, and that, in effect, the legal rights system will operate very much as the intestate system operates at the moment except that you have spelled out here, in this and other sections, that, irrespective of how the testator may feel, the surviving spouse is provided for.  It is only proper that it should be in this form rather than complicated by giving the survivor a tenancy in common.  The simplicity of the present system, which we are continuing, is that this legal right is a claim against the assets of the estate and may or may not be enforced as the person requires.  That is a neater, a simpler and a more proper procedure than giving an actual tenancy in common in the estate to the person. A person may not wish to claim his or her legal right.  That is his own business.  Our view is that what arises here is a legal right, a right to claim against the assets which may or may not be enforced by the beneficiaries. That is a far better way of dealing with the matter than creating a tenancy in common which only gives rise to complexity of title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not at all agree with the Minister that this is a restatement of the existing law.  The financial effect of this particular provision is no different from the financial effect to the beneficiaries of the existing law but it is the legal consequences that follow from having an estate which apparently nobody really owns but against which all of the persons entitled on the intestacy have a claim which is different.  At the present time <Col N="43" /> when a person dies intestate each of the next of kin equally take their shares as tenants in common.  There is no difficulty about that.  That just arises automatically and when a grant is taken out these shares can be vested in due course by the administrator. As matters stand at the moment if a mother dies leaving two sons and a daughter behind and one of them takes out a grant and then if they are advanced in life they can remain on the land, work it and live there.  They are advanced in life and at the present time each of them would hold as tenants in common in equal shares and could be so registered in the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>Under this new situation they can never become owners of any estate in the land without executing some formal instrument under which the property can be vested in them as tenants in common in equal shares. It seems to me that that procedure may well involve them first of all in the cost of preparing a deed and also in stamp duty upon the transfer by the personal representative to them, this being not a transaction that arises on the intestacy but a rearrangement by way of family settlement.  It seems to me that in a case of his kind you will have the three of them enjoying but none of them owning the property. None of them may become registered in the Land Registry as owner.  It will be necessary to have a further deed to make them joint tenants.</P>

      <P>It seems to me in subsection (2) the right of retainer of personal representative is absolutely abolished and cannot be exercised where the estate is insolvent or there is nothing in the Act which affects the right of retainer.  I would like to ask the Minister a question on that point. Supposing a person dies intestate or dies testate and he owes somebody a lot of money and appoints him as executor, if the sum should be statute barred will the executor, because he <Col N="44" /> is executor, still be able to pay himself? It sometimes happens that an arrangement is made in the lifetime of a man that he will not pay a debt because he cannot pay it but he arranges to appoint his creditor as executor so that the executor could proceed to have the estate administered.  I wonder whether or not that right is debarred by subsection (2) of this section?</P>

I regret that in a comprehensive piece of legislation such as this all the rules are not to be found in the First Schedule because the first thing one finds in rule (2) of the Schedule is that the debts are to be discharged in accordance with the rules for the time being in operation in relation to the law of bankruptcy.

That is more regrettable <Col N="45" /> especially because at the present time the whole law relating to bankruptcy is under consideration by a special committee.  It introduces an element of uncertainty into this particular section. Whereas one would have thought that the law was now being defined quite precisely in the Bill for some time to come we have to wait some time for new rules that will be laid down in the bankruptcy code.

      <P>This is the section which provides that the purchaser from the personal representative would not have to inquire into whether or not the personal representative is properly exercising his powers, and the purchaser would be protected.  It is a restatement of the existing law, and is <Col N="46" /> all right as far as it goes.  The personal representative selling property is presumed to be selling in due course of administration and consequently the property is transferred to the purchaser freed and discharged from all debts and liabilities of the deceased.  The difficulty which arises&mdash;perhaps the Minister might consider it before the Report Stage&mdash;is as to what is the stage at which the personal representative should be deemed to sell in due course of administration.  Should it be the new period of six years which is apparently going to be the statutory period within which a claim can be made against the estate under section 125, should it be 12 years, or should it be, say, outside a year?  It is desirable that some clarity should be brought into the law because this is a matter which conveyancers from time to time find difficulty about. There is no doubt that the power of the personal representative to sell property and the title he can give and the protection he can afford to the purchaser are very valuable from the point of view of conveyancers, but there is an area of uncertainty as to when he ceases to sell as personal representative or to act in due course of administration.  The Minister might be able to say that the section as it is now phrased deals with that position.  I do not think it does, but I should be glad if he would clarify the law so that one of the troubles people experience may be satisfactorily answered.</P>

It can become very important, because once an assent in writing is made by the personal representative then he is divested of the estate in the lands.

      <P>Yes.  As the Minister has said, he has put these amendments to meet the case I made on the Second Stage because I feared that the surviving spouse might be left homeless because of the fact that the home might have to be sold to meet the legal right claims.  That is a situation which I feel constitutes a very grave hardship for the surviving spouse.  The Minister very kindly said he would look into the situation.  I should like to thank the Minister very sincerely for his sympathetic consideration of the point I raised, and for putting down this amendment which appears to me, so far as I can judge, to remove the dangers I have in mind.</P>

      <P>I have nothing further to add.  I was convinced, after examining the point raised by Senator Miss Davidson, that there was merit in what she said.  It is obviously desirable in this legislation that the surviving spouse, the widow, for example, should be able to remain in the house, which may have a value put on it which would exceed her legal right share.  She should be allowed to remain there. The courts would take the equitable view that she should remain in the house and that it should not be sold over her head.  I think the amendment <Col N="50" /> meets the point raised by Senator Miss Davidson.</P>

She will have to apply to the court?</P>

What I am concerned about is that while ordinary commonsense and humanity would dictate that she should have the house to live in, she has to undergo the expense of applying to the court, and she has to undergo whatever worry is entailed, with perhaps consequential delays.  It seems to me to be very regrettable that the worry and expense involved in an application will arise.</P>

      <P>My main purpose is to ensure that widows or widowers &mdash;particularly widows&mdash;get their legal rights without the necessity of going to court.  The amendments proposed in the Dáil by the Fine Gael Party and here by Senator O'Quigley are designed to push the widow into court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We shall be dealing with that later on.  Within the context of this Bill, and because of the way it is wrongly framed, it is necessary to do this kind of thing.  Here again the amendment arises because of the limitation of the widow's share to one-third.  The one-third provision <Col N="51" /> takes no account of the fact that a great many of us when we die will leave merely a dwelling house, and perhaps a small insurance or some cash in the bank if we are fortunate. A dwelling house will be the only asset a lot of people will leave behind them.  I would have hoped that in the case of an estate of that kind it would follows as a matter of law that it would all go to the widow and that it would only be in the case where she did not get it&mdash;and such cases would be very, very few&mdash;that she would have to go to court, but this will apply to a great number of cases because she is limited to one-third, and she must go to court to get the house appropriated to herself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice, this is the way this will work.  If the widow stays in the house and has this right written into the section it means that no one will try to put her out because she cannot be put out.  I envisage that the number of cases in which the widow or widower would have to apply to the court would be very few.  This is designed to apply to the case where a widow or widower stays on in the house and another beneficiary seeks to eject him or her.  Under this provision as it stood before Senator Miss Davidson raised this point, such a person seeking to eject the widow might succeed on the basis that the widow was only entitled to one-third.  We are now spelling out that she has the right to remain.</P>

I am certain that no one here could state categorically what is meant by &ldquo;in chambers&rdquo;.

      <P>The Senator is a legal practitioner and he knows what this means.  It means that such an application shall be heard privately in the judge's rooms.  Under the revenue code and the lunacy code there are special hearings by judges in chambers.  It is an expeditious and private way of dealing with these matters in an inexpensive fashion.  It means, as the Senator is well aware, that the judge comes to his rooms half an hour before the public sitting and hears these applications in his rooms prior to the public sitting of the court&mdash;without any wigs or gowns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not concerned with wigs and gowns.  This supposes that judges' rooms all over the country are spacious places, but all I can say is that the Minister should travel to Westport and have a look at the courthouse there.  You could not fit three people into the judge's rooms.  He could go to Ballina which is a more opulent port town and he will see that you would not fit three people in the judge's room there either.  Or he can proceed to Castlebar, although Castlebar has a fairly decent one.  I would have thought the position would be that they could be heard in the ordinary court room in private.  There is certainly no virtue whatever in bringing people into a room.  It seems to me that if this is to be heard in the judge's room it certainly is not fair, <Col N="53" /> having regard to the state of the courthouses round the country as I know them, to a widow or anybody else seeking justice to have to sit in these places which the judges are constantly protesting about.  They are unventilated, cold and certainly not of a size conducive to a proper hearing.  It may be that any case for hearing in Mayo would be heard in Castlebar but I do not see why a person living in Westport should not be entitled to go into the courthouse at Westport or why a person living in Belmullet should not be entitled to go into Belmullet when the courthouse is erected there.  At the present time the idea of conducting a case in some of these judges' rooms is a gross absurdity.  I had thought the Minister should amend that to provide that it can be heard in private.</P>

      <P>This phrase &ldquo;hearing in chambers&rdquo; is a phrase which has been used over the years and is incorporated in various statutes, particularly those dealing with lunacy.  It is well accepted that the judge sitting informally can deal with a case expeditiously and privately with no cost where there is no formal hearing in the sense Senator O'Quigley might wish it to be.  In cases of this kind where intimate family affairs may be raised one can envisage a situation where a row might have arisen between a widow and one of her children&mdash;the matter would obviously be dealt with &ldquo;in chambers&rdquo; by a judge. A widow may be in her home and a bad son or daughter may be seeking to get her out of the house and the facts in a case such as that should not be revealed in court.  There might also be the situation where a widow might be reluctant to go into court and that sort of situation can be dealt with by a judge &ldquo;in chambers&rdquo;.  It means that the judge, it does not matter where he sits, can deal with the matter in a practical commonsense way.</P>

      <P>I would not agree at all.  What we all want and what we agree we want is to have a hearing in private and we ought to say that.  I do not know what the Minister is talking about when he says that certain applications are heard &ldquo;in chambers&rdquo; with regard to lunacy because all the lunacy applications I have heard are made in the open court.  This may be by virtue of a provision in one of the <Col N="55" /> Courts of Justice Acts which I cannot recollect but at the present time all proceedings are heard in open court. That is why I think this phrase &ldquo;in chambers&rdquo; is vague.  There is no judge going to sit in court when he knows that &ldquo;in chambers&rdquo; means that he must hear it in one of his rooms.  This brings me back to accommodation; there just is not accommodation in Westport for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If we want to provide that people are entitled to have the law administered in their regard, they are entitled to have it administered in comfort and you cannot do that, say, in Westport.  The simple thing is to put in an amendment, accepting the physical fact, whatever our views are on &ldquo;in chambers&rdquo;, that this cannot be done in quite a number of courthouses around the country; not, indeed, that it is the responsibility of the Minister nor that he is to blame for it because, as he said, it is the local authority's job. Incorporated in this amendment we could have that these hearings shall be heard in private.  In private seems to me to mean &ldquo;in private&rdquo;.  That means that only those parties interested would be included and everybody else excluded.  That is done in affiliation orders and some other business.</P>

If proceedings are heard &ldquo;in chambers&rdquo; there is no formal fight as you have in court.  That is what the Bill envisages and that is what the Bill wants.  &ldquo;In chambers&rdquo; does not necessarily mean the judge's robing room.  The judge is not sitting formally in court&mdash;he can even hear the proceedings in his hotel sitting-room if he wishes.  It is a completely different form of application.

      <P>I have often thought that it is quite unfair under the present law of intestacy that a mother who looks after her children over a period of from ten to 12 years, from the ages, say, ten to 21, 14 to 21, and so on and who has taken out a grant and is personal representative and acts not alone as mother but, in relation to the property she owns, should have a duty to account to her children for the administration assets when they become 21 years, if they look for it.  The plain truth of the matter is that here is a mother who is trying to carry on and to do the best she can.  If she makes something out of the estate more than the one-third, that would be attributable to herself, by way of profit, of course all of that is spent on the children.  In cases of that kind there should be no obligation whatever on the mother to render any account to a child in respect of the management of the property during the child's infancy.  It seems to me that that accords with commonsense and that what happens in a great majority of cases where a man is fortunate enough to make his will leaving his property to his wife knowing she will look after the children is that the children get nothing.  It is an added misfortune to a widow where her husband dies intestate that she should ever be bothered with this fear that at some stage one of the children may become sour and apply to the court for the administration of the estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> I think, when introducing this proposal contained in the amendment we have just passed, that we should go the further distance and free the widow in a case of that kind from all liability to account to the child in respect of anything she may have done with the property.  If she chooses, as part of her means of rearing the children and as one of the means of keeping herself alive and providing herself with a livelihood to let the property in flats then she should not be under the obligation when all that has been done during the infancy of the children, to render any account to them when they come of age.  If her husband had the good fortune to make his will she would not be doing it and, equally so, I think that the Legislature, acting in the place of the husband who has not made his will, should make this kind of provision to free the widowed mother looking after children during infancy from all liability to account to the children for any profits she may have received or for the administration of this kind of property during their infancy.

      <P>The Senator does appreciate that these amendments are all in ease of the widow.  I think we have gone a good distance in this respect, but, of course, you can go too far.  You can have a situation where a spendthrift widow might proceed to deprive her own children of their share.  That is an exceptional case where a mother may go wrong.  We are providing for that exceptional eventuality by ensuring that she is the trustee of the share or shares of her infant child or children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the administration of the trustee share of the estate, section 58 (5) spells out that persons who are trustees under this section&mdash;for instance, a widow who is trustee for her infant children&mdash;may at any time or times pay or apply the capital of any share in the estate to which the infant is entitled for the advancement or benefit of the infant in such manner as they may, in their absolute discretion, <Col N="60" /> think fit and may, in particular, carry on any business in which the infant is entitled to a share.  There, we have fully covered the situation where a widow, in the ordinary course of administration, proceeds to deal with the infant's share in a proper way. It is an improvement on the present situation where she cannot buy a bicycle for her child without first going to court and engaging a solicitor and counsel for the purpose.  We are now spelling out here as a matter of right that she can operate the estate for the benefit of the children for whom she holds a trusteeship.</P>

      <P>It is completely wrong to say so except in the very few cases where the infant's property is in court and very often she is made an annual allowance by the court and she has to account for it.  It is quite irresponsible for the Minister to try to enlist sympathy by making statements of that kind which are quite unworthy of the Minister and his position.  The fact that we are permitting, under section 58 (5), the trustee or any person who is trustee for an infant to apply the benefit for the advancement of the estate and the infant in such manner as they in their discretion think fit and in particular to carry on a business does not relieve the widowed mother from accounting to her child for the profits out of the business.  This all gets back to the question as to whether or not we are going to trust mothers and fathers and husbands and wives in the disposition of their property after their death and in making provision for their dependants after their death.  We cannot, of course, legislate morality into people. That is a truism.  Neither can we legislate for every possible contingency but what we can do is to survey the situation and see how we find it.  One will <Col N="61" /> find that the overwhelming majority of mothers are not spendthrifts.  They could never survive in the economy in which they have to live and be spendthrifts.  Every mother and every housewife has to bear a constant burden in order to make ends meet. The woman in the small estate we are dealing with has a constant struggle to make ends meet and she is not the type that will dissipate the assets of her children.  Of course, there will be the odd woman who will over drink and spend money foolishly and there is nothing in this world that this legislature or any other legislature can do about that. We ought to have regard for the vast majority of good widowed mothers all over the country and we should do our best to relieve them of the strain of having, at some stage, to account to their children for the management of the property during the children's infancy.  It happens more frequently than one would wish it to happen.  The children, at some stage or another, begin to look for their shares.  If they do not they always have the grouse or grievance that they did not get what they were entitled to from their father's estate.  If they do not get it they will think their mother has cheated them out of something they thought they ought to have.  I would seriously urge the Minister to give further consideration to this matter and accept an amendment on the Report Stage to free the mother of all liability in a case of this kind.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Senator O'Quigley refers to the various small estates where the interests or profits from the estates barely keep the family alive.  The small shop or small farm where they live from hand to mouth barely keeps the family alive. If the Senator is referring to that kind of case the child cannot in practice look for account from the mother.  I have never known of such cases and I am quite certain that Senator O'Quigley has never known of such cases which came before the court.  If such cases came before the court the judge would take the ordinary practical view that the profit went to maintain the family.  If the amendment the Senator <Col N="62" /> wants goes in and applies to every estate, you would have an estate with a large amount of investments, a large amount of spare capital and a large amount of spare income and if the mother in the case of infant children dissipated those assets it would be a very serious matter for the children. It would be a very great injustice in the case where an estate is very large if the assets were dissipated.  This would be very serious if the woman became a spendthrift and the amount involved could be quite enormous.  The mere fact that the woman knows she must use a certain amount of common-sense and that she must apply a certain amount of practical application to the administration of the estate is a brake in itself.  It would be a pity if it was otherwise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section envisages the appointment of trustees in the case of an infant who is entitled to property.  The power to appoint trustees will reside in the personal representative of the deceased, and he may appoint a trust corporation of any two or more persons at the discretion of the personal representative whom he shall think fit.  The thing that concerns me is that in the ordinary course where there are applications to the court for the appointment of trustees for the purposes of the Settled Land Acts to exercise the powers of a tenant for life on behalf of an infant, that always provides a certain safeguard for the infant's wellbeing because the courts, as a matter of practice, take very good care to satisfy themselves that the persons appointed are trustworthy and creditworthy and have not an interest inimical to the infant's welfare.  This is a departure from that kind of procedure in relation to property which <Col N="63" /> the infant would be entitled to on the death of an intestate or under the legal shares right under the later provisions of this Bill in Part 9.</P>
      <P>I am not too happy that the personal representative can appoint two persons over whom there is no further control, because if the two persons are appointed by the personal representative then the personal representative, having vested the property in the two persons so appointed, is relieved by subsection (2) of all further liability.  We all know the kind of situation where trustees make off with the trust funds.  There is no provision here as to what is to happen if the trustees appointed under this section by a personal representative in the personal representative's anxiety to get rid of his own burdens are not trustworthy, creditworthy and reliable. There is no supervision after that over the persons appointed trustees.</P>
      <P>I am wondering whether the Minister would give thought to that particular aspect of the situation.  In the case of a trust corporation as I understand it it will probably be the executor or trusteeship section of a bank or one of the trust companies established by the various banks.  They are always liable and will be good marks in the event of a default, if there were default.  In the case of the two individuals who may be appointed trustees, I think there should be some sort of bond to be entered into, some security to be given by them, so that in the event of their making away with or dissipating the property of an infant there would be some assets against which the infant could claim.  I wonder has the Minister given any consideration to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be said that such a requirement would, perhaps, create certain difficulties for the personal representative, or for the persons appointed, but in the ordinary course up to the present time at any rate, in a case where the deceased has made a will, he has appointed a person or persons whom he trusts to be executors and trustees of the will, and these persons selected by him will act in a prudent manner on behalf of the infant.  On the <Col N="64" /> other hand, in a case of intestacy the administrator will hold the property on behalf of the infant and he is always answerable to the court and what is more important is the bond to administer the estate properly, and if the administrator made away with or dissipated the assets there is the bond to go against.</P>
    <P>We are creating a new situation here in which the personal representative can shelve his responsibility by appointing two persons as trustees. They can be good, bad or indifferent, and if they dissipate the assets the infant has no right of redress.  I would be extremely slow to agree to a provision of this type, and I think the Minister should have second thoughts about it.</P>

      <P>There is no need to go to that expense.  The personal representative has a legal obligation to the estate, and it is only proper that he should be in a position to appoint trustees, if he thinks it necessary, without going through the process of a court application, thereby incurring cost to the estate.  If the beneficiaries are harmed in any way by reason of the operations of the trustees, they have their redress by way of action against the trustees or the personal representative.  I think the section is merely providing a streamlined system which I feel should be welcomed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely sketching in the background of what has happened and the precautions taken by the law up to the present time, and pointing out the great consideration given by the courts when they appoint anyone to receive capital moneys on behalf of an infant and to act and exercise the powers of tenants <Col N="65" /> for life on behalf of an infant.  Great care is taken, and not infrequently the courts have refused applications because they were not satisfied that a person proposed to be appointed was a fit and proper person because of possible inimical interests as between the person proposed and the infant. One sees that happening regularly.  I did not say that I disagree with the idea of appointing trustees to hold the property of the infant in trust.  I agree with streamlining as far as possible. What I am concerned about is that the personal representative can appoint trustees who may turn out to be persons who will dissipate the assets of the infant.  The Minister then comes along and says that the beneficiaries if they are harmed in any way have a right of action against the personal representative or the trustee.  They have not because subsection (2) of section 57 provides that:</P>
      <P>On such appointment the personal representatives, as such, shall be discharged from all further liability in respect of the property vested in the trustees so appointed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>A person might be appointed who was a decent man up to that as far as the personal representative was aware but if he were given to gambling and gambled with the infant's assets and in that way dissipated the assets, the only right of action the infant would have when he comes of age, or, indeed, before that, would be against the trustee who has dissipated the assets.  In all likelihood <Col N="66" /> the reason for the dissipation of the assets is that the trustee himself has got into difficulties.  It is not an uncommon experience.  Anyone who has regard to what goes on in the world around us will see, as far as solicitors are concerned that our present law requires that solicitors who are responsible and trustworthy people have a load of sanctions hanging over them such as ordinary people do not have, that any breach of professional conduct or any indiscretions are always likely to be censured by the Incorporated Law Society or by the court. Solicitors are, at all times, officers of the court and at all times subject to the discipline of the court.  In spite of all that, the Legislature has found it necessary to enact that solicitors shall keep accounts because of the human failing not to do so.  Not alone that but the Legislature has created a fund from the contributions of the members of the solicitors' profession against which a person who has been deprived of his assets by the defalcations of a solicitor may claim.  In the case of people who have all this professional training and all these sanctions surrounding their everyday activities, the Legislature has thought it proper to have a fund to which people can go in the case of solicitors making away with money.  I do not think the infant taking proceedings against a trustee who has got no assets is a remedy. I certainly think the Minister should give some consideration to this provision and provide that where trustees are appointed they should enter into some kind of bond which would be available in the case of their making away with the assets of the infant.</P>

      <P>We were discussing earlier the situation in relation to the widow who would be entitled to have the house appropriated to her.  Before we adjourned for tea we were discussing the liability of a widow to account for the management of the <Col N="67" /> property, or profits she had made, during the infancy of the person for whom she held the property in trust. I think the Minister suggested that it was being provided in subsection (5) of section 58 that the widow in the case contemplated by the amendment to section 56 was being granted absolute discretion with respect to the advancement or benefit of the infant.  Therefore, in effect, what I was contending for if she had any liability to account for profits was covered by section 58 subsection (5).  On looking at it again, it seems to me that subsection (5) does not apply to the widow in the case we were discussing and&mdash;it applies to her only if she is also the trustee appointed under section 57 which we have just discussed.  Accordingly, the widow who is not a trustee appointed by the personal representative does not have the discretion I thought should be vested in her.  Perhaps, the Minister might have a look at that and make this type of provision applicable to the widow in subsection (4).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2), page 31, and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>( ) If an intestate dies leaving a spouse and issue the personal representative of the intestate shall hold the estate in trust for the surviving spouse for his or her life with remainder to the child or children or remoter issue of the intestate as <Col N="69" /> the surviving spouse shall by deed or will appoint and in default of appointment in trust for the children of the intestate equally.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which is not readily comprehended by non-legal minds or by this non-legal mind at any rate. However, it appeared to me that there was a very considerable problem running right through it, certain sections particularly, the problem of giving as much security as possible to the widow and children of a deceased person without at the same time breaking up the property of that person, at least avoiding the breaking up of it as much as possible.  This has been commented on on various Stages of the Bill in the other House and in the Press and, in looking through the Bill, I thought that, in this particular section, this problem had not been very well resolved.</P>
    <P>It seems that in subsection (2) of section 66 there is a hard and fast direction that a remaining spouse who dies intestate shall take two-thirds of the estate and that the remainder of the estate be distributed amongst the issue.  This might, I think, lead&mdash; particularly in the country districts, farms, and so on&mdash;to the danger of breaking up property and this might lead to the rendering of this property useless in the case of small estates because the fragments might be so small as to make the result very poor. I am not quite clear about how this and other sections which have been amended already and for which amendments have been suggested by Senator Miss Davidson impinge on each other.  I suggest this amendment now at this stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the opinion of other Senators, particularly those who are versed in legal matters, as to the desirability of having this amendment. In discussing this matter, I hope somebody will tell me whether the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo; relates to all issue, in other words, issue by another marriage, for instance.  Is that included in the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo; as used in this section and, indeed, in other places in this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support <Col N="70" /> this amendment.  Indeed, a lot of what one would have to say about later sections of the Bill could also be said upon this because it seems to me to meet the kind of situation that exists to a small degree, that, as I said before is a very important and pressing situation for the people whom it affects and is one which everybody wishes to resolve.  The idea behind the amendment proposed by Senator Jessop appeals to me for the reason that in the vast majority of married settlements made in the country&mdash;and this applies not only to rural Ireland but to the country as a whole&mdash;either the husband holds the property for his life or jointly with his wife for life and then the survivor holds it after the death of the other spouse and then there is always a provision that the property is to go to such one or other of the children as the surviving spouse may by deed or will appoint.  There can be no doubt that that is the way in which many farms of land and many businesses have been settled.  In fact, at any time where there is a marriage setlement that is almost invariably the means for settling the property and it has been found to work well.  It provides continuity for the particular piece of property whether it is a farm or a business.  It is continued as an entity.  At the same time, by virtue of the wide powers which a tenant for life has under the Settled Land Acts, the property can be managed to the very best advantage.</P>
      <P>What, I suppose, is our chief concern here is the case of a surviving widow and this amendment ensures that she has the full value of property for her life in the same way as she had it during the lifetime of her husband. I suppose no woman or man can expect more from her husband or his wife than that he or she should enjoy the property for life in the same way as the predeceasing spouse has only enjoyed it under the marriage settlement, taking a life interest in it.  For that reason, I think the amendment gives legislative effect to what is the all but invariable practice in the marriage settlements made up and down the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one wished to confine it to <Col N="71" /> immovable property&mdash;and here there may be a variety of opinions&mdash;if the principle of the amendment were accepted, it might be desirable to say that we will confine this merely to immovable property such as a farm or a business and provide that the wife would have a life interest in it, and then, if one wants give her a half share or a one-third share in the personal estate consisting of money or securities. That could readily be done.  I think the principle which is involved here would provide the kind of security for the widow that we all want to give her and at the same time, would ensure that the property would be left in the family because she would be able, under this, to leave it to one of her children.  When you look at the section which this seeks to amend you find this kind of a situation that the widow will be entitled to take two-thirds of the estate and the remainder of it is to be distributed among the children.  In the case of a small property, a small farm or a small business and, of course, in the case of the salaried or wage earner who dies leaving only a house and a relatively small amount of money, two-thirds in many instances will not be enough to keep the widow going.  It would be much better that she had the whole for her life rather than be given the two-thirds.</P>

      <P>If that were done, it would eliminate all questions of children who have grown up, who have got their education or their start in life from the home, having any claim upon the property that was left and it would be available for the widow entirely.  As I say, if you take the small farmer under £10 valuation, under £20 valuation, the under £10 valuation, farm in the west of Ireland or in Donegal or in Kerry will not give a good livelihood even to the widow. One may ask how did the husband get a livelihood out of it during his lifetime. He got a livelihood out of it plus work with the county council or with Bord na Móna or the odd day's work for farmers here and there and <Col N="72" /> for other people.  The plain truth of the matter is that two-thirds of many of the small farms of this country are quite inadequate to support a widow without some further means.  It seems to me that if she got the whole lot she would not be getting too much.  In many cases she certainly would not be getting enough.  It also seems to me that the provision in this amendment accords with the general policy of the Legislature, not alone since the establishment of this State but for long before that, that small farms should not be fragmented.  Indeed, under the Land Act, 1965 as, indeed, under previous Land Act legislation since the foundation of the State, and before that again, there has always been provisions against subdivision of holdings bought out under the land Purchase Acts.  It seems to me, if the children of a deceased person wish to obtain their share of the small farm or small business that, inevitably, in order that that share should be paid, the property must be sold.  I do not know how that can be done and at the same time how the widow can be entitled, under the amendment passed here this evening to subsection (4) of section 56, to retain dwellings, having regard to the provisions of the Land Act, section 12. I wonder how that will be achieved?</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the simple straightforward and easy remedy is to say the holding will continue and that the widow will have it for her life and that she can appoint it among such of her children as she thinks right to have the estate after her death.  That, to my mind, offends no principle which the Minister seeks to establish in this Bill. It gives a much greater measure of security to the widow on the small farm or the widow in a small shop than would be given to her by merely giving her two-thirds interest in the property.  If the amendment is not regarded as entirely practical in respect of giving her life interest in all the property of her husband, then I should hope that Senator Jessop would be prepared to withdraw the amendment and confine it to immovable property which would embrace the farm or business with the goodwill attached to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> If the Minister were to take a gallop poll of married women in the country as to whether or not they would like to have the whole of their husband's farm or shop for the rest of their lives with the power to appoint it to one or other of their children, as they should decide, to get the estate after her death or get two-thirds and have the property sold over their heads, I should think that the vast majority would prefer to continue on in the security that they could live out their lives in the homes they were married into and in which they brought up their families in the knowledge that after their death they could give the property to such one or other of their children as looked after them best during their lifetime.  That would conform better with the views of the people in this country than with what is contained in section 66 of this legislation, which, be it said, is only a modification in relation to the share which the widow gets, two-thirds as compared with one-third under the Intestate Estates Act enacted when women had virtually no vote, and were regarded as chattels of their husbands and certainly had none of the rights they have in a modern democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has much to recommend it, if one takes it in isolation.  The idea behind it and the purpose which it would achieve would in many respects be good. My objection to it is that it undoubtedly runs counter to other provisions of the Bill and to the general principles which underline Part IX.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part IX of the Bill provides that the widow should get a very definite share, a third share, and this suggestion now departs from that principle.  It is provided that, instead of getting a definite share as she would under the Bill as it stands, she should merely have a life interest and the power to decide which of her children should take the estate after her death.  This to my mind, introduces a completely different principle.  You would have the position, if this amendment were accepted, that one principle <Col N="74" /> is being adopted in this Part of the Bill and an entirely different principle in another Part.  I see no reason, if we were to accept this amendment, why, when we come to Part IX, section 110, it would not be logical to be consistent so that we would have to amend that section also and set out that the one-third share which the widow is to get under it should be held by a personal representative or by a trustee for the benefit of the surviving spouse during her life and afterwards to the children as she might direct.</P>
    <P>You cannot adopt two entirely different principles in the Bill.  Consequently, as I am completely in agreement with the principle adopted in section 110, I could not agree with this amendment.  Although, as I say, in isolation, the amendment has much merit I could not agree with or support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, with regard to what Senator E. Ryan has just said, when you put down an amendment to a section of a Bill knowing that the amendment, if accepted, would entail amending some other sections you would get the amendment passed first.  You would not go through every section of the Bill requiring amendment and put down amendments to each of those sections. The principle would be accepted first and when the principle was agreed it would be very easy to amend the other sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I put down an amendment to section 110 and many of the comments I intended making on that section would equally apply here.  I preferred, at the time, to leave my remarks over for section 110.  I feel that the principle behind Senator Jessop's amendment is the right principle.  I should like to suggest one small amendment to the wording by the addition to &ldquo;in trust for the surviving spouse for his or her life with remainder to the child or children&rdquo; of &ldquo;or failing such, to the remoter issue&rdquo;.  However, that is only a small matter that perhaps the Seanad will consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this business of the half or quarter or one-third share, as Senator <Col N="75" /> O'Quigley mentioned in the country districts at any rate it could do a lot of harm and it is completely contrary to what we are trying to do in the country, that is, to get farms undivided to go as soon as possible to the elder son or whoever is going to succeed.  We have had it in the old age pensions code where we tried to get the old man to take the pension as soon as he could and give his farm to his son.  We had it in the Land Act, which possibly we know by heart, in which under section 6 we were giving pensions to old people to try to get them to leave the bit of land to one of the family.</P>
    <P>Here we are going back again.  In most of these small farms in the country the widow has probably no other assets.  She will probably be a much younger person than her husband, and here we are saying that for her life she is going to be the owner of a half or one-third of that farm.  It is a pity that the Minister could not accept the principle of for life.  For one thing you might consider&mdash;and it does happen&mdash;that this might even encourage the widow to marry again, and under the Bill there is going to be a very difficult situation on that farm.  I do not know whether statistics can be produced of the number of intestates there are in the country. There must be a considerable number of small farmers who die intestate or die saying: &ldquo;I leave the farm to my eldest son&rdquo; or something like that, and in these cases under this section and section 110 you are going to run into that difficulty in the country.</P>
    <P>I think the amendment I have put down to section 110 would apply here. The gist of these amendments is to leave it to the widow for life.  A will is very commonly made where a man especially with young children will leave his farm or all his property to his widow for life because at that stage he does not know in what way his children are growing up or whether they will have any interest in the land whatsoever.  I would be sorry if the Minister could not see his way to accept a life interest.  It would probably <Col N="76" /> be just as valuable a safeguard to the widow, and I cannot imagine the widow in that case renouncing either before or after she gets it within a year or whatever time it is because there would perhaps be no alternative and she would feel at that stage &ldquo;I will not do anything now.&rdquo;  I imagine that that would be the attitude she would take up.</P>
    <P>Under this section when half the farm belongs to a widow the person who works it, makes a good job of the farm, and improves it beyond all measure does not know what is going to happen.  It is not his own and might never be his own.</P>
    <P>That is one reason why I would support this.  The other reason is one which I feel is very important, too, that this breaking up of any property, even a large farm, this dividing into two sections, would not happen very often.  I agree with the Minister on that, and that the whole Bill perhaps is dealing with exceptional cases, but you will have a case where there is a large farm and the owner has worked all his life to get it the way he wants it and there is sometimes perhaps not a son but a nephew to whom he will leave the place who will take an interest in it.  These people have that terrific interest in the land not so much as property but in that place that they want to see whoever succeeds them make the best of it.  Those people are not patriots in the ordinary sense of the word but they are people from whom patriots are bred.  It is very important that this sort of place should not be broken up.  You will have a case where there is no will and nothing is done about it and half of it goes to somebody else who may be far better off than the owner of the property&mdash;half must go to such a person&mdash;and something happens then, there is some falling out in the family, and it has to be divided or sold.  It would be a pity to go as far as that when the other thing is much more safe and possibly a much more valuable asset for the widow.  I am accepting that it is a widow in most cases here.  She is looked after by the son or whoever may be managing the place and the full value of the half <Col N="77" /> share is hers for life.  The possibility of her selling it when she is absolute owner is small and, therefore, it is not of any more value to her as an income to sell.  It would be far better for her as well as for everybody else that it should be managed properly and that half the income or one-third or whatever it was should go to her.</P>
    <P>These are matters that are important and they apply to section 110 just as much as to this section.  I would ask the Minister to see again whether he could not accept a life interest instead of the total interest under these two sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very definite view personally, apart from as Minister for Justice, about life estates. I think they are a very bad form of land holding.  This has been the experience in Britain and in 1958 they introduced a Variation of Trusts Act to enable the court to vary those trusts or settlements where property is tied up in such a way that it becomes immobilised.  You get a situation in which neither the life tenant nor the remainder man can make any use of the property or raise money by way of loan on the life tenancy or the remainder estate.  I have always strongly held the view that this type of arrangement is not suitable in our conditions, and the only exception is that, in very rare circumstances where a life estate could be more value, there might be an argument for it; but in Britain they have introduced the Variation of Trusts Act, 1958, to enable the court to break up these trust settlements.  I intend also to introduce shortly a variation of trusts measure here.  It is desirable that the courts should be empowered to vary trusts in a way that will be to the greater financial and economic advantage of beneficiaries.  Indeed, Senator Garret FitzGerald raised this very point on the Committee Stage of the recent Finance Bill and I agree fully with the point he mentioned.  He advocated this idea of introducing a variation of trusts measure here which would deal precisely with the situation advocated in this amendment by Senator Cole and Senator O'Quigley, this situation of leaving property with remainder immobilised and having no <Col N="78" /> way of dealing with it economically to raise money by way of security to improve the business, property, farm or whatever it may be.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to introduce an entirely new principle.  For many years now we have had intestacy provisions guaranteeing one-third to the widow and so on.  We are now improving this position to guarantee two-thirds to her on intestacy and one-third to the children should she have surviving children; and in the event of there being no children she will get all the property.</P>
      <P>These intestacy provisions have been widely commended both by the various professional groups who are concerned with this measure and by the Dáil itself.  It surprises me to see it being raised here, because intestacies in this country are roughly 50 per cent of total successions, and that 50 per cent would, under the amendment, automatically give rise to life estates. I would regard that as a highly retrograde step.  As it is, we are providing improved intestacy provisions for the benefit of the widow.  In 50 per cent of the farms and properties there is no sell-out.  There is no difficulty of that kind.  There is no fragmentation. Indeed, in a later section we are abolishing tenancies in common which lead to fragmentation.  At the moment these intestacies do not lead to fragmentation or sell-outs.</P>
      <P>I was at pains to emphasise here and in the other House that what we are proposing in the way of a legal right&mdash;this is not strictly relevant to this section&mdash;is a legal right to a share. The widow will have this right which she can enforce if she wishes or if she feels she is being wronged in any way. She need not enforce it at all.  Indeed I am convinced that she will seldom enforce it.  It is a legal right which the widow may use as a last resort to ensure that she gets justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another misconception in the criticism of this measure&mdash;and it is implicit in what Senator Jessop and Senator Cole said&mdash;is that we are in some way doing away with life estates or the possibility of life estates being created.  As I have indicated, I do not agree with life estates, but, if a testator <Col N="79" /> wants to create a life estate for his wife with remainder for his children or any other form of settlement, he can still do that.  There is nothing in this Bill to prevent it.  He can create a life estate if his wife is happy to accept it, and he can make any other arrangement for his children or for anyone else.  We are not seeking to debar anyone from making that sort of an arrangement.  Of course, if the widow is not happy about it and if she thinks it is a bad arrangement, she can, in the ultimate, exercise her legal right.</P>
    <P>What Senator Jessop seeks in his amendment in relation to intestacy provisions would have a very serious consequence.  We are altering the present intestate rules for the benefit of the widow.  Are we now to import into the situation life estates which will tie up property to the extent that the owner will be unable to raise money to expand production and unable to get the money which one could normally get on any property?  This is a very dangerous situation.  It is an innovation and I think the Seanad should think very seriously about it.  I would certainly oppose any amendment along those lines for the reasons which I have mentioned.  It is against the progressive trend of thinking which leans against life estates.  If I were not Minister for Justice and if I were asked for my advice as a legal adviser&mdash;and I have done this&mdash;I would advise people against life estates.  As I have said, the trend in Britain, too, is against that.  Consequently, I ask the Seanad to reject the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see the Minister's argument at all.  If A tries to get a mortgage or to borrow money on a farm and he says: &ldquo;My mother is a widow and she has half a share in the farm&rdquo;; and B says: &ldquo;My mother is a widow and she has a life estate in the farm&rdquo;, would it make any difference whatsoever to the lender?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, this is relevant to a later section.  The legal right must be enforced within a year.  It lapses after a year.  At the end of the <Col N="80" /> year the property will be better from the point of view of raising a mortgage than a property with a life interest.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I should also like to mention that in section 120 we have further provision whereby right up to the day of his death with the consent of his wife the testator can assign property to the son of his choice by way of deed.  If he decides during his lifetime that one son or daughter should manage his farm he can make that assignment by way of deed.  There is also the legal right provision for the widow but the testator can assign or <Col N="81" /> will the property to the child of his choice subject to the child looking after his mother to the extent of the one third legal right share which she has and which she may or may not enforce.</P>
      <P>You can get clear title by way of will or by way of deed subject to one third, as the legal right share, residing in the mother.  In most cases that right will not be enforced, but if it is to be enforced it must be enforced within 12 months.  That sort of situation gives rise to far better title than the situation of a life estate with remainder over.  I certainly would regard it as detrimental to embody the principle suggested in the amendment in the Bill. It is against the whole scheme of the Bill; it is against the intestacy provisions which have lasted over a long number of years in this country and which we are improving here for the benefit of the widow and which, mark you, both outside and inside the Dáil, found approbation on all sides.  The adjusted provisions, as I have said, are generally welcomed by everybody with whom I have discussed the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that the improvement provisions in the share of the intestate's property have won approbation both outside and inside the Dáil.  That may be so but they do not have the benefit of Senator Jessop's amendment.  Of course, everybody agrees for the simple reason that it is giving the widow more than she has at the present time; it is increasing her share from one third to two thirds.  We say that she should be given the lot for life.  The Minister has been eloquently unconvincing but he is obsessed with what goes on in Great Britain.  On the last occasion he was able to tell us what went on in Scotland and we also heard of Switzerland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was taking a point of Senator Garret FitzGerald's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall leave that to Senator Garret FitzGerald with great confidence.  Of course, the position of a life tenant is remediable if it suffers from the defects the Minister thinks it suffers from.  Apparently <Col N="82" /> they thought that in Britain and they have introduced a new law to vary the trust under which the property was held.  The Settled Land Acts were brought in to remedy a state of affairs which was detrimental to the land owners and property holders in 1872, or whenever the Settled Land laws were brought in.</P>
      <P>If a new situation has arisen in this country which would make it desirable that life tenants, persons with life interest in property, should have further powers and if the Minister thinks that they cannot borrow as effectively as full owners then, of course, the very obvious and simple remedy there is to give them further power by statute.  There seems to me to be no reason why we cannot enact a new variation of the Settled Land Acts to enable a tenant for life to borrow money on the security of the property for which he is tenant for life and to charge it on the property for the purpose of improvement.  That having been done, if it is borrowed for the purpose of improving the property, then he who takes it afterwards will take a better property with, perhaps, an encumbrance but he will get a better property.  All this argument about the disability from which a life tenant suffers goes by the board when you realise that the powers of a life tenant are such as are given to him by statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall go further than that and say that if the Minister is correct about the terrible disabilities from which life tenants and so on suffer the truth of the matter is that under the Land Project there must have been hundreds and hundreds of estates where somebody took out a grant of administration and went along to the Land Registry and then the lands were charged with the Land Project payment in the same way as the land annuity.  The administrator in that kind of case was no different in practice from the life tenant we are seeking to establish under this particular amendment. My recollection is that under one of the amendments of the Agricultural Credit Acts we made provision to deal with this kind of situation; that grants could be made and charged on <Col N="83" /> the property irrespective of whether or not the person who was applying for the grant had a valid legal title to it. Once the property was being improved by the grant the person getting it or the Agricultural Credit Corporation was entitled to create a burden upon the land.  Again, that kind of difficulty was resolved by statute.</P>
    <P>Senator E. Ryan, has a great desire for consistency and likes, and is, indeed, tempted by this particular amendment.  Again apparently on the grounds of consistency, he finds himself reluctantly compelled to resist it. He says he is wedded to section 110 which will give the surviving spouse a legal right share and he will not have anything that will depart from that.  If we are interested in looking after the welfare of a widow then it does not seem to me to be consistent to say that a widow of a testator will get only one third where there are children and the widow of an intestate with two children will get two thirds. I fail to see where the consistency is there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are not mandatory provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here in the main with the welfare of widows.  We propose that if the husband does not like his wife and disinherits her then she be entitled to one third but if the husband dies intestate, whether he liked his wife or not, she will get two thirds.  There seems to me to be no logic whatever in that.  If what we are concerned about is the widow who will be disinherited, the widow of a man who is crafty enough to make a will should get at least as much as one who dies intestate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the grounds of consistency there is no argument for retaining subsection (2) of section 66 as it stands. But there is an argument for giving the widow in both cases a life estate so that she has the entire of the property and if it becomes necessary without awaiting an amendment of the Settled Land Acts&mdash;such as the Minister contemplates bringing in&mdash; there is no reason why in this legislation we should not confer upon the <Col N="84" /> widow the necessary powers to manage the lands properly and for that purpose, to borrow whatever money is necessary for the proper utilisation of the lands.  I cannot for the life of me see how the position will be improved under this Bill where as against the life tenant the widow will be entitled to this floating one third interest in the assets of the deceased. Practical difficulties will always arise where a person is either selling or mortgaging land as to what one third of the assets of the deceased was.  It is perfectly straightforward to say that a widow is entitled to one third share in the lands comprised in folio 100 of County Dublin; that is perfectly clear and understandable.  It is another thing to say she is entitled, amongst other things, to one third of the assets of her husband.  Who is to say whether or not she has been paid the full one third or what is to be the consideration for her releasing her one third share over the land?  I anticipate the greatest difficulty arising when it comes to the practical application of the one third share.  Whoever is lending money to her, will not know what she owns.</P>
    <P>It is entirely vague.  I can see banks, the Agricultural Credit Corporation and other institutions of that kind being very sceptical and raising all classes of impossible requisitions before they part with their money on the security of a person who has no vested estate in the land but who apparently would always have a right to sell it. This is relevant, I think, on this section and I should like the Minister to indicate his view upon it.  As I understand the section we were dealing with earlier, section 46 (6), the widow is entitled to take, on death intestate, a two thirds interest in the property, and that interest, that legal right, as I understand it, will prevail over every other interest except charges on the land prior to the death of the deceased.</P>
    <P>If a widow refuses to release her legal interest or to join in it and somebody is getting a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation then the Agricultural Credit Corporation as legal mortgagees would seek to be entitled to sell the property at any <Col N="85" /> time to realise their security.  Will the legal right of the widow be prior to the right of the Agricultural Credit Corporation?  Will she be entitled to look for an order to enforce the same over the head of the Agricultural Credit Corporation or what will the position be?  If she merely has a legal right that she cannot enforce under some power of sale it seems worthless but if she has a legal right that entitles her to sell I cannot see any banking institution lending money on the security of a farm where there is somebody else who has a prior legal right to them to sell the property for whatever they like without any regard to whether or not the security is realised. All that kind of difficulty can be got rid of straight away as far as intestacy is concerned by giving the widow a life interest in the estate with all the present powers of a tenant for life and any further powers that may be desirable or necessary to vest in the tenant for life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue is whether it is more for the public good that when a man dies intestate his widow gets two thirds and his children have a legal right of one third or that when he dies intestate that his widow gets a life interest in her estate and that when she dies his children get everything equally between them.  She has no right to make a will.  Her estate finishes when she dies.  Then all the children become equally entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us apply that to the ordinary practical case where we meet a man, with a shop or a man with a farm who has a wife and four or five children.  By the time the widow dies her children have grown up.  One stays at home and works and manages the farm with his mother or works and manages the shop with his mother.  The others go away, get positions here or emigrate.  If that widow has only a life estate, immediately she dies that entire estate is liable to be fragmented.  The boy who has gone to England or to America and, if she lives long enough it may be difficult to trace that child if he has not been corresponding with home, has an equal right not only to the entire estate but also to any profits <Col N="86" /> made on it in the meantime.  Surely in those circumstances there is no encouragement whatsoever for any child to stay at home, for any child to help to work a farm, knowing that his mother cannot even will it, that she can give him nothing whatsoever, that his brother who has gone to England and has become a carpenter earning £12 or £14 a week while he is slaving at home for a packet of cigarettes will have as much when the mother dies.  That would be a most unhappy state of affairs.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the widow gets a definite two-thirds, that is, two-thirds of the estate that she can bequeath, the remaining one-third belongs to the children as of right but, if they do not exercise their right within 12 years&mdash;if one emigrates to America, another to England, and so on&mdash;then the boy who stays at home and is on the farm for 12 years after his brothers and sisters have gone, and his mother have acquired by prescription a legal right to the estate, and she can will her two-thirds to him and he has the entire estate. He is encouraged, therefore, to stay at home and keep his father's farm or business going.  The most important factor of all in the public good is that the family should be kept together and that somebody should be kept in this country to maintain his father's farm or business and not to have everything dissipated.  Otherwise there is no encouragement to anybody. Otherwise, with great respect to the powers of mortgagees, it is completely impractical and theoretical.  The personal representative can mortgage the farms.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the real estate as well as the personal estate vests in the administrator or in the administratrix. He can mortgage the farm, go to the bank, to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and so on; the question of mortgaging or credit does not arise at all.  What is very important is that there should be an encouragement to one child or to two children as the case may be&mdash;if the mother is old there should be an encouragement for a daughter to stay at home as well&mdash;to stay there to manage and <Col N="87" /> to keep that farm and the business going.</P>

One deals with the situation in which the owner dies intestate; the other in which he is presumably intending to disinherit his wife and children&mdash; and we are trying to prevent him from doing that.  I thoroughly agree that he should be prevented from doing that.

      <P>From his practical knowledge, Senator Nash put the position very cogently.  Precisely what <Col N="88" /> would happen in the event of this amendment being adopted is that you would have a life estate on which no credit could be raised and then a situation where a child remaining on, the important child for the farm or small business, would have no guarantee of being the child on whom the life tenant mother would settle the property.  This is precisely the difficulty which would arise in this case.  The child who had gone to America or Africa or elsewhere could be the child appointed by the life tenant mother and the person who had remained on in the property and who had looked after the business might be completely debarred.  That is the kind of situation we do not want to arise.  We want a situation where, on intestacy, it occurs, as happens in 50 per cent of the cases in Ireland, that the widow with two-thirds has got substantial assets on which to raise credit, on which to improve a farm and on which she can go into the bank and obtain credit. The son who remains on the farm or in the business will, in due course, by way of deed, receive that property. He could also receive it by way of a will.  That son would receive one third by right.</P>

      <P>It is extremely difficult to follow what the Minister has to say because the last lifeline he is grasping on to is the new provision under which title will be acquired after a lapse of six years, that is after a lapse of six years provided a second child has not remained at home.  If that happens the statute will not run and if there is any question of monetary payment the statute will not run. The Minister's argument is as absurd as any that was ever made, that you say you base the section of an Act and the wellbeing of a family on the possibility that people will go away from the farm and that those remaining on will acquire the whole title in six years or twelve years.</P>

      <P>The Minister assumes a great deal.  The idea of founding the wellbeing of a family on this kind of possibility is just a sheer gamble.  I am sure Senator Nash must know that many and many a time people have come into his office and have said they want to get their name down on the register or get their name down for land and he has taken full particulars to see whether they could apply for registration under section 52 of the Registration of Title Act, 1891.  He has had to send them away and tell them to wait for another few years.  Senator Nash knows it is quite difficult to acquire title to register land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens when one member of the family of a deceased is in a mental home?  This happens quite frequently. No title can be acquired as against the person who is mentally incapacitated and no title will run in the case of an infant until that infant comes of age.  So, if one son was aged 19 and another seven when the father died it would be fourteen years plus <Col N="90" /> another three years until the son of 19 and the mother would acquire title.  You can take six years from that under the proposed new limitation and it would be eleven years until infancy, which prevents the Statute of Limitations from running, is eliminated from the case.  Therefore, with the contingency of disability in the form of insanity which happens in a small number of cases, with the possibility of an acknowledgement in the case of some of the claimants and the possibility of some monetary payment being made to prevent the statute running, this is a great way of getting a boy to remain at home and get one third!  It is quite absurd.</P>

      <P>I remember in 1958 I had an application under section 52 of that Act and the solicitor was very wroth with me because I did not send back the papers in time.  That was in 1958.  Seven years later the papers came to me because it took all that time for the title to mature.  The solicitor was not dissatisfied but he accepted the position.  He thought in 1958 the application was right for a section 52 application.  One meets this kind of thing quite frequently.  This is a great way to encourage a son to remain at home so that he and the mother will acquire title under the Statute of Limitations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the widow is left the property for life and a particular son remains at home she does not have to wait for the passage even of six years.  She can, within that time, settle the property on her son and that is an inducement for him to stay on.  That is a straightforward way to deal with <Col N="91" /> the matter and no difficulty at all arises with regard to credit.  I would like to inquire from Senator Nash, if in his wide experience, he ever had a case where a widow had her one third share and maybe a child remained on but who had not acquired title to the remaining two thirds because one of the brothers or sisters was under disability?  There is nobody who would give a halfpenny credit on a farm with a title of that kind.  I am sure Senator Nash has had experience of that kind of predicament.  Under the section the widow will get two thirds and her children will get the balance but for a period of six years she will be bound hand and foot and unable to obtain the moneys that might be necessary to set the farm in full production.  I think that Senator Jessop has done great service to the House in putting down this amendment and that great service would be done to the people of the country if it were accepted.  I have no doubt whatever that it exactly meets the situation, and had it been incorporated in the Bill when the Minister was consulting those outside bodies he spoke about they would have approved of it even more than they did the present meagre increase from one-third to two-thirds, and likewise there would possibly not have been half the opposition to this Bill if this suggestion had been incorporated.</P>

      <P>I want to emphasise again that in over 50 per cent of the cases at the moment property is descending by way of intestate succession in Ireland.  The sort of thing that has been mentioned here just does not arise in 99.9 per cent of those cases.  Secondly, if a testator does, I think misguidedly, want to give his property by way of life estate he is fully entitled to do so. He can do it under this Bill.  The widow can take a life estate and the children can be appointed by her. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent that happening.  Of course, if she is not satisfied with that, that is another day's work.  She can enforce her legal right.  But there is nothing to prevent a testator leaving an estate for life or entering into any other form of arrangement provided his wife agrees with it.  That is the situation, and that is a thing I would like to emphasise here.</P>
      <P>It would be disastrous in my view if we made it compulsory in regard to 50 per cent of Irish property that life estates would be created.  That would be importing into the structure of property holding a completely new conception, that you would make it mandatory in 50 per cent of cases of succession to property that a life estate be established with remainder over.  As I said earlier, that is the type of estate and the type of arrangement which is completely out of touch with the modern world.  A life estate with remainder was a feudalistic conception which belonged in England particularly where estates were held in this manner and tied up in a family for generations. It is now going in Britain; it is gone throughout the world.  It is common cause for lawyers in every country of the world and for progressive lawyers here to advise their clients against tying up property in this fashion.  These are the facts of life in 1965.</P>

      <P>As regards section 116, in the Bill prior to this you had the situation where there was a compulsory legal right for the children as well.  I decided to delete that for some of the reasons already mentioned by Senator O'Quigley and to provide that the only mandatory share would be the widow's and that a child who felt prejudiced would have a right to apply to the court.  That is a different situation to this.  In the case of intestacy the child gets his legal right, his share of one-third, but in the case of testacy he has no legal rights under this Bill and must apply to the court if he is prejudiced.  There is that distinction.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult <Col N="94" /> to amend this Bill in a way that would meet the kind of cases one would want to meet.  When the original Bill was before the Dáil there were certain amendments put down which dealt with the kind of cases I am going to mention now.  Very often one finds in a family that there is one child who will never earn a living because of delicacy in health or physical or mental handicap.  It seems to me that if we are solicitous for the well-being of a widow who is in the whole of her health we ought to show equal solicitude for a child of an intestate, and, indeed, of a testator, who will never be able to earn a living or at least a good living.  Our solicitude should be directed to providing that if you are going to leave two thirds to the widow where you have a child who falls into any of the categories I have mentioned it is unreasonable to say that you can give one third of one third to a fellow who has a good job with the Government, as the phrase has it, or the county council or elsewhere, or give another third to a girl who is married and may already have got a fortune out of the place, and that you have no solicitude for the unfortunate who is never going to be able to earn a proper livelihood.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether all that Senator Cole has been saying would not make an impact so that it would be possible to amend section 116 to provide that an application on behalf of the child of a testator would apply equally to the child of an intestate where the court would be satisfied that the moral duty lay upon a deceased intestate person to leave whatever property he could leave to a physically or mentally handicapped or delicate child who will never be able to earn a livelihood.  I think Senator Cole's point is well founded and perhaps if we do not amend it on this section, on section 116 we might consider applying this beneficial provision to the case of the child of an intestate who falls into one or other of the categories I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I am not claiming that this Bill is perfect.  I do not think any scheme in regard to intestacy can <Col N="95" /> be perfect.  I think the best thing is for the mother or father to make a will providing for the child.  That is the obvious answer.  I do not think it would be desirable to further extend the system of court applications.  If we bring in a system of court administration on intestacy there will be trouble and there will be wholesale insecurity in regard to title.  There will be a large number of applications.  I think court applications should be restricted as much as possible.  The less the courts intervene in this matter the better.  The only reason why I brought in court applications was to meet the point advocated in particular by Deputy John A. Costello in the Dáil, a point of view I hold myself.  The original scheme provided for a mandatory one third in the case of the children in addition to the mandatory legal right of one third for the widow which would lead to fragmentation. It was felt that children who were already settled in life in a profession or in business, or had departed from the country, would come in for the mandatory one third share.  Reluctantly I decided to bring in the system of court applications in section 116.  It is the lesser of two evils compared to the danger of fragmentation which could arise where a number of children would come in for their share. I would be very reluctant to extend the court application system to intestacies. As I said, 50 per cent of succession cases would then be open to court investigation and administration.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister should not be so afraid of the courts as he is.  They are not as bad as all that.  Application to the court is a security and a protection for the <Col N="96" /> unfortunates we all want to assist. Certainly it is the lesser of two evils. It is not an evil at all because in the case of the unfortunates we want to assist it is a benefit.  If a person is just being awkward there is always the sobering remedy to deal with that kind of person.  We can provide in the Bill that we will have to pay the costs if he fails.  When a solicitor is advising his client if he said: &ldquo;You have not a chance; you would not be regarded by the courts as being physically handicapped or as suffering from a delicate state of health and the court would not give you the one third; you may have to pay the costs out of your share&rdquo;, this would greatly restrain unwarranted applications.  The Minister should think about this again and he should dissipate his fears of having fragmentation of title by providing that this application should be made within a year.  If the application must be made within a year the title would be uncertain for a period only.  The estate would not have to be administered for a year anyway and no harm could be done.  Our paramount consideration should be for the child who needs all he can get from the father.  We should not draw back from giving that advantage to the child simply because it involves court applications.  As regards the question of title we can provide that the application should be made within one year of the grant being issued.  The Minister would do very well, having accepted the principle in section 116&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one point on this section.  At the moment a solicitor who is an executor theoretically is not a beneficiary under the will.  That means that such a solicitor cannot witness the will.  At least if he witnesses, he has to take out administration and he cannot even charge out-of-pocket expenses for so doing.  I should like to direct the Minister's attention to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>It does mean that if a client wants the solicitor to witness a will in such circumstances the solicitor has to send out or maybe call in somebody from next door to witness the will, especially if he has a small office with only one typist.  Therefore, he has got to send out for somebody <Col N="99" /> to witness the will and very often the client does not like it.  The solicitor does not benefit under the will and he charges the normal fee for taking out probate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Senator Nash has just said.  There are some dangers, of course, but the position of solicitors is such that they have got to free the way for what they do.  In any event, the stage has been reached where the solicitor who is required to act or, as executor, is required to witness the will will explain the legal position with regard to costs to the client and a clause can be incorporated in the will providing that the solicitor will be entitled to charge his normal and proper costs.  Since that is valid, I do not see any reason why we should not enable him to sign a will without this kind of penalty and to act as well without the penalty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>

    <P>
      <Col N="101" /> Much of what we have been saying on section 66, on Senator Jessop's amendment, is probably relevant to this and succeeding amendments.  These are the provisions of the Bill which have created the greatest controversy both in the Dáil and among various callings in life in this country and, indeed, among the people generally.  It is quite clear that the original misconception as to what ought to be done to deal with the disinherited widow, that what was sought to be done originally was not the correct remedy for the problem that was to be dealt with.  As I said before, because of the way this Bill is constructed it becomes very difficult to amend it in a way that would meet the situation in the kind of way that one wants to.  I have anticipated that the Minister may adopt a particular attitude in relation to this particular amendment and, consequently, I have put down other amendments in case the first was not acceptable.  But I want to say quite clearly that I understand &mdash;if I am incorrect, the Minister should correct me&mdash;the Minister to say on the Second Stage that the Incorporated Law Society, among other groups, had now approved of the Bill as it stood.  I understood him to mean that sections 109, 110 and the whole of Part IX had received the approbation of the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <P>On the Second Stage.  I understand that that is not the position.  The situation in relation to sections 109 and 110 and the whole of Part IX is that we are trying to deal with a small problem which is very important and very acute for those whom it affects.  The way that the problem was first tackled was manifestly wrong and the Minister has gone away from it.  The experience of the solicitors in this country is an enormous body of experience and it does not really make a great deal of difference to their fortunes&mdash;I do not suppose it makes any difference to their personal fortunes&mdash;whether or not these particular sections go through.  One of the difficulties of lawyers dealing with a Bill of this kind <Col N="102" /> is that there is always the underlying suggestion that the amendments they are proposing are designed to put money into their pockets.</P>

Barristers have their faults and failings and are as fond of money and dissipate money as much as anybody else.

      <P>This is the usual kind of situation we are up against. It does not make any difference to me personally whether or not these sections go through in this or any amended form.  It will not affect the legal profession: I do not see how it will.  They have practical experience. They meet people day in, day out, the small shopkeepers, the distressed widows, the unfaithful husbands.  They go out to the country house at any hour of the day or night to draw up a will under all classes of conditions. <Col N="103" /> They make the marriage settlements, arrange the transfer of property, try to make the title.  They have an incomparable body of experience.  There is no other group in this country which can equal the experience they have. To a lesser degree, the barrister end of the profession has experience in these matters.  I would not claim for a moment to have anything like the experience in these matters that Senator Nash has because a solicitor, in his daily contact with these kinds of problems, can meet and resolve them and they go on quite successfully.  Having got rid of the idea that the Incorporated Law Society, barristers or people of that kind have a vested interested in what is happening in this legislation, I would then ask the House to pay some attention to the great volume of experience which the legal profession in this country bring to bear upon this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on the Second Stage, irrespective of what has been done in Scotland, England or the Continent we have to look at this problem from our own experience.  The truth of the matter is that most men in this country, having wives, when they come to make their wills make adequate and proper provision for their wives.  That is the experience of the solicitors of this country.  Indeed, one solicitor went to the trouble of looking up something like fifty wills he had where the testator had a wife and in 48 out of the 50 cases all the property of the testator was left to the wife and in respect of the other two it was not because of disinheriting, but because of other financial provisions that had been made, that the widow did not get the entire property but got a share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the kind of situation we are up against.  It is a small problem.  No doubt the Minister and certain people will say it is a sizeable problem.  I cannot say what is meant by a sizeable problem.  The Minister cannot say it occurs in 1 per cent, 1.5 per cent or 2 per cent of the cases.  We all know a problem exists but it is <Col N="105" /> quite wrong to try to foist upon the population, male and female, who have property to dispose of by will, a solution which is appropriate and designed to catch the spouse who wants to disinherit his partner.  No matter what way one looks at the provisions of section 110 they do not work out right.</P>
    <P>Two thirds, as we had in section 66, is no good in the case of a testator owning a small amount of property. One half is no good either.  In many cases the whole lot would not be sufficient.  If a man has an obligation in his lifetime to support his wife he has an equal obligation to make the best provision he can after his death. An objection to section 110 is that merely to leave half of a small estate to a widow is not good enough and does not meet her situation.  She should get the lot.  It is in that way that the first difficulty arises with regard to section 110.  A half of a small business, a half of a small farm or a half of a small insurance that a testator has left will be quite inadequate in a great majority of cases to enable the widow to live properly.  Of course, it ultimately means, from the point of view of public policy, that she more quickly goes on to public funds if she is not entitled to a contributory pension.  Therefore, section 110, in so far as it is intended to deal with small property owners' widows, does not measure up because it does not give her half enough.  That is the first objection one has to the section.</P>
    <P>It may be quite wrong, in the case of large property owners, to give one half. It may be a very damaging thing to a large family business.  You could have the husband as the principal owner and the other members of the family working in it and deriving a livelihood from it.  This would happen in quite a number of cases and if the widow could be given an annuity, say £1,000 a year, out of the business she would be well provided for.  If one wanted to make adequate provision it could be increased by, say, four per cent or by so many pounds per annum, having regard to the inevitable decline in the value of money.  If the widow got £1,000 a year it would be much more <Col N="106" /> desirable and easier to bear than if she were given one half of the family business which, if she insisted on taking it and moving out to reside with her favourite daughter, or something of that kind, would leave the business completely crippled.  In most cases the business would have to be sold.</P>
    <P>It does not meet that kind of situation or the situation where the man may leave less than a half share to his widow.  He may do so because he thinks she is what Senator E. Ryan described earlier this evening as a spendthrift.  There are some wives, but they are a small proportion in my view, who are spendthrifts, who have no idea of handling money or of the value of money.  It may merely mean, if you give such a person so much money into her own hands, that she will spend it all and will then have to be kept out of public funds.  Half, in that case, does not meet the situation The prudent husband, having affection for his wife and regard for her capacity and her faults and failings, would make such provision in the will as would be suitable to her particular circumstances.  The only person who can know those circumstances is the husband and wife of the person, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The provision of one half does not meet the small estate.  It does not meet the case of the big estate and, equally, it would not meet the case of the medium-sized estate, whatever value you would like to put on these estates. It is because of this absolute rigidity and because it is unnecessary in so many cases to make this kind of stipulation that the section is opposed.</P>
    <P>The Incorporated Law Society, in May of this year, issued a document and they have pointed out a variety of ways in which this particular part of the Bill does not meet the situation. They point out, among other things, that there are undeserving spouses who have absolute right to a share in the estate of their partner.  For instance, at the present time, I know of a case of a man and his wife who have not lived together for years.  They just did not hit it off.  One of the partners is extremely wealthy and the other is not. <Col N="107" /> It means that £30,000 or £40,000 is going to the partner who has not a care at this time and has not had for the past 20 years.</P>

      <P>That may be for better or for worse but it seems quite unreasonable to say in cases of that kind that the partner can come in and claim, as an absolute right, one half share of the estate of the partner who has been deserted for a number of years.  The Minister may say that the provision in section 110 of the Bill deals with the spouse who has been deserted.  We will be dealing with this later.  I am suggesting in section 110, by way of the insertion of a new subsection, that we should recognise the existing conditions in this country, that the vast majority of testators who are survived by their spouses, make adequate provision and declare in the first part of the amendment that it shall be the duty of a testator to make adequate provision in life for his spouse according to his means by will or otherwise.  Then if any surviving spouse feels that such provision has not been made that spouse would have a right to go to the court where she or he would establish a case and that the proceedings would be conducted in an expeditious and summary manner. There is no use in the Minister saying that this is an approach from a lawyer's point of view&mdash;that this creates more expense, more applications to the court and by implication could put more money into the pockets of lawyers.</P>

      <P>We have had that innuendo throughout the debate in one form or another.  There is the suggestion that the widow is being driven into court.  What we are dealing with here is a small number of widows, and that where such a widow has a justifiable grievance she will have the right to go to court.  It happens every day in administration proceedings and probate <Col N="108" /> actions that people look soberly at the situation as they see it.  They are advised by their legal advisers, and not infrequently in relation to actions to set aside improvident deeds or to have wills declared invalid because the testator was not of sound mind, memory and understanding, those who are entitled to benefit settle the cases out of court.  Might I say that that is always what the legal advisers of people engaged in this kind of litigation seek to achieve.  Very often it is quite impossible to get some unreasonable people to accept a compromise, but I have no doubt that, once it is laid down in a statute that a testator shall make adequate provision in life for his spouse, everybody will know what adequate provision in life means and the number of applications to the court would be minimal, because people have enough wit to see that if a widow is left nothing maybe one third or one half of the estate would be what she should get, or in cases maybe the lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once you provide, as is provided in this amendment, that the costs of the action shall be at the discretion of the court you introduce a sobering element which induces great judgment in people when they are dealing with court actions and they will have to pay for the costs if they fail.  If a man left all his property to a son or a brother, disinherited his wife, and the donee under the will was not prepared to see reason, that person would quickly realise that in the first place the widow was going to succeed and get something in court, and, secondly, he would have to pay his own costs and the widow's costs.  In that way you would ensure that many applications will never reach a hearing in court.  Having done that, you have then provided all the possible safeguards that a widow can require under the law.  Let it be remembered, too, that every solicitor advising a husband making a will will tell him: &ldquo;You must provide under the law adequate provision for your widow, and if you do not she will be entitled to go into court once this statute is enacted.&rdquo;  It seems to me that when you are dealing with people of commonsense who have ordinary regard for their duties as <Col N="109" /> husbands the number of cases where widows would be disinherited would be very few.  The great advantage of this kind of scheme would be that while providing the necessary protection for widows who might otherwise be disinherited you leave a man entirely free to dispose of his property as he thinks best.</P>
    <P>It may be that instead of giving the widow half of an estate an annuity for life would be given to her out of it. The advantage as far as the Minister is concerned would be that here we do not raise this horrible ugly ogre that the Minister is terrified of, the life estate.  We would not have anything of that in this situation.  All the property might go to a son with a provision to pay an annuity of say £500 or £750 or whatever the property would bear to the widow, and he would be able to develop the property as he thought best with the annuity charged upon it. The widow under this provision would get all the benefits she requires.  The number of court applications would be absolutely minimal, and at the same time the rest of the population who at the present time make adequate provision for their widows would not be hamstrung by this rigid provision that she must in all events get half of the estate.  When you have regard to the fact that there is not a single group of people in this country to my knowledge that has come out in favour of the earlier provision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>I am glad that the further discussion of this Bill can proceed upon the basis that those who like myself derive their livelihood&mdash;a very small part of it&mdash;from the administration of estates and from this kind of thing will be taken at their face value <i>de bene esse</i> and that when these underlying currents are got rid of all the proposals will be debated upon that basis.</P>

      <P>The courts are there to interpret the law and not to wander around vaguely and try to interpret what is meant by &ldquo;adequate provision&rdquo; in this instance.  The law has to be administered by various judges and there is difficulty if they have not clear terms to guide them. In this case those particular people would be left in grave doubt as to how <Col N="111" /> an individual&mdash;and a judge is an individual the same as anybody else&mdash;can interpret such a vague section as this, were it incorporated into the Bill, to mean what is adequate provision.  We must have some finality and some clarity and this type of section, were it incorporated, would only confuse the issues the Minister is trying to resolve at this stage.</P>

      <P>I think Senator O'Quigley is blowing hot and cold when he says the provision as to costs would discourage applicants from using a section such as this.  The courts might look on both sides and say that the applicant also might not readily be able to bear the burden of the costs.  They might not ask him to bear that burden.  They might ask him to share the costs or they might make no order as to costs. They might decide to levy the costs out of the estate if there was a reasonable case.  This cost restriction is one that would not readily apply.  I feel that from the point of view of reason and clarity this particular amendment has little or nothing to recommend it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am exaggerating his despair.  The Minister interjected something about sacred marriage contracts.  If this section stands the wording will be: &ldquo;with half my worldly goods I thee endow.&rdquo; There is a case against the amendment but the case against the amendment is not a case for the section as it stands.  It is a case for changing the section to make it do what we want it to do.</P>
      <P>I was very impressed with the case made against the section on Second Reading by Senator Nash.  That case was developed here this evening very effectively by Senator O'Quigley and it has not, in fact, been answered. When we come to legislate in a matter of this kind, I do not think we should simply decide to take an arbitrary figure and say it will meet all the cases. It was clearly pointed out that there are many cases this will not meet and that injustices of one kind or another will be involved.  The best remedy for that is not necessarily an amendment of the kind now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not been able to decide the method of laying down precisely what should be done to meet a variety of conditions.  The first task of a Legislature should be to try to lay down in a precise way what needs to be done to meet certain conditions.  There is one way in which the Minister could effectively reject this amendment.  He could put to the House a constructive suggestion to meet the objections to the section.  He has said the amendment is too vague.  Some attempt should be made to offer other amendments to deal with this particular point and then the amendment could be withdrawn in good conscience. Perhaps this amendment could be developed.  For instance, I do not think a figure of £5,000 is sufficient for this purpose and I think the wording of the amendment in some respects is <Col N="113" /> too vague but I think other amendments could be made to meet the case of small estates.</P>
    <P>There is also the case where a woman has left her husband but is not technically guilty of desertion.  There are some cases in which people have to be protected against themselves.  A woman may be a spendthrift or for other reasons&mdash;perhaps an illness of some kind&mdash;she may be incapable of handling money or it may be thought unwise to leave money to her.  I have used the word &ldquo;she&rdquo; deliberately because that is the term which has been used throughout the discussion by the Minister and others.  This section also covers widowers and, of course, there can be spendthrift husbands.  I do not really think it is necessary to make provision for widowers who should be capable, in general, of looking after themselves. I think we should insert the word &ldquo;female&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;.  This section as it stands, if it stands, deals with widowers as well as widows, so we need not be rejected on the grounds of being anti-feminist. I see no reason why a woman should have to leave half her money to a drunken husband, for example, to spend it on drink&mdash;and I would be prepared to admit that in the case of drunkenness, it is more likely to be the widower than the widow, who is a drunkard.</P>
    <P>This section needs amendment and possibly the answer might be to make provision&mdash;I am putting this forward for what it is worth&mdash;that the man <Col N="114" /> could go to the court in his lifetime and make a private application in chambers if his wife is, for example, an alcoholic.  It could also be the husband who is the alcoholic.  However, if the wife is an alcoholic the husband could leave her an annuity of some kind.  Perhaps he could be required to make the annuity two thirds of the full amount.  The court could examine into whether the money should not be left absolutely to her so that it would not be wasted.  Some such amendment might meet the case.  Surely it is not beyond the wit of the Seanad to devise an amendment to meet the case so cogently put before us by Senator Nash and Senator O'Quigley.  In default of anything else the amendment now before the House must be accepted.  If the Minister is prepared to say he will look at the question of amending the section in concrete ways to meet these cases and that he intends to do so, I certainly will support him and will support the withdrawal of the amendment.  I still have the hope in him, although Senator O'Quigley has not, that in the cause of clarity he will be prepared to agree to amendments of this kind to make it possible, in good conscience, to withdraw the amendment before the House.</P>
