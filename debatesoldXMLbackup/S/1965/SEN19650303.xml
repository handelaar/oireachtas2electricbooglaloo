    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave formal notice last week that I objected to the enactment of this Bill.  Before I set out the various objections I have to the provisions of the Bill, I think I should say very briefly what, in fact, is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill relates to a small graveyard called the Huguenot Cemetery at Peter Street, which adjoins Jacobs factory.  In this graveyard some 250 to 300 Huguenots are buried.  The Huguenots were French Protestants who left France after 1685.  Many of them came to Ireland and settled in <Col N="1060" /> Dublin.  In 1711 they bought this graveyard to serve as a cemetery for themselves and their descendants.  Interments continued, and the last one took place in 1879.  Since then no further burials have taken place although the graveyard has never been officially closed.</P>
    <P>The six trustees who administer the graveyard have now agreed to sell it to Jacobs for an extension of their factory.  Jacobs propose to use it for the purposes of their factory and the money will go to the Huguenot Fund, with which I shall deal later.  Under the provisions of the Bill, Jacobs are to remove the 250 to 300 bodies from the graveyard and re-inter them in a plot to be bought by them in Mount Jerome or in such other cemetery as the trustees may appoint.</P>
    <P>That, in brief, is what is intended to be done under this Bill.  There are certain other details with which I shall deal when we come to them later on. It seems to me that on a number of counts the procedure in the Bill is extremely objectionable.  I imagine Senators will readily be able to foresee at least some of the objections which can be made against the provisions of the Bill.  It, I think, offends a sort of innate belief that we all share in the sanctity of graves.  We have always assumed, as a matter of course, when really thinking about it, that the bones of our ancestors should be allowed to lie in peace.  It is one of these things that, without really thinking much about it, we have always assumed would happen.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to a person today.  I asked him if he had any views on graveyards and he said he had not so long as they are respected and left in peace.  I think that is really the attitude we all take.  We assume, as a matter of course, that the graveyard will be respected, that the bones interred in it will not be disturbed and, in particular, that no question could arise of commercial interests being able to take over a graveyard in order to advance their particular activities.</P>
    <P>I think also we assume as a matter of course that when we all, in time, come to die our bones will be left in peace.  This is not simply an attitude <Col N="1061" /> of mind peculiar to the Christian religion though, of course, Christians have always believed very strongly in the sanctity of graves in consecrated ground.  The desecration of a graveyard has always been regarded as a very serious sin.  I think all races and all religions have always had a particular reverence for the graves of their forefathers.  Therefore, any proposal for uprooting a graveyard such as is mentioned here should be accepted only in cases of the greatest and most urgent public necessity.  I hope to show, in due course, that no such urgent or great necessity exists in the case of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is obvious also that the Huguenots who originally bought this site for the graveyard for themselves and their descendants &mdash; and provided the money for its maintenance and provided a scheme of trustees so that after they were gone this graveyard would still be preserved as a haven of peace for themselves and their descendants &mdash; never for a moment thought a proposal such as this would ever be considered.  They would have been appalled at the suggestion that their bones should be uprooted as is suggested in the Bill in order that commercial interests should be erected on the site.  These are general considerations which would apply, I suppose, to any graveyard but I think we should consider also the particular circumstances of this old graveyard.</P>
    <P>The first thing I should mention is that since 1924 the graves themselves have been unmarked.  In 1924, the trustees of the day &mdash; to my mind, quite rightly &mdash; made an arrangement with Jacobs whereby they were appointed on a caretaker basis to look after the graveyard and use it as a recreation ground for their employees.  Such stones as existed were removed from the graves and put along the walls. Flowers were planted and, since then, it has been rather a pleasant flower garden used by the workers in Jacobs factory.  The result is that the graves are unmarked.  Apart from that, this is an old graveyard and there can be no question of coffins: any coffins will have long since disintegrated.</P>
    <P>In relation to graves where a number <Col N="1062" /> of people were buried, with the settlement of soil, and so on, the bones will long since have become mingled. This is a small site&mdash;64' ×110'.  In that very small area, from 250 to 300 people are buried.  Therefore, as between adjacent graves, even if they knew where the graves were it would be impossible to distinguish between one set of bones and another.</P>
    <P>Lest there should be any misunderstanding, let me say that I accept completely the undertaking given in the Schedule to the Bill by Jacobs that they will remove with all due reverence the bodies that lie in the graveyard. I am quite certain they mean what they say and that they will do their best to carry out that removal.  However, I am afraid the circumstances are such that it will be impossible for them to carry out the removal in any seemly way.  The only way in which it can be done is by sifting through the soil of the entire area of this graveyard, down to a depth perhaps of 10 feet, carefully collecting all the bones together, ensuring so far as is possible that no fragment of bone is left unfound, and putting them into what amounts to a communal grave in this plot in Mount Jerome Cemetery. That is an extremely objectionable and unseemly procedure and should be tolerated only in the case of most urgent necessity, which does not arise under the Bill.</P>
    <P>It may be said that section 3 (3), (4) and (5) provide a certain safeguard. These provide that a relative of any deceased person may apply to have the remains of that person removed separately.  In subsection (5), Jacobs say they will provide up to £50 in case of any one removal.  So far as this is a safeguard at all, it relates only to a very small minority of those who are buried in this graveyard.  The great majority of them have no living relatives. In respect of a period of 40 years, from 1731 to 1771, there are no records at all of who is buried in this graveyard.  It is quite clear that there are no relatives of the great majority of the remains in the graveyard.  In so far as there are relatives who could apply for permission to have separate removal of the remains, it would be <Col N="1063" /> obviously quite impossible to carry out this, to find a particular grave, to find a particular remains, to segregate them from the others.  There would be difficulties.</P>
    <P>Apart from these considerations, which, to my mind, would be sufficient to make it extremely undesirable that we should pass this Bill, there are far more important and fundamental objections on the grounds of general public policy.  This is not just a question of a small graveyard owned by a small religious group.  It is a question of setting up a serious precedent which could affect all such graveyards. Before I go any further, I should make one thing clear, in fairness to the trustees.  I accept without any question that the trustees have acted in good faith.  I shall criticise them.  I think they have been completely wrong, that they have completely misunderstood the duty that lay upon them to look after and preserve this graveyard; but I accept that even when most wrong, they honestly and sincerely believed themselves to be right.  In fairness to them, I should like to make that clear.</P>
    <P>This is not the first occasion on which negotiations have taken place for the acquisition of this graveyard. Jacobs themselves, for more than 50 years, have made known their anxiety to acquire the site and have made several offers to the trustees, all rejected. In 1948, the ESB for some reason of their own sought compulsorily to acquire portion of the graveyard.  They served a compulsory acquisition order on the trustees to acquire this section of the graveyard.  The trustees appealed to the High Court for protection against this attempt by the ESB to acquire portion of the graveyard. In this appeal they submitted an affidavit and in the course of the affidavit, signed by the four trustees, it is stated:</P>
    <P>Each of the said Trustees is a member of the Church of Ireland and a person of Huguenot descent and as such is in his or her personal capacity strongly opposed to the proposed acquisition of the lands by <Col N="1064" /> the Board as constituting a desecration of a Christian Burial Ground and an improper and unjustifiable appropriation of the property, of the purposes of the lands in question, would be strongly resented and regretted by the majority of Huguenot descent in Ireland, many of whose forebears are buried in the said graveyard.</P>
    <P>That was the attitude of the trustees in 1948.  Fourteen years later, in 1962, they accepted this offer by Jacobs. Why did they accept this offer now when they set out so clearly in 1948 their reasons for not allowing the ESB to acquire part of the graveyard?  One would have thought they would have opposed far more severely the 1962 proposal than the one in 1948 which proposed to acquire only part of the site and which did not propose the removal of any of the bodies.</P>
    <P>In 1962 the offer was to acquire the whole site and to have the bodies removed. The four trustees who signed the affidavit in 1948 are all trustees today. Two further trustees were added in 1959 but four of the trustees who have accepted this offer by Jacobs believed in 1948 that the acquisition of the lands by the ESB at that time would constitute a desecration of a Christian burial ground.</P>
    <P>The principles at stake seem to be exactly the same.  Only 14 years have elapsed but the wonder is that the offer made in 1948 was for £200 and the offer by Jacobs is £20,000.  That is a big difference and I am afraid that was the reason why the trustees were prevailed on to abandon the principle they clearly enunciated in their affidavit to the High Court.  When they said in 1948 that the majority of Huguenots would resent the acquisition, they were perfectly correct because it has been strongly resented and opposed by such Huguenots as are left.</P>
    <P>What I find difficult to understand is why the trustees did not ask for the views of the Huguenots before accepting this offer by Jacobs.  If they had, there would have been an end to the matter, a lot of trouble would have been avoided and we would not have <Col N="1065" /> this Bill facing us today.  In fact they accepted the offer and went to the High Court to seek relief to accept the offer. They advertised in the newspapers for the views of the Huguenots.  A number of letters came in from Huguenots whose ancestors were buried in the graveyard.  I should like to read extracts from these letters.  Some of them are too long to read in full but the extracts I shall read are in general conformity with the respective letters and are not taken out of context.</P>
    <P>The first letter states:</P>
    <P>This is to say that I do not consider that the Trustees of the Cemetery in Peter Street are at liberty to accept the offer made by Messrs. W.R. Jacob and Co. to purchase the cemetery.</P>
    <P>Letter No. 2 states:</P>
    <P>...I beg to enter a protest against the proposed desecration of the Huguenot Cemetery...</P>
    <P>Letter No. 3 states:</P>
    <P>I cannot consider the Trustees of the cemetery in Peter Street at liberty to sell it to Jacobs... On my own behalf and on that of my son... and my grandson...  I wish to object most emphatically to the proposed sale, and to the disturbance of the remains of our family that it would entail.</P>
    <P>Letter No. 4 reads:</P>
    <P>Four members of our family are recorded as being interred in the Cemetery and we feel that they, with the other persons buried there, should be allowed to lie in peace. We are entirely opposed to Messrs. Jacobs' proposal and feel that the Trustees should not be authorised to accept the offer.</P>
    <P>Letter No. 5 reads:</P>
    <P>We do not consider the Trustees at liberty to accept the offer.  The Trustees are presumably acting for the descendants of those who are buried in Peter Street.</P>
    <P>In spite of Messrs. Jacobs' assurance as to the removal and re-burial <Col N="1066" /> of the human remains and in spite of the sum they have offered to the French Huguenot Fund, we as descendants of the Merciers who came to Ireland as Huguenot refugees, are entirely opposed to the proposal.</P>
    <P>Letter No. 6 is in much the same terms as No. 5.</P>
    <P>Letter No. 7 reads:</P>
    <P>If the Trustees feel their duty is to act in accordance with the wishes of the descendants of those buried in this cemetery they will reject Messrs. Jacobs' offer.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the remains of my forebears be removed for the furtherance of commercial interest is quite abhorrent.  I am entirely opposed to the acceptance of Messrs. Jacobs' offer.</P>
    <P>Letter No. 8 reads:</P>
    <P>In response to the Legal Notice in the public press we wish to object very strongly to the proposal made by Messrs. Jacob, and consider that it would be a breach of trust on the part of the Trustees to sell the burial ground.</P>
    <P>Peters was as it were the cradle of our family; we consider that it is the Trustees' responsibility to protect it on behalf of all those whose forebears are buried there.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Senator a question?  Would he give us the number of letters in favour of the removal as well as against?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There was none.  The only letter in favour was one from someone who had no relatives buried there.  His point was they should be removed but they should be buried in a Huguenot cemetery.  It would be more seemly that they should be buried in a Huguenot cemetery such as St. Peter's but no letters came in favour of this proposal.  I can assure the House the letters I have read out are the letters immediately concerned and the extracts are in conformity with the general tenor of the letters.</P>
      <P>Letter No, 8 continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> It was not through materialism that these Huguenots found themselves refugees from France, and materialistic motives seem insufficient to justify desecrating their last resting place now.</P>
    <P>The Legal Notice in the press does not mention the very real financial gain that would accrue to the French Huguenot Fund, and perhaps it is unnecessary for us to refer to it; but less questionable ways of raising funds for charity can certainly be found.  An appeal for funds to relieve genuine distress among Huguenot descendants could well be addressed to all those whose forebears settled in Ireland as religious refugees. We fully appreciate the scrupulous procedure proposed by Messrs Jacob for transferring the human remains to a new place of burial, but their proposal entails an act of desecration for commercial reasons, and we consider that the Trustees would be quite wrong to agree to it.</P>
    <P>So far as I know these letters, signed by a total of 20 people, represent all those who can be traced to have ancestors buried in this graveyard.  I should explain, perhaps, that the trustees themselves have no interest in the graveyard, or the other one in Merrion Row.  The trustees have no ancestors buried in St. Peter's graveyard. These letters represent the sum total of the opinions of the Huguenots' ancestors immediately concerned with the graveyard.</P>
    <P>Two main justifications have been advanced in favour of the Bill.  Firstly, it would be a great convenience to Jacobs and, secondly, the £20,000 to be provided by Jacobs would be of great assistance to the Huguenot fund. In regard to Jacobs, I should make it clear that, to my mind at any rate, even the most vital necessity to an undertaking would not, of itself, justify a procedure of this kind.  I cannot see that a commercial concern, finding it vital for expansion to take over an adjoining graveyard, would justify the desecration of the graveyard, as proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" /> I think the facts show that it is not by any means vital for Jacobs that they should take over the graveyard. Jacobs have themselves said that no decrease in employment would result. We should get some facts clear about this.  The size of the graveyard is 64 feet by 110 feet &mdash; a very small graveyard occupying, combined with the factory, the entire area between Bishop Street, Bride Street and Peter Street. The factory occupies an area of approximately 4 acres.  Of this entire site about 4 per cent is occupied by the graveyard and the remaining 96 per cent is occupied by the factory.  In so far as the expansion of the factory is concerned, the limit has been reached whether they get the graveyard or not.  If they do not acquire the graveyard, it will make little difference as far as future expansion is concerned.  In the proceedings in the High Court last year Jacobs stated the reasons they wanted to take over the graveyard:</P>
    <P>To obtain economy in operation, ovens have got longer and longer and the most modern type of oven which we would wish to instal is so long that it would not fit where the present ovens are situate without projecting into or over the space occupied by the Huguenot Cemetery and no other as suitable space is available.  If the graveyard can be acquired some of the existing ovens could be lengthened.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the words &ldquo;no other as suitable space is available&rdquo; are the important words.  It would obviously be convenient for Jacobs to acquire this site and instal the ovens without changing the position of the bakehouse at all.  They have said in the affidavit that if they do not get the graveyard they can still instal the ovens but will have to shift them.  They also stated in the next paragraph of the affidavit:</P>
    <P>A major reconstruction of the factory is in hands and the Company's plans would be advantageously revised and modified if the Cemetery could be incorporated.</P>
    <P>Reconstruction of the factory is going <Col N="1069" /> ahead in any event.  If they can acquire the cemetery the company's alterations will be modified.  I do not think there is any suggestion there that the incorporation of the cemetery is all important to Jacobs.  It is a small cemetery, surrounded on three sides by Jacobs, and it would be convenient for them to acquire it.  It is worth spending £20,000 on it but that is the limit.</P>
    <P>The second argument in favour of the Bill is that £20,000 would be very useful to the Huguenot Fund.  I cannot concede, and I do not think Senators could agree, that the mere fact that the money is being used for charity could necessarily justify the acquisition of a graveyard.  In fact, the position would appear to be that the needs of the fund are not so very urgent and vital as might, at first sight, be thought. The present fund is rather far from the original intentions of the Huguenots who, in the early 18th century, provided this money which still forms part of a Charity.  In the early 18th century this money was provided by the Huguenots who bought this site and erected a church on it.  It was, in fact, for the support of the poor of the said churches in Lucy Lane and Peter Street that the fund was operated.  As time went on the Huguenots became assimilated with the population at large.  The church was demolished in 1840, the last trustees died in the 18th century and the money remained in court for twenty years.  Finally, at the end of the century the court framed a new scheme for the administration of the fund.  There was nobody to support it and the court revised the scheme under which the persons who should be nominated as objects of the Charity should be poor and deserving persons who should produce satisfactory proof that they were Protestants of Huguenot descent.</P>
    <P>Weekly allowances are provided and grants or loans for funeral expenses and matters of that kind are given.  I can see the work which has been done under this fund by the trustees.  I can see also that £20,000 would enable still more work to be done.  I suppose it would, having regard to the amount of money involved, be <Col N="1070" /> possible to send descendants of those Huguenots to universities and so on.</P>
    <P>The facts suggest there is no degree of urgency which would justify the proposals in the Bill.  The income from the present fund is rather small. It is only £130 per year.  The trustees at present are spending only £80 12s. 0d. per year.  If the matter was so urgent and there were so many people relying on this fund, I should have thought the £130 would be spent.  In fact, at the moment, they are spending only £80 out of £130.  One answer is that the annuities have not increased.  They are only something like 7/- per week since 1902.  That is a small amount of money.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, no appeal has ever been made by the trustees of the fund. The Huguenots are people of standing. Many of them are very well off and if they had been asked many of them would be only too willing to consider contributing to a fund of this kind. The trustees have never appealed for funds and have never asked the Huguenots for funds.  Therefore, I suggest there is no degree of urgency to justify the proposals in the Bill.  At the same time, it has been suggested that the trustees made a point that it was not part of their duty to make such an appeal.  If it was not, it certainly was not part of their duty to make money in this way by selling an entire graveyard.</P>
    <P>There are other things which are far more important than the objections I have mentioned with regard to the Bill.  If we pass the measure we shall be setting an extremely dangerous precedent.  If we pass the Bill, how can we in conscience refuse others? The law provides that no graveyard may, in any circumstances, be built on except in the case of a church.  That is the law as it stands. If we pass this Bill it will set a headline to anyone else who is concerned with a graveyard of this kind.  There is another Huguenot graveyard at Merrion Row.  It is an extremely valuable site and it is unused at present. If we pass this Bill the trustees of any other Huguenot graveyard could accept even a greater sum than <Col N="1071" /> £20,000 for the building of some supermarket.  They would feel they were right in accepting an offer of that kind and we would be bound to bring in a Bill to enable them to accept the offer.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Huguenot graveyard, there are a number of small disused graveyards in Dublin and throughout the country.  The passing of this Bill would be setting a headline and commercial development undertakings everywhere would be looking out for disused graveyards.  They would be considered valuable as building sites. The people buying those graveyards could say to the trustees concerned that they would pay the money to any charity named by them.  If we pass this Bill we would be bound to pass any other Bill brought in by the trustees of any other graveyard.</P>
    <P>Some of the bigger general graveyards in the country have unused parts. Parts of Deans Grange, Mount Jerome and Glasnevin graveyards are no longer in use as graveyards.  If it were suggested that the management of any of these graveyards should sell the unused parts, I am perfectly certain there would be an appalling outcry.  The point is, by passing a Bill of this kind we are opening the way for the management of any general graveyard in future years to come to us and seek to have a portion of it sold for development purposes.  Somebody would see what could be done with them.  The decent thing to do is to do what is already being done with others, that is, to have open parks there and flowers planted.  That has been done in the case of one graveyard in London about a quarter of a mile from Marble Arch. It is obviously of great commercial value.  It is an open space and nobody has suggested so far that it should be built on.  That is the proper way to deal with graveyards of this kind.</P>
    <P>I object to the Bill and I hope the Seanad will do likewise because I consider as completely inadequate the reasons advanced as to why an old and historic graveyard, which is part of the history of this city and country, should be destroyed.  I object to it <Col N="1072" /> because the bones of these Huguenots, who sought shelter in Dublin and bought the graveyard, should not have to be removed and placed in a communal grave.  I also object to the Bill because it is strongly opposed by the descendants of these Huguenots who are still alive.  I believe, with the trustees themselves in 1948, that the proposed acquisition of the land would be a desecration of a Christian burial ground and an improper, unjustifiable appropriation of the property of the Charity.</P>
    <P>We must make up our minds on this. This is not simply a matter of one small graveyard.  If we pass the Bill we will be changing the law in this respect and we will be giving notice to all concerned with graveyards everywhere that we are prepared to change the law if commercial interests want to develop there.  We would disturb the present sense of security with regard to grave-yards&mdash;that once a graveyard is there it is not going to be disturbed in this way for commercial development.  We should be very slow to pass the proposals in the Bill.</P>

      <P>May I say a word not on the merits of the Bill but on the question of whether we should take the attitude adopted by Senator Yeats on any Private Bill?  Senator Yeats has a perfect right to make a case on the Second Reading of the Bill.  There is a judicial investigation made into a Bill of this sort before a Joint Committee of the two Houses.  Senator Yeats wants us to provide that that will not happen.</P>
      <P>I do not want to discuss the merits of the Bill.  This is not a Private Member's Bill.  It is not recommended by a particular party or a particular group of members or even by one Senator. It is not even recommended by the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  He moves the motion because of his official capacity and is precluded from casting a vote, I think, on the proceedings later on. There were numerous Private Bills at one time but they are very few now. There are various reasons for that which I need not go into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trustees of this graveyard have asked leave to bring in this Bill. Advertisements have to be issued. <Col N="1073" /> Officials of the Oireachtas have to be satisfied with regard to certain views, interested parties have to be notified and, when the Bill goes to a Joint Committee of the two Houses, the case for and against it may be presented. When the Joint Committee have made their recommendations to the two Houses any member of either House who desires can then take the line Senator Yeats has taken here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are being asked to prevent the Bill being discussed by a Joint Committee in the particular fashion which Joint Committees have always followed &mdash; that is to say, not by way of argument, but by way of investigation and weighing up the evidence.</P>
      <P>I think that while the Senator was within his rights in doing what he has done, it would be very inadvisable for this House to take the line on this Bill that they do not want the proposal to be investigated.  I have the greatest possible regard for any old cemeteries or old monuments in Dublin.  There must be very few people in this House as well acquainted with that particular area as I am.  There may be one, but I do not think there are more.  I have the greatest possible reverence for the dead and for graveyards, but there are circumstances which may arise in which a certain procedure may be desirable.  That is what is being asked here.  It is being asked that there should be an investigation.  It has nothing whatever to do with the fact that this is the graveyard of a small religious minority now, I think, almost extinct. It seems to me that we would be very ill-advised to discuss the merits of the Bill here before it has been investigated in a Joint Committee, and that what Senator Yeats asks us to do should not be done.  We should allow the Bill to go to a Joint Committee and take whatever action we think fit subsequently.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement with Senator Hayes on the point that a full <Col N="1074" /> discussion of the Bill should not take place at this stage, but as Senator Yeats has put an extremely full and moving case as to why we should not give the Bill a Second Reading, I think it is only fair at this stage to put some of the other points which occur to some of us, because at the end of the debate we will decide whether or not to give the Bill a Second Reading and let it go to a Joint Committee of the two Houses.</P>
      <P>This is an extremely difficult matter. Senator Yeats has argued most cogently, and with great feeling, that we should not give the Bill a Second Reading.  He bases his argument on three main grounds which I should like to consider because I think there is another side to the question.  Certainly there are sufficient reasons for us to give the Bill a Second Reading and refer it to a Joint Committee.</P>
      <P>In his summing up Senator Yeats objected most strongly to the bones of these Huguenots being placed in a communal grave.  We must try to get this whole picture into perspective.  As Senator Yeats told us, in 1924 this graveyard was let to Jacobs on, I think, a caretaker's agreement.  At that time the graveyard was a wilderness. I have seen photographs which were taken of the graveyard at that time: the grass was growing high everywhere and there was a small mortuary chapel with a broken roof and very nearly in ruins.  It was practically impossible to see any of the gravestones: branches of trees and rubbish of one kind and another were lying around.  Obviously no one had tended the graveyard for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the gist of Senator Yeats' argument was that as a result of what Jacobs did to the graveyard in 1924 the graves were no longer marked and could not be traced.  In fact, the position was that at that time Jacobs made a survey of the graveyard and marked on it all the headstones they could find.  They marked on a plan all the headstones or other stones that could be identified.  They took the greatest care with this.  When they took up the headstones and moved them to the walls at the side of the graveyard they made the garden of which the Senator <Col N="1075" /> spoke.  Each stone that could be identified was marked on the plan which they made at the time.  So it was not as a result of anything Jacobs did that the graves were unmarked.  It would be quite unfair &mdash; and I am sure Senator Yeats did not mean to give this impression &mdash; if any impression were given that a large industrial undertaking had merely made the graveyard into a sort of recreation garden without giving every consideration to the identification of the graves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I approved completely of that arrangement.  I said I thought the trustees were right to make that arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood Senator Yeats to say that the graves were unmarked as a result of what Jacobs did. The point I want to make is that it was not as a result of what Jacobs did, but as a result of years of lack of attention, that they were in this state. As a result of what Jacobs did under their caretaker agreement there are some headstones around the walls of the area.  Of course, the bones are still there and where the graves could then be identified they are still identifiable, but today those bones are in almost what amounts to a communal grave since so few of them can be identified.  I feel it is over-emphasising and over-stating the case to talk of taking up those bones and putting them in a communal grave as if they were all easily identifiable, because a communal grave is really what they are in at the present time, except for a very few which can be identified.</P>
      <P>Senator Yeats' second point was that the carrying out of this scheme was strongly opposed by the descendants of the Huguenots.  He read to us a number of letters of protest and told us that they had been signed by some 20 people.  I accept that, but, again, I feel we must get this into perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, while the graveyard was undoubtedly in a completely unkept state in 1924 and was put into the condition in which it now is by <Col N="1076" /> Jacobs, no inquiries from any person representing any Huguenot about any grave were made either to the trustees or I think to Jacobs over at least the past 20 years until the High Court action.  In other words, these people who are now protesting never thought to do anything about any grave in that cemetery for 20 years prior to this time and this must mean that no one has cared sufficiently about the graves to try to find an ancestor, or to try to tend a grave or to re-letter a stone or even to place flowers on a grave.  The interest which is now so strong does not appear to have been very strong in the past when one might perhaps expect that a real interest, if it had been real, would have been there.</P>
    <P>There is another point which was touched on by Senator Yeats and to which I should like to refer.  It concerns the amount of money available to the trustees to look after this graveyard and to look after Huguenot annuitants.  It is virtually negligible. They had a fund of £8,000 or £9,000 at one time but, about the turn of the century, this was most unhappily depleted by their stockbroker becoming a bankrupt and a great deal of the money in the fund was lost.  The present annual income of the fund is about £110 to £130 and after payment of the annuities there is no money for the upkeep of this graveyard in the fund.</P>
    <P>As Senator Yeats told us, the amount that goes to the annuitants is so fractional as to be insignificant&mdash; 5/- to 7/- per week, enough to buy a pound of tea, I suppose, but, in today's values, negligible.  If this Bill goes through and if the trustees are then enabled to accept the offer of Jacobs, they will have a sum of £20,000 and, with that sum, they will be able to look after living people. They will be able to pay substantial annuities, certainly substantial in comparison to 5/- or 7/- per week, to people who are in need and who are the descendants of Huguenots.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind, therefore, the scheme proposed in the Bill cares for the necessitous and poor who are living, as well as for the dead.  Of the <Col N="1077" /> dead, let us not forget that for 85 years there has been no burial in this cemetery.  I very much doubt whether there is anybody alive today who can remember any person buried in that cemetery with any clarity or any personal feeling.</P>
    <P>Finally, Senator Yeats makes the point that the Bill is contrary to public policy.  This in many ways is the most difficult problem.  Obviously, any Private Bill of this kind must be considered on its merits and the merits in this particular case are strong.  I do not, for one moment, want to suggest that disused burial grounds are to be available for industrial, commercial or other developments without the very greatest consideration but the greatest consideration, I think, has been given in this particular case.</P>
    <P>We cannot suppose that the trustees have not considered this over the years with the greatest care and the greatest concern and with much thought for the greatest good for all the people and interests concerned.  Furthermore, we cannot accept that a judgment of the High Court has not been given with the greatest care.  We too must similarly consider the merits of this Bill with the greatest care because I believe this is an exceptional case.</P>
    <P>Let us put even the matter of public policy into perspective.  In many other countries I believe the position is that a graveyard which has not been used for 30 years can, without very great legal difficulty, be converted to other uses.  These are continental countries in which there is probably greater land hunger than there is here, but we must face that there is, perhaps, a case of industrial land hunger in this case.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats gave us figures of the percentage of Jacobs present premises and of the graveyard in relation to the whole area.  He said that Jacobs hold about 96 per cent of the whole area, including the graveyard, and that the graveyard represents only four per cent. I do not think that these figures in relation to an industrial site really have any meaning at all and we should not be led astray by them.  If, as happens in this particular case, a small area of ground, even though only four per cent <Col N="1078" /> of the whole, makes a solid wedge into a long line of production, the effect on that line of production will be very much greater than a four per cent disruption.</P>
    <P>We should not be misled by the size of this small plot.  Certainly, in considering the effect which its acquisition would have on their production, Jacobs have obviously gone into the matter in great detail.  They wish to extend their oven lines into long, economic lines which would run across this area rather than have broken production lines or lines in some other place which would certainly be very much more disruptive and very much more difficult to operate.</P>
    <P>This plot is worth £20,000 to Jacobs and if we look at the Bill, we see that the entire sum will go to the trustees to look after the living.  Jacobs have undertaken a great number of things as well as the payment of £20,000. They have undertaken the whole legal expenses, the cost of taking up the remains and reinterring them, the purchase of the plot in Mount Jerome cemetery and, in the case of any individual relative who is able to identify the bones of any ancestor, they have undertaken to give a grant of £50 towards the cost of reinternment.</P>
    <P>The £20,000 will go to the trustees for the benefit of the living.  I am told that a well-known Dublin valuer placed an open market value on that plot of less than a quarter of that sum. £5,000 would probably be fair value for such a plot, comprising approximately 7,000 square feet, but the trustees would have £20,000 to look after the living.  At the same time, in their agreement with Jacobs, they have taken the greatest possible care any such group of people could take to show proper respect for the dead.  For those reasons I feel we must accord this Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inspired to intervene in this debate by the statement made by Senator Hayes.  I feel Senator Yeats was quite right, when he had scruples about this Bill, to make the statement he did and to inform the Seanad what the position was, as he <Col N="1079" /> saw it.  It is well Senators should know, before the Bill goes to a Committee and before there is any further examination of it, what it is all about because too many private Bills are given very little attention by anybody except those directly interested and it is a good thing the Seanad should show itself aware of certain things which trouble many people.</P>
      <P>I find it very hard to make up my mind on this Bill.  I am quite prepared, however, to agree with Senator Hayes that it should go to a Committee in the normal way for close examination and a report in due course.  Apart from the references to the possible desecration of holy grounds, Senator Yeats omitted to mention one thing which troubles me.  I regard these Huguenot cemeteries as links with the historic past, as important national landmarks about which, unfortunately, due to the lack of proper teaching of history in all schools from primary to university level, our people know very little. When one of these cemeteries is closed down or is about to be closed down as in this case, we should remember it is a link with the past which should be recalled by our people because only these landmarks can make them remember the days when this country was a haven for those who fled from religious persecution in other lands to find shelter here.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the march of time, the industrial expansion should involve the closing down and obliteration of historic places such as this.  These matters should be mentioned because of the unfortunate attitude many of our people have towards graveyards in general.  Anyone who travels throughout the country and sees the way graveyards are allowed to fall into decay must feel sad, and, indeed, cynical, when they think of the great reverence paid to people at their funeral to be replaced after their death by lack of care for their graves.  This is a case where we should allow the Bill to go to the Committee.  In airing his opposition to it, Senator Yeats has done a public service and a service to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little left for me to say.  I agree with Senator Hayes that to refuse to give this Bill a Second Reading would be prejudging an issue.  It is a matter which should be investigated by a Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Such an investigation was authorised by the High Court and were we to refuse that we would be preventing people from having their affairs legitimately investigated.  Certain Bills could on their face be so objectionable that we could not authorise them to go any further. Having heard Senator Yeats speak so eloquently and strongly, I do not think this Bill falls into this category.</P>
      <P>The matters involved are proper matters to be investigated by a Joint Committee.  The very fact that we have had this debate, lasting more than an hour, shows that there is a difference of opinion and that this is a proper subject for such an inquiry.  We can always sympathise with people about their ancestors but I submit there is nothing new in a graveyard being built over.  Many graveyards throughout the country have been built over and in many cases the remains have been removed. In this case, it seems to me, there is less objection than in others. There has not been an interment for more than 70 years.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ross that the place is simply used as a children's playground.  It is to be utilised for the purpose of extending a factory.  It is ground which is no longer an active burial place.  Therefore, it is just a matter of what is best and how it ought to be done.  They are matters to which the Joint Committee can have regard. I do not see why it should not be used as a factory.  The result of its use as a factory would be that the trustees would have a considerable sum at their disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last point I should like to make is this.  Refusal to pass this Bill will really be almost a vote of censure on the trustees.  The trustees have agreed to these proposals and for us to say the Bill should be rejected at this stage is really casting a slur, if we can assume that the trustees who considered this matter would not have <Col N="1081" /> given their consent until they were satisfied it was the right thing to do, that they were doing nothing to dishonour the dead and that they were putting the space at their disposal to advantageous use.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Bill on the face of it is not so objectionable that it should be rejected at this stage out of hand.  That is what Senator Yeats has tried to do, to prevent the matter being investigated.  I for one have learned since I came here with an open mind that this is a matter which should be investigated by a Select Committee and, therefore, the rejection of this Bill would be depriving the trustees and the other people concerned of their rights to have their affairs debated in the correct parliamentary manner. Therefore, I also join with the other speakers in supporting the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this Bill.  Senator Yeats has made a strong case against it but has been fully answered by Senator Ross. Senator Ross has spoken in defence of Messrs. Jacob.  To my mind, they have made a generous offer.  I am probably not mistaken in suggesting that people of Huguenot blood had something to do with that offer.  It was not a purely commercial matter between hard-fisted business men on the one side and an innocuous community on the other.  If one looked into the pedigrees of both sides, one would find Huguenot blood, I imagine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a word which would, I believe, be the views of the descendants of Huguenots in so far as I have been able to ascertain them on this matter.  Those I consulted were on the whole in favour of the Bill, on the same principle as was adopted by the High Court, that the interests of the living were to be preferred to the interest of the dead.  They put it to me so, and I agreed with them &mdash; and I have Huguenot blood in my veins.  The people whose remains are buried in this cemetery belonged to a very charitable and public-spirited body of citizens.  Those whom I consulted believe that if the dead whose bones are now buried in this graveyard could be <Col N="1082" /> asked, they would accept the view which the trustees and the High Court have accepted: when there are members of the Huguenot community impoverished in this city of Dublin and elsewhere, they would endure, cheerfully and gladly, we believe, the removal of their remains with due dignity and care in the interests of their descendants.</P>
    <P>With regard to the letters which Senator Yeats read, I feel that the attitude shown in them was merely negative &mdash; simply no, no, no.  If the people who wrote these letters had written them earlier and had recognised earlier the poverty of their kinsfolk in this city and the neglect of this cemetery for many years, and had taken active steps to meet that situation sooner, then they would have had a strong case now.  But to come in at the last moment and object only then does not give them a very strong standing in the matter.</P>
    <P>There is one point made by Senator Ó Maoláin which I should like to answer.  I am very sympathetic with what he says about the historic landmarks in our city and throughout the country.  May I put it to him that the cemetery in Peter Street is far from being an important historic landmark or monument?  Until recently it was in bad condition and it was virtually impossible to see into it.  Very few knew of its existence.  I personally never visited it, nor did any of my family.  It is virtually unknown.</P>
    <P>There is a contrast between this cemetery and that in Merrion Row which we can all see as we pass by.  I would strongly object to the handing over of Merrion Row cemetery to a chain store, as Senator Yeats suggested. That would be wrong.  It has been a landmark for many years, open and clear to all.  I think it would satisfy Senator Ó Maoláin to some extent if I suggested a possibility that might be put into effect later on, that some of the money got from this obscure and virtually unknown plot of ground in our city might be used to put the Merrion Row cemetery into better condition.  I repeat that it is not a fair comparison to compare a well-known landmark like Merrion Row <Col N="1083" /> with this very inconspicuous space.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill on the principle that the interests of the impoverished living are to be preferred to those of the long-departed dead.  I am convinced that every generous-hearted Huguenot in the past would support the same sentiments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection at all to this measure being referred to a Select Committee but I do think, however, that if one has a view to express on it, one should express it. Unfortunately, I did not hear Senator Yeats's statement on this measure.  I heard other speakers but, because I have a view of my own, I feel I should express it.</P>
      <P>It is not a question, in my view, as to whether it is a Huguenot cemetery or any other.  The fact is it is a graveyard. Christian people have been buried there.  It may be a long time ago and the graveyard may not have been well kept.  Many old cemeteries in Ireland have not been well kept because of the shift of population and other factors.  But we should not lose sight of the fundamental fact that it is a place of Christian burial.  I do not know much about the Huguenot population but I know sufficient to recognise that they were people who suffered in their own country and who because of the climate existing here, had relevant peace in this country. They were trained people and they had arts and crafts and anything they brought to this country was an asset to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the selling of the cemetery, as far as I know, it is the first time a cemetery has been so sold by statute.  If this Bill is passed, we will be closing a cemetery by statute, selling it for use for industrial purposes. What I fear is that it is the beginning of a trend.  I have a particular view on this because it so happens some distant relatives of mine are buried in a particular farm in a certain county, and it is not normally regarded as a cemetery.  I shall not go into the reasons and the history which led up to that being so, but I know if I saw that particular little area <Col N="1084" /> which is surrounded by trees in a particular county being sold, even though those people are buried there a long time, it would annoy me.  I would feel annoyed if it were used in a way in which I feel it should not be used.</P>
    <P>I further know that there are many private cemeteries up and down the country on farms being taken over by the Land Commission.  Once we begin to provide by legislation, as is proposed to be done by this measure, I feel it is the beginning of a trend, one which, in my view, is not a good trend.  We are all aware that many of the older cemeteries in Ireland have been taken over in some cases by local authorities, even though large numbers of people in the area might use them as cemeteries.  Very often they were good cemeteries, much better than the modern ones.  Many of the people buried in these cemeteries have been over 1,000 years there.  They were places where people could be buried with respect.  In modern times we have cemeteries nearer the towns and in areas where modern churches have been built.  Very often, while the area might be suitable for a church, from a convenience point of view, it is not suitable as a cemetery.</P>
    <P>In my view, if we make provision in Dublin, where there is congestion, that cemeteries can be built on, we will also find down the country that older cemeteries which have been closed by local authority action or as a result of action by the Department of Local Government who close them because of the passage of time, although they did not intend to interfere with them, will be built on for factory purposes.</P>
    <P>In County Leitrim where cemeteries were closed because of overcrowding even though people may have been buried there over 1,000 years, it was never the intention that they should be used for any other purpose, when they were closed, than as cemeteries.  I did not hear Senator Yeats speaking on this Bill but I still would like to express my views on this.  I am not convinced this is a good thing to do. As far as I know it is the first time this has been done.  We will probably find in 50 years' time, as Senator Ross <Col N="1085" /> said, that Jacobs might move to a completely new site for development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting to Senator Ross that this is a development. This opens up a new principle. There is another point I should like to raise and it is the question of who really owns cemeteries?  As I am not a lawyer, I had always the view, irrespective of who owned the whole land, whether there was a deed of the actual land from here to the far side of Kildare Street, in real terms the real ownership of the particular part of the cemetery belonged, by squatter's title, to the people who had the right to bury their dead there and that no local authority could take away from that. The fact is the owners of the graveyard were the people buried there, even though the land might be vested in particular persons.  The particular plot in the final analysis belonged to the family or the successors of the people who are buried there.  I am not a lawyer but that is what I always thought was the legal position.  If that is so, I would not like to do anything that would create a new situation. Therefore, I would not like to support a Bill which would have that effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the County Borough of Cork (Extension of Boundary) Provisional Order, 1965.  The Order provides for the extension of the Cork City boundary to take in three adjoining areas of the county of a total area of 6,278 acres approximately, exclusive of tidal areas.  The Order is the result of a petition by Cork Corporation under section 25 of the Cork City Management (Amendment) Act, 1941, in which the addition to the city of an area of 9,590 acres plus a large area subject to tidal waters was sought.  The petition was the subject of a protracted public inquiry at which all interested parties were heard.</P>
      <P>The case made by the Corporation in support of their petition rested mainly on the claim that the existing city and the proposed extension area should and can conveniently be administered by the Corporation as a city unit for local government purposes. It was claimed that because the areas are not so administered at present the Corporation is unable to achieve an equitable level in the amount required to be raised by rate to meet the cost of the services they are obliged to provide. While I was satisfied on the basis of the inquiry evidence, and the report of the inspector who conducted it, that the Corporation's case was substantially established, I was not convinced that a boundary extension to the full extent sought was justified.  The areas which would be added to the city under the Provisonal Order are, in fact, less than two-thirds of the acreage sought by the Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension now proposed includes on the east of the present city the townlands <Col N="1087" /> of Ballinamought East and Lotabeg and the lands lying between the rivers Lee and Douglas; on the south the lands north of the Tramore and Glasheen rivers; on the west most of the townlands of Ballinaspig, Inchigaggin and Knocknaheeney; and on the north the townlands of Commons and Kilnap and portions of Kilbarry and Ballyvolane.</P>
    <P>Apart from a minor adjustment in 1955, which was mainly to bring into the city lands on which local authority houses had already been built, the Cork city boundary is unaltered since it was established in 1840.  As the city grew and expanded the question of boundary extension was raised from time to time but, apart from the 1955 change, nothing came of these moves.  The matter was raised again in 1958 and the present proposals are the result.</P>
    <P>At present almost one-third of the population of the Cork built-up area live outside the city boundary.  The proposed added areas have assumed their built-up character largely as a result of the natural growth and expansion of the city.  The city and its suburbs constitute an urban unit and they have been recognised as such for a number of administrative and legislative purposes.  Until recently the city and its environs were treated as one for planning purposes.  The Corporation supply water and fire-fighting services to the proposed extension areas.  In other ways also the suburban areas are treated as part of the city.  A considerable part of the extension areas are included in the County Borough constituency for elections to Dáil Éireann.  The same maximum on advances under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts has operated in these areas as in the city.  It is reasonable that the unity of the built-up area as recognised in these and other ways should be reflected also in the administrative boundary.</P>
    <P>The majority of people in the proposed extension areas are directly or indirectly dependent for their livelihood on activities in the city.  The suburban dwellers, about 35,000 in all, enjoy the community and social benefits of city living and look to the city for specialist <Col N="1088" /> shopping, commercial and recreational facilities which are lacking in the suburbs themselves.  The suburbs are part of the city economically and socially and it is proper that the residents there should be within the administrative area of the city, that they should have a say in its affairs and should contribute to the city finances. The peripheral growth and development of the city constitutes a valid ground for review of the administrative boundary.</P>
    <P>The proposed extension will give recognition to expansion which has already taken place in the built-up area and will provide room for inevitable further building as the city grows and prospers.  Much of the peripheral development is the result of slum clearance and re-housing operations by the corporation in central areas.</P>
    <P>Every modern city has special problems involving heavy demands on rates &mdash; housing, roads, sanitation, public lighting, parks and public amenities, vocational education, and so on.  The position in Cork is aggravated by the high proportion of people dependent on local authority housing and other public services.  It was shown at the inquiry that a high proportion of the population were housed by the corporation and this is expected to rise still further as the corporation's housing programme proceeds.</P>
    <P>The Cork city rate is among the highest in the country and the corporation claim that they would be unable on the existing rate base to provide and maintain the full range of services which a modern city community expects and which must be provided if the city is to retain and develop its social and economic position <i>vis-à-vis</i> other growing centres.  This is a matter of concern not only to the city dwellers and those in the immediate environs but to the whole country and region. Cork is the second largest city in the State and the centre of a region of substantial social and economic expansion. It is important to the maintenance of this growth that the developed area should be planned as a whole, that the renewal and redevelopment of many central areas of obsolete property <Col N="1089" /> should be tackled without delay, so as to provide an adequate modern civic environment.</P>
    <P>The new Planning and Development Act provides the necessary machinery to enable this task to be undertaken; but central renewal will not in itself be sufficient to cater for the full expansion needs of the city and provision should be made for continuing fringe development for housing and other purposes. In this regard I think the proposed new boundary is a reasonable compromise between the corporation's position and that of the county council.  In general, the extension would embrace the areas in which extensive development has already taken place and areas in which such development is projected as well as a reasonable margin for further building in the years ahead.  Centres such as Douglas and Donnybrook which, although built-up, retain a separate social or historical identity, are excluded.</P>
    <P>The county council opposed the corporation's petition at the public inquiry chiefly because the proposed extension areas are areas in respect of which rate revenue exceeds expenditure. They are, therefore &ldquo;profit&rdquo; areas of operation to the local authority and I can appreciate the reluctance of the county council to see them merged in the city.  However, the Provisional Order provides for a financial adjustment between the two authorities in respect of any matter requiring to be adjusted between them in consequence of the extension.  This includes provision for payment to the county council in respect of the increase in rate burden falling on the ratepayers in the county as a result of the reduction in the county rate base following the extension.</P>
    <P>The amount of the increased burden, when determined, will be payable by the corporation to the county council, the total not to exceed ten times the annual amount determined.  Payment may be made in one sum or by instalments. If by instalments due provision will be made for interest payable to the county council.  Thus the county council will be able to claim recoupment in respect of the difference between the rates bill on the county <Col N="1090" /> ratepayers following the extension and what the bill would have been if there had been no extension.  The order provides that in the event of the two authorities failing to reach agreement on the financial adjustment a settlement will be made by the Minister on the application of either party.</P>
    <P>The county council are naturally concerned that this settlement should be expedited and in particular that something should be done to alleviate the extra rates burden, arising from the extension, which in the absence of a financial settlement between the two authorities, might fall initially on the county council rates for 1965-66.  The apportionment of the expenses of the Cork Health Authority for 1965-66 is based on the existing areas and the expenses in respect of the added areas are included in the demands on the county council.  It is accepted by all concerned, including Cork Corporation that, following the extension, these expenses should be levied by the Corporation and not by the county council.  The corporation also accept in principle that they should compensate the county council forthwith for the extra rate burden which would otherwise fall on the county ratepayers in 1965-66 as a result of the extension.</P>
    <P>I have had a meeting with the Senators and Deputies from Cork city and county, on the financial aspects of the extension and as a result, it was agreed that the city and county officials should immediately open negotiations with a view to agreement on the amount of the payments to be made to the county council in 1965-66.  These negotiations are subject to the consent of the county council; the Corporation have already agreed to negotiate.  I expect that the negotiations will go a long way towards settling outstanding differences. If full agreement should not be reached the Corporation are agreeable to making an interim payment.  In that event it would fall to me under the Provisional Order to make the final determination and such determination would be made at the earliest date possible.</P>
    <P>I think it will be clear from what I have said that the way is now open to a speedy financial settlement between <Col N="1091" /> the two authorities that the rates for 1965-66 on the reduced county area need not be saddled with any expenses which would not have been properly chargeable in respect of that area if there was no boundary extension.</P>
    <P>Another important feature of the Provisional Order is the provision relating to rates in the added area.  The intention is that rates on property brought into the city by the boundary extension will not be raised to the higher level of the city rate immediately. For these properties the gap between the level of the county and the city rates will be bridged gradually by annual stages over five years as provided for in article 16 and the second schedule to the Order.</P>
    <P>Agricultural land in the added areas will cease to attract the agricultural grant following the boundary extension. A corresponding amount of the grant will, however, be paid over to the Corporation and, in turn the valuation on agricultural land in the added areas will be reduced by 50 per cent, as in the case of all agricultural land taken into the city.  In addition to this relief, the procedure I have just referred to in regard to the easing of rates by means of differential rating on properties in the added areas will apply to agricultural land also.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Order includes a number of other consequential provisions on the usual lines such as the preparation of official maps of the extended city area, continuation in effect of county council resolutions and orders where appropriate, arrangements in regard to jurors books, registers of electors, employment and hours of trading Orders, polling districts, the adjustment of the agricultural grant and a saving from disqualification for county council members in the added areas pending the forthcoming local government elections.</P>

      <P>We have just had a discussion on a Private Bill of a rather unusual nature.  Under the British <i>régime</i> and under the old regulations, the matter the Minister has just <Col N="1092" /> been dealing with and has dealt with in this Provisional Order Bill would have been the subject of a Private Bill. It is now deemed, quite properly of course, to be a matter of public interest what the boundaries of a city or town in the State may be.  It has been conducted by way of a public inquiry by an inspector of the Minister. Then the matter is put before the two Houses of the Oireachtas by way of a Public Bill confirming a Provisional Order of the Minister.</P>
      <P>It would appear that both the county council of Cork and the Cork City Council have agreed and an interesting arrangement has been made by which the increase in the rates that had been added from the county to the city will be adjusted and will be, so to speak, the subject of a number of years' purchase.  The improvement on Private Bill procedures with this kind of Bill should be noted.  As far as I am concerned, the Bill is one which should pass.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I presume is called article 6, sub-article 5, on page 4 of the Bill, at the very bottom, there is provision for the machinery to be used if the county council and the corporation fail to agree upon an equitable adjustment of any matter or thing.  The method suggested is that, if either of them so wish, the Minister intervenes and makes a compulsory adjustment.  I should like to suggest that that seems to be a rapid movement from one extreme to another.  I should have thought that, properly, what should happen would be that if the parties fail to agree the matter should go to arbitration.  There is plenty of machinery available for arbitration of such things.  I should have liked to see that approached as an intermediary step.  I agree that this is probably an unusual set of circumstances but would it not be as well to provide that there could be arbitration but if either of the parties did not want to go to arbitration then it should go to the Minister?  I should like to suggest an amendment to that subarticle so that, at the end of page 4, words would be inserted which would then make the article read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> Whenever the County Council and the Corporation fail to agree upon an equitable adjustment of any matter or thing which would be the subject of an agreed adjustment under this article&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>And here I suggest should be inserted the words&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;the matter or thing should be made the subject of arbitration provided that if either party shall object to this procedure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and then the Article would continue&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister shall, upon the request of either the County Council or the Corporation make an equitable adjustment...</P>
    <P>I had some trouble in getting a form of words which would cause the least possible disturbance of the draft.  I suggest it would be a fair and equitable thing to do to provide that arbitration could be sought but it would not disturb, in fact, to any great degree what is in the Bill in that either party can ask the Minister to make a compulsory adjustment.  I do think it would be a good thing to preserve the right of arbitration in such a matter.</P>
    <P>The only other matter on which I wanted to ask for a bit more clarification concerns this business of agricultural land in the area taken over. If I understood the Minister right, the valuation will automatically be reduced by 50 per cent.  Does it mean, then, that on top of that 50 per cent automatic reduction there are these other reductions which are mentioned in the Second Schedule?  It seems to me to be much on the lines of what is provided in the 1946 Local Government Act, Part II of a Schedule, where this type of adjustment was provided for urban land other than in a borough.  I am not at all clear as to what exactly happens, nor do I quite take it from what the Minister said what is the precise effect.  Does it, in fact, mean that, on the land being taken over by the borough, there will be an automatic reduction of 50 per cent in the valuation of agricultural land as defined here and then, on top of that, for five <Col N="1094" /> years there will be another sliding scale?  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to illuminate this rather murky point a little further and I should be glad also if he would consider the amendment I suggest to article 6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one small point I should like to make.  It is a matter of my recollection.  When the last Bill of this type was going through, in regard to the extension of the City of Dublin, the provision for the increase of burden allowance was an allowance up to 15 times the agreed increase.  As I understand the Minister this evening, he is allowing up to ten times.  Would he indicate why there has been a change in this particular respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Replying to Senator Sheldon on this matter of arbitration, the fact is that, really, it will be arbitration and that the Minister is the arbitrator and has so been in the far more important aspect of the entire matter, namely, in regard to the boundary decision itself.  The follow-on from that seems rather logical since it is merely a question of apportioning the compensation to be arrived at and, furthermore, this procedure has a fairly long history and many precedents.  I do not really see that there is a great deal of need for this.  The principle is there. Although it is not stated to be an arbitration, in fact it really must be. The Minister, if and when called upon to do this job, really has to face up to the problem as an arbitrator would and, of course, with the far greater safeguard that there are penalties that might be visited on his head if he makes a mess of it whereas, if the ordinary arbitrator does these things, nothing can happen to him &mdash; not that I have known of any.</P>
      <P>On the agricultural land question, it is quite true that immediately on coming into the city and becoming city or borough lands, these agricultural lands will, by the present statute, be entitled to a 50 per cent reduction in their actual rates or payments on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have the question raised <Col N="1095" /> by Senator Dooge in regard to the 15 times and why the change from the precedent established in the latest Dublin extension.  The situation there is that the 15 times was by agreement of the two parties concerned.  In fact, it is the only case in which 15 times was so arrived at and a precedent can be quoted in the three other city cases of recent times such as Limerick, Waterford and Cork itself in the past.</P>
    <P>Another thing I should say is that, in the 1953 Dublin case, the compensation was based on 15 times the increase on burden and payments were spread over 15 years but no interest was paid or provided for.  There is a very distinct and in this case quite a substantial difference in the manner in which the payments are made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>A lump sum of ten times the burden?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a lump sum. It is the type of variation which might make for the reaching of agreement which I hope we shall have between the two authorities.  It gives that little more play.  While it might appear that Cork is given a different sort of deal over all, the difference need not be anything like the difference between ten times and 15 times as is indicated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to revert to Senator Sheldon's proposed amendment.  In the normal way every reference to the Minister would not really be arbitration. However, the Minister has had to be the arbitrator in decisions in relation to the extension of the borough boundary.  The actual agreement on the boundary was a big decision, and if the Minister has had to adopt the role of arbitrator in that case, it is fair and proper he should also be the arbitrator in a case of this sort.  The suggested amendment proposes that if either of the two parties fail to reach agreement, they will then go to arbitration and that the one who disagreed could finally suggest to the Minister to do what, straightforwardly, he could do at the moment.  The Minister, in this case, is far more restricted in <Col N="1096" /> his dealings than would an arbitrator from any other walk of life.  Not often does an arbitrator in other walks of life have to justify what he did in public.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Second Reading, the change over is a bit sudden &mdash; we suddenly go from this agreement to the Minister's intervention.  The Minister said very fairly that in more material matters he has arbitrated.  I can visualise a case in which one party was anxious to go to the Minister but the other was not.  The second one would, so to speak, be led screaming into this compulsory adjustment.  It would seem fair and equitable that an ordinary arbitrator should come in at that point, with the proviso that the Minister can come in.  For the Minister to say there are precedents leading in the other way is superfluous: every time we pass legislation, we open up new precedents.  If one allowed oneself to be influenced by precedents, no legislation would be needed at all.  I am <Col N="1097" /> not unduly worried by that.  I cannot see the point that an ordinary arbitrator would be in a worse position than the Minister because the Minister was more amenable to public opinion. I would think that all the more reason why a public arbitrator should come in is because he could not care less about public opinion.</P>
    <P>It has been difficult to draft an amendment on this matter.  It appears to me that it would put the party who wanted to go directly to the Minister in a more awkward position in any bargaining with the other party.  It seems to be a bit sudden to have to go straight from a disagreement to a compulsory adjustment by the Minister and I should have thought the Minister would welcome some cushioning in between.  He is not famous for being humorous in face of every situation that crops up.  I can visualise a disagreement and the Minister being forced to make an adjustment that would be very annoying to one of the parties.</P>

      <P>I should have added one thing.  It would probably have given Senator Sheldon an answer to his amendment.  As it stands, there could be arbitration by agreement.  If it is not agreed, there would be arbitration anyway.  Entered as mutual agreement, arbitration could in fact form part of that mutual agreement. Neither the Minister nor anybody else really has to come into it which is the ideal thing.  In fact, this can be done if you have agreement.  Where they might wish to have an arbitrator, they can do so by mutual agreement. I think that probably is the ideal way out of this, if they have a mind to approach it in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This short Bill comes before you in direct consequence of the Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Bill, 1965, which proposes to authorise a substantial extension of the municipal boundary of Cork.  To secure effective representation on the county borough council for all sections of the population of the enlarged municipal area, this Bill proposes to increase by ten members the present membership of that council.</P>
      <P>The Cork City Management Act, 1929, provided that the council would consist of 21 members.  At the time the Act was passed Cork county borough had a population of 78,490 and occupied an area of 2,685 acres. A boundary extension in 1955 added 835 acres and a population of 15,364. The Provisional Order which has now been submitted for confirmation will add to the county borough 6,278 acres &mdash; disregarding approximately 800 acres of tideway &mdash; and a population, on the basis of the 1961 Census, of 33,641 persons.  If the Provisional Order dealing with this projected boundary extension is confirmed by the Oireachtas, the population of the enlarged county borough will be 111,621 persons.  This comprises 56,202 persons within the old 1929 boundary, 21,778 in the area added in 1955 and, as I have said, 33,641 persons in the areas now being added.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ratio established by the 1929 Act between the population and the number of members of the county borough council in Cork would be maintained by an increase from 21 to 31 members.  I think, however, that an uneven number of members, as in the case of the other county boroughs, would be preferable and for this reason the Bill provides for 31 members which would be justified on the <Col N="1099" /> basis of comparison with Limerick and Waterford.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend, for a further period of three years, the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956 which was to expire on 31st March, 1959 but which was renewed for two further periods of three years each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prohibit by Order the exportation of industrial goods save under a licence issued by him.  Orders made under the Act have a life of 12 months and are required to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made, and the Orders may be annulled by resolution of either House.  At present a number of goods are subject to export control under the Control of Exports Orders, 1965, <Col N="1100" /> which were made under the powers conferred under this Act.</P>
    <P>I consider that the time has not yet come when the export controls may be dispensed with.  Accordingly, it is necessary to enact legislation to continue these powers for some further time.  The control is necessary in order to conserve scarce raw materials for the benefit of home industries and to ensure that strategic materials are not exported from or through this country to Communist countries.  It is also desirable to have readily available a means of dealing with a situation in which in some international circumstances there might be a danger of the country being drained of some essential material.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to consolidate in a single measure, as far as this is practicable, the existing body of law relating to the safety, health and welfare of mine and quarry workers.  At the same time, the opportunity is being taken to bring the law up to date and to provide for some desirable innovations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operations of mining and quarrying have much in common and are attended by similar risks.  At present there are two separate codes of law relating to them, although these codes are similar in general character and are closely connected.  Both are cumbrous and involved, being contained in 18 enactments stretching back <Col N="1101" /> to 1872; they are also out of date in many respects.  I think it would be convenient for all concerned if the entire body of the law were dealt with comprehensively in a single enactment.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been framed on the principles that the rights enjoyed by mine and quarry workers under existing legislation will not be diminished; that mine and quarry workers will, in general, be given the same kind of protection as has been afforded to factory workers by factory legislation; and that working conditions will comply with this country's obligations under International Labour Organisation Conventions.  Accordingly, it follows the general lines of existing legislation but revises many of its provisions in the light of modern conditions and practices.  At the same time a number of elaborate provisions are replaced by power to make regulations. This change, by setting out general requirements in the statute and leaving the details to be prescribed by regulations, will provide a degree of flexibility which should obviate for many years to come the need for amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill makes the usual preliminary and general provisions relating to interpretation, expenses, repeals, etc.  I would like to draw attention, however, to Section 6, which brings State mines and quarries within the scope of this type of legislation for the first time.  This development is in line with current views on the position of State enterprises&mdash;the Factories Act, 1955 and the Office Premises Act, 1958, have already set a headline in this respect.  Section 9 provides for prior consultation with the Minister for Health on health regulations.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with the management and control of mines and quarries.  It sets out the duties of owners and provides for the appointment, general duties, rights and powers of managers. The most important innovations in this Part are the requirement that a manager must be appointed to supervise the working of every quarry, and the power to prohibit, by regulations, the carrying out of certain operations unless the quarry manager has prescribed <Col N="1102" /> qualifications.  The requirement that every quarry must have a manager arises from the need to have a readily identifiable person who will be responsible for seeing that the detailed requirements of the Act and of Regulations and Orders made under it are complied with.  Owners of small quarries need not feel that this requirement will place an undue burden on them, however, as it will be open to any owner to appoint himself manager of his own quarry.  On the second point, developments in recent years in the scope of the activities being carried out at some of the larger quarries have indicated that, in order to supervise some of the more complex operations, a manager would need to have technical qualifications.</P>
    <P>Part II also contains some new provisions about the rights and duties of mine and quarry owners and managers which are designed to set out clearly their respective areas of responsibility. For example, orders by mine and quarry owners to subordinates of managers must normally be given through the managers, and managers may in certain circumstances require written confirmation of owners' orders.  Also, a quarry owner may exclude any matter from the manager's control and reserve responsibility for it to himself, as long as this would not be prejudicial to the safety or health of his employees.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with safety, health and welfare of mine workers.  It covers such matters as securing shafts and entrances, construction, maintenance and safe use of roads, operation of winding and haulage apparatus, provision of support underground, ventilation and lighting of mines, use of electricity and blasting materials, precautions against fire and flooding, safety provisions relating to machinery and buildings, and general welfare.  These provisions are based on existing legislation to a large extent, with some necessary modifications required by modern conditions.  There are a number of new provisions, none of which could be regarded as revolutionary.</P>
    <P>Part IV provides for the safety, health and welfare of quarry workers. <Col N="1103" /> As might be expected, it has a good deal in common with Part III, and it incorporates certain provisions of that Part, which are relevant to both mines and quarries.  Again, existing legislation is followed closely.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with the notification and investigation of accidents and diseases. This Part also follows the lines of existing legislation, which has been adapted to modern requirements.  The procedures laid down for holding inquests and formal investigations are similar to corresponding provisions in the Factories Act, 1955.</P>
    <P>Part VI, which consists of only one section, maintains the right of workmen employed at a mine or quarry to appoint &ldquo;workmen's inspectors&rdquo; to inspect the mine or quarry at intervals. I am advised that this right has seldom, if ever, been availed of in this country but I do not propose to extinguish it.</P>
    <P>Part VII also consists of only one section, which continues in force the existing requirement that owners must fence abandoned and disused mines. I might mention here that the fencing of dangerous quarries, whether abandoned or not, comes within the scope of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1964, and accordingly, there is no need to provide for it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part VIII deals with conditions of employment.  At this stage I might point out that settling conditions of employment is not a primary objective of this Bill, and in fact quarry workers are already covered by the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936.  However, under existing legislation mine workers have certain rights in this matter which will be continued in force, and I have taken the opportunity of making some necessary new provisions.  The existing prohibition on the employment of boys under 14 years below ground is being replaced by a power to make regulations restricting the employment of boys under a prescribed age.  This change will enable the minimum age for work below ground in mines to be reviewed in the light of any alteration in the general school-leaving age or any future commitments which this country may assume under any international <Col N="1104" /> agreement on the matter.  Restrictions on the employment of women and young persons at night are being brought into line with the latest ILO Convention on the subject; other conditions of employment of such persons employed above ground may be settled by regulations.  The prohibition on the employment of women and children below ground will, of course, be continued.</P>
    <P>Regulations may also provide for the compulsory medical examination of all persons employed or seeking employment at mines or quarries.  Compulsory medical examination of young persons has long been a feature of factory legislation, but the danger of contracting respiratory disease in mining and quarrying requires that such examination can be extended to adults.  I envisage that these regulations will require (a) compulsory medical examination of all persons seeking employment and (b) compulsory medical examination of serving workers at regular intervals.  Consultation with owners and trade unions on the making of these and other regulations relating to conditions of employment is required by section 119.</P>
    <P>Part IX continues in force, without any fundamental changes, existing requirements about keeping records and furnishing returns and information. Part X, which consists of a single section, makes provisions for the making of ministerial regulations, the procedure being set out in the Second Schedule.  Here again, the lines of existing legislation have been followed.</P>
    <P>Part XI maintains the right of coal miners who are paid by the weight of coal produced, to check the weighing of it.  I understand that this right has hardly ever been formally invoked in this country, but its existence probably is of some value in the completion and implementation of wage agreements where wages are based on output.</P>
    <P>Part XII deals with the appointment of inspectors and sets out their general powers.  These provisions are on the lines of existing legislation.  Part XIII makes the usual type of provision for offences, penalties and legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Finally, Part XIV covers a number <Col N="1105" /> of miscellaneous matters which are not proper to any other Part.  The most interesting of these is a new provision for the setting up of an Advisory Council representative of employers and employees.  This provision has been prompted by the success which has attended the operation of the Factory and Office Advisory Councils set up under the Factories and Office Premises Acts.  It will be the function of the Council to advise me on any matter arising out of the execution of the Act which I may refer to them. They will also be entitled, on their own initiative, to advise me on the administration of the Act and any orders or regulations under it, and on certain other matters affecting the safety, welfare and education of employees and employers.  The Council must include representatives of trade unions and of employers' organisations.  I am confident that the Advisory Council will be of considerable assistance in the smooth operation of the Act when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, which the Minister has outlined to us, consists of three parts, an essential reenactment of existing legislation, an amendment of the existing code on mines and quarries to bring it into line with modern conditions and thirdly, certain provisions to allow for the particular conditions in this country.  Our existing code on mines goes back to 1872 and 1911 and that on quarries to 1894.  We have had no amending legislation since that period and it is timely that the Minister should bring in a Bill on this particular topic, and should incorporate in this Bill many of the provisions which appear in the British Mines and Quarries Act, 1954, which the British Parliament, with their longer and greater experience of mining and quarrying, saw fit to enact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is, of course, of its very nature, a technical Bill, and its discussion lends itself far more to a Committee Stage discussion than to a debate on Second Stage.  Nevertheless, there are some points that could well be discussed here this evening.  The Bill is again of its nature, largely an <Col N="1106" /> enabling Bill, and even though certain specific matters are laid down, the Bill largely sets out to outline the code of administration for the operation of mines and quarries in this country.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill is timely, and it is a good Bill.  I think it will be welcomed by the House.  It involves a substantial improvement of our existing conditions.  Nevertheless, as a loyal member of the House, I do not consider there is any Bill that cannot be improved by discussion here in the Seanad, and accordingly I intend to table several amendments on Committee Stage.  Before we start to consider whether the Bill as it is before us today is suitable for enactment by the House for conditions in this country, it is well for us to recall the peculiar position of the mining industry and the quarrying industry in this country. We do not have a very large mining industry.  We have not had a very large mining industry in the past, but there are signs now&mdash;and very welcome signs indeed&mdash;that mining will loom larger and larger in this country in the future.  In the past we have not had many mines, and the mines we had have been small.  Indeed, the Ice Age which managed to give us some of the best scenery in western Europe also managed to leave us with some of the worst mineral resources in western Europe.  The result is that such mines as do exist are mines which were set up to exploit relatively narrow seams. That is something which affects mining operations and the code of mining operations in many ways.  When we look at what has been enacted in Britain and ask if this should be enacted in exactly the same way, we must make allowances for those facts.</P>
    <P>Let us take a typical example.  This Bill, as I have said, is an enabling Bill but there are certain specific conditions in it.  One of the most specific is the provision laid down that all travelling roads in mines should be five feet six inches in height.  It might be thought that this is something which is equally desirable and equally onerous under British conditions and Irish conditions.  Actually it is a particularly onerous provision in regard <Col N="1107" /> to Irish mines.  I anticipate that practically every Irish mine&mdash;and certainly every Irish coal mine&mdash;will ask the Minister to be exempted from the provision in that section.  The position is that in making a travelling road five feet six inches in height in an ordinary mine such as occurs in Britain that road is excavated and probably three feet six inches or four feet of the excavation is solid coal.  Therefore the greater part of the excavation which is taken out consists of the mineral which they are looking for.  In Irish mines the seams are something like 18 inches thick and the position is that only 18 inches of the excavation actually involves the removal of the material which is being sought; the remaining four feet involves the removal of completely waste material.</P>
    <P>There are many instances where there are differences because of the particular circumstances in mining in this country and because we are working seams which people would not bother to work in Britain.  We have a very great responsibility in enacting a mining code because our mining industry is operating in a marginal way on these marginally worthwhile mineral seams.  In the enactment of a Bill like this, we must tolerate no lowering of standards involving matters of the health, safety and welfare of the people working in the mines, but we must also be extremely careful not to impose conditions that will be more onerous than is necessary because, as I said, in this peculiarly marginal industry, this would bear very heavily on the owners.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is largely a Committee Stage Bill and my main comments will be made then, but there are a few general points I should like to raise at this stage.  First, I should like to say something about the new provision in regard to medical inspection.  I welcome very much the provision in the Bill in regard to medical inspection of all new workers and all existing workers.  My information is that the position in regard to the health of the workers in this country has unfortunately not kept up <Col N="1108" /> with the times.  I do not think that is anyone's fault but at the moment we are a long way behind conditions in other countries.  That is not because anyone was neglectful, but rather because we have not managed to develop the proper administrative machinery.</P>
    <P>The position in this country appears to be that in the case of a mine worker who is unfortunate enough to contract the disease of pneumoconiosis, to which mine workers are subject, the disease is not often diagnosed until it has reached a relatively advanced stage.  Under conditions as they stand in this country, when the disease has reached an advanced stage, the worker goes to civil law to recover damages from his employer.  Thus we have the case of one man who has his health ruined to a large degree, and another man who pays heavy damages as a result.  It should be possible under the new provisions in this Bill to produce a scheme which would prevent that situation.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, for many years past in Britain there has not been any advanced case of the disease of pneumoconiosis, nor has there been any resort to civil action.  In Britain, apparently, they have developed a system whereby in a case such as this a tribunal is up, consisting of a mine inspector, a trade unionist and a doctor. The tribunal examines each case and makes an appropriate award.  In all cases both the mine owners and the workers have been perfectly satisfied with the awards made by the tribunal. This, together with the X-ray system which has been operating in British mines since just after the war, has led to a tremendous reduction in the number of workers suffering from pneumoconiosis.  I think we could adopt such a system here.  In the British system an award of damages is made on the basis of the degree to which the person's health has been affected, and also a recommendation is made in regard to the employment of the worker.</P>
    <P>I think it is important in this regard to remember that this disease is not a progressive disease.  Once the worker is removed from the actual working face of a mine, the disease will not progress. <Col N="1109" /> Actually, workers who have contracted the disease in a mild form can work not only over ground but also in something like 75 per cent of the working areas below ground: those who are mildly affected with this disease can continue to work.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister, with the aid of his Advisory Council, will, following the enactment of this measure, be able not exactly to follow in detail the British system but to evolve a system whereby this particular disease will be diagnosed early; that the financial adjustments can be made readily and easily on this informal basis and that agreement can be reached concerning the placement of the worker.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the educational qualification of mine managers.  Section 15 of this Bill in fact replaces section 5 of the 1911 Coal Mines Act.  But, as it stands here in the Bill, I think it replaces it by a weaker provision.  The Bill repeals the 1911 Coal Mines Act which laid down certain qualifications for mine managers and merely provides that regulations can be made in regard to qualifications for the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest that there should not be any weakening at all in regard to this question of the qualifications of mine managers.  Even a casual glance at the Bill will bring home to anybody the tremendous responsibility placed on the mine manager in regard to the health and safety of all concerned. Indeed, the key-note of the Bill is the solid placing of this responsibility on the shoulders of this single individual, the mine manager.</P>
    <P>Under the 1911 Act, the position was that if there should be more than 30 people engaged in a mine then the mine manager had to have a first-class certificate of competency.  If there were between 14 and 30 people, he would require a second-class certificate.  In addition, a mine inspector could at any time make an order in respect to the classification of any mine classifying it as requiring a manager qualified in a particular way.  This, as I understand it, is the law in regard to the qualification of mine managers at the moment.</P>
    <P>The law as it stands now should be <Col N="1110" /> carried completely into effect on the coming into operation of the new Bill. It should then be open to the advisory council to amend these particular qualifications in any way.  As I see it, we shall have a hiatus in regard to mining qualifications under the way the Minister proposes to do it now. We do not have in this country any qualification of our own in regard to the management of mines.  The fact that we should have to use, for such time as may be, the British qualification in regard to this matter should not deter us from making sure that we carry on, from the date on which the Bill comes into operation, exactly the same provisions in regard to the competency of mine managers as were in operation before that date.</P>
    <P>We would hope that, if our mining industry develops, managers can be trained in this country.  If there is not the opportunity to train mining managers in this country at the moment as they have been trained from 1911 to date, then we must carry on as before and have these men trained in Britain or elsewhere and returned here as mine managers.  I feel that what we should do in this regard is to re-enact what is in the 1911 Act, with power of variation on the part of the advisory council.</P>
    <P>A final point I should like to refer to at this stage of the debate is the matter of regulations under this Bill. I should like to ask the Minister some questions in this regard.  There are, under the Bill, a multitude of types of regulations.  There are Ministerial orders which could bring certain parts of the Bill into operation.  There are regulations under the complicated procedure laid down in the Second Schedule.  These could be general regulations which apply to all mines and quarries or they could be special regulations applying to individual mines or quarries.  There is also provision under the Bill for orders to be made by mining inspectors.  These, again, are of different types.  Some of these are subject to appeal under, I think, section 145 of the Bill.  Others are not subject to appeal.  There are still further types under section 131 where an order can be made and must <Col N="1111" /> be carried out without delay because of possible immediate danger.  Statutory rules to be made by the mine manager are also provided for in the Bill.  He has power to make transport rules and support rules.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, in this regard, what guiding principles he has adopted in deciding the matters to be covered by Ministerial order, Ministerial regulation, inspector's order or manager's rule?  What are the different principles which allocate a particular order to one or other of these types of regulations and what criteria has the Minister used in determining which orders of inspector are subject to appeal and which orders are not subject to appeal?</P>
    <P>Again, in this matter of regulation, there is the question I shall return to on Committee Stage: the matter of sanction for certain breaches of rule. There is provision in certain sections for rules made by a manager but, as I read these sections, there does not appear to be any particular sanction for a breach of these rules as made by the manager.  I do not know whether we would be getting into difficulty here by allowing a manager to make a rule the breach of which would be a statutory offence.  I do not know if there is the difficulty in that regard but I feel that, in a matter like this, there should be a definite sanction for the breach of rules.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, some of the mine and quarry owners are of the opinion that mines can best be operated in regard to this matter of rules to be made by the manager for safe working if the manager of the mine or of the quarry were given power to fine workers for breach of these rules.  They make the point in this regard that there are certain breaches of discipline for which it would not be appropriate to bring a man to court for a statutory offence and neither would it be appropriate for the man to be peremptorily dismissed but that there are certain types of offences in regard to safety and welfare below ground which could be a potential danger in which a system of fining, which would be a matter <Col N="1112" /> of agreement between the manager and the trade union representatives&mdash; would be an appropriate way of dealing with the matter.  I should be glad if the Minister would indicate if there exists a sanction for breaches of manager's rules and if he would give us his views on how this may best be carried out.</P>
    <P>There are many regulations and when the Bill goes into operation, all these will be applied and there will be many people other than the managers who, when working in a mine or quarry, will have the responsibility of seeing that the regulations are complied with.  I would urge the Minister to follow the excellent example of Britain in regard to the publication of a mining and quarrying code.  The position in Britain is that separate publications are produced in regard to the responsibility of different classes of people.  Whether the person is responsible for blasting at the mine face, or is a mine manager, a publication covers him and imposes responsibility.  To summarise, may I say that this Bill, both in regard to what it re-enacts of old legislation and in regard to the fresh provisions, is a good and a timely Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply wish to welcome the Bill on general grounds. Those interested in industrial development look on mining as an activity likely to grow.  A number of possibilities are in sight which could make mining an important industry in the near future and a still more important industry in the distant future.  The Bill provides for a satisfactory legal code regulating this industry which we hope will grow.  It is an industry which gives large employment of a good kind.  At the same time, it requires to be very carefully regulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill seems to have covered the whole ground as far as I can make out. It is very important the law should be clear regarding the welfare and safety of people working in mines and quarries and this Bill goes a long way towards clarifying these matters.  I particularly welcome section 150 which provides for the setting up of an advisory council.  Employers and employees <Col N="1113" /> will be represented and we hope that this will make for good labour relations in the industry&mdash;discussion among people who meet each other on equal ground in cases of threatened disputes or differences of opinion.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge spoke about the necessity to tighten up medical matters. Though this is new ground to me, I should have preferred if the qualifications of managers could be more clearly defined than they are in section 15.  This is really a Committee Stage Bill and I do not wish to raise any points which should be more properly raised later.  There is one small point I should like to make in relation to section 5, the interpretation section.  It provides that special regulations are defined as regulations applicable to a particular mine or quarry only.  Section 8 provides that every regulation other than special regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The special regulations might affect a whole lot of people and members of the Seanad might have views on them just as much as they might have views on the general regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in welcoming the Bill, which consolidates the law in regard to mines and quarries.  The Bill itself, as previous speakers have said, is largely one for Committee Stage debate.  The only regret is that it represents a type of legislation that could very well have been introduced in the Seanad in the first instance.  The Seanad is reasonably well fitted to take the first consideration of such a Bill.  We had plenty of time before Christmas which could have been utilised for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill being so highly technical, I wonder did the Minister consult in any real way the engineers' association. I know from such people they are very anxious to contribute in any way they can to national development and to placing their technical skill and know-how at the disposal of the Government.  I speak in ignorance on it.  I do not know whether these people were consulted on it.  Had they <Col N="1114" /> been consulted, I would have thought they would have set up a committee and worked effectively to produce some really worthwhile suggestions and recommendations for the Minister on this topic.  If the Minister has not got that assistance, I would appeal to him not to let such opportunities slip in the future of acquiring specialist help on problems obviously of a specialist character.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse what Senator Dooge has said about qualifications of mining managers.  We must go very carefully into this on Committee Stage.  While we have not got courses that would qualify mine managers at the moment, our primary degree courses in engineering and so on provide a solid foundation on which subsequent work can be taken. I welcome the provision in the Bill, whereby the Minister takes power to introduce legislation to raise the minimum age for employment above 14.  I hope we have not under 14-year-olds, or anything in that region, working underground at the moment and I hope the Minister will see in the future that the age is rapidly pushed up to the realistic figure of 16 years at the minimum.</P>
    <P>I also welcome section 119 which sets out clearly the duty of the Minister to consult with the owners, representatives and employees before making regulations affecting their interests. That is a very worthwhile provision. Also, the creation of a new Advisory Council symbolises a new type of thinking which has proved so valuable in the past few years.  The council is a very positive step forward and I welcome especially the section in the Bill which gives the Advisory Council the right, and the initiative, to examine the necessary regulations, make changes or amendments in them and draw those to the attention of the Minister.  In other words, to that extent the Council is enabled to function as an effective council.</P>
    <P>I have a few reservations in regard to the Council in that I do not think it is in keeping with the general spirit that the Minister should nominate all new members, the chairman plus the eight members of the Council.  I should <Col N="1115" /> think the Minister at this stage should recognise the contribution the engineering profession is making to the development of the country and the part played by their central organisation, the Institute of Civil Engineers of Ireland and its co-body, Cumann na nInnealtóirí.  He should recognise their position by giving them the right to nominate at least two members to the Council.  That is not much to ask and it would be only a just and fitting recognition by the Government of the great service performed by the engineers.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am not over-happy that the Council should continue for an indefinite period.  Subsection (7) of section 150 states that the chairman and the ordinary members shall hold office for such period as the Minister may decide.  I think it would be far better to put the decision into the Bill itself and make the period a reasonable one, something in the order of five years. That would give an opportunity to the Minister to replace any members who have not pulled their weight.  In conclusion, I welcome the Bill and I look forward to an effective Committee Stage discussion when we may be able to make some minor improvements of a technical nature in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>This corner has had quite an innings today on this legislation.  I should like to welcome the Bill.  I think it is a most enlightened piece of legislation.  It is a tidying up of out-of-date enactments of the past.  It recognises the rights of workers in many sections and makes provision for the safeguarding of their health, welfare and safety.  Like Professor Quinlan, I welcome particularly the reference to the age of entry into work, that is, the decision of the Minister to replace the existing prohibition of boys under 14 by regulations restricting the employment of boys under a prescribed age.  This is particularly welcome, especially in view of the fact that our official thinking on the matter of age of entry into employment has been governed since 1934 by a decision of an inter-departmental committee which stated that <Col N="1116" /> children of 14 were not immature for employment, either physically or mentally.</P>
      <P>That, I think, was a most enlightened decision and we seem to be coming round to the fact that children are immature at that age and are not yet ready for employment, either above or below the ground.  It is of interest to note that children under 17 years are not allowed to enter employment in Russia, a country which is often held up as the symbol of materialism.  As a matter of fact, the school leaving age over a considerable area of Russia is 17 years.  It is also so in many areas of the United States. In England according to the Sir Geoffrey Crowther Report all children should be kept at school until they are 16 and there should be the compulsory education for all up to the age of 18. I particularly welcome that section of the Bill.  I consider it a piece of enlightened legislation which should be welcomed by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As most of the speakers have said, this is a Bill that can be dealt with more effectively in Committee than in Second Stage. There were a few points raised with which I shall deal on this Stage, perhaps not in the details Senators will require, but, nevertheless, I hope to satisfy them that any apprehension they might have expressed at this stage may not be too well founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooge pointed out that we were not very well endowed with mineral deposits.  Apparently he seemed to be putting the blame on something beyond the Government's control, the Ice Age, I remember when I had particular problems with the copper mining industry, and that was not long ago, I took counsel with a very eminent mining engineer, Sir Chester Beatty.  He was kind enough to offer some advice which was very valuable to us.  He told me that having regard to the Jake Day theory, we could not be expected to have great mineral deposits in this country.  He told me when he was a mining engineer in a Utah company for which he worked, they had a fair idea that there were valuable deposits on the land of a certain Jake <Col N="1117" /> Day.  When the company approached Jake day to get on to his land, they were told it would cost $50,000 to put their foot on it; to start inspection would cost $250,000 and he said: &ldquo;When you start boring holes, we will talk about what it will cost you then.&rdquo; The representative asked what this meant on land that was full of rock and scrub and Jake Day said: &ldquo;When the good Lord put rock and scrub on my land, He gave plenty of it.&rdquo;  He must have put something good underneath it.  Apparently in this country the good Lord gave too much scenic land for us to expect a lot of valuable mineral deposits.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons why, to revert to what Senator Dooge said, we have not perhaps advanced to the stage in mining operations they have in Britain.  That applies particularly to one of the big points he made about the existence of pneumoconiosis of the workers in this industry.  In Britain they have a system whereby when this disease is suspected, by reason of the vast nature of the operations, they usually employ such a man in an overground capacity and thereby relieve him of the necessity to go underground to earn his living.  Unfortunately, in this country we do not have sufficient overground operations to take anybody who is suspected of the disease from underground and give him similarly paid employment overground.  Nevertheless, the regulations we are now proposing to make will be an advance in this respect.</P>
    <P>As far as the difficulty of compensation for those who suffer from this disease is concerned, it is true most of them have taken their remedy under common law rather than under statute law.  It was suggested to me in the Dáil that this is a matter we ought to provide for in this Bill, but this is not the appropriate Bill.  This is an enabling Bill and it does not provide for matters such as this.  It would be more proper to the comprehensive Workmen's Compensation Bill which the Minister for Social Welfare is at present preparing. I am not certain he is going to deal with this specific matter in the Bill. Nevertheless, it is not proper to the Bill under discussion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> Another point the Senator made referred to the qualification to be required of mining engineers under Section 15.  He seemed to suggest that there might be danger that we would depend on the standard set in the 1911 Act.  I can assure the House there is no such danger.  In the first place, as Senator Quinlan said, we have not got any training facilities in this country. We have no degree in the university at a level that we can insist on mining engineers possessing.  Nevertheless, this is a matter on which I will have to take the advice of the Council.  There will be no gap between the period when the new qualifications will be required and the present time.  The qualifications will be prescribed without any danger of a hiatus occurring.</P>
    <P>With regard to the guiding principle I would imply in my regulations, I can, first of all, say the regulations will fall under three main heads.  There will be Minister's Orders.  They are applied generally.  There will be inspector notices which will apply to individual cases.  Naturally the inspectors will have regard to the requirements in these individual places when they make the orders.  Thirdly, there will be owners' rules which, of course, must necessarily apply again on a more <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  In regard to owners rules, Senator Dooge suggested there might be some system of providing for fines to be imposed by managers for breaches of regulation by their workers.  I discussed that with the Mines and Quarries Association and I expressed some doubt as to the constitutionality of such a provision in the Bill.  We have all of us fairly recent recollection of another Bill being declared unconstitutional in giving the Law Council power to impose certain penalties on members of the Incorporated Law Society.  I doubt if it will be possible to enact such a provision in this Bill without danger of its being challenged on a constitutional basis.  Nevertheless, I do not think there is any thing to prevent a mining engineer and the trade union representing the workers in the mines evolving a system whereby some system of fining could be imposed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> Another point made by Senator Dooge referred to the height to be required in regulations for access roads.  I agree with what he said about many of our mines in this country.  They operate on a marginal basis and it might be unrealistic to require that an access road shall be of a certain minimum height, say, 5 ft. 6 ins. when a seam might be only one-fifth of that measurement.  Nevertheless, this is a regulation that will be applied in a realistic way and having full regard to the problems facing individual mining owners.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien referred to the fact that special regulations would not be required to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas before they became applicable.  General regulations will, of course, but I can assure the Senator if he consults the Second Schedule of the Bill, he will see that before such regulations are made they have to be published in advance and the objections will have to be taken account of. These objections which are made will be taken account of, even to the extent of having inquiries set up.  I believe by the time such regulations ultimately become effective, they will be generally acceptable.  There will be the necessity to hear objections from the parties interested and there will be the possibility of having special inquiries made into the making of these regulations.</P>
    <P>With regard to prior consultation with the engineers, which was mentioned by Senator Quinlan, we did not in fact consult with the engineers' body, as such, but we did have consultation with the Mines and Quarries Association of Ireland which, I thought, was the more appropriate body for consultations of this sort. The Senator also referred to the provision whereby the Minister will nominate the chairman and eight members of the Advisory Council.  He suggested engineers' associations and others should have the power to nominate one or two members to the Council.  I am not making any specific reference to any organisation in this matter but it has been my experience, <Col N="1120" /> when organisations like this have power of nomination, they invariably nominate the President as the chairman for the time being.  He might not be the best man for the job in all these cases.  It is difficult for these people to nominate other than the President and in fact it is invariably done.  It is better that the Minister should have a free hand in this respect.</P>
    <P>I expect any Minister&mdash;I certainly will&mdash;will have prior consultation with appropriate bodies before he nominates anybody, first of all, to ensure that he gets the best man and secondly, to preserve the right of the Minister in this respect.  I have very strong views, in a business like this, on having members nominated by outside authorities. We usually get some convention that really is not as effective as one would want it to be.</P>
    <P>I think these are the main points that have been raised.  There was one other point about there not being a right of appeal against the inspector's notice in all cases.  There will, of course, have to be provision for quick action by inspectors in the case where an immediate danger is apparent to the inspector, that is, an immediate danger arising, which might cause an injury to life or limb.  I think, in such cases, the inspectors might be expected to act reasonably.  It is only right, whoever is required to do a certain act in order to obviate an imminent danger of that nature, that there should not be a right of appeal which might perhaps be so long delayed as to give rise to danger happening in the meantime.  However, these and other points, which I may not have covered specifically and fully, can be raised again on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate that Orders in respect of apprehension of immediate danger under section 131 should not be subject to appeal but is the Minister satisfied that in all other cases there is an appeal against an inspector's order?</P>

      <P>I cannot say there is an appeal in all other cases.  There will be an appeal in all other cases where the requirements that he will seek go beyond what is provided for in the Act. <Col N="1121" /> In other words, if a mine owner or manager feels the notice or the order of the inspector is not in accordance with the Act, he has the right to appeal, so I take it that would cover most cases in which the manager would be aggrieved.</P>

      <P>Before the discussion is resumed, might I express the hope that, while not wishing to restrict the debate, Senators will aim at trying to finish these motions tonight, as it may not be feasible in the near future to continue the debate?</P>
      <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann would welcome a statement from the Minister for Education on post-primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When last this motion was before the House, I had indicated that I had almost finished.  I have noted what the Leader of the House has said and I shall keep it in mind.  That does not mean that Senators who have not yet spoken should not express their views.  I shall be very brief.  On the last occasion the motion got a reasonable amount of discussion and attention.  We know the problem that exists.  The motion is pretty clear even if it does not go into the problem to the extent to which we are now discussing it but it has drawn a good deal of attention to the problem and I suppose that is as much as one can expect a motion to do.  I am glad that Senator Quinlan introduced it and whether it can be concluded tonight or <Col N="1122" /> not is not a matter for me.</P>
      <P>This is a national problem not only here but in other countries.  Everybody who desires a better standard of education should have facilities available to him but there is no denying that such facilities are very limited.  Many boys and girls find themselves handicapped at the beginning on acount of finance. The number of scholarships is limited and so are other facilities, with the result that youth have not the opportunity in all cases of making the grade and achieving all that their brains are capable of achieving.  It is a question of money at all time.</P>
      <P>The Minister is naturally very interested in trying to provide all possible facilities.  Vocational education appears to be making immense headway but there, also, there are limitations and obstacles in the way of boys and girls with ambition because the major problem is really financial.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party set out their policy almost two years ago and we are glad to find that since then it appears portions of that very extensive policy have been implemented and are being noted. It could be said that that would happen in any case and it is only a small portion of our policy.  One important thing we stood for is the desirability of students capable of benefiting from university or higher technological education having an opportunity of entering such a course even when they are not able to go through the normal channels of entry.  It is difficult for a worker who has entered employment at an early age to assess his capacity to undertake a course of higher education and particularly difficult if the course in which he is interested is only remotely related to his actual occupation. We therefore suggested that for persons in employment, introductory evening courses should be provided at universities and colleges of Technology which would qualify such students for entry to the higher educational course. In addition, the possibility of making available State guaranteed loans to enable such people to undertake higher studies should be given favourable consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, from his experience throughout the country, knows the progress vocational education is <Col N="1123" /> making and he knows the huge numbers that are anxious to avail of it. We learned something of that last week when the Minister was down in Cork and could see the huge numbers taking the courses there and making immense headway.  That is only one example of the anxiety that there is on the part of the youth of the country to pursue that facet of education.  There are other facets also which are very important.</P>
    <P>Those, briefly, are my comments on the motions before the House.  I realise that there are other Senators who are anxious to contribute to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to know people who are vocational teachers and they tell me that quite a number of children who come to them are practically illiterate.  The reason that they give for that state of affairs is that the classes in the primary schools are so overcrowded that it is as much as the teachers can do to keep the children in order.  The solution seems to be to have more teachers and, I suppose, that means having more schools also.  I am speaking of Dublin city.  I happen to have first-hand knowledge of the position there.  Many of the children who attend school up to 14 years of age are practically illiterate.  I wondered how that could be and the information that I have got is that it is due to overcrowded classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing together two motions, one of which calls for greater financial assistance for secondary education and the other of which asks for a statement from the Minister for Education on post-primary education.  The second motion is framed in such a way as not to be a motion of censure and I think we may take it that neither of the motions we are discussing this evening is to be taken as a motion of censure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the first, the request for more money for secondary education, I think we would be all in agreement. The different kinds of education we have here&mdash;primary, secondary and vocational, together with the new comprehensive <Col N="1124" /> schools which the Minister has told us a little&mdash;very little&mdash;about on the last occasion, have all different origins in history and all work in a different way and all work from the point of view of the Government with different types of grants, different types of teachers, different training and different remuneration.  The secondary schools are all privately-owned, either by religious orders or by lay people, both Catholic and Protestant.  In the present circumstances, with an immense increase for several years past in the number of pupils going to secondary schools, both boys and girls, the question of building has become acute; the question of accommodation to which Senator Boland has just alluded in the primary schools is also becoming acute in the secondary schools, and it is fair to say that it is not possible for the present owners of secondary schools to put up suitable buildings in modern conditions and for modern purposes, particularly for scientific purposes.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister has brought out a scheme to give grants for buildings. These grants are confined to schools of over 150 pupils and I am not sure that the Minister is absolutely right in that.  It has been put here by Senator Ross that that is unfair to certain types of Protestant schools because there are a great many of them which have less than 150 pupils.  I think there is a substantial number of Catholic schools too which have less than 150 pupils.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech on the last occasion when we discussed this matter, 16th December, stated that if you had small schools you would not be giving justice to all our children.  I wonder whether the Minister might not think that question out again, whether the small school is by definition not a good school and the big school is by definition the school we want.  I do not think that that is so.  The Minister looks a bit puzzled so perhaps I can tell him exactly what he said.  He said:</P>
    <P>This suggestion made here of maintaining the small school and at the same time cherishing all our children equally is a contradiction.  A small school with a small number of pupils can only have a limited <Col N="1125" /> staff and perhaps five or six subjects.</P>
    <P>That is in the Official Report of 16th December, column 167.</P>
    <P>I think a small school can have a great many merits and I am not sure but that a very big school can have substantial demerits.  The Head of a very big school, for example, has a very big staff of teachers.  It takes him all his time to know the teachers and he gets to know very little at all about the pupils, whereas in the case of the small school the Head of the school knows both the pupils and the teachers.  I know, of course, that if you want to make provision for science in a girls' school or in a school of 150 pupils you may have difficulties in hiring a teacher but, again, new situations can be met by new methods.  I am not so sure that you have to stick entirely to the notion that one teacher should teach in one school.  You might have a town in which you would have a science teacher teaching in two or three schools.  I just want to enter the denial that the big school is the better type of school in all circumstances and gives better education to the children.  I do not think it does.</P>
    <P>However, one of the features of the secondary schools is that the Act of 1878, the British Act, has been used by clerics and lay people in Ireland for a purpose which I think its authors, the British Parliament, never intended it.  I think great credit is due to the people who worked it and did such good work for religion and Ireland in those schools and they should be rescued now from the impossible situation in which they find themselves with regard to school buildings.</P>
    <P>With reference to the other motion asking for a statement on post-primary education, the Minister made a speech on the last occasion here in which he stated a number of principles with which we would be all in agreement, but he gave us very little information as to what precisely he intends to do about these comprehensive schools.  I know they cannot leap fully equipped from the Minister's head, that the principles have to be agreed on.  There was an announcement about 18 months ago <Col N="1126" /> and while the theory may be sound, the way the schools are going to work is all-important.  I have a number of questions to put to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, I should like to agree with some of what Senator Boland said.  It is an exaggeration to say that a substantial number of children leave the primary schools at 14 years illiterate.  &ldquo;Illiterate&rdquo; is a word that comes trippingly from the tongue of a great many critics of Ministers for Education and of primary schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;practically illiterate&rdquo;.  I qualified it to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Some are not as good as one would expect them to be but, as the Senator says, the work being done in the primary schools is wonderful. Whatever is to be done about secondary education, whatever grants are given for building, whatever provision is made for post-primary education, for secondary or comprehensive schools, if it is not based on a sound primary education it will all be a waste of money.  To that extent Senator Boland made an excellent point.</P>
      <P>In the city of Dublin, as I am aware, having grandchildren, the classes are enormous.  It is a mystery to me how any primary teacher succeeds in getting anything at all into the heads of 50 children, and sometimes 60 or 70, in the one class.  Steps are being taken to remedy that, taken rather slowly, and until we can remedy that situation and provide a better basis for post-primary education by giving the primary teachers a chance to do their work efficiently, in proper surroundings and with smaller numbers in the classes, we can have no hope for our post-primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not certain that I know what the Minister intends by a comprehensive school.  Presumably he intends that it will be a school that will combine two types of education and one type would be, for want of a better word, academic such as is thought to be at present pursued in the ordinary secondary school; the other would be technical, practical, scientific&mdash;I am not sure what the correct word is.  The Minister himself talked about training of hand and eye.  I am not so sure that <Col N="1127" /> that is entirely a matter for post-primary education.  These two types of education, academic and technical, overlap to some extent and they are not necessarily opposed.  It is not proposed to avail of the present secondary schools and to give them money and buildings to pursue another type of education besides the one they are at present engaged in.  It is intended in certain places to set up completely new schools, but what kind will they be?  They will presumably be built at the expense of the Government.  Will they be controlled by the Department of Education, for example?  If they are controlled by the Department of Education they will be a genuine innovation because there is no such thing now as a school entirely controlled or managed by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Who will appoint the staff for these schools?  What qualifications will the staff have?  Who will set out the programmes? What consultations will there be with anybody or with whom will there be consultations?  Will the schools be, as the vocational schools are, co-educational?  Will they cater for boys and girls together or will these girls be educated separately as in nearly all Catholic secondary schools?</P>
    <P>I do not know the answer to all these things but it seems to me we may be falling into one error which it is easy to fall into when we begin to talk, as so many people are talking now, about equipping ourselves and equipping our youth for the atomic age.  It is said we must adapt ourselves to this new age of scientific discovery. However, in this atomic age, as we call it, we must not turn our backs on things for which we have always had regard, the things of the spirit, for religion&mdash;I do not suggest anybody is going to do that&mdash;for literature, philosophy and history, for example. Whatever kind of an age we live in and however important science may have become, we still need men and women who will have the power to think, to compare things and to judge, and above all to be able to make enjoyment for themselves, to use their <Col N="1128" /> leisure without being bored with themselves and with one another.</P>
    <P>There is more than merely the problem of production, the problem of work or automation; there is also the problem of leisure, we must have a system of education, particularly post-primary education, which will equip people, insofar as education can equip them, for the use of leisure. If one is confined to a scientific education, it is a very incomplete preparation for life.  It is an incomplete preparation for modern life and an incomplete preparation for the kind of life that is being predicted for us, no matter how scientific that life becomes. As we advance into this age of scientific discovery, education for leisure is becoming more important than ever.  For that reason, in the development of educational plans there should be no such thing as turning our backs upon the kind of school disciplines that we have heretofore found so important.</P>
    <P>It is said for example, that children will be divided into two streams.  I am not quite clear as to what that means precisely.  Who will divide them?  What process will be used?  Presumably there will be teachers to divide them.  Will those teachers get any particular training or particular equipment to enable them to make that distinction?  Will it be done by examination and what kind will the examination be, because examinations can be deceptive at particular ages for showing one where children ought to go?  Our neighbours in Britain, for example, believed that the 11-plus examination was a wonderful thing, that it would enable them to divert people into proper streams of education.  I think they are recovering from that view and they do not take it at all now.  If there is to be division, one would hope it will not be of a social type and that those who make that division will be competent to do it and will get some kind of special training to enable them to do it.</P>
    <P>That brings me to this point which I think the Minister must consider in the circumstances of making better provision for post-primary education.  He will have to consider not only comprehensive schools but a comprehensive <Col N="1129" /> teaching profession.  I know what the Minister is thinking, that that is a hard one I am putting to him.  I know it is hard but it will have to be faced. Although we agree this motion does not refer to universities at all, let me point out that the teaching profession is now in three water-tight compartments, with three sets of teachers, three different types of training, three different types of qualifications, three different masters and three different sets of salaries, therefore, three different sets of arbitration, and three different kinds of deputations going to see the Minister for Education, with three separate and distinct problems for the Minister involving status and goodness knows what else.</P>
    <P>I know there are historical reasons for all that, but it seems to me that once you enter upon spending a great deal of money on post-primary education and the evolving of a new type of school, you ought to go into the question of a comprehensive teaching body. Some of the primary teachers, for example, upon whose work, as I said, all progress will depend in the end, are trained in special colleges under what some of them and some other people consider are out-of-date conditions, under restraints, for example, university students do not suffer at the same age.  The secondary teachers have to do a university course and a Higher Diploma in Education.  The vocational teachers mostly do a university course, but some have special equipment with a diploma.  It seems to me that these teachers should be interchangeable or, at any rate, interchange should be facilitated.  A great many primary teachers avail themselves of university courses in the evening and get degrees, quite a number of them good degrees, higher degrees and doctorates.</P>

      <P>It is true they do get MAs.  I have myself examined a number of them.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are.  They are not all to be found in the book&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but by the goodwill of the professors they are available.  I think they should be more available, if that is what the Senator wants me to say.  Actually some primary teachers, after doing evening courses and getting MAs have become professors in the university itself. Academically, I suppose that is as much as one could expect.  The primary teachers at present do a two-year course in a training college.  There is talk of their having to do a three-year course in future.  If they have to do a three-year course, it should surely be a university course.  I think that is where the Minister will get the teachers he wants for these new schools.</P>
      <P>There should perhaps be liaison established between training colleges and universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in planning new schools without taking thought of how you will staff them.  I am not sure that you can get staffs for the new comprehensive schools because, and this is particularly true in the case of men graduates, it is very difficult to get them to take up teaching, naturally enough in the light of the salaries, and even in the light of the improved salaries.  If the comprehensive schools are designed to make special provision for the modern world&mdash;that is, mathematics and science&mdash;mathematics and science teachers in secondary schools are fairly scarce as it is.  I think, on one occasion, the Department took five years to get an inspector of mathematics; when they did get him, he considered the post and, in the end, he refused it.  I lost touch with the matter after that.  I do not know what happened. It is very difficult to get these teachers and I do not know where the <Col N="1131" /> Minister proposes to get them.</P>
    <P>There is then the question as to where these schools will be sited and whether they will have any influence on the secondary and vocational schools in their own areas.  There may be special areas and that may involve transport.  So far as my recollection goes only one has been mentioned, Cootehill in Cavan.  I am not sure why it has been selected, if it has been selected.  There is no pressure of population. There is already a lay secondary school and a vocational school, controlled as usual by the local body. There are other districts in Cavan, such as Arva, Ballyconnell, Killeshandra, and other places, where there is no secondary school and no vocational school, and there is no proposal for a comprehensive school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what effect these new schools will have on existing post-primary facilities.  Another thing that strikes me from my own experience, going back a long time to when the British were here, is that if these schools are going to be controlled by the Department they will be favoured.  Every civil servant and every Department that put up anything favour their own creation.  The vocational schools, for example, are better buildings than the primary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but the vocational schools at the time the Act was passed in 1930 were better.  Even now they are better in many cases than the nearby primary schools.  I know the new primary schools are good schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>My thesis remains unchallenged.  If the Department controls they will build better schools than <Col N="1132" /> anybody else has.  The British Department of Agriculture, for example, built the College of Science which is now occupied by University College.  They built that for training vocational teachers and they gave a niggardly grant for a university college.  However, I hope that I am right about the future. The Minister has also decided to give grants in secondary schools for visual methods and for new methods of teaching both science and modern languages.  I understand that the course in physics and a certain course in mathematics have been very successful on television.  The course in physics has been particularly successful.  It is proposed&mdash;I suppose it is&mdash;that these new comprehensive schools will have these advantages as well?</P>
      <P>I should like to conclude by hoping that, when the Minister speaks tonight, he will be able to give us more precise information than he gave us on the last occasion.  We are all agreed with certain principles which the Minister has laid down.  No one wants to stand in the way of educational development. But the path should be clear, the obstacles should be seen and should be capable of being surmounted.  We should like information not so that we can be more critical but in order that we can be more helpful, because education concerns us all and it is something about which we should all be helpful.  I think the notion of a comprehensive school, properly understood and properly run, is something which could do great good but, so far, we have been left very much in the dark as to where these schools will be sited, as to how they will be manned and as to how they will be managed.  I hope the Minister will give us more information on that this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also hope that, when he is considering this question of comprehensive schools, he will take a good hard look at the whole teaching profession, at the curious way in which it is simultaneously mixed and separated&mdash;that is something of a contradiction, but it is nevertheless true that it is mixed to some extent&mdash;at the way in which they are kept in watertight compartments and do not go in, one type with the other.  The advent of these comprehensive <Col N="1133" /> schools will mean, that you will have to have an inquiry into the question of teachers and you will have to ensure that the primary teachers and their functions are not injured by the advent of new schools.  I hope the primary teachers will get what I think they ought to get, a university education and an opportunity of mixing with other young people going for other professions, because teaching is surely a profession.  I would not think primary teaching any less a profession than any other part of teaching.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say.  I hope, when the Minister speaks tonight, he will give us some clear information on the whole matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said so much in Irish that there is not much left for me to say in English.  We are all behind the idea <Col N="1135" /> that post-primary education should be made available to the young people of this country to the extent that our resources can afford.  But, as other speakers have said, the question of increased expenditure arises, and we cannot afford to go too fast.  Over the years we have made great strides in post-primary education, especially for the past ten years.  The amount being spent on post-primary education&mdash;if that is to be taken as a criterion of our advancement&mdash;is almost twice as much now as was spent ten years ago.  I have not the figures at present&mdash;I daresay the Minister has them&mdash;but I think I would not be far wrong in saying we are providing almost twice as much now for post-primary education as we did ten years ago.</P>
    <P>I remember, when we used to discuss the question of secondary education 20 or 30 years ago and the number of pupils who used to go from the primary school to the secondary school, we used to say that the ratio was one in ten&mdash;that one in ten went from the primary school to the secondary school. Now the ratio is much greater.  I suppose the Minister could supply figures to prove that more and more young people in the country are availing themselves of secondary educational facilities.  There is no doubt but that the young people at present are more aware of the benefits to be derived from secondary education than the young people who went before them.</P>
    <P>I listened to the very valuable contribution the Minister made to this debate.  I fully subscribe to the principle he enunciated on that occasion that it should be our duty as far as possible to make post-primary education available for all the young people of this country who require it. That is a principle we all stand behind and a principle to which we all subscribe. As I said, we have to take into account the question of having to provide the wherewithal for that purpose. I must say that, like Senator Hayes, I should like to hear more about these comprehensive schools. Some of the other speakers have referred to them but the idea behind these schools requires some more <Col N="1136" /> clarification.  I take it that they will be mostly in rural Ireland, especially where there is a sparse population and where there will be a school to cater for secondary education and for vocational education at the same time.</P>
    <P>These schools to some extent will break down the barriers that existed between rich children and poor children. As a result of the establishment of these schools, it will be possible to enable vocational pupils to rise to higher levels of education analagous to, say, what is available for secondary pupils who have an opportunity of going to the university.  Through these comprehensive schools, the poorer children who cannot avail themselves of a secondary education can now go on to higher levels of education.  They can go to these regional technological schools which are to be set up and in some cases to the university.</P>
    <P>More and more of our young people can now avail themselves of secondary education and to a certain extent that is due to the policy of the Minister because it was he who brought in the Scholarships (Amendment) Act of 1961 as a result of which more and more people who could not do so before can now go to secondary schools.  If there is any recommendation that I would make it is that that scholarship scheme should be extended still further, and again, that is a matter of finance more than anything else.  We are all behind the idea that as many of our young people as possible should get a secondary education.  We subscribe to the Minister's policy which is to make post-primary education available to every young person, irrespective of means, class, or creed.  The day may come when we may achieve that.</P>
    <P>Ní mian liom mórán eile a rá ar an dá thairiscint seo.  Táim sásta go bhfuilimid ag dul ar aghaidh go maith le h-iar-oideachas le roinnt blianta anuas.

      <P>I should like to say how glad I am that these motions have given us an opportunity to debate the question of post-primary education. I should like also to say how grateful I am to the Minister for the statement he made before Christmas on this matter.  I have been concerned with the management of secondary schools for about 30 years and I can remember the very depressing situation, when, I suppose, the Minister was a schoolboy.  At the time we had deputations of governors to various Ministers for Education and even to the Taoiseach, always being received very courteously and listened to with great sympathy but in the end with nothing being done.  I am sure there were very strong reasons preventing steps being taken at the time but it makes me all the more pleased and hopeful that in recent years the position seems to have changed.  In particular we have the present Minister encouraging an active and dynamic outlook on the whole question of education, particularly post-primary education. I am quite sure that every governor, teacher and parent is grateful to him for this.  This question has been discussed very widely by all the Senators who have spoken both on the previous day and this evening and I agree with the Minister that if we were to debate the question of post-primary education fully we would be here for a very long time indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer only to a few of the points that have been made, perhaps, with somewhat different emphasis.  First of all, from the point of view of the children, who are the objects of all this, the Minister stated a principle to which none of us can take exception that all children should have the opportunity of post-primary education consistent with their ability. That is a very excellent principle and I would not dilute it with the further qualification which Senator Ó Ciosáin suggested&mdash;&ldquo;consistent with the resources of the country.&rdquo;  We all know we cannot spend more than we have but <Col N="1138" /> when we are considering whether we can afford a better standard of post-primary education or not, we have to consider can we afford not to have it. There are certain circumstances in which an apparent extravagence is wiser than an apparent economy.  It must be, of course, in relation to the ability of the pupil to take advantage of the education.  The question at once arises, how are we going to decide which pupils are in this position? There has been a great increase in the number of pupils in various kinds of post-primary schools.  Senator Ó Ciosáin raised this point and said that the ratio had improved from a figure of one child in secondary schools per ten in the primary schools.  The figure, according to the information in <i>Facts about Ireland</i> for the number of children in primary schools is about 428,000 for the year 1960-61; In secondary schools, 76,843 and if you add in them the vocational schools there were 37,228 attending day courses and 54,849 in evening courses. That means that of the round figure of half a million in the primary schools 170,000 had some form of post-primary education.</P>
    <P>This is a figure of one in three of primary school children which, I think, is extremely creditable and most encouraging. Obviously, of course, it is ever so much better than the figure of one in ten mentioned by Senator Ó Ciosáin.  This posses the question of how we are to select, from the half million pupils attending primary schools, even one in three who can go on and take advantage of further education.  I submit that this is a question which should not be decided at this stage by an examination.  As Senator Hayes has said, the eleven plus experience in England has shown that an examination is a very poor guide about the further activities of a child at this point.  I think the best guidance is obtained from the teachers. It is here that we must remember that the whole result of our effort in education at any level&mdash;we are talking about post-primary education and, therefore, we must talk about that level in particular&mdash;depends on the quality and enthusiasm of the teacher. <Col N="1139" /> I have to serve on an admissions board in the university for students coming on from secondary schools.</P>
    <P>We always look at the examinations they have passed, but we pay a great deal of attention to the reports from their teachers.  We know that there are some teachers who are more reliable than others but, by and large, their report is the factor that very often decides whether or not a student will be admitted.  When you are relying on men and women to such an extent as that, these people must be adequately rewarded so that we can get the kind of person in whose reports we will have confidence, who has taken a sufficient interest in the children to make sure that he is able to give a report in the first instance and then has the courage to do it and to say that a child is not adequately equipped to come to a university when, in fact, it may be the dearest wish of that child's parents that he should go. That kind of character is required in the teachers and we cannot get it unless we pay them properly and give them proper conditions.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the teachers.  I must say I was very encouraged, indeed, to read the improvement which had occurred recently in the teachers salaries and I congratulate the Minister on the decision in this regard.  I do not think that, even with that, they are being overpaid.  I think that, particularly in the case of the secondary schools, you expect a standard of service from the teachers which is very often equivalent to that which university teachers are expected to provide. I think that if I were given the choice between running a department in a university and a fair sized secondary school and were asked which I would think took the greater amount of responsibility, I would consider that the headmaster of a secondary school is probably equivalent to a Chair in the university and should not be paid on a very different basis.</P>
    <P>We know that the secondary teaching profession and the students owe a lot to the celebate Orders that have given such excellent teaching service here.  I know that in many day schools <Col N="1140" /> there are teachers who are bachelors not for any religious reason but because they do not really feel they can afford to establish a household.  I feel quite strongly that the question of payment to teachers, even though it has been looked at very favourably recently, should not be allowed to remain there.  It is not only a question of payment: there are the whole conditions of service.  It is too often the case that a secondary teacher, who has got his Higher Diploma in Education teaching, say, a language or a subject like geography in a secondary school to the Intermediate or Leaving Certificate levels, is allowed to continue to cover the same course mechanically year after year and with minor changes in the books that may be set, until it becomes an entirely mechanical matter. Everyone who has taught knows that when it gets to that stage the inspiration has gone and it cannot be passed on to the student because it is not there any longer in the mind of the teacher.</P>
    <P>Recently, we have seen the Minister's encouragement to teachers in mathematics to have another look at the way in which mathematics could be taught. One of these teachers said to me at the beginning of such a course: &ldquo;I am attending a course to make teachers of mathematics out of teachers of mathematics.&rdquo; At the end of that course, I think he had a very different view of the purpose of that course and he was very anxious to attend further sessions of the same course.  Why should that be limited to mathematics?  I think we should envisage such courses all the time particularly in science and encourage science teachers to bring the newer developments to the attention of their students, and, if necessary, provide them with what might appear to be very expensive items of equipment for this purpose.  Such items, although they might appear very unusual to-day, are routine tomorrow.  If the Minister were to provide even a selected number of such pieces of equipment which could be demonstrated to the students &mdash;electronic counting apparatus, and so on&mdash;it would help to enliven the rather dreary routine which secondary teaching, as I know from experience, can be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> Language teachers should be encouraged to take journeys abroad.  I do not think this is done nearly enough and I would say the same for almost every other kind of teacher.  We should, in fact, make sure that they become educated rather than just grinders.</P>
    <P>The next question is the method by which secondary schools discharge their functions.  This has been criticised in the debate before.  Senator Stanford mentioned an instance where they had been able to correct the not very sound method that was being used.  Senator Ross has referred to the learning of things by heart.  The method by which a student or a pupil is educated is as important, perhaps more important, as the amount of knowledge that he acquires.  I heard a definition of an educated man when I was a student which I have never forgotten.  The educated man, it was said, is a man who knows when a thing is proved.  In other words, he can put together a certain amount of information and make up his own mind on when a decision can be reached.  This is not a question of the store of knowledge that he has acquired and which he has always in his mind.  It goes much deeper than that.  It does not mean that he must be scientifically educated because almost any branch of learning can, if properly used, be made to turn out a person of that calibre.  I agree with Senator Hayes when he said that scientific education is not the only thing needed to equip one for life. Maybe it is not.  I do not think any one kind of education is the only kind needed to equip one for life.  I do not think education in a language with no attention to science in this day and age equips one adequately for life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>What he said was that scientific education was not the best equipment for life.  I say that no special education in itself could be made out to be the best equipment.  I suggest, however, that if a scientific education is properly presented, with a historical background to the various questions like chemistry, biology and so <Col N="1142" /> forth, one can be brought right back through the classics to the customs of ancient China and one can get a very sound humanistic background for scientific teaching.  The Minister said in the opening sentence of section 9 of the White Paper on the Irish language:</P>
      <P>Independence of mind and strength of character depend basically on moral training and on education in the widest sense.</P>
      <P>That is something that should be written in large letters, preferably gold, and put in a frame on the wall of every school.  It is a challenge to the teacher that that is the kind of pupil he is supposed to turn out.  Of course, he must be the kind of teacher who can take up that challenge.</P>
      <P>We know that the curriculum is prescribed very largely by the Department and I know that in some cases it has remained unchanged over quite a long time.  I am pleading for a more liberal outlook in the design of the curriculum in the various subjects, with particular reference to the sentence I have quoted from the White Paper on the Irish language.</P>
      <P>May I refer to our experience in medical education?  It is not strictly on the post-primary level but as an extension of post-primary education it might be regarded as relevant.  I shall give an illustration to indicate to the Minister, what he knows very well because he has submitted to the same curriculum, how much can be done by liberalising the curriculum.  In 1858, the General Medical Council was instituted in Great Britain&mdash;it had jurisdiction here at that time&mdash;and a series of regulations&mdash;they called them recommendations &mdash; were drawn up giving the opinion of the council as to how the medical student should be educated.  It set out everything from A to Z, the number of hours, and the stages of the course at which the several subjects should be taught.  This put the teaching of medicine into a straitjacket for a hundred years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medical education became a dreary thing.  Nobody was interested in it from the educational viewpoint. Teachers merely vied with each other about the number of facts they could <Col N="1143" /> get into the students' mind.  But in 1957 the same council, now in conjunction with the Irish Medical Registration Council, decided to liberalise the curriculum, not defining the number of hours for the different subjects, but indicating just what subjects should be taught and giving some guidance as to the relative importance of these subjects but leaving it to the individual schools to carry out the programme. The result was an immediate increase in interest in the business of medical education.  An association for the study of medical education was established in Great Britain, another in America.  Journals devoted to the medical curriculum and to medical education came into being and there is now a very lively interest in it and competition between the schools as to which can have the most up to date curriculum.  I mention this to indicate what can be done to stimulate enthusiasm by giving a bit more freedom to the schools in the choice of the way they will teach a subject.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, it is not possible to go as far in secondary education as in the university but we could go a lot further than we are going at present, in particular in the way in which the sciences are taught.  Senator Ross referred to the teaching of biology.  He said it was being taught now up to intermediate level.  This is almost a disgrace.  This basic science which is as much a humanity as a science should be taught up to the leaving certificate level and if it were it would add very much to the value of the secondary school curriculum.</P>
    <P>On the question of the facilities available for post-primary education, I must agree with those who said the school buildings and other general facilities are in great need of improvement. A comparison has been drawn between vocational schools and Senator Hayes and the Minister had an argument about that.  I sometimes look at the facilities in the vocational schools and compare them with the university facilities and I am very envious indeed. I do not grudge the vocational school a single building, a single item of equipment, but I hope they may set a <Col N="1144" /> headline in this not only for the secondary schools but also for the universities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the facilities in the science sections in particular, I should like a clear statement, certainly a clearer statement, from the Minister about the application of the new awards for capital expenditure.  I am still quite hazy about the conditions in which a school may qualify for these awards.  A minimum of 150 pupils has been mentioned and I know that in the other House an assurance was given that this minimum was not to be taken as bearing unjustly on the smaller schools.</P>
    <P>But among the smaller schools there is still a great deal of uneasiness about how this grant is to be used&mdash;if it will go to their larger competitors or whether they, too, are to qualify for it. Of course some smaller schools would necessarily have to suffer.  I realise we cannot expect the Government to make money available for very small schools which are clearly uneconomic because of their smallness.  Our answer to that is amalgamation.  I am one of the few here who has succeeded in bringing about the amalgamation of two schools. I shall remember it for as long as I live. I shall remember the sweat and blood it cost me.  It is an extremely difficult thing to get two schools to come together, to persuade one of them to sink its identity.  Questions of prestige have to be resolved.</P>
    <P>One thing that cropped up in that case&mdash;I suspect it will crop up very frequently in such cases in the future &mdash;was the question of cost.  If you bring the pupils of two schools and put them into one, the building must be larger.  It cost £15,000 to re-equip the building I was concerned with so that it would be capable of taking the pupils from the other school.  It would also solve the prestige question for the schools that were being dissolved, if they were able to say that there were so much better facilities in the new school than they could provide. This is really a face-saving matter but it might be very effective.  I put that suggestion to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with Senator <Col N="1145" /> Hayes about the comprehensive schools.  I have read the statement about the establishment of these schools and I felt this was a really good forward step.  I have read everything I can find about the intentions regarding them since, including the Minister's statement, and I still have not got a clear impression about what they are going to be.  The Minister mentioned, for instance &mdash; a very worthy point I think&mdash;that there would be a certain freedom of interchange between these comprehensive schools and other schools.  If a pupil were to find himself in a secondary school and did not want to go on to university level, he could then transfer to the comprehensive school, and it would even be a bridge to the vocational school.  This would be excellent.  I cannot see how this ties up with the age structure in the school.  I have been trying to work it out and if the Minister could tell me, I would be grateful.</P>
    <P>These are the points I want to make in the debate on this motion.  I am glad we had this opportunity and we are indebted to the Senators who put these two motions down.  I should like to support Senator Ross's plea that more money be made available than has recently been made available and I would appeal to the Minister to continue encouraging the dynamic approach which he has shown us during the last few years.  I feel confident he will so continue and I am certain if he does he will have the support of everyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I have to make reference to a statement here, by an ex-Minister, Senator Boland, in connection with children who leave national schools.  He said he was told by the vocational teachers that all the children leaving national schools were illiterate.  Subsequently, when challenged by Senator Hayes, he said he would qualify it by saying that practically all the children leaving national schools were illiterate.  I am in agreement with Senator Brosnahan that that statement cannot go unchallenged both in the national interest and in the interest of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is really a condemnation of the <Col N="1146" /> whole system of primary education because, if the Minister is spending on primary education and the children are leaving schools illiterate, then I say it is a condemnation of the Department and a slander.  It was a slander on the national teachers and of the inspectors of the country.  I should like to know from the Minister tonight whether he ever saw a report from inspectors stating that the children of the national schools were illiterate.  I think when a person like Senator Boland comes in here and makes such a sweeping statement, he should first get his facts right and, secondly, he should not involve any group of teachers.  He said the statements were made by the vocational teachers.  That was trying to create disharmony between the vocational teachers and the national teachers.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has decided to speak twice on this motion.  I have read his first statement and, as far as the comprehensive schools are concerned, he has in no way enlightened me except to say they should lead to some faculties in the universities and in technological colleges.  He said that &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; means a wide range of subjects to meet the aptitude of different children and that the schools would be available to all children.  He said the comprehensive schools would cater for a wide range of talent and would have a wide range of subjects which means a wide range of teachers.</P>
    <P>I hope, when the Minister gets his comprehensive schools going, we will not have the same problem today as we have in regard to teachers.  I, as Chairman of the Vocational Education Committee in Westmeath, have a problem in regard to teachers.  Many of our teachers are not fully qualified.  We require many more teachers and it is not possible to get them.  If many more teachers will be required, the Minister will have to try a system whereby teachers will be trained and ready to take up the new positions that will be offered to them.</P>
    <P>When the Minister first spoke of the comprehensive school, he led us to believe that they would cater for some backward places which have neither vocational nor secondary schools.  In <Col N="1147" /> his statement in the Dáil, he said that the comprehensive school would have a relatively large number of pupils&mdash; probably 225 or upwards.  If he thinks he will get 225 children and upwards in a backward area which has no vocational or secondary schools, I am afraid he will have to keep them as boarders and bring them from much wider distances than he has in mind.</P>
    <P>I see also that in Cootehill there has been a lot of talk and fears expressed about the secondary and vocational schools there.  In view of what the Minister said in the Dáil, that the comprehensive school would absorb the national school, I think there are good reasons for these fears.  It is a pity that everyone is so doubtful about the future plans of the Department of Education.  In my opinion, a national planning branch should be set up with experts to advise the Minister on what is really necessary and what is best for the country.</P>
    <P>We heard it stated on the previous occasion that the Minister seemed to be in difficulty as regards the managerial control of comprehensive schools.  That is another aspect of the case which has given rise to a great deal of thought and consideration about these comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>As regards scholarships, I should like to know if the Minister is satisfied that he was justified in reducing the age.  There are so many rural schools in this country to which children have to travel a long distance that I think it was unfair to reduce the age.  He said himself it was an attempt to eliminate cramming which, he described as educationally unsound.  My experience of what has happened since the age was reduced is that cramming has become a fine art.  It is now quite common to see children going home from school at 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening.</P>
    <P>The Department also gives travelling scholarships to children attending vocational schools.  I suggest they should do likewise for children travelling long distances to secondary schools.  No such provision is made for <Col N="1148" /> these children.  They are not subsidised in any way by the Department.  I would also like the Minister to clarify the position as regards technological colleges.  I notice Cork Vocational Committee purchased a site for £17,000 and it was stated in the public press that the school would probably cost £1,500,000.  We have also purchased a site in Athlone.  Athlone has been named as one of the areas in which there will be a technological college.  We would like to know where we go from there.  We should like to know if the Department will provide the funds to build, equip and staff these schools.  It is most important we should know that.  We should also get some indication as to when we will get the green light to go ahead with the technological colleges.</P>
    <P>One would imagine, from listening to previous speakers, that every child in the country was anxious to get a post-primary and higher education.  It is an extraordinary thing that this year in Westmeath, we gave two scholarships, valued at £185 each to Rings-end. There were 70 pupils who were qualified.  Number one and two did not turn up, numbers three and four were offered the scholarship and did not take it and it was not until we reached the seventh person that one of the scholarships was taken.  That was a most extraordinary situation.  We were giving scholarships to people at the top and they refused to take them.  The best of them refused to take the scholarships.  There is one scholarship going abegging at the moment: there is nobody to take it.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the Minister has done a very good job since he came to the Department.  He certainly has improved school buildings.  He has made funds available for scholarships and he has made increased capitation grants available.  He has not made the position clear as regards comprehensive schools and the technological colleges. I have not yet met one person who could give me a clear idea of what the Minister has in mind as regards comprehensive schools.  We got a slight shock in Westmeath a few evenings ago, when the question of scheduled accommodation for boys and girls at <Col N="1149" /> technological colleges in Athlone was discussed at the committee meeting.  As a result of what was said there, it was decided to defer consideration of the matter to give the Minister an opportunity of making a comprehensive statement and letting us know what he proposes to do for post-primary education, particularly as regards the change in age at which children will be allowed to enter these colleges.  The CEO informed us his schedule was based on a plus-12.</P>
    <P>Last year, when I met the Minister, with the General Council of County Councils, on a deputation, someone discussed the 11-plus with him.  I have no doubt in my mind that the Minister would not have anything at all to do with the 11-plus.  I wonder how did the plus-12 schedule come to be considered at all?  There were people on the committee who were really worried about it, who were worried about the future of the national schools.  They were worried, too, about the future of people in the national schools in relation to scholarships.  My idea is that the vocational schools are not catered for in the matter of scholarships.</P>
    <P>With regard to scholarships to technological schools from the primary schools, I am sorry to say I have not known a single one person in my county who has been accepted for a vocational school.  Every one went to the secondary school; not one scholarship holder went to the vocational school.  The fact that the plus-12 was mentioned in the schedule of accommodation has certainly given us an amount to worry about and I would like to hear the Minister making some reference to this.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity for an open discussion on post-primary education in the presence of the Minister for Education.  It is an opportunity which comes all too seldom to this House.  It is a pity that when it does come, we are so restricted in time. The Leader of the House thought fit to appeal to Senators to be brief, but I consider this House is capable of providing a very valuable cross-section of opinion on the problems that have to <Col N="1150" /> be faced in the matter of post-primary education.</P>
      <P>I had hoped to speak on this debate when it arose in December last.  I am glad, in a way, I was not in on it at that stage because there have been certain events since which probably have nullified my attitude towards the Department.  There has been an easing of tension on two fronts since that time. It has been just an easing.  One is on the issue of salaries to secondary teachers. There is a sort of uneasy peace there.</P>
      <P>I should thank the Minister, in this connection, for the part he has played in bringing about this peace, such as it is.  At the same time, I should say that it is unfortunate it was not as readily acceptable as it might have been.  The secondary teachers and those associated with them, with some reluctance, decided in the interests of education and on other considerations, to accept the offer, although with grave reservations, because, unfortunately an important section of the teachers have been left out of consideration in the awards which have been given.  One is prompted to ask why this settlement was not arrived at last year when all the illwill which was engendered in the dispute of last year, and all the friction which was then involved could have been avoided.  Perhaps the Minister has an answer to this and perhaps those teachers who are now feeling very aggrieved will be encouraged by the statement made yesterday by the Minister in the Dáil that the present award was just a step in a further general policy of upgrading teachers and raising their status in the community.</P>
      <P>The other front on which there has been an easing of tension is that of the oral Irish test.  I am very glad the Minister has seen reason in this matter. That is an aspect of administration upon which I had intended to be voluble, had this settlement not been arrived at.  I think that only when the Minister discovered that no section of those interested in secondary education was willing to accept the plans he had proposed for the Irish examination did he agree to concede that the examination could not be adequately conducted without them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel I should not let this opportunity <Col N="1151" /> pass without paying tribute to the services rendered to the State by the voluntary schools, especially now that their status&mdash;if not their very existence&mdash;is being threatened by the new ministerial approach to post-primary education in general.  It is fitting that we should recall with gratitude the part they played in keeping the torch of learning aflame by providing educational facilities for every stratum of society down through the years.  As we know, they did this in a spirit of charity and self-sacrifice, and without concern for material reward, back in the days of foreign rule.  Even in our own time, and under our own State, they continued in the same spirit of dedication to place both their property and their services at the disposal of the State.</P>
    <P>Governments down through the years have gladly accepted the millions of pounds of capital investment represented in secondary school buildings all over the country as the basis on which to build a scheme of secondary education suited to the new conditions of the time.  In those circumstances, one might reasonably expect that a certain measure of generosity would be accorded to them in the subventions of the State, but, in fact, over the past 40 years or more, the State has been extremely niggardly in its treatment of those schools.  That is a fact which no one can gainsay, and it is widely recognised that it is solely through a lack of adequate subventions that secondary schools have been prevented from liberalising their courses and providing a wider range of subjects for their pupils.  Irrespective of the standards achieved&mdash;whether they have been satisfactory or otherwise&mdash;we should be guilty of the basest ingratitude if we were not to appreciate and recognise the contributions those schools have made to the maintenance of a high standard of education, a standard probably comparable with that in any country in the world.  I feel it is important to stress this point, now that a new scheme for the provision of post-primary education is being planned.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive school about <Col N="1152" /> which we heard so much in this debate is, indeed, casting its long shadow over the scene, and threatening to distort the image of the conventional secondary school.  The original concept of the comprehensive school, as promulgated by the Minister, was an exercise in social justice and made an immediate appeal.  Senators may recall that all the newspapers and other media of communication were vying with one another in applauding this new scheme, and applauding the young, energetic, forward-looking, up-and-coming Minister who would not be deterred by considerations of cost from making higher education available to all members of the community even in the most backward areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister laid down very detailed specifications.  No comprehensive school would be within ten miles of an existing post-primary school, secondary or vocational.  The curriculum would extend to 25 subjects, only three of which would be obligatory.  Transport would be provided and it was hoped the question of management could be arranged.  Then came a long silence, and questions on the matter only elicited the reply that the survey was not yet completed.  Finally, it transpired that the whole idea of social justice, which was the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the whole scheme, had been thrown overboard.  Comprehensive schools were to be established in areas already adequately provided with post-primary educational facilities, and at least three of the four selected were to be sited in areas where existing schools were to be displaced.</P>
    <P>Obviously, what happened was that the Minister's alleged enthusiasm for social justice outran his knowledge of the conditions.  In other words, he announced his plan without having made a sufficient preliminary research, even though in his statement to us here in December, he said that in most of the changes he had made, no research was necessary.  It seems to me this was one instance in which preliminary research was essential, and that preliminary research was not done.  When the Minister found the specifications originally laid down could not be met, when he found that no sites could be <Col N="1153" /> arranged which would fit in with the specifications he had laid down, he did not come forward and admit he had made a miscalculation.  To my mind, he should have said that in spite of that miscalculation he was prepared to go on and establish comprehensive schools wherever there was a demand.  This, I think, would have been the honest thing to do.  It would have been the statesmanlike thing to do.</P>
    <P>What did he do?  Nobody knows. For all we know, for all the public knows, he just threw sticking pins at a map of the Twenty-six counties and one landed on Cootehill, another on Glenties and so on.  He has given no reason that I know of for the selection of these sites for comprehensive schools but what is most amazing about it all is that he can so blandly shift his ground without any explanation to any responsible body as to why he has done so.  It is in this aspect of his administration that I see some danger because the next pin may land anywhere.  Every secondary school is now in danger of becoming redundant and, of course, in the long run, no voluntary school can live in competition with a comprehensive school because the Minister is in a position so to endow the comprehensive school and equip it with all modern aids and at the same time keep the voluntary school in comparative penury that competition is out of the question.  The introduction of a comprehensive scheme could be the beginning of a creeping and progressive socialisation of education.  It could even be the beginning of a trend to divert education from its proper ends and orientate it mainly towards subserving the economic programme of the State.  And there could be a tendency in it to subordinate the person to the citizen.</P>
    <P>How real are those dangers?  Personally, I am not very apprehensive.  I believe that we all still cherish the same fundamental values and that our concern for the material welfare of the people is still subordinate to the higher purposes of life.  But the Minister has done nothing to reassure us on this point.  Rather has he sown the seed of doubt among us.  He defends himself <Col N="1154" /> by saying that the problem is there and that it is up to someone to take the initiative and that someone must be the Minister for Education for the time being.  I agree that the someone should be the Minister for Education but that does not entitle him to present himself as one endowed with the charisma of rectitude and infallibility and to parade himself as Sir Oracle who alone can judge what is educationally best in any given circumstances.</P>
    <P>This involves the whole question of consultation and I propose to come back to that later, but before leaving the question of the comprehensive schools, I should like to ask the Minister whether he has at any time considered the feasibility of comprehensifying existing secondary or vocational schools.  This, of course, would involve the giving of such grants and the waiving of such restrictions as would enable an existing school to provide the full range of subjects as envisaged in the comprehensive school. It might even involve the amalgamation of two or more schools in a particular area but I think the idea has a lot to recommend it.  It would eliminate all the wastage due to the overlapping we have in various towns and hamlets throughout the country and it would be a question of building on a foundation already laid and availing of facilities already to hand.</P>
    <P>The only difficulty would be the question of management, and on this matter I should like a direct answer from the Minister.  Does the Minister regard it as of the essence of the comprehensive school that it be under public or semi-public management and control?  If the Minister is not agreeable to some adjustment in the terms of management to cover the possibility I have mentioned, then I shall have to ask myself whether he is not more concerned with ensuring that school management shall pass out of private hands than with the educational welfare of the children about whom he professes to be concerned in the neglected and remote areas.  I shall look forward with keen interest to the Minister's reply to that question.  If it is intended that comprehensive schools should proliferate all over the country, <Col N="1155" /> it is important that we know the Minister's mind on that point.</P>
    <P>One wonders if, having regard to all the circumstances of post-primary education in this country, it was necessary at any time to introduce a scheme of comprehensive education.  He did propagate the idea that the big school is so much better than the small school.  Senator Hayes has dealt with that problem and has raised doubts, I think, in the minds of most people as to whether the Minister is right or not. The idea of having larger schools depends on the distribution of population and personally I do not see, unless the Minister can inform us of some way of redistributing the population, how we can cater for post-primary education in rural areas other than through small schools.  At present, as we know, there are many people in secondary schools who should really be in technical or vocational schools. We have the position in which secondary schools are bursting at the seams and vocational schools still have capacity for many more pupils.</P>
    <P>The problem, I think, is to find a method of diverting some of the people who go to the secondary schools into vocational schools and, perhaps, extending both systems in such a way that provision will be made for all. There are two ways of approaching that.  One is the examination at a certain level to divide off the two streams. I am glad to say that that method has been discarded as it does not work well anywhere and I would not like to see anything like it introduced here.  The other way is to make one set of schools as attractive as the other.  Obviously, up to now it is the secondary school that has provided all the attraction and the attraction, if we examine the case, is based on three factors.  One is that up to now the secondary school has been leading somewhere; the vocational school has not.  A remedy has been proposed for this, that is, the introduction of the Intermediate examination common to both types of schools and the proposal to establish technological colleges leading to higher education.  That is a remedy in theory, but in practice I doubt if that will in <Col N="1156" /> itself withdraw many pupils from secondary schools to vocational schools because there are other factors.</P>
    <P>There is, secondly, the tradition of humanism that we have in our education in this country more than there has been elsewhere, due, I suppose, in a large measure to the lack of opportunity for technicians and technologists here and I wonder if in the present state of our economy we are even yet in a position to initiate any sort of major change in that direction.  If we go all out now to provide technicians, I am afraid it will be, for many years to come, for export.  Personally, I cannot see that there is room for a great increase in the number of technicians and the Minister, of course, has said in the OECD report that it does not worry him if a number of the technicians who are trained here are for export, that he is not going to distinguish between those who are trained for home use and for use abroad.  I think that is a very important factor to consider.</P>
    <P>The third attraction the secondary school has is the confidence that has grown up down the years in the clerical and religious management of the schools.  This is one aspect of the schools that it will be very difficult to overcome if the vocational school is to be made at all as attractive as the secondary school.  We have seen that the provision of attractive buildings has failed to do anything like that.  Certainly, in most cases the vocational schools provided have many more educational facilities of a physical kind. So that the Minister, I am afraid, will have to think up some way of creating these two streams on a voluntary basis by, as I say, making the vocational side as attractive and providing outlets for the products of the vocational schools such as are provided for the products of the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the question of the lack of consultation that has been a feature of the present Minister's administration.  There is really a litany of instances in which this lack of consultation has been evident down through the years.  Recently, one body concerned with secondary education has gone to the Press on the matter of <Col N="1157" /> establishing a permanent advisory council to which the Minister would submit any changes that he proposed to make before publicising them.  It has been the Minister's custom to publicise what he proposes to do, in the way of schemes, and then to come along and say that he has consulted when, in fact, the consultation has been done at the demand of the people concerned.  I need only mention one instance&mdash;they all follow the same pattern&mdash;the question of the introduction of the new mathematics course. The Minister could say that he did consult but what happened was that the bodies concerned with the introduction, I mean the teachers and the managers, all joined together and sought a deputation to the Minister. In other words, they had to take the initiative in having this consultation. Otherwise, there would have been no consultation.</P>
    <P>The same thing occurred in the case of the new oral Irish examination scheme which has now been abandoned but, had there been any body of people willing to row along with the Minister in that, I dare say it would not have been abandoned and, again, the Minister in that instance claimed that he had consultations.  As a matter of fact, in the White Paper on the revival of Irish that we had recently, it was stated that he was in consultation with all the interests concerned.  I think one of the interests concerned, and primarily concerned, in all these matters is the teaching body, the men in the field, and I can state unequivocally that in certain of these matters and particularly in the case of the introduction of an oral Irish examination the teachers were not at any time consulted.</P>
    <P>I mention this because I hope that in future this policy of introducing changes of one sort or another without prior consultation will be abandoned and I mention it because I hope the Minister will look favourably on the suggestion that has been made for the establishment of a permanent advisory council of all the bodies concerned with secondary education, the teaching and managerial bodies.</P>
    <P>Some headway has been made in that by the bodies concerned but it would <Col N="1158" /> be much better if something was done at the instance and on the initiative of the Minister rather than that these bodies should establish a council of their own and invite the Minister or his representatives on it.  So, I hope he will give some consideration to that matter.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up much more of the time of the Seanad but there is one matter to which I must refer and it is the matter of the qualifications of teachers for teaching certain subjects.  I think that we are more or less a laughing stock in other countries when we have to admit that a teacher who has a degree in any set of subjects and a Higher Diploma in Education is thereby qualified to teach any subject under the sun.  I think it is a system that is unknown anywhere else and it is one of the things against which my Association has been crying out for a number of years and they have proposed a very reasonable basis on which this might be adjusted.  It is the basis that no teacher would be allowed to teach a subject to leaving certificate standard that he has not studied at degree level in the university and to no class up to intermediate standard that he has not studied at some stage in the university, say, First Arts or Second year.  In no other country that I know of is the situation tolerated that is tolerated here with regard to the teaching of subjects without any adequate academic preparation on the part of the teacher and I can assure the Minister that my Association, the Association of Secondary Teachers, would welcome a move in that direction at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>I am more concerned with it now than ever because, in some of the statements made on the educational side in the White Paper on the revival of Irish, it was admitted that some teachers are teaching Irish who are not qualified to do so.  The Minister's reply was that he was satisfied that the great majority of the teachers were qualified to teach Irish in secondary schools.  The great majority of teachers still leaves a minority and as long as there is even one teacher attempting to teach Irish without knowing the special problems or without being <Col N="1159" /> properly qualified, the Minister should be concerned about it.  It is very important for the whole work of the revival of Irish, insofar as secondary schools are accountable, that every teacher who is committed to teach Irish should be qualified to do so.</P>
    <P>There is little in the Minister's statement to which anyone could take exception, apart from the things I have mentioned, namely, his claim that no change has been made without consultation, which I for one cannot accept, and his claim that the larger school is of necessity better than the smaller school.  In deference to the plea made by Senator Ó Maoláin for brevity and knowing that the Minister has yet to speak and that Senator Quinlan has yet to reply, I shall forgo referring to a number of points I intended to raise, but I look forward to the Minister's reply to all the points raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I agree that this debate provides a useful opportunity for the House to discuss certain matters on which many Members are competent to speak.  However, I think that in some way the time of the debate has been slightly out of joint or, perhaps, more correctly, slightly out of phase. In one sense the debate has come too late and in another sense it has come too soon.</P>
      <P>The motion was put on the order paper of the Seanad following the press conference held by the Minister in May, 1963.  The proposals outlined by the Minister then would be expected by now to have been worked out in some detail and, accordingly, though the Minister has not made a further comprehensive statement, in this sense the debate has come too late to influence events; it would have been of more value coming rather quickly after the Minister's press conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, this debate comes a little too soon.  We are, I understand, on the eve of the publication of the report of the Investment in Education Project.  In that sense it is a little premature for us here to discuss this question of post-primary <Col N="1160" /> education, when we hope in a matter of a month or so to have the results of two years' work of fact-finding which would be largely devoted to this subject.  Nevertheless, it is well for us during this debate, begun in last December, now continued in March and whenever, despite the promptings of the Leader of the House to finish to-night it may be resumed, to discuss this matter.  In May, 1963, the Minister enunciated his basic approach to post-primary education.  On that occasion he said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>As I see it, the equality of educational opportunity towards which it is the duty of the State to strive must nowadays entail the opportunity of some post-primary education for all.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that we are at one with the Minister in regard to this basic principle and that the discussion which arises in a debate of this sort is on the manner of the implementation of this basic principle accepted by all. In his statement of May, 1963, the Minister proposed three directions in which he sought to implement this basic principle.  First, he spoke of the proposal for comprehensive schools; secondly, he spoke of the proposal for regional technical colleges; and, thirdly, he spoke of the revision of the certificate examinations.  These are the three things which the Minister has put before himself, before the country and before us as the best means of achieving this objective.  In a debate like this, it is well for us to look into these three prongs of advance which the Minister seeks to implement.</P>
    <P>The motion before the Seanad asks for a statement from the Minister, and this is a suitable way in which the motion should be phrased.  It is now almost two years since the Minister made that statement.  Since then, there have been references to education in the White Paper on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, in both Parts 1 and 2.  These statements on education were largely summaries of what the Minister had to say in 1963 and it can fairly be said that the speeches by the Minister in the Dáil, when moving the Estimate for his Department, have added little but <Col N="1161" /> minor footnotes to what he had to say on that original occasion.  Furthermore, the Minister's intervention in the present debate has been somewhat disappointing to Members of the House in that a more comprehensive statement was not made and I think I speak for many Members when I say that we would hope before this debate is ended the Minister would be able to bring his thoughts and those of his advisers to such a stage that he could give to the House and to the country a more comprehensive statement on these ideas which he has put before us.</P>
    <P>I have said that it is rather difficult to speak on this matter now, being as we are on the eve of the publication of an important report on this whole problem of investment in education. Nevertheless, I think it is worthwhile. There are some matters of general principle which can be ventilated and which might be lost in the factual debate which I hope will follow the publication of that report.  Therefore, I should like in this debate to bring forward some considerations of general principle.</P>
    <P>Before I mention the things I think the Minister specifically should include in a comprehensive statement to the House and to the country, I should like to mention some of these basic principles and basic ideas.  I should also like to make some comments on a matter which has been a concern of mine and of my profession during the past few years and which is bound up with this question of post-primary education, namely, the position we face in regard to the training of technicians.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a policy in education that is really worthwhile, if we are to have a policy that will stand the test of time, then we must be clear on what our objectives are.  Before we go into details of policy or planning, we must be quite clear in regard to our educational principles.  Now the aims, the objectives and the principles of education have been a matter of some debate throughout the world since the close of the Second World War.  In the course of that debate there has been <Col N="1162" /> quite a change in regard to the approach to education.  The various aims and objectives of education can, I think, be summed up under three headings.  Education seeks, on the one hand, the development of the individual. In another way, education is concerned with the handing on of a particular culture.  In recent years we have come to realise, too, that education is also vitally concerned with the training of the future work force.</P>
    <P>In any liberal democracy, in any country such as ours, with an approach to political and educational problems such as we have, there must be a tremendous emphasis on the first of these objectives.  There can be no retreat from the position that education is concerned with the drawing out of the individual child, with helping each individual in the community to reach his or her potentiality.  But the debates that have occurred in recent years, particularly the debates that have occurred in the past five years, have shown us that this prime objective is not irreconcilable with the other two types of objectives I have mentioned.  The debate which is taking place now throughout the world has demonstrated clearly, I think, that rather than being destructive of one another these objectives&mdash;the training of the individual, the handing on of culture and the training of the work force&mdash;not only do not destroy one another, or cancel one another out, but, if we can only discover the secret of it, can coerce or entice these separate objectives to reinforce one another; the aim of any educational policy and of any educational planning must be so to order our educational policy and the whole educational system that these three objectives will all be present and will all reinforce one another.</P>
    <P>That is, I think, all too obvious today.  We have come to realise the truth of the linkage between the problems of economic growth and the problems of universal education.  In the past two years we have come to see that economic growth, the rise in the national income, the amount which is available to be spent on education, means that universal education is possible <Col N="1163" /> once economic growth has occurred. At the same time, we have also come to realise that universal education is very often a prerequisite for economic growth, that economic growth, which will make universal education and education for all our citizens available, is itself only possible if our education is as universal and as well planned as possible.  This is something which appears, as I say, quite evident to us now, but this is something which was not dreamt of before the War.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has any doubts on this score will not, I think, remain unconvinced if they read the reports which have been issued on this subject, particularly by OECD.  I might mention in this connection the report of the 1961 Conference in Washington, which was most aptly named the &ldquo;Conference on Investment in Education&rdquo;. Besides these very valuable reports there are also the reports of the OECD Mediterranean Regional Project on Education for Economic and Social Development.  That is the project which was the forerunner, in a sense, of our own investment in education project and was based on the realisation that we can combine this education of the individual, this handing on of cultural values of all types and the development of a trained work force in the future.  I may say it was somewhat of a surprise to educators to find they were economically respectable.  It was somewhat of a surprise to find that, having for years been charged, as it were, as a debit in the national economy, as a cost to be borne, almost as a luxury, one now comes under the respectable heading of &ldquo;Productive Investment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If we look at it closely we will, I think, realise that there is no real contradiction between education for culture and education for work.  Indeed, if we think of this and look at it fundamentally, we will see that in the large sense there is no real distinction between the two because the full culture of any community, such as ours, includes its habits of work.  Culture in the correct sense, culture in the proper sense, culture in the sense of sociology, <Col N="1164" /> is not merely something concerned only with arts and crafts, something of leisure; it is something which involves not only leisure but also the working day and the working habits of the whole community.  The position in very primitive societies was that only very primitive technological work was possible and culture only emerged when technology reached the stage at which culture could be supported as well as pure subsistence.</P>
    <P>Today we find ourselves at an advanced technological stage.  This technology makes it possible for us in this generation and future generations, as a result of having a very productive technology, to fuse together the ideas of culture and leisure and work.  We can, under the technology which is to come, ensure that culture will not be the preserve of the few.</P>
    <P>That is the first development which is possible.  It is by no means inevitable. Nevertheless, it is something which can be done.  If we can tackle this problem, we in this country, from the point of view of Christian humanism, will, I think, do something which, perhaps, we are particularly fitted to do.  We must remember that, in the eyes of Christian humanism, we must no longer think of an artist as being a particular type of man; we must, in the eyes of Christian humanism, look at every man as being a particular type of artist.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that if we set out to find an educational system which will allow for the personal rights of each individual to be educated to his full potentiality, on the one hand, and at the same time, the right of the State, which pays the cost of this operation, to have individuals trained in order to be an effective work force, we can combine all these things.  We can produce an educational policy which will be an all round policy and, if we work hard enough at it and think fundamentally enough on this particular problem, we can, without sacrificing any of the objectives of education, go forward with an educational policy and an educational plan which will do all of these necessary things.</P>
    <P>This task will not be an easy one. <Col N="1165" /> It will not be something which can be done merely by taking a snap decision on this or a snap decision on that.</P>
    <P>It is something which will have to be worked out gradually and slowly, not merely by the Minister in his Department but by the Minister in consultation with all those in this country who are interested in this particular problem. <Col N="1166" /> The measure of those who should be interested is the measure of the whole community.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 10th March, 1965.</P>
