    <Title>State Guarantees (Transport) (Amendment) Bill, 1965    (Certified Money Bill)  &mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The State Guarantees (Transport) Act, 1962, provides that the Minister for Finance may guarantee the due payment by Córas Iompair Éireann of any moneys payable by the Board under contracts for the provision of goods and services or both goods and services entered into by the Board with my approval, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised that the State Guarantees (Transport) Act, 1962, does not provide explicity for guarantees of payments due under contracts entered into by the Board to be expressed in any currency other than <Col N="628" /> Irish currency; and the purpose of the present Bill is to remedy that defect. The only guarantee given under the 1962 Act was in respect of a contract entered into by the Board in 1962 in US dollars for the purchase, by extended payments, of diesel locomotives from General Motors Corporation, USA.</P>
    <P>Amending legislation of a somewhat similar nature was necessary in the case of Aer Lingus and other companies covered by the State Guarantees Act, 1954 and, more recently, in the case of the Electricity Supply Board; and the necessary provision was made in the State Guarantees (Amendment) Act, 1964 and the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1965.  In the present case, however, the guarantees which the Minister for Finance may give extend only to payments in respect of contracts for the provision of goods and services and do not extend to borrowings.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill extends the powers of the Minister for Finance in the State Guarantees (Transport) Act, 1962 to enable him to guarantee payments by the Board in foreign currencies and establishes the method of calculating the equivalent in Irish currency of moneys due by the Board in foreign currency.  Rules for conversion follow those in the State Guarantees (Amendment) Act, 1964. Such conversion is necessary to determine the value in Irish currency of the guarantees given by the Minister for Finance for the purpose of subsection (2) of section 2 of the State Guarantees (Transport) Act, 1962, which prescribes the maximum amount of principal in Irish currency which may be guaranteed at any one time.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, this is one of a series of Bills to cover a defect in the original Act, which is a rather surprising one.  The Minister has not indicated how this came to be discovered or, indeed, how the original defect occurred.  However, now that it has been discovered, it is right that we should remedy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that, in these instances, the guarantees which the Minister may <Col N="629" /> give extend only to payments in respect of contracts for the provision of goods and services and do not extend to borrowings.  I think this is appropriate. One of the things I was interested in in relation to this Bill was whether or not this was the case because, unlike Aer Lingus, which earns a very high proportion of its revenue from abroad and is, therefore, in a position to remunerate capital borrowed abroad, CIE's capital earnings are very small, excluding hotels, and would amount to no more than 3 per cent.  It would be inappropriate, in these circumstances, economically to finance the expansion or continuation of CIE by foreign borrowings and it is a good thing that this power has not been included here.  As it has not been included, I do not think this is an appropriate time to say more about the capitalisation of CIE or the appropriateness of investing further large sums for revenue equipment, as distinct from maintaining the existing investment and carrying on the railways for as long as they can carry on in their present condition, which could be for 20 to 25 years.  That is something we can, no doubt, clarify on another occasion.  Bearing in mind the limited purpose of the Bill and its limited value, I do not think we can have any difficulty about supporting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for dieselisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there no other purpose in contemplation to which this would be applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a programme of diesel engine purchases which includes new diesel engines of a more modern type and replacement of existing diesel engines.  The utility of some engines is being gradually reduced by age.  It does not imply any extension of the rail system of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Having brought out that point, which was not <Col N="630" /> clear to me, it would be appropriate to comment that the Government's decision in relation to CIE and the provision of continuing capital for the railway system of CIE is open to question. It would certainly seem that there is a very strong case from a practical and a social point of view, which one would not contest, for maintaining the railways in their present form and running them down gradually over a prolonged period.  Because they were run from 1921 to 1949 without any injection of capital we know that a railway system can be run for a very long time without further investment of capital.  If this guarantee is to extend the continuing purchase of diesel engines it appears that the Government's intention is to continue to invest in railway equipment.  One may question the desirability of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not come prepared for a discussion on the policy of CIE because this Bill merely enables CIE to be sure they can make purchases for dollars for purposes which relate to the operation of CIE which have already been discussed in relation to the Transport Act, 1964 and the annual Estimate in the Dáil.  I did not conceive that the discussion could be extended to this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not push the point.  It was not clear to me that there were continuing purchases involved at the moment.  When this point was brought out by Senator O'Quigley I thought I should bring the matter up but in deference to your ruling, Sir, I shall not press the matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, I have not made myself fully clear.  The 1964 Act provided for total capital to be made available to CIE of £6 million from 1964 for five years&mdash;in other words, to the end of 1969.  That was agreed to by the Dáil and also by the Seanad.  The purchase of the diesels comes within the capital requirements of CIE agreed to by both Houses of the Oireachtas so this is absolutely within the limits of what has been agreed to.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  Although we were told that the capital investment involves dollar expenditure we are now told something of the character of the investment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In his statement the Minister says that the only guarantee given under the 1962 Act was in respect of a contract entered into by the Board in 1962 in US dollars for the purchase, by extended payments, of diesel locomotives.  Do we take it that the mention of extended payments covers the day-to-day position at the moment in regard to payments due or being made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Payments continue to be made on the basis of the contract entered into by CIE which I am glad to say was of a satisfactory character particularly in relation to current interest rates.  It is for the completion of these payments and also for carrying out the full diesel engine programme envisaged under the 1964 Bill that this is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to the 1962 Act and to the amendment to that Act in that regard.  Could the Minister indicate to us, with reference to the 1962 Act, what was the full commitment with regard to the extended purchase of diesel locomotives? Was there a limit in regard to the figure and the date by which the extended purchase would finish?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to seek clarification at this stage.  I gather that certain payments have been made to date.  Why is it that the position has altered?  Why has it become necessary at this particular stage to discover that amending legislation is necessary to deal with something that up to the present appears to be satisfactorily dealt with under existing legislation?  It is a matter of extended payments and these payments were evidently made to the satisfaction of General Motors and all concerned. Why has it become necessary, at this stage, to alter this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is simply because we were advised by the Attorney General that the phrasing of the previous legislation was inadequate.  We have also been so advised in connection with Aer Lingus and the Electricity Supply Board.  It is just a defect in writing the legislation which we are now overcoming.  There was an absence of precision with regard to all three cases, in the previous legislation. There is no other hidden reason and there is nothing complicated about this at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that the 1962 Act relates to a specific contract of £2,200,000 and, if so, how can the Minister speak of this applying to future purchases of diesel engines if the contract is now completed? I may have misunderstood the Minister on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the Minister said on advice that the 1962 Act relates to the guarantee contract for £2,200,000.  If this Act amends the 1962 Act how does it apply to the whole capital programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not make it clear to the Senator.  The first contract is £2 million odd, and guarantees under the 1962 Act may be given up to a total of £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is to be commended for introducing this Bill and this section, because I believe that where legislation is found to be defective those who find it in that condition should not hesitate to confess their previous failure, whether <Col N="633" /> culpable or otherwise, and in a Bill of this kind to regularise the position. I observe that subsection (1) of section 2 deems previous moneys to have been included, and moneys in currencies other than the currency of the State. The Minister is to be commended for regularising that position.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage the Minister told us that these moneys were being guaranteed for the purpose of the CIE dieselisation programme and that more of these diesel engines will be purchased abroad.  I gather that £2.2 million of the £5 million has been allocated for that purpose already.  I understand that the Minister would have no experience of what I am about to say now, and it is very relevant to the question of the application of these moneys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 15 and 16 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Act shall come into operation on such day as the Minister by order appoints and the Minister may by order appoint different days upon which different provisions may come into operation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that this Act will come into operation on the 1st day of July, 1966.  I do not think anyone will quarrel with allowing a certain period of time to elapse between the coming into operation of the Bill and its passing, because there are a number of wills and other arrangements that will have to be considered by people which if not changed would be affected by the provisions of this Bill.  With all the opposition there has been to this Bill, it is in some respects a good Bill, in other respects not a bad Bill, and in other respects a bad Bill, in my opinion.</P>
      <P>I should like to urge on the Minister that there are certain provision in the Bill which should be brought into operation immediately because they represent a lack in our law for many years which could not be remedied too soon.  In particular I have in mind Part VIII of the Bill which deals with conflict of laws relating to testamentary dispositions.  It introduces new legal provisions and that is something which the Minister, on thinking it over, might well decide it would be of value to bring in on, say, 1st April or 1st February.  It is not the kind of thing, so far as I can see, that will cause anyone any trouble.  On the contrary, I think Part VIII could be very useful.  I myself have cases which have to wait until the coming into operation of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> There are other sections that are similarly valuable.  Part XI deals with limitation of action and it seems to me that whatever views we may have on section 124 there are various sections in that Part which might also with value be brought into operation at an earlier date.  The Minister's amendment provides that the Bill should not come into operation earlier than 1st July.  My amendment would enable him to bring it into operation any time, and if the Minister considers that it should not come into operation earlier than 1st July I suggest he should have the freedom and the power not to bring it into operation, but he should also have the power to bring the portions of the Bill which are noncontroversial and useful into operation at an earlier date than 1st July.  I think the Minister should take that power and if he does not want to exercise it he can do so by not making an order.  I think there are provisions that should be brought in earlier and the Minister would have the freedom under my amendment to do so.  I urge that on the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The official amendment goes some way to meet Senator O'Quigley's case, providing for a greater degree of flexibility whereby the Act could by order be brought in on an appointed date not earlier than 1st July.  I do not think it is practicable to bring in certain Parts of the Bill at different times from other Parts.  The main reason for the official amendment is the importance of having the Succession Bill become law on the same day as the Registration of Title Act comes into effect, because the machinery of succession is wrapped up with the whole machinery of registration of title.  The two mesh in together, as it were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would obviously be in convienient to have different Parts of the Succession Bill become law at different times.  Also, from an administrative point of view, it would be inconvenient to have the Registration of Title Act become law at a different time from the Succession Act.  Therefore, the <Col N="636" /> official amendment is a cleaner job. It provides for the synchronisation of this Bill with the Registration of Title Act, when it comes into effect.  Any suggestion of different Parts coming into operation at different times would not be practicable from an administrative point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>For the life of me, I cannot see what Part VIII of the Bill would have to do with the Registration of Title Act.  Part VIII deals with the conflict of laws relating to testamentary dispositions &mdash;&ldquo;Testamentary disposition&rdquo;; Validity as regards form; Dispositions made on board vessel or aircraft; Exercise of power of appointment; Joint dispositions; Effect of restrictions on capacity; Construction of testamentary disposition; Effect of testamentary disposition under Part VII.</P>

      <P>I think it could be isolated.  However, I do not see any reason why the Minister should not have the power.  Then, if he does not want to bring in Parts of the Bill until the whole lot comes into operation, it rests with the Minister to do so. Upon re-examination, the Minister might well come to the conclusion that he could and ought to bring in some of the provisions of the Bill.  It is not very often that we want to force power upon a Minister.</P>

      <P>That is what we are trying to do here.  I think the Minister should take unto himself this discretion and he can exercise it, then, in the way in which he says he can only exercise it under his own amendment. What the Minister has to say about the Registration of Title Act is interesting.  I understand that the Registration of Title Act cannot come into operation because there is no adequate building and no adequate staff have been recruited for the purpose <Col N="637" /> of bringing it into operation. Judging by the present slow-down in building, I suppose we need not fear that Parts IX and X of the Succession Bill will come into operation for some years to come.  I urge the Minister to take unto himself this power.  I think he can well be trusted with it.  If he does not want to use it until the Registration of Title Act comes into operation, he does not have to use this amendment or exercise the powers.</P>

I think it is a cleaner job to have the two coming into effect at the same time. It is messy to have the two Acts coming into operation at different times.  I do not want that particular power. These two schemes of succession and registration synchronise and there would be no confusion on their coming into operation at the same time.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister's amendment quite covers the point.  However, I cannot see anything that my amendment would not cover.  It brings them into exactly the same position as ordinary descendants and relatives of a deceased person as might be used elsewhere throughout the Bill.  Although I have not put down in my amendment the word &ldquo;alive&rdquo;, which I complained about on an earlier Stage, I think my amendment brings them exactly into the same position in the Bill as any other phrase of that sort in the Bill, whereas the Minister's amendment, by emphasising the words &ldquo;alive&rdquo; and its &ldquo;having survived him&rdquo;, brings the idea to my mind that one would almost have to have a <i>post mortem</i>.  Otherwise, I think the Minister's amendment covers the point and I am quite agreeable to it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 21, to add at the end &ldquo;or real estate&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This concerns another point made by me on section 6 on Committee Stage. What I had in mind was that subsection (4) provides that the jurisdiction conferred on the Circuit Court by this section shall be exercised by the judge of the circuit.  I was saying, in that connection, that, in modern times, when we have so much emigration, especially from rural Ireland, very often the actual fixed place of abode of a deceased person who has emigrated is Birmingham, London or <Col N="640" /> some such place and therefore it is necessary, if you are to give jurisdiction to the Circuit Court, to relate the jurisdiction to the land or property which the deceased died possessed of. Relating it merely to his place of abode is of no value because he has died in England.  Therefore, in this amendment I suggest that there should be added to &ldquo;had a fixed place of abode&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or real estate&rdquo;, and that would capture all classes of property which are defined in section 4 for the purpose of this Bill.  That would give the Circuit Court undoubted jurisdiction where a person died outside this country but had land situated within the area over which the circuit judge has jurisdiction.  I referred to this on the last occasion and I understood that the Minister was to go more fully into it.  Section 46 of the County Officers and Courts Act, 1877 seems to me to suggest that the locality of the land was the determining factor. For that reason I want to include at the end of subsection (4) that where the deceased has had a fixed place of abode within the Circuit Court area, or real estate, which would include leasehold property or any other types of land, the Circuit Court may have jurisdiction.  The Minister may point to some other statute which deals with this position but I should be surprised if he could because if that were the case there should not be any question of including subsection (4) in section 6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is mistaken in thinking that the County Officers and Courts Act, 1877, covers this point.  That Act was replaced on the setting up of the Circuit Court in 1924 by the Courts of Justice Act, which provided that administration proceedings should be taken where the deceased had his fixed place of abode. The Senator's amendment would undermine the whole principle in operation in the Circuit Court since 1924.  The High Court has original jurisdiction in all administration matters.  In the case of a person living in England at the time of his death, one would go to the High Court for representation. The Circuit Court has jurisdiction in probate actions involving estates up <Col N="641" /> to a certain value where the deceased lived in the particular circuit at the time of his death.  That has been the position in the Circuit Court since its formation in 1924.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I heard the Minister correctly or understood the purport of his remarks.  Of course, I agree that the very purpose of the Circuit Court is to bring the law to the people and that is the whole trend and tenor of legislation in modern times.  What the Minister said, if I understand him correctly, amounts to this, that if a man dies with a property the valuation of which is £15 and if at the time of death he has had a fixed place of abode in England, neither the 1924 Courts of Justice Act nor any other subsequent legislation enables the estate to be administered by the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>What I am talking about is whether the Circuit Court area in which the land is situated governs where the administration shall be carried out.  If the Minister is correct it means that if you want to administer the estate of a person who dies in England whose property is valued at £10 or £15 you have to go into the High Court to administer it.  That certainly could not be correct, or if it is, it is an unreasonable position, because in this very Bill we are extending the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £60 to £100 and that in spite of the fact that land always retains its monetary value whatever the valuation.  I do not think the Minister could be serious in contending that the administration must be in the High Court when it could be far better done in the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>The Minister cannot <Col N="642" /> say that.  It is not correct.  Look at all the inconvenience this gives rise to. If somebody institutes an administration suit in respect of land which had been abandoned by somebody who has died in England &mdash; say a man who left his property and went to live with a married daughter in England, which is the kind of thing that can happen&mdash; then if it is necessary to institute these proceedings to ascertain the next of kin and the encumbrances to which the lands are subject this is going to be done in the High Court on a grand scale.

      <P>If that is so then my amendment is more than timely. I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment now for the purpose of incorporating it into the Bill, and if he wants to, after further consideration, he can have it deleted in the Dáil. He will at any rate have had time to study it.  It seems to me to be absurd to say that when you go to administer an estate of £10 valuation it must be in the High Court with all the paraphernalia of a High Court judge giving an order and having inquiries made to ascertain the next of kin and encumbrances when it could be done in the local Circuit Court just as well. He would pay on the High Court scale, which is a good deal higher.  The estate <Col N="643" /> could well be eaten up in costs.  I think the Minister should here and now incorporate the words &ldquo;or real estate&rdquo; at the end of the section, and if for good and sufficient reasons he afterwards thinks it is desirable he can delete them in the Dáil.  But I would urge him not to let it go through without giving this power to the Circuit Court which in no way that I know of conflicts with anything that is going on at the present time.</P>

      <P>The only point I wish to make is that all this goes to the very root of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the High Court in this country.  The law since the inception of the Circuit Court has been that it is the place of residence of the deceased which is the relevant factor in deciding whether or not the Circuit Court will administer his estate.  The Circuit Court has no jurisdiction to issue grants of probate. An application for probate must automatically go to the High Court, because the Circuit Court has no jurisdiction in this respect.</P>
      <P>In the case of a person with a fixed place of abode here and, possibly, having money in a bank in England, it is to the High Court that application would have to be made for a grant of probate.  Bearing in mind the whole structure of the courts here&mdash;the Circuit Court and the High Court&mdash;it is not practicable to accept Senator O'Quigley's and Senator FitzGerald's amendment because it introduces a feature of jurisdiction which, at the moment, is under further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the matter be met by making it optional as regards the position of &ldquo;real&rdquo; estate and compulsory as regards the fixed place of abode, by changing the amendment so that jurisdiction &ldquo;shall be&rdquo; exercised by the judge where the deceased had a fixed place of abode and &ldquo;may be&rdquo; exercised where it is &ldquo;real&rdquo; estate?  Certainly, in cases where there are not the complications the Minister has mentioned, it would be more convenient and inexpensive where a &ldquo;real&rdquo; estate is held.  However, one can see the flaws the Minister has mentioned in mixed cases and in these cases the High Court might be preferable.</P>

      <P>Again, I am somewhat at a loss to understand what the Minister is saying.  We do not seem to <Col N="645" /> be speaking the same language.  I do not understand what the Minister means when he says the Circuit Court has no probate jurisdiction and that any action in relation to a probate matter would have to be fixed in the High Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an entirely different thing.  Indeed, what we are doing in this Bill is that we are making every county registrar a district probate registrar.  In other words, we are bringing the facilities to the people. But, as far as probate actions go, in deciding whether or not a will is to be upheld, there is no doubt that the Circuit Court would be adequate.  If it is, in those circumstances, I do not see why it should not have jurisdiction in an administration suit.</P>
      <P>Another point I should like to make is that under the 1961 Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act the whole trend is to give the Circuit Court the same jurisdiction as the High Court, merely imposing upon it a limitation of £600 and £2,000 in equity and a £60 valuation. We have invested in the Circuit Court in this country the same jurisdiction as the High Court, except for divorce, criminal offences, murder and one or two other matters which are very rare.  The plain truth of the matter is that, in law at the present time, the Circuit Court has the same quality of jurisdiction as the High Court and it certainly comes strange to me to hear that we would be offending some principle.  I know of no principle that would be offended if we were to extend administration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not general jurisdiction, just jurisdiction.  If the Minister looks at the Third Schedule to the 1961 Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, he will see that the judge by whom jurisdiction is to be exercised on the sale, and distribution on sale, of any lands is the judge of the Circuit Court where the lands or any part of them are situated.  Nothing could be clearer from the whole trend of the law.  In similar cases, the Circuit Court has jurisdiction.  There is no difference in principle between a murder suit in the Circuit Court and an administration action.

      <P>In page 12, to add to section 21 a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act to the contrary, it shall be lawful for an administrator to continue to act as such in any case in which he has brought an action for the purpose, <i>inter alia</i>, of ascertaining the next of kin of the deceased and as a result of enquiries made in such action next of kin of the deceased has been discovered who would be <Col N="647" /> entitled to a grant of administration in priority to the administrator in the action, unless the Court for good and sufficient reason shall otherwise order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are occasions when it is necessary for somebody to take out a grant of administration who may not be the nearest of kin to the deceased. I do not quite follow why it is the Rules of the High Court which prescribe the order and priority in which the next of kin are entitled to a grant but the fact is that Order No. 79 does prescribe the order and there it is. What I do say is that it happens, not infrequently, that an administration suit is instituted in the High Court or Circuit Court, one of the main purposes of it being to ascertain who are the next of kin.  The next of kin may be abroad and it is desirable to have that ascertainment done after sufficient evidence has been adduced and established to the satisfaction of the court for carriage of the suit.  As the law stands at the present time, once the next of kin has been established, and that next of kin had all along a prior title to the grant of administration, the probate office writes to the plaintiff in the proceedings and says: &ldquo;You are not entitled to have this grant of administration&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then the whole rigmarole in regard to that has to be gone through.  I am suggesting in this amendment, and I hope the Minister will accept it, that where an administration suit is instituted for the purpose of ascertaining who the next of kin are if the next of kin are discovered to be nearer to the deceased than the administrator in the action, unless there is very good reason for revoking the grant of administration, the plaintiff should be allowed to continue.  I think that would avoid unnecessary expense and also avoid waste of time.  I see no reason why the amendment should not commend itself to the House.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the amendment.  The general jurisdiction <Col N="648" /> in section 27, subsection (4), enables the court to make a grant of administration to any person having an interest in the estate.  I think this meets the point made by he Senator.  That is more flexible.  If there are any difficulties envisaged by the Senator, they would be met by the general jurisdiction of the court as set out in section 27.</P>

      <P>Section 27 is a copy of section 12 of the Administration Act, 1927 and of section 78 of the Wills Act.  I think the Minister misses my point.  Section 4 merely applies in a case where it is necessary to apply to the High Court for leave to take out a grant.  I am talking about a case where the grant is already out and in the course of administration proceedings nearer of kin to the deceased than the administrator are discovered.</P>

It should be possible where the administrator has entered into the bond to the satisfaction of the Probate Registrar, and the administration proceedings are before the court.  There is no reason that I know of or no logic or commonsense in saying &ldquo;because we have discovered new next of kin.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This amendment and amendment No. 29 are drafting amendments designed to clarify the position of a purchaser why buys property from a person to whom it has been transferred by personal representatives, that is, a purchaser who buys from a beneficiary.  Section 59 provides for the protection of creditors and beneficiaries who are given the right to follow property into the hands of any person other than a purchaser.  As <Col N="654" /> these provisions read at the moment, it might appear that there is an obligation on a purchaser to satisfy himself that the person from whom he is buying is, in fact, the person entitled under the will or intestacy, as the case may be.  Quite clearly the purchaser must not be placed in such a position.  It is obvious that if such an interpretation could be made, it would be an unfair burden to place on any such purchaser. He must be entitled to assume that the personal representatives have acted correctly in transferring the property and that the property has been vested in the person legally entitled to it.  The amendments are intended to clarify this aspect.</P>

      <P>This is designed to clear up a point of ambiguity which existed in the section as originally framed and to which Senator Cole drew attention on Committee Stage.  I think the phraseology, &ldquo;So long as a right conferred by this section continues to be exercisable&rdquo; is more definitive than the phraseology used in the original draft.  The reference to the period mentioned in so-and-so paragraph was confusing.  It is more definitive to say that this is applicable so long as any right conferred in the section continues to be exercisable.  It is a better form of drafting and avoids any ambiguity.</P>

      <P>These amendments are designed to meet a point raised on Committee Stage by Senator O'Quigley. The main purpose is to make it clear that, where a surviving spouse of unsound mind is already a ward of court, the right of appropriation under section 56 and the right of election under section 114 will be exercisable by the committee of the spouse's estate by leave of the court which has appointed the committee.  We now place the obligation on the committee to seek the leave of the court.  Where there is no committee, the rights will be exercisable on behalf of the spouse by the High Court or, in appropriate cases, the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 27, to add to section 56 a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) The appropriation of a dwelling under this section shall <Col N="658" /> not be subject to the provisions of section 12 of the Land Act, 1965.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In section 56, we are authorising the appropriation of a dwelling house to the surviving spouse in part satisfaction of the legal right share.  It occurs to me that under section 12 of the Land Act, 1965, there is a general prohibition, in relation to agricultural holdings, against letting, sub-letting, or subdivision&mdash;we are concerned here with subdivision&mdash;without the consent in writing of the Land Commission and such consent may be either general or particular.  In the case of agricultural land, where the spouse might appropriate the dwelling in part satisfaction of the legal right share and subsequently decide to sell that house, some difficulty might arise in relation to whether or not this is a subdivision of the agricultural holding.  What we intend to do here is to ensure that the surviving spouse shall be given the house not merely for life but as an outright conveyance or gift of the property.  It seems to me that we ought to place the matter beyond all doubt and to insert here that the appropriation of a dwelling under section 56 shall not be subject to the provisions of section 12 of the Land Act, 1965, which prohibits subdivision without the consent in writing of the Land Commission.  I think that this amendment would clarify the position beyond all doubt.</P>

      <P>It seems to be quite clear that you are not just going to give a dwelling, isolated from all. There will be the usual bit of land around the house.  There may even be a bit of garden going with it.  As I understand Land Commission law at present that would amount to a subdivision. It would involve the Land Commission maybe later, or some other authority, in having to build a house on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can foresee the necessity of future legislation to amend section 56 because merely to speak of a &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; is not quite good enough without defining what is meant by &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;.  When you ordinarily speak of a dwelling, you speak of a dwelling plus the usual out-offices, maybe a turf shed, an outside toilet, and so on, that go with it, and that may involve quite a bit of <Col N="660" /> land, a bit of garden in front and back.  If you want to give a widow a dwelling, I take it that that is the kind of dwelling you want to give her with the ordinary piece of land about it.  If that is what we are going to give the surviving spouse as part of the legal right share, it seems to me that that would amount to a subdivision as far as the Land Commission are concerned. I can see difficulty in a purchaser accepting that, without the consent in writing being obtained from the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>To use the Minister's words, we ought to spell out quite clearly what we are doing in this amendment, that is, that whatever appropriation of a dwelling is made under section 56 is not a subdivision to which section 12 of the Land Act would apply.  I think the Minister cannot go wrong in accepting this amendment but he is very likely to go wrong if he does not accept it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27.</P>
      <P>In page 27, line 22, before &ldquo;any&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by leave of the Court&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 57 enables the personal representative of a deceased person to <Col N="661" /> transfer an infant's share in property to a trust corporation or any two or more persons to be trustees of the share for the infant.  In the ordinary course of events, where property is held in trust for an infant, it is held in trust by somebody who had confidence in the trustees and selected them because he had confidence in them.  The only other way is that the persons have been appointed by the court under the various Acts which apply to property of children.  This section proposes to depart from the safeguards which exist in relation to the appointment of trustees and it enables the personal representative to appoint any two or more persons, who may or may not turn out to be trustworthy persons.  There is no question of these two persons appointed by the personal representative having to enter into a bond or to give any security.</P>
    <P>When we were discussing this on Committee Stage, the Minister made the point that the infant would always have his right to sue the person in court for the recovery of any property or moneys which the trustee might have done away with.  My reply to that was, and still is, that there is no use in giving an infant the right to go to court when, in all likelihood, the reason the trustee who held the infant's money has done away with it is that he was already in financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>In any event, I do not think we ought to entrust infants' money as lightly as that to two persons nominated by the personal representative.  I should point out that, in the ordinary course, if a child is injured in a road accident or in any other way and is awarded damages in court, the money is always kept in court, until the child is 21 and invested in appropriate securities in the name of the circuit judge and the county registrar.  In that way the dividends are allowed to accumulate.  That is the kind of protection we have always provided in our legislation regarding the property of infants.</P>
    <P>Under this section the personal representative may appoint a trust corporation, to which I have no objection, <Col N="662" /> because the trust corporation, I understand, will normally be the nominees of banks and, in the present credit squeeze, would be good marks in the event of defalcations.  I have no objection to a trust corporation but I do say we ought to provide in this section that if a personal representative wants to get rid of an infant's share in property arising out of the death of a testator or, on intestacy, of a deceased person the person to whom the property is to be transferred should be appointed by the court.  This is a standard practice at the present time. It is the minimum safeguard we can provide.  The persons appointed by the court may not always turn out to be the best but one can be certain that the child will have the satisfaction, at least, of knowing that before the persons were appointed to hold the money in trust, they were persons who were approved by the court.  In my experience, the courts are quite searching in the qualifications of the persons they appoint as trustees for the purposes of the Settled Lands Acts and under the Trustee Acts.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  I concede it entails an application to the court, but the amount of money involved in that is far less than the risk involved if a personal representative should shed his responsibilities, appointing any two people to take the infant's share.  I think an infant, who may get property under a will or on intestacy, is entitled to this minimum protection and that is the purpose of this application, that the approval of the court to the appointment of the trustees should be a prerequisite of the transfer of property to the two persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.  One of the objects of section 57 is to enable trustees of an infant's property to be appointed by the personal representative. If we were to provide that a personal representative would have to apply to a court to appoint trustees, we should merely be adding to the expense of administering the estate.  We are trying to avoid and cut down administration expenses.  We must <Col N="663" /> have regard to the fact that personal representatives are responsible people. They are appointed either by the testator himself or by the court in the case of administration.  We must take it, <i>prima facie,</i> that they will appoint proper trustees; and the need for a court application merely adds to the legal costs of administering the estate. I think we can place the onus fairly on the personal representatives and accept that the trustees whom they will appoint will be proper people.  The personal representative has a remedy in the event of the trustees not acting properly.</P>
      <P>I am against this amendment in that I want these trustees to be appointed with the minimum amount of expense and as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>I regret that the Minister has adopted this attitude. Just a short time ago we accepted an amendment in the case of a person of unsound mind, when the exercise of discretion would be by committee, by leave of the court or, where there was no committee, upon application to the court.  I have always understood the position of infants and persons of unsound mind to be similar.  They all fall within the designation of wards of court.  I do not see why in one case you provide that the discretion can be exercised only with the leave of the court and, in the case of the unfortunate infant, that the personal representative can appoint anybody he wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, having started upon that road, should continue.  The Minister should not abandon being reasonable.  I do think that, especially in the case of infants, it may be just too easy to make off with the infant's money.  The personal representative, of course, is the responsible person.  In the case of an executor, he is the person appointed by the testator and that is all right. In the case of an administrator, he is the responsible person, because he has to be.  He has to enter into a bond or get some insurance company to enter <Col N="664" /> into a bond for twice the value of the sworn assets of the estate.  It behoves him to be responsible but he can shed his responsibility by appointing any two persons to take the share of the infant and that may be the end of it.</P>
      <P>It is quite undesirable and certainly not in keeping with the other provisions of the Bill, or with the existing law, to say that a personal representative can appoint one or two persons to take the property of infant children and, thereafter, be anserable to nobody.  That is a reckless disregard of the well-being of infant children.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to put beyond doubt the stage at which a personal representative sells in due course of administration.  I have consulted the conveyancers on this and it is very difficult to say when an executor sells in due course of administration.  I have selected the period of six years, taking the six years from section 125 of the Bill, which is now to be the new limitation period in respect of which claims can be made in respect of deceased persons.  If the House and the Minister were to accept the amendment it would clarify the position <Col N="666" /> beyond all doubt that within a period of six years there will be an assumption that the sale was in due course of administration and after that it would not be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that the six year period is too restrictive. I do not want to encourage long administrations but, unfortunately, they occur for one reason or another. It is not unusual for administrations to go on for six, eight, ten, 12, 14 or 16 years.  The amendment suggested by the Senator would, in effect, mean that, outside the six year period, the purchaser would not be entitled to purchase. He would only be entitled to do so within six years from the date of the death of the deceased.  I think the existing law, as restated in the section as it stands, is better, having regard to the facts of life as they are. If we bring in a restrictive clause of this kind, it could only cause difficulties. I would like to know precisely what would happen in the event of an administration going on for longer than six years.  There would be very serious difficulties for personal representatives and for purchasers.</P>

      <P>It seems in that kind of a case that a personal representative is protected by the order of the court and no difficulty would arise.  At present it is very difficult to say at what particular point of time an administrator is selling in due course of administration. The only reason an administration can sell in due course of administration is to pay the debts and that is the basis upon which it is ascertained whether or not the sale is in due course of administration.  Certainly the law, as it stands at present, is very vague and the amendment seeks to bring some <Col N="667" /> clarification and definitiveness into it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 31, to delete lines 1 to 4 inclusive and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If an intestate dies leaving a spouse and issue the personal representative shall hold so much of the estate as consists of immovable property together with stock in trade and the goodwill attached thereto where such immovable property consists of a business in trust for the surviving spouse for life with remainder to the child or children or remoter issue of the intestate as the surviving spouse shall by deed or will appoint, and in default of <Col N="669" /> appointment in trust for the issue of the intestate in equal shares.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment to deal with the position where an intestate dies leaving a spouse and children.  On the last occasion Senator Jessop moved an amendment to provide that all the property of an intestate should be held by the personal representative of the widow in trust for her during her life and thereafter that it would be disposed among certain of the children as she wished.  I expressed sympathy with the idea of Senator Jessop's amendment on that occasion and the amendment was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>We are asking in this amendment to provide in the case of immovable property, which in the main, as far as this country is concerned, would be farms and businesses, that the widow of a person who dies intestate should have the entire property for life with power to appoint to such of the children as she may decide and if she failed to appoint among them equally upon her death.  There are many advantages in this kind of property holding. The best illustration of the advantages of this kind of property holding is to be found in the fact that&mdash;and I repeat it is a fact&mdash;the vast majority of deeds settling property in this country leave it to the husband or the wife for life, and then in trust for such children as the husband or wife may by deed or will appoint.  In cases where the son on a farm is getting married and the father is handing over the property to him, it is sometimes kept by the father for life but more frequently transferred to the man and his wife with power to appoint to the children.</P>
    <P>The test of the value of that kind of property holding and that kind of limitation on estates is to be found in the frequency with which it is employed.  There is no use in the Minister or anyone else saying life estates are a feudal concept and outmoded. Historically they are not a feudal concept. Entailed estates were a feudal concept which the passage of time and enlightened legislation got rid of, but life estates are designed to keep the property in the family.  Socially, I think <Col N="670" /> it is very desirable that they should be kept in the family, and that they should not have to be put upon the market upon the death, intestate, of the husband in order to realise the widow's portion.  The vast majority of women would prefer to have the reins over the whole property for their entire life with the right to appoint the property to one or other of the children.  If she has the right to appoint to one or other of the children she can pick out the child she believes she will get on best with, and who will look after her with the greatest care and affection, and she can by will or deed appoint the property to that child after her death.</P>
    <P>I said the best test of the value of this kind of property holding is the frequency with which it is used, and the fact that it is used by the rich, by the medium rich, by small farmers, small shopkeepers and small property-owners. This amendment relates merely to immovable property, that is, land and dwellings thereon, and businesses together with goodwill and stock-in-trade attached thereto, which would provide a useful living for any widow while, at the same time, preserving the property in the family and giving her a hold over one of her children.  She can appoint it to that child in her lifetime by deed to have after her death.  Where a man dies intestate and leaves children I think this is a desirable way to deal with it so far as immovable property is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could go so far as Senator O'Quigley wishes to go in his amendment.  In a great many cases in the country where the property is not vested the eldest son has been working the whole place and it would possibly create a little difficulty for him if he had to wait the remainder of another life for the place. I have the greatest sympathy with the Bill and the principle which the Minister has brought in, but I think something must be said on behalf of the children too.  The Minister has gone a long way to deal with this problem but there is the problem of the children <Col N="671" /> also.  Someone said that 50 per cent of the properties in this country are held by women.  If you have to decide between the surviving spouse and a young person starting off in life, I think there are times when one must feel a chance should be given to the younger person.  That is what is behind my amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that about 50 per cent of the holdings in this country are intestacies.  In those cases the widow or the widower will be told after the death of the spouse: &ldquo;You are entitled to a half-share in this property or one-third share under section 110.  What are you going to do about it?  You have one year to decide.&rdquo; Supposing the person goes to see a solicitor or a friend for advice, the only advice the solicitor, the lawyer or the friend can give is: &ldquo;Take it.&rdquo; If a person came to me and asked me that question I would say he should accept his share.  The Minister says this share will not be accepted in a great number of cases, but I think it will be, because if the person goes for legal advice he will be told to accept it.  That will be a great drawback in regard to farms.  I am with the Minister to a great extent and I have reduced my amendment considerably since Committee Stage but in the case of agricultural land there should be the possibility that the whole place can be united again under the eldest son.  That is why I put down this amendment.  In certain cases the children must get precedence over the parent who has lived most of his or her life.  Otherwise this would lead to fragmentation and a great deal of disturbance in farms.</P>

      <P>We went through all this before on Committee Stage. The intestacy provisions were generally welcomed in the Dáil, throughout the country, and by the various professional groups I met.  There did not appear to be any dispute in regard to the intestacy provisions until we came to the Seanad.  Intestacy provisions of one kind or another, allowing for shares of the estate to go to the wife and the <Col N="672" /> children, have been in existence since 1695.  We are improving them and giving the surviving spouse stronger rights.  The widow will get two thirds and the children one third.  If there are no children, the widow will take all. These provisions are an improvement on the existing situation in which, if there are children, the widow gets only one third, and, if there are no children, the widow takes the first £4,000 and half of the rest of the estate, the balance going to the next-of-kin.</P>
      <P>I think the new provisions in the Bill are excellent.  I see no reason why we should disturb them, particularly when the suggestion is that we disturb them in the interest of a life estate which I am firmly against and which all the people whom I have consulted are against.  It is an undesirable type of land holding&mdash;as I emphasised very sufficiently on the Committee Stage.  It is much better to have one person with a fee simple interest in practically all the property, as will be the case in regard to the surviving spouse, whose share will be two thirds.  That is a far better kind of title to property.  The introduction of a life estate interest on intestacy would cut right across all the existing conceptions which we have had for hundreds of years and which we are now seeking to improve here in a logical way.</P>

      <P>I did not have much hope of converting the Minister on this particular amendment.  What we are proposing is to give the entire of the property to the widow for her life as against the Minister's two thirds. It is very much a matter of opinion as to whether it is better to have the whole of the property for life or merely two thirds of it.  When we take into account the social aspects of retaining the property in the family, I think that undoubtedly the balance is in favour of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister got some queer dislike at some stage in his career for life estates.  The best test of the value of life estates is the fact that every day there is a settlement, it creates a life estate.  If the Minister sees, as conveyancers and chancery lawyers do see <Col N="673" /> certain difficulties in the existing law in relation to powers of tenants for life, particularly powers of borrowing, there is nothing simpler than to amend the law to give them the appropriate powers.  At present, they have powers to borrow only to improve the property.  It could be extended in the same way as it has been somewhat extended under the Agricultural Credit Acts.</P>
    <P>The fact that there was no comment on these provisions in the Dáil is not a reason at all for not reconsidering them here in the light of a very useful amendment put forward on the last occasion by Senator Jessop.  I have very little doubt that if any woman is confronted with the question whether she would prefer to have two thirds of the property, with shares, then, among maybe five or six children, or the entire of the property and to be in a position to say to one of them &ldquo;I will be able to give that to you&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will give that to you when you are settling down&rdquo; and that she could, by deed, appoint the property to the child after her death, she would say she would get much better value from a life estate and the further power of appointing to one of her children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are dealing here with the case where a man dies intestate.  Our concern then is to make the best provision for the widow and the children.  There is not a doubt at all about it.  If you get one of the Telefís Éireann interviewers to take 20 minutes off and to ask 20 people in the street which they would prefer, a life estate in the lot with a power to appoint to one of their children or two-thirds absolutely and the rest of it to be divided out amongst their children, with no power of appointment, I am quite sure the result would be an overwhelming majority in favour of the life estate.</P>
      <P>The Minister has discovered some disease associated with life estates that nobody else with whom I have spoken on this matter&mdash;people of all shades of opinion&mdash;can understand.  With regard to the Minister's reference to life estate as being feudal, some pointed out that this is historically inaccurate and that what he was talking about was estates entailed, an entirely different type of estate which was very restrictive and for which the law has made adequate provision to dispose of.  Nobody has this vigorous dislike of life estates that the Minister has.  For that reason, I thought perhaps, having considered the matter again, the Minister might be disposed to say, where a man dies and does not look after his property, that the State, through the Legislature, should say: &ldquo;We will give the entire of the property to his wife and power of appointment to her children&rdquo; because, if there had been a marriage settlement or if he had been thinking of doing it himself this is probably the way he would have done it.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 34 not moved.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 35:</P>
    <P>In page 32, between lines 3 and 4, to insert in section 72 the following subsections:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( )  The Minister for Finance may, if he thinks proper to do so, waive, in whole or in part and in favour of such person and upon such terms (whether including or not including the payment of money) as he thinks proper having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the right of the State under this section.</P>
    <P>( )  Section 32 of the State Property Act, 1954 (which provides for the disclaimer of certain land devolving on the State by way of escheat or as <i>bona vacantia</i>) shall extend to the grantee's interest under a fee farm grant and the lessee's interest under a lease, where the State has a right to such interest as ultimate intestate successor.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is twofold.</P>
      <P>The first of the two subsections proposed in the amendment will empower the Minister for Finance, if he thinks proper to do so, to waive in whole or in part, and upon such terms as he thinks proper, the right of the State to take property as ultimate intestate successor.  Under section 31 of the State Property Act, 1954, the Minister for Finance already has this power of waiver in relation to property which devolves upon the State by way of escheat or as <i>bona vacantia</i>.  The right of waiver would, for example, be exercised in cases where the intestate left persons who were dependent on him but, not being next-of-kin, were not entitled to succeed to his estate under the provisions of this Part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second of the two subsections proposed to be inserted by the amendment provides that section 32 of the State Property Act, 1954, shall apply in relation to property to which the State has a right as ultimate intestate successor.  That section enables the Minister for Finance to disclaim the State's right to a fee farm interest or leasehold interest to which it has become entitled by way of escheat or as <i>bona vacantia,</i> respectively.  A disclaimer abolishes any liability of the State to pay the rent reserved by the fee farm grant or lease and also has the effect of vesting the interest, in the case of a fee farm grant, in the person in whom the grantor's interest was vested immediately before the disclaimer, and, in the case of a lease, in the persons in whom the reversion expectant was vested.  The right of disclaimer is important where the State <Col N="677" /> becomes entitled to property which is not only worthless but carries liabilities for the payment of rent.  I mentioned on Committee Stage that this amendment would be introduced on Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 38.</P>
      <P>In page 38, section 112, between lines 20 and 21, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  A renunciation by a spouse made after marriage shall be signed by the said spouse in the presence of a witness and such witness shall attest by his signature the signature of the spouse in the presence of the spouse.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister, on Committee Stage, to consider whether or not the <Col N="678" /> renunciation should have some little formality about it.  Otherwise I am afraid there will be a host of applications by spouses saying they did not quite understand what they were doing, that they were asked to do it with some sort of a promise, or a lot of things like that.  If there is witnessing to it, both on behalf of, say, the widow and on behalf of the other spouse who has suggested that she should renounce or that he should renounce, I feel there is some formality about it.  If there is formality about it, we must have a witness present and, at the same time, it would be a protection for the spouse without the necessity of having to go to court.  Otherwise it will have to go to a court application.</P>
    <P>If you have this formality you must have another person present and, before that other person, there will be some explanation of what it means to a spouse who might, perhaps, not be very wise in these matters.  It will stop a great deal of applications to court later on, where the surviving spouse could contend they did not know what was happening and did not know they were signing away the right they are now getting under this Bill.  Therefore, I think it would be an improvement to make it a little more formal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment for the simple reason that, at this stage, the spouse has a vested contingent interest in the property and this renunciation will be the divesting by the spouse of the spouse's interest in the property.  If that kind of act is to be done, it should be done with some degree of formality.  Therefore, not alone should it be in writing signed by the renouncing spouse, but it is very important that it should be witnessed so that it would be surrounded by some formality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very good reason for having the renunciation witnessed is that a domineering spouse could well exercise improper influence over the other spouse to get that spouse to renounce the legal right share.  If that were done during the lifetime of the husband and wife, whichever of them <Col N="679" /> succeeded in doing so, the person who owned the property could then go along, sell it and have this written renunciation.  Of course, at that stage, it is too late for the spouse who has been obliged, under pressure, to renounce it to begin protesting because then there is a family feud, there is a marriage relationship in danger, and a whole lot of other trouble would ensue.</P>
    <P>If a husband wants to get his wife to surrender her legal right share in her lifetime, the renunciation should be signed by the wife in the presence of a witness.  That brings some formality into it and provides some kind of safeguard that, at the time the wife is doing so, there should be somebody else there to witness it, and the husband knows he must bring somebody else in to witness it.  I see every reason for accepting the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must oppose this amendment because it runs counter to the whole purpose of providing for renunciation of a legal right.  The whole basis of much of the opposition to the Bill has been that the legal right should not be there at all.  Here, we are providing that the legal right can be renounced in a simple way in writing without any more ado.  The writing will give a clear indication of the intention of the renouncing party and that is really the root of what should be sought in the matter.  We should only, as a last resort, introduce formality in regard to human arrangements.  It is only, in the case of an ante-nuptial contract&mdash;which must be by deed, as provided in the section&mdash;in the case of a will or in the case of a deed signing over property, that we expect formality.  But, short of that, it is desirable, in the main, to have as little formality as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main root of the matter which should be examined is what are the intentions of the parties to the arrangement? The intention of the parties to an arrangement can be made quite clear, in this instance, by a renunciation by one of the parties to the marriage contract, a renunciation in writing of his or her legal right share. <Col N="680" /> The whole social purpose of this Bill is that man and wife should discuss their affairs more closely and to a greater degree than at present.  There should be mutual consent and interest. They are members of a partnership and, as in the case of a business partnership, both should be interested as to how the business goes.  It is not a matter of bringing two strangers together, in which case, every formality must be observed.</P>
    <P>In the case of an ante-nuptial contract it is only right and proper that it should be, as provided in the Bill, by way of formal contract.  But, in the instance with which we are concerned here, the parties are married.  They are in partnership, they are man and wife, and I see no necessity for infusing into that relationship the sort of formality the amendment seeks, that witnesses should attest the signature, in addition to the arrangement between the spouse.  This is a private, intimate family matter between man and wife.  I do not see why we should introduce the legal formality of a witness into that situation.  I can see far greater evil arising out of the provision, under statute, for such a witnessing than under the present arrangement. The requirement that a witness should be present to attest the signature of one of the parties would, in many cases deter an ordinary arrangement between man and wife.  Why bring in this complication?  That is the question I ask myself.  I object to it from the point of view of society.  We should only bring in legal formalities, where they are absolutely necessary and where vital rights are involved. But, in the case of man and wife, surely the nub of the matter is between the two parties.  Our concern should be to see that it is done in the most inexpensive, expeditious and easy way.  The renunciation, or any other deed, can be upset in the courts by way of ordinary court application.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> While I have some sympathy with the intentions behind the amendment, I am inclined to take the view that the intentions might easily be frustrated by the amendment itself for this reason.  Suppose you <Col N="681" /> had situations where the domineering spouse, as envisaged by Senator O'Quigley, or the other spouse not fully understanding the implications, would agree, a situation of injustice would ensure after the death of one of the spouses.  The surviving spouse, not genuinely fully understanding the implications involved and agreeing, then, the injured spouse would, in the normal practice, have fairly good cause for action in the courts.</P>
      <P>It is only reasonable that the court should take a reasonable view, once they were satisfied that there was grave injustice.  The court would be in favour of the injured party.  If you were to have the case where the testator had signed, I am afraid that the object of Senator Cole's amendment would be defeated, and what he is trying to prevent would really develop because it would be much harder then for a court to take a reasonable view, once this document was witnessed.  It would be much harder to hold that the injured party, at that stage, did not fully understand the implications of the document.</P>

      <P>These will be exceptional cases where possibly the spouse who is making the will is trying to avoid what is in this Bill.  In this case you could say to the surviving spouse: &ldquo;Make your will and sign that&rdquo;.  Ten chances to one, the surviving spouse will not know what it is about and then you will have a court application or family troubles.  The fact is that it will deter the spouse, who is trying to cheat the provisions of this Bill, if there is some person brought in, not alone who knows his intentions, but those of the surviving spouse.  Most of the arguments against this amendment could be similarly made against witnessing the signing of a will.  The arguments could all be used in the case <Col N="682" /> of witnessing a will where the husband is leaving property to his wife and family.</P>
      <P>I feel this would be a help and would stop a great many applications afterwards in cases where the surviving spouse is a little disappointed in the will.  There will be this temptation to go to court and say they were induced to sign this renunciation but that they did not understand what was in it.  They can say there were certain promises which were not fulfilled.  I am only suggesting one witness and I do not think it would be a very difficult or public affair for a man and wife to call in one witness when an agreement is being made.  Probably if there were a will, there would be two witnesses there in any case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 39, between lines 29 and 30 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>116.  (1)  Where on application by or on behalf of an infant child of a testator the Court is of opinion that the testator has failed in his moral duty to make proper provision for the maintenance of the infant child during such child's infancy in accordance with his means, whether by his will or otherwise, the Court may order that such provision shall be made for the maintenance of the infant child during such child's infancy out of the net estate as the Court thinks just by way of lump sum payment or otherwise.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Court shall consider the application from the point of view of a prudent and just parent taking into account the position of each of the infant children of the testator and any other circumstances (including those specified in subsection (3) of this section) which the Court may consider of assistance in arriving at a decision that will be as fair as possible to the infant child to whom the application relates and to the other infant children.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Court in determining whether and in what way provision for maintenance ought to be made by an order shall have regard to the value and nature of the property representing the testator's net estate and shall not order any such provision for maintenance to be made as would necessitate charging or otherwise encumbrancing or realising all or part of the estate that would be improvident having regard to the interests of the person or persons who apart from the order would be entitled to the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  The order under this section shall not affect the legal right of a surviving spouse or if the surviving spouse is the mother or father of the infant child any devise or <Col N="684" /> bequest to the spouse or any share to which the spouse is entitled on intestacy.</P>
    <P>(5)  &lsquo;The testator's net estate&rsquo; means all the property of which the testator had power to dispose of by will (otherwise than by virtue of a special power of appointment) less the amount of his funeral, testamentary and administration expenses, debts and liabilities, death duties payable out of his estate on his death and the value of the legal right of a surviving spouse or if the surviving spouse is the mother or father the value of any devise or bequest to the spouse or the value of any share to which the spouse is entitled on intestacy.</P>
    <P>(6)  Rules of court shall provide for the conduct of proceedings under this section in a summary manner.</P>
    <P>(7)  The costs in the proceedings shall be at the discretion of the court.</P>
    <P>(8)  An order under this section shall not be made except on an application made within twelve months from the first taking out of representation of the deceased's estate.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to limit the application of this right in the case of children to infant children. This section, in its present form, speaks of the moral duty of a testator to his children.  The implication is that a testator has in fact a moral duty to adult children which he may fail to fulfil by not providing for them in his will.  I would like to contest the existence of such a moral duty.</P>
    <P>A parent has a duty to his children which he fulfils by educating them.  He does so by providing for their education and launching them into the world adequately equipped to earn their own living.  After that point, he has not got a moral duty of the kind which ought to be enforceable in law. In particular cases, there will be an obligation in charity on him, <i>vis-à-vis</i> his children, but there is no obligation <Col N="685" /> in justice, once they are adult, capable of earning their own living and no longer in a state of infancy.</P>
    <P>I would admit there will be special cases and perhaps those could be provided for in this amendment.  We could perhaps provide for an adult child who is handicapped, mentally or physically, but outside those cases, there does not exist any moral duty.  This recasting of the section is designed to secure the right of infant children to seek maintenance from the estate, but only maintenance, if they have not been provided for, and to enable them to go to court to seek that maintenance.</P>
    <P>The Minister may reply that the section as it stands is permissive in that it does not require that children must be given this specific share but leaves it to the court to determine what that share should be.  The section in its present form could be interpreted by the court to mean that the Legislature, in considering it, considered that a man may have a moral duty to adult children.  The court must, therefore, work on the basis that such a right to a share in the estate exists in the case of adult children.  The fact that the section is not confined to infant children, or handicapped children, could be taken to mean, in court, that the Legislature, by not confining it, maintained that such a moral duty exists and that they would be required to consider the particular circumstances of the case and what that moral duty would be.</P>
    <P>I do not think it can be said that leaving it to the court, in the form in which it is left at the moment, leaves it completely open.  It binds the court to start from the premise that, in principle, such a moral duty can exist <i>vis-á-vis</i> the adult child and to consider merely the application of this moral duty in the particular instance. It seems to me to be quite unnecessary and an excessive infringement on the right of an estate.  It is also an infringement on the relations of parents and children.</P>
    <P>The amendment as drafted involves a number of changes in the section. Subsection (1) of the amendment is similar to subsection (1) of the section <Col N="686" /> except that the word &ldquo;infant&rdquo; is introduced in the second line.  Further down there is a provision introduced to cover the maintenance of the infant child as distinct from the section which just says what the provision for the child shall be, which of course could be a provision for his maintenance by a lump sum.  Further down, in the subsection we say:</P>
    <P>The Court may order that such provision shall be made for the maintenance of the infant child during such child's infancy out of the net estate as the Court thinks just by way of lump sum payment or otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is open to the court to provide a lump sum payment for maintenance of the child.  The change in subsection (2) is consequential.  Subsection (3) is a new subsection designed to assist the courts in determining what in fact would be suitable provision as regards maintenance and it develops the point about net estates.  Subsection (5) is a new subsection which defines net estates for this purpose:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;The testator's net estate&rsquo; means all the property of which the testator had power to dispose of by will (otherwise than by virtue of a special power of appointment) less the amount of his funeral, testamentary and administration expenses, debts and liabilities, death duties payable out of his estate on his death and the value of the legal right of a surviving spouse or if the surviving spouse is the mother or father the value of any devise or bequest to the spouse or the value of any share to which the spouse is entitled on intestacy.</P>
    <P>The purpose is to limit the fund out of which the court should be looking to provide the money to the amount actually available.  This concept of net estates is helpful in this context.  I ask the Minister to look at this seriously because I do not think he can validly hold there is this kind of absolute right, in justice, by adult children to part of their parents' property.  Such right does not exist in justice and such duty does not exist in justice.  I would ask the Minister to consider this amendment in the light of the points I have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to confine its provisions to maintenance of infant children.  I feel that in so far as this provision is to be included in the Bill at all, it should extend to provisions other than maintenance. Nowadays one hears much about the right to further education and the fact that the State should so far as it possibly can extend facilities for higher education to most of our school-going children.  In the case of a fairly wealthy family, or a reasonably wealthy family, where one or two children have undertaken a university education, I see no reason why the parents should not be regarded as having a moral duty to provide for a continuation of that education.  In most university courses the student would long since have come out of his infancy before he would have completed the course.  I feel a case of that nature is a very strong argument against Senator Garret FitzGerald's amendment.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I cannot see why it should be confined to mere maintenance. So far as I am aware, no one has suggested that the moral duty of parents extends to maintenance only. The amendment provides that an application may be made to the courts and the court shall consider the application from the point of view of a prudent and just parent taking into account the position of each of the infant children.  This obviously is intended to guard against people applying to the court and saying: &ldquo;I want to be maintained out of the estate,&rdquo; when they are perfectly capable of looking after their own interests. In fact it is likely that such a person would not be entitled to maintenance.</P>
      <P>I can see very little in favour of these amendments.  I feel that to confine it to maintenance only would be inconsistent with modern attitudes towards education and the general duty of parents towards their children.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to Senator FitzGerald's case, and while I sympathise in general terms with it, at the same time, I <Col N="688" /> think he failed to establish his case. There might well be a continuing moral duty on parents to leave something to a son or a daughter who had reached the age of 21 years.  Senator O'Kennedy gave the example of the university student.  A person might be half way through some period of training and in such cases it is possible that he would be placed at a disadvantage by an unjust or an imprudent testator.  There is also the case of an adult daughter on the farm who has contributed very considerably in an almost unpaid capacity to the building up of the value of the farm. She might be placed at a serious disadvantage by the testator.  Therefore, I would have confidence in the discretion of the court.  I think the section as it stands is better and covers a wider number of cases than the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the case against the amendment has been well made by Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  I considered very carefully at the drafting stage of the Bill the question of whether we should leave full discretion to the court or have restricted categories of dependants and I came down on the side of leaving full discretion to the court.  The more one thinks of this the more one can arrive at an infinite variety of cases where there is a moral duty owing by the parents to children outside whatever restricted categories one might devise. I do not agree with Senator FitzGerald's narrow definition of moral duty.  A moral duty is a duty owing by one person to another and the circumstances in which such a moral duty arises can go beyond the moral duties of parenthood.  However, here we are dealing with the moral duties of parenthood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the question of education.  Quite obviously in the society in which we live, and in the society of the future, this will arise to an ever-increasing extent.  There will be the moral duty owing by the parent to the child for the continuation of a higher education. There is also the more usual case <Col N="689" /> in rural Ireland&mdash;and anyone who has knowledge of rural Ireland will bear me out&mdash;of the daughter who remained at home to look after her parents and who, by reason of that sacrifice, has probably missed her prospects of marriage.  The other sons and daughters have gone from the home.  She may be over 21 years, or 31 years, or 41 years, and have lost her prospects of marriage.  Surely there is a moral duty owing to her in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the infinite variety of cases there are.  I must come down very strongly on the side of the broad phraseology of the section as it stands.  The section provides that, where the court is of opinion that the testator has failed in his moral duty to make provision for the child, the court may order that such provision shall be made for the child as the court thinks just, and I think that is better than the narrow category of moral duty which arises from the introduction of the test of infancy. Similarly, I think the attitude in regard to maintenance in Senator FitzGerald's amendment is again too restrictive.  The mere maintenance of a child during infancy may not meet the infinite variety of cases, some of which I have mentioned.  It is better to leave it to the discretion of the court.</P>

      <P>It is a question of how far one thinks one should go to impose on people by legislation the duty of being moral.  How can you define &ldquo;moral&rdquo;?  This is a matter of judgment and opinion.  One obviously goes a certain distance.  There are some things in this Bill which are desirable because they impose on people an obligation to carry out a moral duty of a specific character, although I would draw the line slightly differently from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Points made in the discussion suggest that the amendment as drafted is unsatisfactory.  I was absent from the discussion here on Committee Stage. If I had been present, I would, no <Col N="690" /> doubt, have learnt from it at that stage and this amendment might have been better formed.  I believe that there does not exist a moral duty of a kind we should enforce between a parent and an adult child capable of earning his living and standing on his own feet. This does not seem to me to be the kind of moral duty the Legislature should enforce.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in Senator Sheehy Skeffington's speech in favour of the system of hereditary capitalism and I was very startled to find myself to the left of him in this respect!  This determination that property should pass on to the next generation seems to me something we cherish unduly and we are, in this respect, I feel, a little too bourgeois&mdash;but Senator Sheehy Skeffington might not perhaps agree with me on that!</P>

      <P>Yes; they are on the same ground.  Since Committee Stage, the House may have noted perhaps that I had occasion to visit some of the courthouses in the West, and what I had to say on Committee Stage about the size of the judges' rooms in some of these establishments &mdash;perhaps Senator Flanagan can bear me out in this since he was county surveyor for Mayo for a great number of years&mdash;is still valid.  There is no doubt that the judges' rooms in the West of Ireland&mdash;and I should think it applies equally to many other parts of Ireland&mdash;are such that it would not be possible to fit five people in at a time; therefore the requirement that these applications to a judge should be made in chambers is a physical impossibility.</P>
      <P>I recognise the point raised by the Minister on the last occasion that it is desirable to have these applications with the minimum of formality and as inexpensively as possible, and in this amendment I make it quite clear that the &ldquo;in chambers&rdquo; type of hearing will continue, that it will be heard in such part of the courthouse as the judge may determine, without pleadings, which means there will be no formality, and in private.  That gives the maximum privacy to the persons making the application.  To require judges, litigants and their legal advisers to try to fit themselves into some of the judges' chambers in courts in this country is unreasonable because of the size of these rooms and indeed in some cases the condition in which they are kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister on the last occasion said that the size of these places and their condition were matters for the local authority.  That is so, but every local authority has to deal with other matters, such as the housing of the poor, improvement of hospitals, and so on, and I would think that the building or renovation of courthouses takes a very low priority among the priorities of local authorities.  Consequently we may expect that in the <Col N="692" /> next 20 or 30 years the judges' rooms in courthouses throughout the country will be inadequate for the kind of proceedings we contemplate should be heard here.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that what would happen was that the judges would take these applications half an hour before the court sat.  I do not contemplate that there should be any such summary disposal of business before the judges in chamber, because these things will involve perhaps the disclosure of a fairly lengthy family history, an offer by one party justifying what the deceased has done and a submission by the other party to show that the deceased's actions were unreasonable and prejudiced.</P>
    <P>It would be a gross mistake to think that this can be dealt with in the same way as an income tax appeal, where the matter is laid out on a balance sheet and the question arises as to whether or not a particular property or income is assessable to income tax. That will not apply in cases of this kind where you are dealing with family affairs which are always tedious and tortuous.  Nor indeed do I think it would be fair to the family concerned that they would get a public hearing. Consequently, the appropriate way to deal with this is to ensure that all reasonable accommodation is given to the parties involved, and that certainly cannot be done in the numerous judges' rooms provided in courts throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, may I say that &ldquo;in chambers&rdquo; means&mdash;according to the way it has been defined in law&mdash;&ldquo;in the judge's room&rdquo;.  It is useless to say that the judge can decide that he will hear it in any other place in the courthouse he likes.  That is not the definition given in Stroud's Legal Dictionary.  &ldquo;In chambers&rdquo; means &ldquo;in the judge's room&rdquo; and it would be physically impossible in a number of judges' rooms to have decisions elsewhere.  If the Minister has a Supreme Court decision I certainly will feel bound by that but I have not been able to uncover such decision.  The Minister has greater facilities than I, with the staff he has at his disposal, and I shall be glad to hear of it.  He <Col N="693" /> should have interrupted me much earlier.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the view the Minister may have.  In my opinion the amendment, although it appears to give greater flexibility, in fact, appears to me to make the position more inflexible because I believe &ldquo;in chambers&rdquo; is a well-known term. It is something which can be interpreted rather loosely and which could mean in certain circumstances, for instance, in one of those remote and dilapidated courthouses which Senator O'Quigley describes down in the west on Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This discussion is largely academic.  We are all of the one mind in seeking to have the proceedings concerning family matters carried out as expeditiously and inexpensively as possible and with as little fuss as possible.  Senator O'Quigley seeks to define the way in which this is done, rather than using the well tried legal phrase &ldquo;In chambers&rdquo; to describe such a procedure. There is a danger in this very definition and it is better to rely on the definition which has been used by the Supreme Court in the case of the Redbreast Preserving Co. Limited, 91. I.L.T.R. 12.  In that decision the Supreme Court defined the term &ldquo;in chambers&rdquo; as &ldquo;a place, other than a court to which the public are freely admitted&rdquo;.  The practice has been that the judge sits wherever he considers most convenient to everyone, in fact, any place to which the public are not freely admitted.  Therefore, in his hotel room, or anywhere else convenient for the purposes of the suit, meets the case. <Col N="694" /> It is a term which has been defined in a Supreme Court decision.  This is the term which meets what we want here, that is, to have these proceedings conducted in private.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I should require, in the latter part of subsection (4) of section 119, that they should be precluded from taking any share in the legal right or on intestacy.  But, there are cases of, perhaps, attempted murder which must <Col N="695" /> be technically classed as attempted murder.  Under this section we are taking away the right of&mdash;let us call him the victim&mdash;to forgive.  I feel we should leave it to him.  Perhaps, through some temporary lapse, which could not be classified as insanity in any way, a person attempts to, perhaps, assault or goes very nearly as far as what might be classified as attempted murder.  We are, under this Bill, precluding such a person for ever from taking any gift under the will of the victim.  I think such people should be allowed to forgive the person, if they thought fit, and in a latter instrument or under a will should be allowed to leave or give some of their property to that person.  It should be a right left to them, and left to them alone.  We should not take it away from them.</P>
    <P>I agree that a person who murders must be precluded but I think an attempted murder might be an offence, perhaps, which can only be technically classed as an attempted murder.  That is, in the case of a person who cannot be found guilty of insanity.  I feel that person will, very often, be forgiven. I feel we should leave it open to the victim to forgive the offender, if he thinks fit, and give some of his property, later on by will, or by some previous instrument.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to accept subsection (2) of amendment No. 45 particularly.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) of section 119, as amended by an amendment of mine on Committee Stage, now reads:</P>
      <P>A sane person who has been guilty of the murder, attempted murder or manslaughter of another shall be precluded from taking any share in the estate of that other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Senator Cole is seeking to exclude is attempted murder which, to put it mildly, is a very serious offence, probably the next most serious offence after murder itself.  The example given by Senator Cole related to an insane person, but, when the crime is committed by a sane person, public policy <Col N="696" /> in the North and in Britain has been that that person is not entitled to benefit from his or her crime.  Senator Cole's amendment would mean that if a man in all sanity sets out to attempt to murder another man, he will be allowed to benefit from the will of the man whom he attempted to murder.</P>

        <i>(Longford):</i> Is there a clear definition of manslaughter in this context?  Perhaps there is a legal definition of manslaughter. I know people have been charged with manslaughter in the case of death as the result of a motor car accident.  Would a person who killed the testator with a motor car and who is thereby deemed to be convicted of manslaughter, be debarred from benefiting under the will?  I want to get it nailed down whether there is a clear definition of manslaughter in this particular context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one offence that is known as manslaughter in criminal law.  In certain circumstances, that could include killing by a motor car but the circumstances are so remote that there have been very few manslaughter convictions over the years for dangerous driving causing death.  There have been so few cases that it was necessary in the 1961 Road Traffic Act to introduce a list of offences to deal with that particular category.  I would certainly defend manslaughter being introduced if a jury of 12 men brought in such a verdict. <Col N="699" /> It would have to be very serious to justify such a verdict.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that what I have to say relates to amendment No. 47.  I am a bit unhappy about this amendment.  I think the Minister would rightly say that a person should not be allowed to benefit from the consequences of a criminal act, particularly murder, attempted murder and manslaughter.  This is a pretty general principle of the law but distinction should be drawn between murder and manslaughter on the one hand and attempted murder, on the other.  In the case of murder, a death has been caused and the person who has caused that death cannot be allowed, in law, to benefit from the consequences of his act.  He should not be allowed to benefit because of that act.  Death has not resulted in the case of attempted murder, which is a very grave and serious offence.  As Senator McQuillan has said, 20, 30 or 40 years could elapse and the person who attempted the murder might receive some benefit from the person whom he had attempted to murder.  I would be a little unhappy if I thought the person who had been attacked was precluded from making a will in favour of his attacker of some years past.</P>
      <P>That is where the distinction should really be drawn.  Murder or manslaughter is a definite and final act which would confer immediate benefit on the person who brought about the death.  I can see the Minister's difficulty in connection with the person who, by force, or by threat, attempted to kill a person, but, again, I think the difficulty there would be more apparent in that the will made in such circumstances, if there were evidence on which to challenge it, could not possibly be upheld in our courts.  I feel there is a real point in Senator Cole's amendment and that it is one that is worthy of consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pursue the line followed by Senator O'Kennedy.  The Minister has said he cannot see the logic of this amendment. I must confess I cannot for the life of me see the logic of the Minister's argument against it.  The Minister has argued that he is, in fact, giving mere statutory force to the common law principle that a person cannot benefit from his own crime.  He then proceeds to argue not from the issue that there is any benefit from the crime of attempted murder to the person who attempted the murder, but rather just because attempted murder is a serious crime.  The principle he has invoked of a person not being able to benefit from his own crime bears no relation to whether or not that crime is serious. If he wishes merely to give statutory force to this principle he must, indeed, convince us that there is real benefit flowing from the crime of attempted murder.  As Senator O'Kennedy said there is a very clear distinction here, and I would urge the Minister to distinguish between the principle of not benefiting through the commission of a crime and the completely different matter of the degree of seriousness of the different crimes.  If the Minister attempts to hold hard on this principle he is not, in fact, adhering to the common law principle.  He is saying that attempted murder is so heinous a crime that it must be punished in this way.  This is a new departure.  This is a new sanction against the crime of attempted murder and it is not in line with the principle he seeks to invoke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Dooge said.  I wonder is the Minister under a misapprehension on this point.  He started to argue that people should not benefit from the consequences of their crime and he changed feet with remarkable suddenness when he realised where that was leading him.  He must have an appreciation of what is involved here. It seems to me absolutely intolerable that a man should be forbidden to forgive another.  If he wishes to exercise Christian charity and decides to leave something to someone who <Col N="701" /> attacked him in the past, near or distant, we should not intervene to prevent him from doing that on purely specious grounds.  This is introducing a completely new principle that if a serious crime of some sort is involved a person should be precluded from leaving something to the person who committed the crime.  There is also the crime of assault in which the person who was attacked might suffer more than the person who was the victim of attempted murder.  There are other serious crimes such as the crime of incest.  The Minister has made no case. In the course of the discussions we have made a number of points and the Minister has made a case and come down on one side or another.  This is the first time he has totally failed to produce any logical or coherent defence.  I appeal to him in the light of the opinions that have been expressed from both sides of the House to reconsider his decision.</P>

This is a case where the person attacked forgives his attacker.  I cannot put it in any plainer terms.  He forgives many years afterwards and he wishes to leave something to this man for conscience's sake, or for his own sake. He says: &ldquo;I will leave him money in my will, to prove it&rdquo;.  In any case, he decides to give this person something later on in life or in his will.  I think it would be appalling that we should stop that man from doing it.  That is the gist of the matter.  I feel that if the Minister consulted his moral advisers or even his theological advisers, of whom we have heard, he would then accept the principle involved here. If somebody attempts to murder me and if, years afterwards, I want to leave that person something in my will, I do not think it right that this House or anybody else should stop me from so doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 47:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 40, line 39, to add at the end &ldquo;provided that this subsection shall not apply in a case where the offence is one under <Col N="706" /> section 53 (1) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 or where the offence was committed more than three years before the date of death of the deceased or where the deceased by will or by other overt act forgave such person the offence.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides that a person who has been found guilty of causing death or serious bodily harm, or against a spouse or any child of the deceased, will not be precluded from taking a share as a legal right or on intestacy where that offence was committed more than three years before the date of the death of the deceased and where the deceased, by will or other overt act, forgave such person the offence.  Subsection (4) of section 119, in effect, notifies that where a person has been found guilty of an offence under section 53 of the Road Traffic Act that person shall not be entitled to take a share in the estate or on intestacy.  Subsection (2) (a) of section 53 of the Road Traffic Act is, of course, designed to deal with the very serious offence of causing death or serious bodily harm to a person by dangerous driving.  But there can be cases where a spouse or a child of the deceased can be found guilty of this offence and at the same time if the person affected by the accident, in the case of serious bodily harm, has forgiven that, then the person who caused the injury should not be precluded from taking a share in the estate, legal right or on intestacy.</P>
    <P>If a father and son are driving from a football match and the son is driving and through a moment's inadventence which a jury would say is dangerous because he should not have passed out that particular lorry at that point knowing the amount of traffic on the road, and the jury would conclude that it was dangerous driving, that is not the kind of criminality that we have in mind in section 119. If the father should die intestate it would be the last thing that the father might wish.  If the son has suffered the remorse of having killed him and had to undergo a trial and afterwards perhaps serve a term of imprisonment in addition why should you pile on the punishment by depriving him of a share <Col N="707" /> in his estate?  The same thing could apply in the case of a wife or a husband causing the death or serious bodily harm to a spouse.  It seems to me and to a number of people with whom I have discussed it that subsection (4) as it is drafted at present would prevent the son or spouse in the cases I have just outlined from taking shares as a legal right in the case of the spouse or intestacy in the case of the child.  The amendment should be accepted by the House to put beyond doubt that this is not the kind of criminal offence that we wish to punish.</P>
    <P>There is another very important principle involved, and on this I am glad to see the Minister getting back to the common law.  I was inclined to refer to the common law but I felt that the Minister being a progressive, forward-looking, non-feudal type of man would have no regard for the common law, and I am delighted to find we are going back upon this solid foundation of legal thinking.  Under the common law it was always regarded that where a person who had been convicted of a crime paid the penalty imposed by society he should, therefore, be regarded as having purged his guilt and entitled as far as society is concerned to live without further disability. If a person undergoes a term of imprisonment and perhaps pays a fine for causing serious bodily harm to somebody such as a parent, then as far as the Legislature and public morality and society are concerned that person has paid the price of his criminal negligence, and when that has been done we should not visit any further penalties upon him or import into family relationships a penalty such as is provided in this paragraph.  For that reason I would think that in order to remove this beyond all doubt the amendment which is here suggested should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help feeling that this section could go a little bit more than was intended when this Bill was drafted.  In the case of a person who merely suffers serious bodily harm as a result of an offence of this nature it does mean that he can point out <Col N="708" /> to the victim, as it were, that unless the victim makes a will he cannot inherit anything from him, but of course in these circumstances the victim might be inclined to make a will so as to rectify the situation.  However, in the case where a person was killed as a result of an offence under section 53 of the Road Traffic Act, then there would be no opportunity for the victim to rectify the situation, and it might be a situation where there was certainly dangerous driving but nothing in the nature of vindictiveness or an intention to harm the person or to kill him.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances it seems to me that it is very hard that a person guilty of this offence should be deprived of the rights which he otherwise would have on intestacy or from the point of view of legal right.  It is true, of course, that this may very seldom occur.  It is also true that in the present situation and the present climate in regard to road traffic offences a Bill should not do anything that would tend to overlook the gravity of these offences or to play them down in any way.  Nevertheless, it seems to me that this section does go a bit too far.  Whether or not the amendment suggested by Senator O'Quigley is the most appropriate way of dealing with it, I think the Minister should try to mitigate it in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are concerned to a certain extent here with somewhat the same type of situation as on the last amendment.  A case could arise, though it may be academic, where a husband and wife would be driving together in a car and the spouse who happens to be driving might be found guilty of dangerous driving causing the death of the other who was a passenger in the car.  The husband or wife could throughout their married life have been perfectly worthy and indeed an admirable partner in every sense and because of one act which amounted to dangerous driving and which is irrevocable could thereby be precluded from the benefit which this Bill quite rightly intends to confer on husbands or wives who have lived together in proper married unions.  For <Col N="709" /> that reason I would support Senator Ryan's attitude that this particular case of dangerous driving causing death could deprive a spouse of the great benefits which the Bill is giving to him or her.</P>
      <P>The Minister might draw his attention to this aspect, and he could go further in connection with dangerous driving causing serious bodily harm because in that case the person could survive and it would work greater hardship still.  I do not think it is right that such a person should be precluded from taking a share as legal right or on intestacy, precluded from the new benefits which this Bill is conferring, and precluded also from the share he would have hitherto had. That would be a very severe penalty. A situation could arise many years later of an intestacy and because somebody had been found guilty of some such offence he would be precluded. Whatever about not giving the benefit of the new provisions under the Bill, I do not think he should be restricted from the benefits he would have had hitherto on intestacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this.  There is here a principle similar to that in the previous amendment.  In certain of these cases a person must be entitled to forgive, in this case by some overt act or by will, and I do not see why we should stop him.  As the last Senator said, it could in a few cases happen that where a husband and wife were driving together the wife through some lapse would be deprived of her livelihood, as it were. I think the Minister should look at that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fundamental difference between this provision and the provision to the amendment to which I have already agreed. In the case of the murder, attempted murder and manslaughter issue which we were debating, the person so involved was precluded even from benefiting under a will.  In this case the only penalty is that a legal right or intestate share shall not apply.  However, the person can forgive in his will and make proper allowances for <Col N="710" /> the person responsible for the type of offence set out here.</P>
      <P>That makes the situation entirely different.  I should like to emphasise that the offence envisaged here under section 53 of the Road Traffic Act is one for which a sentence of up to five years imprisonment can be given.  It is one in respect of which very few convictions have been obtained since it was introduced under the 1961 Road Traffic Act.  It is a very serious offence which goes on indictment to trial by jury.  There are many road traffic offences for which imprisonment of up to six months can be given, but they are not included.  The offence set out here is a very serious one.  From reading leading articles, listening to comments and reading reports of accidents, it can be seen that the whole climate of opinion in this country is very seriously concerned about this problem of road traffic offences.  It would be against public policy, particularly when the Government are contemplating further, more stringent road traffic measures, to delete this provision.  The sort of driving involved here is very serious, very dangerous driving which causes serious bodily harm or a fatality.  That is not the sort of driving for which a summary conviction can be obtained.</P>
      <P>I should like to impress upon the Seanad the distinction here.  I gave in on the previous section because of the plea that was made: why not allow the person to forgive?  That was the plea that touched my simple heart.  However, in this case the forgiveness can be implemented by the person who has suffered grievous bodily harm.  The matter can be cured by way of will. Senator O'Kennedy mentioned the case of a man and wife together.  Again, the sort of driving that would impel a jury to convict a man and imprison him for dangerous driving causing the death of his wife&mdash;or <i>vice versa</i> in regard to the wife causing the death of the husband&mdash;would have to be very serious and heinous driving.</P>

      <P>No.  It must be an offence punishable by imprisonment for a maximum period of two years. In that instance, there would be no question of a suspensory sentence.  It would mean jail, not necessarily for five years but certainly for six months, a year or 18 months.  The main point is that for practical purposes the only case meriting sympathy that emerged from the discussion was Senator O'Kennedy's case of the man and wife. No jury in this country would convict a man and send him to jail, unless the offence was heinous.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the case in which a man and his wife are travelling in a car and one or other is killed in a road accident where many other people are killed as well.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Miss Davidson may have a point in this because what is in the Road Traffic Act is: &ldquo;shall be liable on conviction on indictment to penal servitude for any term not exceeding five years&rdquo;.  What is sought to be established in this section is the kind of crime where the minimum punishment is two years, indeed even more than that, which certainly falls within the category of serious crime.  I am not at all sure whether &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; is not the correct word.  However that may be, it emphasises the need for reading this thing with great caution.</P>
      <P>The Minister has spoken, and I do not disagree with him, about the seriousness of road traffic offences and the general climate of public opinion in regard to them.  The truth is that there is not the same type of criminality feeling in the public mind about dangerous driving and careless driving as there is, say, about assault or rape or crimes of that kind.  We dealt with murder, which we all abhor, and manslaughter, in earlier sections but in this section we are prohibiting a boy, driving his father and who causes his father serious injury or death, from sharing in the intestacy of his father.  We are prohibiting a childless wife who has caused the death of her husband from getting anything on his death.  You will get the man who will say: &ldquo;God bless the Minister for Justice, I do not have to make a will because if I die without children my wife will get everything under the new Bill&rdquo;.  Take the childless couple driving along.  The property owner is killed and the surviving spouse is found guilty of causing death or serious bodily harm.  The property owner may have felt that there was no need to make a will because under this Bill his wife would get everything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a reality.  It will come home to roost some day on some unfortunate spouse who will not bless those responsible for it.  That person will be left destitute even for the crime of causing serious bodily harm.  There is no limitation in the section.  In section 53 of the Road Traffic Act, causing serious bodily harm merits punishment of up to five years.  Here we determine the crime not by the amount of punishment meted out by the court but by assessing it at the level of a crime punishable by a maximum period of two years.  Grave and serious injury will be done to somebody some day if we do not adopt this amendment.</P>
      <P>I had a case of a mother and daughter driving home from Croagh Patrick, a most blessed occasion, one would imagine.  The daughter was driving and going through a crossroads which she did not know because of the configuration of the houses, and right in the middle of the crossroads there was a head-on crash.  She was brought up on a dangerous driving charge for causing her mother serious bodily harm.  There was no doubt in the judge's mind that there was serious dangerous driving and it was touch and go whether that lady was acquitted.  Thanks be to God for Mayo juries, she was acquitted. She might well not have been and who was to say that that mother, who got into the witness box to give evidence against her daughter, if she had died intestate would feel that she wanted her daughter deprived of everything? It is not in accord with experience or with humanity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the seriousness of offences under the Road Traffic Act.  The fact is that the Supreme Court does not regard the crime of drunken driving, which I regard as a more serious offence than mere dangerous driving&mdash;I regard it as a potentially greater crime&mdash;in that light.  On the constitutionality of the Road Traffic Act, the Supreme Court decided that drunken driving was a minor offence capable of being decided summarily.  That was an indication of the view there is on road traffic offences.  I do not think anybody will <Col N="714" /> want to have people deprived of their share of intestacy or legal right in this fashion.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case I referred to of a childless couple.  The property owner says he will not bother making a will because his partner will get everything on his death and the surviving spouse will be deprived of everything under the subsection as it stands. I urge the Minister to reconsider this and adopt the reasonable approach suggested in the amendment.  If he does, nobody will blame him for it but many will commend him.</P>

On re-reading the Bill, it seems that what we are now doing is providing that even where a person does take out a grant of administration or indeed proves a will&mdash;because subsection (2) refers to the personal representative of the deceased&mdash;the people entering upon the land, notwithstanding that they have taken the appropriate legal steps to put their title in order, will not be entitled to hold their shares as tenants in common.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion the Minister pointed out that the defects or the abolition of tenancies in common of the holding of land upon death could be cured by taking out administration. I had some doubts about that and I referred to some statements the Minister made.  I cannot put my finger on the particular column now but he made it clear that if a man died intestate, leaving a wife and children and they all enter upon the land, whereas at present those on the land acquire the shares of those out of possession as joint tenants but retain their own original shares as tenants in common, they could continue to retain their shares as tenants in common, if they took out administration. It is now clear, I think, when one looks at subsection (2), that even taking out administration does not retain the tenancies in common because it provides:</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) shall apply whether or not any such person entered into possession as personal representative of the deceased, or having entered, was subsequently granted representation to the estate of the deceased.</P>
    <P>That presupposes taking out a grant of administration or having entered into it, has subsequently been granted representation to the estate of the deceased.  I do not quite follow how the Minister had in mind&mdash;he may be able to clear this up&mdash;that this could be cured.  I understood from him that once we took out a grant of administration, whether a grant of representation or probate, the persons were entitled to hold the land as tenants <Col N="717" /> in common but subsection (2) seems to eliminate that.</P>
    <P>As I said on the previous occasion, suppose you had the case of two brothers remaining on a farm and even now if one took out a grant of representation and got married and there are four other children of the family away and living off the land, each of them originally would take one-sixth share as tenant in common and the two persons who remained on would in due time become owners of the other four shares as joint tenants. But I was instancing the case of one of the two brothers marrying and if he died, under this section as it is now drafted, even though he had taken out a grant of representation to his father, upon his death intestate, his original one-sixth share will go to the unmarried brother who has remained on the farm and the other four-sixths will pass by survivorship to the other brother who remains on the farm and he will have his original one-sixth as well so that the wife and family would have no share whatever in the holding.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of case one meets not infrequently in rural Ireland.  You do have the fellow who marries: the boy or the girl gets married and the other girl remains on.  You do have this brother or sister relationship, the aunt or the uncle in the house with the married person and his or her family.  It seems that under this section if the married person dies intestate, all the property upon his or her death will pass to the surviving brothers or sisters, as the case may be, who have been on the farm since the death of the father. I think that is very undesirable and consequently I think subsection (2) should be deleted to provide that where a grant has been taken out, they should still be entitled, as under the present law, to hold on to their shares as tenants in common.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Minister can make the argument that if they take out a grant, they should then proceed to have the title registered in the Land Registry and the appropriate assents given in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.  That is so.  If people did what they ought to do, there would not be <Col N="718" /> half the need for law and lawyers and court proceedings.  Many people think that once they go to a solicitor and get him to take out a grant of administration and then keep away from him so that they will not have to pay his fees for years, once he has told them the grant of administration is out, everything is in order.  That is what happens and will continue to happen. They keep away from the solicitor when the grant is out and eventually they will find themselves in the situation I have described, and instead of owning some land as they would under the present system as tenants in common, some share in the house or the property would be held as a joint tenancy, with the eventual result that the lot will pass to the survivor who in some cases may be an unmarried brother or sister and who will be in a position then to oust, as he or she wishes, the widow and children of the man who got married.</P>
    <P>What we are concerned with in this Bill is to protect those people whose own incapacity or whose system of life exposes them to being deprived of what, in all justice, they should get.  That is all we are trying to do when we introduce the legal right share and the making of other arrangements.  The existence of subsection (2)&mdash;indeed I think the whole of section 124&mdash;is the kind of thing that will undoubtedly, again in that small number of cases, bring to them the kind of hardship that in other cases we are protecting people against.</P>
    <P>It would be a serious hardship if many people who up to the present think that, having taken out administration, they are all right, find themselves in the position where they own nothing, believing themselves to own something.  Consequently, I would press on the Minister the desirability of deleting subsection (2) so that in the case where a person takes the initial step to regularise his title and vest the property properly in himself, he will not find himself in the position the Minister says is good enough for the people who take no steps, pay no revenue and do nothing about putting their title in order.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator has come back to the stage of misconception he was at before I removed the misconception.  This section does not apply to any case where administration is carried out.  It is designed purely to cover any case where people are in adverse possession. Subsection (2) may appear to apply to a case where administration is taken out, but it does not, if you read it.  It says:</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) shall apply whether or not any such person entered into possession as personal representative of the deceased, or having entered, was subsequently granted representation to the estate of the deceased.</P>
      <P>This is designed to cover the case of a person who enters into possession as personal representative&mdash;a person who may have been granted representation but has done nothing to adminiter the estate.  This happens on many occasions.  No administration takes place.  A grant has been taken out but nothing is done about it.  The personal representative can be in adverse possession just as much as those people who never took out a grant can be in adverse possession.  In our system, where that adverse possession takes place for six years, it means you have much clearer title.  You have two people remaining on as joint tenants, holding between themselves or between themselves and everybody else, as joint tenants.  You have not a separate form of tenancy side by side whereby they hold as tenants in common. One or two sons may remain on in the family holding, the rest having gone abroad.  If they remain on and make no effort in the way of administration but merely remain on for six years or more, they acquire as joint tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A close reading of the section makes <Col N="720" /> it plain that this applies whether or not representation was taken out or not.  If they remain on for six years or more and do nothing about administering the estate, the acquisition of title by possession is as joint tenants, which I think is a good thing.  If either of them makes an effort not alone to take out a grant but to administer the estate and register it, he is then registered as tenant in common and his right is preserved.</P>

      <P>I can see a good deal of force in the Minister's argument. I should be happier if I thought the kind of situation I feel will arise would not arise.  This section will be a Godsend to the solicitors' profession, like many sections of this Bill.  It is certainly going to make it obligatory on people to do things they have never done before or pay the consequences in terms of their shares in land and other property.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it is possible for the Minister, through any of the agencies of information he has available to him, to bring this section, which can have drastic consequences for some people, to their notice.  People who are now tenants in common of particular parts of lands&mdash;if the Minister is correct in saying this applies to cases already in progress&mdash;will, on the coming into operation of this Act, become joint tenants and then section 124 applies.  That seems to me to be rather drastic.  I hope the Minister can find some widespread medium of communication to bring this to the notice of the wide variety of people who may find themselves in this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the number of section 52 applications occuring in the Circuit Courts all over the country.  This is going to change drastically the position of all those <Col N="721" /> people who at present feel a certain sense of security under the old laws of distribution and intestacy, who felt they owned a real interest in the form of a tenancy in common of the lands. From now on, the situation will be quite different.  I assume also if people want to sever the joint tenancy for the purpose of registration of title, they can do so?</P>

      <P>I am trying to be helpful.  I intend to give publicity to these two sections because I regard them as the two best sections in the Bill.  The fact that now you can clear up title in any case&mdash;and there are numerous such cases&mdash;where people have not bothered to register or declare their tenancy in common by enabling a joint tenancy to be acquired in six years, not 12 years as heretofore, means you are going to have many more holdings than heretofore where title can be definitely established.  That is the great merit in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few observations about the <Col N="724" /> Bill and the debate in general.  From the records I have here, we have debated this Bill over a period of five days and in the course of that time there have been 42 amendments of which 23 came from the floor of the House and the balance were from the Minister.  The Seanad can take some satisfaction in that record, that we have made these amendments to the Bill on our own part and that the Minister has seen fit to accept quite a number of suggestions which were made on the Committee Stage and, in fact, accepted some of our amendments.</P>
      <P>At this point I should like to say, from this side of the House, that we do appreciate the attitude of the Minister to the various amendments which were put down and the various points which were expressed from all sides of the House.  One can only regret that the great opportunity which the Minister had in this Bill of covering himself with considerable glory was lost by him.  Of course, he was riding a bad horse from the beginning.  It came from the stable that bred the Bill that proposed to make it illegal for a man to leave the whole of his estate to his wife.  That was the stable companion of this Bill.  Of course, the Minister was carrying a great weight and was much handicapped in piloting this measure through the House.  Having said that, it is as much as one can say against the Minister. He was labouring under that handicap. It is a great pity that he did not surmount it.</P>
      <P>There was a great fund of knowledge, information and commonsense available in this House and the Bill which is now being passed bears witness to all of that.  In a complicated measure of this kind, it is reasonable to expect that when it begins to operate and numerous lawyers and judges begin to look at it some defects will show up.  If that does happen, and even if it happens to the sacred cow enshrined in Part IX, I do hope the Minister will take the necessary steps to amend the law in the light of experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel quite certain, judging by the open-mindedness the Minister has <Col N="725" /> shown on this Bill and the generally reasonable approach he has adopted, that he will do just that and, if it turns out that Part IX is not what the form books would indicate, that the Minister will come back to the House with amendments, if it falls to him to do that.  It is pessimistic on my part, I suppose, to expect that it will fall to him.  I should say that a Minister for Justice will do that.</P>
    <P>I do hope that in relation to such matters as require publicity, the kind of thing I was referring to on sections 124 and 125, the Minister will take the opportunity to bring these matters to the notice of the general public.  It would be most regrettable, in connection with an enactment which is primarily designed to bring about improvements in the lot of people on the death of their relations, if their lot were to be disimproved by anything that is contained in this Bill merely for the want of adequate publicity.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in the course of the debate the old business of this being a lawyer's approach, and so on, was knocked on the head by the Minister. Judging from this Bill, there will be more work for lawyers than ever before.  That is the view of lawyers. Some of the amendments suggested here were designed to eliminate or reduce the need for legal assistance.  I trust that when the Bill is launched by the Minister it will bring the rewards to which the efforts this House put into it entitle it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with the tributes to the Minister for his handling of the Bill and for the very open approach he brought to the Committee Stage.  What is in the Bill reflects the triumph of public opinion.  It also reflects very much the willingness of the Minister to listen and learn.  Both are excellent, coming after such a disastrous beginning as this Bill had.  It was, perhaps, the worst exhibition of a misguided bureaucracy we have had in my period of eight years in the Seanad.  Fortunately it has served its purpose.  The public were awakened into an awareness and alarm, which was shown, and <Col N="726" /> the alarm was shared by all sides of the House.  The result is that we now have a measure passing which is almost unrecognisable from the first version printed.  That is a triumph for democracy and one which we would not hesitate to use as a glorious example in the future.</P>
      <P>It we wanted to add to that we might acknowledge the very valuable contributions made in this debate today by the front bench of the Government Party which, combined with all others, was instrumental in getting the Minister to accept a couple of very valuable amendments.  All this is excellent. I would ask the Minister to continue the good work of listening and learning because they were the central features of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The legal right provision seems to have a rigidity which may cause a great deal of trouble in agricultural and industrial circles and may cause a great deal of upset in the pattern there.  The Minister should keep a watchful eye on this.  He should invite those organisations, both professional and rural who helped and contributed so much over the past year and a half, to continue their watching brief and to see defects, whether they be defects in the Bill itself, or undue litigation caused by it.  These defects should be brought to the Minister's notice, studied, and amended as soon as is practicable.  If that is done, I think we will be will on the road to real law reform, a reform in which all sections of the community play their full and rightful part.</P>
      <P>Again, we can do no more than congratulate the Minister on his open-mindedness and willingness.  I might say it is only something we might expect from one who served a five-year apprenticeship and who cut his teeth on the PR Bill here in the Seanad with Senator O'Quigley strongly opposing him on that occasion.</P>

I am a completely non-legal person and, when I put forward my views, the Minister approached them in a very reasonable manner and, if I might say so, a <Col N="727" /> very human manner.  He put in an amendment arising out of a suggestion of mine which will bring great benefits to widowed spouses under this Bill.

I hope I may survive its passing for some little time.  At the same time, I must say I have been encouraged by the attitude of the House towards this Bill.  It was discussed from a non-political point of view.  I feel that a Bill of this nature, dealing as it does with very human and day-to-day problems, should always be discussed in such an environment.</P>
      <P>The Minister has certainly had a very difficult task on his hands, particularly on the Committee and Report Stages of this Bill.  It comes very easily from me, on this side of the House, to thank him for the way in which he listened to all the amendments put to him and to the arguments, some of which he accepted and some of which he rejected.</P>
      <P>Apart from some rather misguided remarks from time to time about the vested interests in this Bill, the House has done itself credit.  Indeed, the Minister has proved that the general reform which has taken place in the administration of justice nowadays is something which leaves us all encouraged and in a position to look optimistically to the future.</P>

      <P>The debate on the Succession Bill, both in the Dáil and Seanad, proved one thing at any rate, that is, that law reform, or improvements in the law, are not only matters for lawyers.  Lawyers, naturally, can bring their professional competence to bear on the problems involved, but these matters directly concern the ordinary citizen to a very important extent.  Many of the more valuable contributions, both here and in the Dáil, came from people who were not lawyers and who brought practical points of view to bear on this matter.  The law itself is concerned with protecting individual and his everyday behaviour in the community.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise one point, that is, that this Bill was introduced by my predecessor precisely on the basis that it was open to public comment and public discussion.  I continued his policy in that regard.  I want to emphasise that point in case there were any misconceptions either here or in the other House.  The whole purpose of the Bill was to enable public comment to be brought to bear on it.  Both my predecessor and I felt that a Bill such as this, which will affect the rights of every citizen in our community, should be open to the most detailed scrutiny.  Every suggestion put forward by the various professional bodies and by individuals in the way of representation to my Department and by all Parties in the Dáil and Seanad was given full consideration.  I am very thankful for the many suggestions which came from all those quarters throughout the very lengthy discussion &mdash; now lasting over 14 months&mdash;on this Bill.  I should like to thank, in particular, the Members of the Seanad for the very constructive debate we have had in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made an appeal in the Dáil to have this debate carried out on a non-Party basis.  That was accepted in the <Col N="729" /> Dáil but, even more so, in the Seanad, where there was a completely dispassionate and impartial investigation. That should be the first consideration in regard to law reform because one cannot in relation to law reform move too fast ahead of what people feel.  We must come to grips with the 1960s in regard to improvements in our legal machinery, but, at the same time, it can be a mistake to run too far ahead of people's opinions.  Reforms must secure acceptance from the community. It can do more harm than good if improvements in the law do not win favour from the people.</P>
    <P>I feel that this Bill, due to the very lengthy discussion and the number of amendments which have improved it, will get a wide measure of acceptance from our people.  I think it enshrines the fundamental principle which all of us had in mind that the surviving spouse should have a definite right under an estate, although we may have disagreed on the means of achieving that right.  This Bill does it in a certain way.  Senator O'Quigley and the Senator's Party in the Dáil wanted to do it in another way but we were all agreed that it should be done in some way.  Our hope would be that the way which has been adopted by a majority decision of the Dáil and the Seanad will ensure justice for the surviving spouse.</P>
    <P>Apart from that aspect, there were a number of other important technical matters in the Bill which have now been codified.  Practitioners can now find in this measure the full body of law relating to succession and the rights of succession in regard to property. This is very important and I hope in the years ahead in other spheres of law where, at the moment, we have many dispersed statutes, we will achieve codification like this, so that, as far as the public and the practitioners are concerned, the law can be located in one volume.</P>
    <P>It is important, I feel, as far as possible, that the law should be predictable and easily accessible.  If we can continue this work of codification, I would like to see the body of laws easy accessible and available to the <Col N="730" /> citizens where they may find their rights in one volume.  That is the project on which the Law Reform Section of the Department of Justice is working hard at the moment, as well as other measures to improve the actual administration of justice itself.</P>
    <P>I would like to say, in conclusion, there is no conflict in this sort of work or indeed in any work of Government between bureaucracy and democracy. The two can work hand in hand.  I would like to pay a tribute to the selfless work of the officials in the Department of Justice, the Law Reform Section, who have been responsible to a large degree for the backroom work on this particular measure.  Their work, combined with a critical examination by the public and a critical examination by the public representatives in the Dáil and the Seanad, has resulted in a measure of which we can be reasonably proud.  I would like to thank the Seanad for their kind remarks to myself personally and I only hope that the justification for all of us will be an Act which will function satisfactorily in the future.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Seanad would welcome a reconsideration by the Minister for Education of recent changes made by him in the Rules for National Schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the same good spirit will prevail for the remainder of our discussion as has prevailed during the last hour on the Succession Bill.  The motion deals with recent changes in the Rules for national schools and invites the House to have a look at them and perhaps go back to what the Rules were prior to last January.  Inevitably, in the discussion which has taken place so far, the main emphasis has been on those sections of the Rules dealing with corporal punishment, in particular in the national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm, at this stage, to remind the House that the motion <Col N="732" /> does not contain any condemnation of the teachers or any suggestion that they are a strange, savage tribe or anything like that.  Therefore, it is unreasonable on the part of certain people in this House to launch an attack on the mover of the motion on the basis that he had suggested in some way, in the course of his remarks, that the teaching profession, the national teachers in particular, were a dangerous group.</P>
    <P>I find myself bewildered by the fact that responsible Senators did not put their minds to the actual subject of the motion but instead concentrated on what I can only describe as a personal attack on the mover of the motion.  I am not here to defend the mover of the motion.  There is nobody better able to do that than he, but it is necessary that somebody should clarify the position apart from the mover of the motion in the light of the reports that have appeared in the papers.  When I say the papers, I mean the public Press.  It would appear, with the exception of one or two, that the sole subject of discussion in this House was the teachers.  The contributions made by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party were, in my opinion, scandalous in their effort to misrepresent the position and the statement of the mover of this motion.</P>
    <P>Let me put it quite clearly.  The personal opinion of the mover of this motion does not matter as far as corporal punishment is concerned.  If he wants to get rid of corporal punishment, he is entitled to that view and to express it.  He asks us in this motion to reconsider the position as far as the Rules are concerned and to go back to what they were last January.  As far as corporal punishment is concerned, it was clearly laid down, up to last January, that when corporal punishment was to be carried out, a cane, and a light one at that, was the only legal weapon to use and it could be used only on the palm of the hand.</P>
    <P>This Minister is not responsible for altering that Rule.  His predecessor who now holds another portfolio had responsibility at that time.  I am not criticising him today, especially in view <Col N="733" /> of the fact that he has shown a certain amount of courage within the past week or ten days in dealing with vested interests.  I certainly appreciate that, but the fact that he made a mistake on the issue of the alteration of these rules of punishment in the national schools is no reason why his successor should stand over that mistake.</P>
    <P>Another Minister brought in the Succession Bill and before it had passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas Deputy Lenihan had taken over as Minister for Justice.  Many changes were made which were an improvement on the Bill.  That Minister was not afraid to alter the proposals first made by his predecessor. That did not make him any smaller, and he did not lose any public regard. In fact, his stature has grown because of his attitude.  The Minister for Education, who has said many things of a progressive nature in his short term of office so far, should not fail to say what he really thinks on this issue of corporal punishment and he should not be afraid to go back to what the Rules were in January last.</P>
    <P>Many Ministers have good views on this question of punishment generally. For instance, in spite of the backwoodsmen who argued otherwise in the Dáil and on television, the Minister for Justice has said he believes the birch and the cat should not be brought back for young offenders.  He made a very strong case that that is not a deterrent, and that, in fact, the use of the cat brings a savage reaction and coarsens the individual who suffers that punishment.  He has said it is not a deterrent and that it does harm to the individual.  If that is the view taken in the case of hardened young criminals, why is it felt that the use of the cane and the fist and, as someone has said, the leg of a chair&mdash;and these things are not forbidden under the new regulations&mdash;will have a good effect on tender youth?  If we forbid the use of corporal punishment for criminals, why should we allow it for young children during the most formative periods of their lives?  That is something that deserves consideration <Col N="734" /> and the Minister should examine it.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister feels a certain sense of loyalty to his predecessor.  I believe that is the only reason why he faces this House and puts up the arguments he has put up so far for the retention of the present regulations. The previous Minister expressed the view that he favoured parent-teacher groups, as did the present Minister, but I am very chary of pronouncements made by Ministers over the years because I have seen so few of them brought to fruition.  In the Dáil in the past I heard agreement expressed that the school leaving age should be raised. That was back in 1958 and this is 1965, and there is no sign of it happening yet.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor was in favour of parent-teacher groups.  He left office and now we have his successor. We have no guarantee that the present Minister may not be gone inside another 12 months in another game of musical chairs so far as Ministerial office is concerned.  We all agree that one of the most important Ministries in the State is the Ministry of Education.  One would think that when a man is in that Ministry, he should be left there to do a good job.  All I can say of Ministers for Education in the past 15 years is that the more they change the more they remain the same.  That is the position as I see it so far as results are concerned.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister cannot contribute to this debate again, but I should like some member of his Party to tell us for him why the Rules were changed last January.  That is the kernel of this discussion.  Why were the Rules concerning corporal punishment changed?  Who thought it up? Was it the Minister?  Was it the Department?  Or was it someone outside? We had two very excellent contributions from Senator Brosnahan and Senator McAuliffe giving their views on the regulations.  Both were very eloquent spokesmen for the teachers' organisations and both said the National Teachers Organisation did not ask for the alteration and did not know anything about it.  They were not consulted.  If they were not consulted, <Col N="735" /> who was consulted?</P>
    <P>Why were the Rules changed?  If we could get an answer to that, I am sure there are a number of Senators who are not at present too sure of their position who might be persuaded to support this motion.  If we are not to get an answer, the only thing I can say at this stage is&mdash;and if I am wrong, I want my statement challenged and contradicted&mdash;that I believe the Minister's predecessor really intended to tighten up the position and to restrict the opportunities for corporal punishment, and that in some unfortunate way his wishes were not translated into effect in the regulations which were made at the time.  We have often seen something discussed at length in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and passed into legislation, and the minute a county manager or a higher civil servant got at it, he took a completely different view of the legislation from what Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas had in mind when the legislation was being passed.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister did not contemplate such a loosening of the control that could be exercised under the regulations relating to corporal punishment. That is my belief, and when I say that, I should like to know if I am correct.  If I am correct, then I think there is nothing in the world wrong with asking the Minister to go back to what the position was last January.  I may say, at this stage, that when Senator Brosnahan, for instance, discussed the change he welcomed the change that the Minister brought about.  That does not alter the fact that his organisation were not consulted.</P>
    <P>Senator Brosnahan put forward the case here that it was a good idea for the Minister to remove from the previous Rules references to pulling hair, and so on, and various forms of punishment which are in vogue in certain schools.  Senator Brosnahan's point was that the impression created on visitors from abroad was not a good one: I think I am not misquoting him when I put it that way.  That is a point of view.  Personally, it does not weigh <Col N="736" /> very heavily with me under these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I believe it is much more important to ensure that there is no harm or cruelty to the young children rather than to give a good impression to foreigners with regard to the rules in national schools.  I should prefer to see justice done at home rather than to satisfy visiting dignataries.  The same argument goes when people come here and are shown O'Connell Street and some of our fine buildings.  We make perfectly sure, in the tour, that we keep them away from the dilapidated and broken-down parts of the city. We want to create a good impression abroad and to show the foreigner that we are up to date and civilised.  As far as schools are concerned, we would not dream of putting anything into the rules that would give an indication or an idea to an outsider that these particular types of punishment are utilised in our schools.  However, it is a point made by one of the teachers' representatives and I must say that I do not agree with it because these things are being done.  The pulling of hair goes on.  The severe pinching of young people's cheeks goes on.  The twisting of ears goes on and the use of other than light canes goes on in the national schools.  I am satisfied from my own investigation that these types of punishment are carried out in many of our schools.</P>
    <P>In the past week, I went specially to a number of schools to find out for myself whether I had been in sufficiently close contact with the situation. I found that not alone were those punishments being carried out but that they were being carried out for not knowing the lessons&mdash;the one thing the Minister has been specific about for which punishment should not be inflicted.  It has been carried out not alone where lay teachers are concerned but where nuns are concerned.  They are just as guilty of breach of the Rules as the ordinary lay teachers. In that regard, what strikes me as extraordinary is this.  The Rules today are being flouted with the utmost contempt by people whose job it is to instil respect into the youth of the country&mdash;and their way of instilling respect for the laws of the country <Col N="737" /> is by the use of the cane, which is forbidden to these very teachers.  I know I shall not make many friends amongst certain elements because of some of the things I have yet to say here but I think they must be said. The Minister, speaking here, said:</P>
    <P>My view on this matter of corporal punishment is that corporal punishment in schools should be administered only on rare occasions&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;it should be used only on rare occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;when the teacher's authority is at stake.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke here as Minister for Education and I believe he was serious when he made those statements. But if, as I accept, he was serious, I must at the same time say he is away out of this world if he thinks that what he says here has any bearing on the actual situation.</P>
    <P>The majority of national teachers in this country are dedicated people who are doing a first class job, and a difficult one at that.  It has not been made any easier over the years by the failure of various Governments to provide suitable school accommodation and suitable class sizes.</P>

      <P>The Minister makes this case.  I suppose that when he has taken up this stand he has to make some kind of a case and to put the best front possible on it.  He makes the case that the change in the regulations to his mind makes the situation more positive as to what the teacher can do.  The Rules are more positive, according to him.  Then, in the next sentence, he says that teachers can make the case that they do not know where they stand under the new regulations&mdash;in other words, that the regulations are such that those teachers who may be disposed to overuse of the cane or corporal <Col N="738" /> punishment will now be far more careful because of the fact that the Rules are now in such a form that they do not know where they stand.  That is a very poor argument to put forward on behalf of the people who were responsible for changing the Rules.  To my mind, the reading of that could only be, in other words, that the vaguer the Rules the better the position as far as those teachers are concerned because the more cautious they will have to be.  I do not think that is logical.</P>
      <P>We are dealing, remember, only with a section, and a small section, of the teaching community when we talk of this particular issue.  Other Senators put it better than I did, but I say that as far as the small section is concerned, you should not increase the temptation to do what their nature wants them to or their feelings urge them to, in other words, inflict more corporal punishment.  We should not widen the scope for their activities in this regard.  If, for instance, there is somebody partial to drugs or a drug addict we do not leave the cupboard open or the key in the cupboard so that that unfortunate comes along and helps himself to the drug.  In the case of somebody who is over keen on drink, we do not go out of our way to encourage him by putting liquor under his nose.  In other words, we do not encourage people by tempting them with what brought about their weakness or the cause of their downfall or whatever it was.  As far as corporal punishment is concerned the clearer we spell out what can be done and only what can be done the better for the limited section who utilise corporal punishment in the schools.  The Minister has stated in his remarks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
