      <Col N="9" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objects of the Bill are, first of all, to put our general extradition law on an up-to-date basis; secondly, to make fresh provision for the enforcement here of British criminal warrants, which have been unenforceable since last July, following a decision of the Supreme Court; and, thirdly, to provide for the enforcement of Northern Ireland warrants.</P>
      <P>The extradition of offenders other than to Britain and Northern Ireland is dealt with in Part II of the Bill.  In drafting this Part we have in general followed the text of the European Convention on Extradition, a multilateral Convention prepared under the auspices of the Council of Europe and opened for signature in 1957.  It came into force in 1960 and has so far been ratified by six member States of the Council, namely, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Turkey.  It is proposed that, when the Bill becomes law, the Convention will be ratified by this country and that, on ratification, an order will be made by the Government under section 8 of the Bill.  The effect of that order will be to bring into force as between ourselves and the countries which have already ratified the Convention, reciprocal arrangements for the extradition of offenders in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.  Subsequently, negotiations will be commenced with other countries with a view to making appropriate extradition arrangements with them as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection I think I should say that the Bill has been made as flexible as possible to facilitate the making of extradition arrangements with as many countries as possible notwithstanding that the extradition practice of some countries may not be quite in accordance with that of the Convention. This is, of course, subject to the maintenance of certain minimum standards, such as the prohibition on <Col N="10" /> the extradition of political offenders, which the Bill insists upon.  For example, some countries insist that before a person is extradited from their territory, sufficient evidence must be produced which would, according to their own law, justify the person claimed being committed for trial if the offence of which he is accused had been committed in their own territory. That is, in fact, the position under the present law, contained in the Extradition Act, 1870, and in the law of countries following the Anglo-American tradition in this respect.  In many other countries, including most European continental countries, evidence that a warrant has been issued by a competent court or authority for the arrest of a person in respect of a criminal offence, together with evidence that the offence is an offence under the law of both the requesting and the requested country, is sufficient. Some countries will not allow the extradition of their nationals in any circumstances; others are prepared to do so.</P>
    <P>Under Part II we shall, as I have said, be in a position to negotiate agreements with countries with varying practices and traditions.  We shall be free to conclude extradition agreements, on a reciprocal basis, with Governments whose law requires a <i>prima facie</i> case to be furnished and with those countries who are prepared to allow their nationals to be extradited. Any order made by the Government giving any such arrangement the force of law must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and there is the usual provision for having it annulled by resolution by either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>If previous experience is any guide, however, it is not likely that Part II of the Bill will be availed of to any great extent in practice, though in legislating for the future it is reasonable to proceed on the basis of increased commercial contacts with foreign countries and the increasing likelihood of international criminals coming on to our territory.  The fact is that the Part of the Bill which will be more frequently used will be Part III, which sets out <Col N="11" /> fresh arrangements for the enforcement here of warrants of arrest for ordinary criminal offences issued in Britain and provides for the extension of these arrangements to Northern Ireland.  It may be anticipated that a hundred or so warrants will be executed here annually under these provisions, so that this is the portion of the Bill to which I expect Senators will devote the greatest attention.  For this reason I think I should explain briefly the background to it.</P>
    <P>Up to last year our warrants were executed in Britain, and British warrants were executed here, under the authority of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, as adapted.  An Extradition Bill had been introduced in the Dáil in 1963 which proposed to continue these more or less automatic arrangements for the enforcement of British warrants and for extending them to warrants issued in Northern Ireland.  A number of safeguards were introduced by the 1963 Bill into the arrangements; these were based on recognised principles of international extradition practice.  For example, extradition for political, revenue or military offences or for offences carrying less than three months was prohibited and restrictions were imposed on the endorsement of warrants for summary offences.  Moreover, it was provided that any person arrested under a British or Northern Ireland warrant should be given a reasonable opportunity of consulting a solicitor if he desired to do so.  After the Second Stage and Committee Stage had been agreed by the Dáil early in 1964, it was held, first of all in Britain by the House of Lords and then by our Supreme Court in unrelated <i>habeas corpus</i> actions, that the existing arrangements were invalid.  Since then British warrants have been unenforceable here.  Our warrants remained unenforceable in Britain, too, for a short time after the court decision I have referred to but the British authorities, as a temporary measure, were able to make an Order in Council which was effective to make our warrants enforceable again in Britain. At the time they undertook to introduce <Col N="12" /> legislation to replace the 1851 Act procedure, and the necessary Bill, which has been the subject of discussions between ourselves and the British authorities, has passed the British House of Lords and is expected to pass their House of Commons shortly.</P>
    <P>As a result of the court decisions to which I have referred and of the discussions with the British authorities, Part III of the present Bill provides for further and extensive modifications of the former arrangements for the enforcement of British warrants and requires that every person arrested under such a warrant must be brought before the district court and that he must be allowed a period of at least fifteen days to consider whether he wishes to exercise his constitutional right of <i>habeas corpus</i> or the statutory rights given by section 50 of the Bill of applying to the High Court or to the Minister for Justice for a direction for release on various specified grounds, such as the political or military character of the offence.  Of course, the person to whom the warrant relates may wish to leave the jurisdiction earlier and in that case he may consent to do so but his consent must be given before either a district justice or a peace commissioner.  Moreover, a person may not be surrendered unless the offence is an offence under both our law and British law.  The maximum penalty attaching to the offence for which a person may be surrendered is being raised from three months to six months and provision is being made for provisional arrest in the absence of the warrant in case of urgency.  All these modified provisions will, of course, apply to the reciprocal arrangements we will be having with Northern Ireland for the first time since they ceased to operate some thirty-five years ago.</P>
    <P>Both this measure and the earlier measure have been generally welcomed, especially, I think I can say, in so far as they propose to put an end to the present immunity enjoyed by persons accused of the most serious crimes who escape the consequences of their acts by merely crossing the Border.  It is a matter for gratification <Col N="13" /> also that we shall now be in a position to proceed to have extradition arrangements with other countries on the basis of a statute of the Oireachtas.  I should like to acknowledge, and express my appreciation of, the co-operation we have received from the British and Northern authorities both in relation to the 1963 Bill and the Bill which the House has now before it.  Such co-operation offers every prospect of our being able to secure in due course an arrangement for the reciprocal enforcement of court orders and judgments between our respective jurisdictions in non-criminal matters.</P>
    <P>As soon as this Bill has become law, I propose to press ahead with arrangements for this extended co-operation in the legal field.  I shall place emphasis on trying to get a scheme into operation as soon as possible for the enforcement of maintenance orders, that is to say, court orders for the support of married women and their children who have been deserted.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to express the hope that the Bill will commend itself in principle to Senators as a necessary step in the promotion of the administration of justice between ourselves and other jurisdictions and that they will agree to give it a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is obviously a very necessary measure and when it is finally passed into law it will, I hope, abolish the uncertainty which has existed up to the present time and will remedy the situation which gave rise to the rather unseemly proceedings which took place in the Philip Arthur Quinn case in our courts in the last year.  Perhaps, it was inevitable that the then state of the law should have given rise to these somewhat unseemly proceedings which reflect no great credit upon some of those who took part in them.  Perhaps, it may not have been their fault; perhaps it was.  But, at any rate, one hopes, when this fairly detailed measure, which has obviously received great and detailed consideration in the drafting, is passed and is in operation there will be an end to the uncertainty which has existed up to the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> The Bill, as presented, rather surprised me when I had finished reading it.  I had gathered from the newspapers, and I would have thought, that the Bill would deal entirely with extradition but it appears the position will be that there will be no extradition agreement between this country and Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but that there will be extradition arrangements in relation to other countries which are parties to the International Agreement on Extradition.  What the reasons for that are I do not quite know.  I was hoping the Minister might throw some light on the circumstances which determined that there would be no extradition agreement between this country and Great Britain.  Of course, there is a different situation with the interflow of people between this country and Great Britain and between this country and Northern Ireland.  It creates a different situation from that which obtains between this country and, say, any of the Continental countries.</P>
    <P>I do not know, and I am not satisfied in my own mind, that there are any good reasons why an extradition agreement which is somewhat more detailed and which requires more stringent safeguards than are being provided in Part III should not be put into operation.  For a proper understanding of the Bill it is essential to get quite clearly into one's mind that the extradition arrangements in Part II of the Bill relate to foreigners, non-citizens of this country, whose extradition is requested by another Government with whom we have extradition arrangements.</P>
    <P>I should say that in Part II no citizen of this country can be extradited to any other country, if I am correct.  We do not extradite our own citizens.  In Part II of the Bill we will not send our citizens charged with criminal offence to Great Britain or to Northern Ireland.  It is essential to get that distinction clearly in mind, that the extradition arrangements in Part II do not relate to Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>As I read through Part II of the Bill I was quite happy in my own mind that here, certainly in section 25, we <Col N="15" /> are providing that the documentation which must be provided by the requesting Government is gone into in full detail and that every effort is made to safeguard the rights of the person being extradited and that every effort is being taken in section 25 to make sure that a person is being extradited solely for an extraditable crime or offence.  In so far as that section is concerned one can have only commendation for it.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in section 29 of the Bill one finds that care is taken to make sure that the person brought before the district court for the purpose of having an extradition order made against him is fully safeguarded and his interests are looked after.  Among other things, the court making the order has to inform the person to whom it relates that he will not be surrendered except with his own consent in less than 15 days, and must also inform him that he has a right to apply under section 4 (2) of Article 40 of the Constitution for an order of <i>habeas corpus.</i> One again commends that procedure as being fair and reasonable to a foreigner or anybody who is charged with an offence and whose extradition is sought by another country.</P>
    <P>But I was somewhat disappointed and, indeed, surprised that the rights and safeguards we are according in Part II of the Bill to foreigners are not being similarly accorded, or certainly accorded in as clear terms, to our own citizens when an extradition order is being sought or what, in fact, is an extradition order against them, this business of endorsing or backing warrants. A person for whom a warrant is sought has to be brought before the district court but in the case of our own citizens the district court will be under no obligation to tell them of their right to <i>habeas corpus.</i>  Why that is so I do not know.  It seems to me that they should be informed of that right.  They have not to be informed either of their right to appeal to the Minister or to the High Court if they have the view that the offence for which they are to be extradited is political or an offence <Col N="16" /> against military law or a revenue offence.  Why these provisions are omitted in relation to our own citizens I do not readily understand and I should like to hear from the Minister why that is so.  A facile argument can be made.  One can say that every Irish citizen is presumed to know the law of his own country, but that is a rebuttable presumption, and very easily rebutted in the case of criminals who know nothing about the law except how to break it.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat disappointed to find that there is less regard for safeguarding the rights of our own citizens than there is for foreigners.  The safeguards provided for foreigners are being provided because Part II of the Bill which deals with the extradition of foreign persons from our country follows the lines of the international convention. It seems to me on first reading and as a matter of first impression at any rate that we should give to our own citizens the same break as we give to foreigners on our soil.</P>
    <P>Having said that perhaps that end of the Bill, section 48, can be readily enough amended in order to have the district justice inform the person who is before him of his rights in the same way as he is bound to inform a foreigner of his rights, the Bill goes on to sections 54 and 55, which I must say will call for a little more scrutiny on the Committee Stage.  There is always, of course, a difficulty of knowing, when a warrant is out for something that is said to be a crime in England, how our courts can establish whether the offence named in the warrant is, in fact, a crime under English law.  That is one of the difficulties that have arisen in some of the <i>habeas corpus</i> cases where warrants were challenged by persons sought to be extradited to Britain. Although we can read English statutes and English decisions as a matter of practice in our courts, our courts do not pretend or purport to interpret or say what is the effect of an English statute or to say that certain facts constitute a particular offence under a certain statute of the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> In order to get over that difficulty section 54 provides that the matter shall be dealt with in a very summary way and one which I think could not commend itself to any constitutional or criminal lawyer or, indeed, to any layman.  What we are providing under section 54 is that a warrant, once it is issued in England and appears to be regular on its face, may be taken by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and if it appears to him to be all right then he can take the person to whom it refers into custody.  That is fair enough.  The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána is not a law officer or a judge and does not have to inquire too minutely into something that appears on the face of it to be in order. Then we find that the Commissioner is bound to accept a certificate which appears to be given by the authority or by the clerk or other officer of the authority by which the warrant was issued&mdash;a certificate that the offence to which it relates is by the law of England an indictable offence and not also a summary offence, or that it is a summary offence punishable by a specified period of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>What is the law in England as to what is a summary offence in a particular case or what is an indictable offence is to be determined not even by a magistrate in England or in the usual way of determining a matter of foreign law in our courts by an affidavit made by a practising barrister or a practising solicitor, but merely by a certificate of a magistrate's clerk somewhere in Scotland, England or Wales that such and such an offence is an indictable offence or a summary offence.  This is to be regarded by this country as being the law in England and it cannot be questioned by the Commissioner nor, indeed, if one reads section 55, can it even be questioned by the courts unless the court sees good reason to the contrary.  Since our courts will not take a British statute and say &ldquo;We interpret that as meaning that this is not an indictable offence&rdquo;, I cannot see how our courts can go behind the certificate that is to be issued by a clerk in any of the magistrates' courts or the Mayor's <Col N="18" /> court in London, so that even our Supreme Court or our High Court in habeas corpus proceedings which may be instituted by any of our citizens in respect of whom a warrant has been issued must take judicial notice of the authenticity and correctness of the certificate issued by the clerk of the magistrate's court in England and there is an end to it.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be the difficulty of establishing to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, or to the satisfaction of the district court, what is an indictable offence in England, or in the Isle of Man, or wherever people may be extradited to under Part III of the Bill, I do not think this House should be satisfied that the provisions of sections 54 and 55 of this Bill are the appropriate way for a self-respecting country, with its own independent courts, and with a Constitution pledged to safeguard the rights of the individual, to deal with what is, of course, a difficult problem. Difficulty is no reason for this kind of short cut which literally pulverises all the safeguards which exist in our criminal law, for our own citizens, within our own domestic jurisdiction. It is in marked contrast to the treatment we are giving to foreigners who will be extradited under Part II of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Having said that much, there is very little else I have to say.  We have in operation at present a system of legal aid for certain categories of persons charged with criminal offences.  I am wondering whether the Minister can tell me if the legal aid which is available to citizens of our own country who are charged before a district court will be available to them in relation to these proceedings in the district court. I do not know whether that is so.  I am wondering whether a person who comes before the district court under Part III of this Bill will be entitled to avail of the legal aid provisions which were recently introduced, and whether, in fact, we are going the further distance to make this legal aid available to him if he makes an application to the High Court under section 50, or if he is applying to the High Court in <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings under <Col N="19" /> Article 40, section 4, subsection (2) of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Apart from those observations we can consent to the Second Reading of the Bill and the principle contained in it.  I hope the Minister will deal with what seem to me to be the very real defects in relation to the extradition of our own citizens.  In the various constitutional law cases that go through our courts from time to time, the High Court and the Supreme Court have as an unshakable principle for the interpretation of statutes, that the Legislature always examines these provisions with meticulous care to ensure their constitutionality.  This Bill strikes at one of the most important constitutional freedoms&mdash;and that freedom is one of the reasons why the Constitution exists&mdash;namely, the freedom of the individual, and I hope that the urgency which I appreciate obtains in relation to this matter, and the necessity of getting persons charged with criminal offences and, in some cases, convicted criminals, out of the country, will not prevent the Minister from giving full consideration to what I consider are the serious defects contained in Part III of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Eoin Ryan Mr. Eoin Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eoin Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which certainly was badly needed because of the collapse of the machinery which existed between this country and Great Britain for exchanging people charged with offences. The machinery which exists under the old Extradition Acts between this country and countries other than Great Britain appears to have been working reasonably well.  It did not give rise to any difficulties in the past, but the machinery between this country and Great Britain collapsed completely during the past year.  It was essential that some legislation should be introduced, and this legislation seems to meet the needs very adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is just as well that this matter was brought to a head by the Supreme Court in this country and the courts in Britain recently, because the situation which existed was in many respects <Col N="20" /> an undesirable one.  I think the Supreme Court took the right view on this matter.  They were right to reverse the stand which they formerly took on the provisions of the Petty Sessions Act, 1851.  It was clearly undesirable that a person accused of a crime in Great Britain should be taken out of this country without being allowed any opportunity whatever of taking <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings, or questioning the validity of what was being done.  That was the position under the situation which existed up to a few months ago, and that was, in fact, done on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>The safeguards which are provided in this Bill appear to be generally satisfactory.  I think we must face up to the fact that it will not be possible to provide safeguards that are in all respects perfect.  There may be certain loopholes, and certain cases which will arise under the Bill as it now stands, in which justice will not be fully done. I doubt whether it is possible to frame a Bill in which justice would be done in every possible case.  It seems to me that the provisions for allowing a person who is to be extradited sufficient time to take whatever proceedings he thinks necessary, and the provisions which exclude certain offences not generally regarded as criminal offences, meet so far as possible the necessity of ensuring that justice is done.  As I say, it may be that in the course of time we will find that it is not possible to provide for every possible eventuality. As the position stands at the moment, and so far as we can envisage the situation which will arise, this Bill does in a practical way meet the necessity of giving the safeguards which are desirable to the person involved.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that in certain cases it will be necessary to produce evidence to show that the person accused has committed the offence which he is alleged to have committed. It seems to me that this provision could give rise to very great difficulty. I do not know whether it is intended that it should ever be written into an extradition agreement because if it is these extradition agreements will be <Col N="21" /> made between this country and various countries other than Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the rules of evidence and the rules in regard to the onus of proof in most of these countries vary very considerably from this country.  In many cases the onus of proof and the evidence required to obtain the conviction are considerably less stringent than the law of evidence in this country.  Consequently, a court in this country might find itself in the position that the evidence would be quite sufficient to convict a person in the requesting country but not quite sufficient to convict a person in this country.  That will cause a conflict which it will be difficult to deal with. In my view it is undesirable and this question of writing in to any agreement the necessity of producing the evidence as well as producing the other documents and proofs will almost certainly lead to a great deal of difficulty if it is included.  Furthermore, you might have the position where a court has not merely to be satisfied that the offence is an offence which comes within the terms of the Bill and that the warrant is a valid one.  If it has also to consider the evidence it will, in fact, have to try the case and this is not a desirable position.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the question of extradition of Irish citizens.  It says:</P>
    <P>Extradition shall not be granted where a person claimed is a citizen of Ireland, unless the relevant extradition provisions otherwise provide.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he would tell us whether there is any machinery in operation at the moment for extraditing Irish citizens to countries other than Great Britain.  I should also like to ask him whether it is intended or envisaged that in the future under this Bill extradition of Irish citizens will take place.</P>
    <P>There is just one further point to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister and that is in relation to repeals.  There are a number of repeals of Acts dealing with this matter in the past and in several cases the whole Act is repealed, and, generally <Col N="22" /> speaking, these are re-enacted in the present Bill.  There are two Acts &mdash;the Extradition Act of 1870 and the Extradition Act of 1873&mdash;in which the entire Act, except for one section, is repealed and the one section in each case is a relatively simple and short one.  It seems to me a great pity that an opportunity was not taken in this case to repeal the whole Act and to reenact the section in question in this Bill.  It would certainly make the position a great deal less confusing and would be of more assistance to practitioners to have as much as possible of the law in relation to extradition in this Bill and not have to refer to two previous Acts for two very simple sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put some questions to the Minister.  Some of what I should like to say is, perhaps, more relevant to Committee Stage than to Second Stage. Nevertheless, if one were to consider putting down amendments, the answers to some of the questions should be given to us.  I should like to associate myself with what has already been said.  It is quite obvious that the general spirit of this Bill is acceptable to us and will clear up a situation that has been unhappy, time-wasting and unfortunate in many ways.  Senator O'Quigley made the point clearly that the Bill may turn out not to be sufficiently specific or may turn out to be, in fact, not quite in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little unhappy not so much about the definitions that are included as the matters mentioned which are not covered by definition.  I suppose it is clear what is meant in section 38 by &ldquo;any citizen of Ireland does any act outside the State&rdquo;.  I take it the State means the Republic of Ireland.  I suppose any citizen of Ireland means the Republic of Ireland although, if we consult our Constitution, we find that the name of the State is Éire or, in the English language, Ireland.  It might be contended that this applies to all Ireland for I notice section 41, Part III, specifically mentions Northern Ireland, England and Wales, Scotland, <Col N="23" /> the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.  I should like to ask the Minister is Northern Ireland here to be taken as Northern Ireland defined by the 1925 Agreement which was passed and ratified by Dáil Éireann in 1925 or 1926.  I am afraid there may be ambiguity arising out of the failure sufficiently to define.  If a citizen of Ireland means a citizen of the Republic it probably should be put in in those words.</P>
    <P>I notice also that among the definitions themselves on line 5 of page 4 &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; does not include the taking or attempted taking of the life of a Head of State or a member of his family.  In my opinion it is quite right to exclude a political offence.  I do not know whether the full implications of this are clear but it would appear that you may be extradited for assassinating a Prime Minister, his wife or child, or wife of a Prime Minister under a monarchy or, perhaps, even in a republic provided that the Prime Minister and President is the same person.  There might be an argument here as to why, for instance, the Royal family in Britain would have, as it were, this protection under the Bill, but the family and person of the Prime Minister would not.  I suppose, in America, this would apply to the President and his family.  In one or two other countries it is not absolutely clear just who is the Head of State.  I am not really sure that it is worth making this exception. I should like to hear the Minister's comment on the necessity for including, or rather excluding, this particular form of what might be a political offence.</P>
    <P>Section 19 is what I would regard as commonsensible and humane in that here we are not going to hand over under this Bill people to be tried for a capital offence under the laws of another country where the offence would be regarded in the Republic as a capital offence.  This seems to me to be a good section and one which is soundly based.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I am a little puzzled by section 44 which refers to <Col N="24" /> another excluded offence in addition to a political offence.  Apparently, here, a revenue offence is excluded.  If you are merely bilking the Revenue Commissioners themselves&mdash;according to the spirit of the Bill before us&mdash;that is regarded as perfectly normal practice and not something to be condemned and certainly nothing to which we would attach any odium.  I do not know whether this is the Minister's or the Government's view or whether there might not be bad example in the Bill. Even citizens of Ireland might be encouraged by this particular subsection to feel that they could cheerfully defraud the Revenue Commissioners and that this would be merely a revenue offence.  I am a little puzzled as to why this should be put in&mdash;as if it were of an equal standing with or of an equally forgivable nature as an offence under military law which is not an offence under criminal law or a political offence.  In other words, I should like to hear the Minister's defence for the exemption of revenue offences. What is there that is so intrinsically pardonable about revenue offences?</P>
    <P>There are two other sections about which I should like some clarification. They are sections 35 and 50.  The point I would like to make is that it would seem to me&mdash;I think many members of the House would agree with me&mdash;that, perhaps, these two sections give too much power to the Minister.  Section 35, subsection (1) says:</P>
    <P>whenever the Minister is of opinion, in relation to a person who is for the time being on remand or awaiting his surrender under this Part that extradition is prohibited under any provision of this Part or of the relevant extradiction provisions, the Minister may at any time refuse extradition and shall thereupon order the person, if in custody, to be released.</P>
    <P>This is done without any reference to the courts.  The Minister decides this himself.  I do not know whether the House is happy to give such complete power not only to the present Minister, in whom we have confidence, but to <Col N="25" /> his successor, to decide in his opinion alone, without the decision of any court, that this particular offence does not come under the Extradition Bill. I should much prefer if the matter were referred by the Minister to the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 44, subsection (1) states:</P>
    <P>a warrant shall not be endorsed for execution under this Part if the Minister or the High Court, on the question being referred to the Court by the Minister, directs in accordance with this section that it shall not be so endorsed.</P>
    <P>Here is the implication that the Minister may refer the question to the High Court.  I should like to feel that in these circumstances he should refer the question to the High Court or to the courts at any rate and not that he should have his own power under the Bill.  It should be up to the courts of law to decide this matter.  It seems to me that it would be necessary to limit the power which the Minister seeks in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 50, subsection (4) says:</P>
    <P>A direction under this section may be given by the Minister on any of the grounds set out in paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (2).</P>
    <P>The Minister again has power to release any person from the jurisdiction of this Bill.  This seems to me to be too great a power to give to the Minister. There may be justification for it and I may, perhaps, have misinterpreted the Bill but, speaking as an ordinary citizen.  I would feel happier if the Minister had to appeal to the court before deciding that a particular application for extradition did not come within the jurisdiction of the Bill.  Apart from that, the Bill should have our support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical Bill but there are one or two points I should like to raise in regard to it. In the course of his statement the Minister did not indicate the number of Irish citizens who might be affected by the Bill when it becomes law.  I gather that about forty countries are concerned in this matter and that it is based mainly on the European Convention <Col N="26" /> in a general way.  There is just one point that springs to my mind at this stage.  When the Bill becomes law could Dr. Singer, if he were discovered in one of these 40 countries, be sent back here to face our courts again under the reciprocal arrangements?</P>
      <P>I gather that the Bill is retrospective but I could not find in any section of it whether the period of retrospection is limited or unlimited.  That, of course, would make it more difficult for the Minister to give some idea of the number of persons who may be affected by the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the last point by Senator Rooney it can be anticipated there are roughly 100 people a year, give a few either way, who will be affected by these arrangements. The Bill will apply, in practice, almost entirely to Britain and Northern Ireland.  Over a long period of years, a number of warrants were executed here in accordance with arrangements which we presumed to be valid.  Every year, up to last July, about 80 to 100 people were extradited from here to Britain and from Britain to here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley made reference to some differences which exist between Parts II and III.  He is right to some extent but not in his contention that we should have a formal extradition arrangement with Britain.  In fact, Part III of this measure, in conjunction with the British Bill, amounts to such an extradition arrangement.  Part II is more in the nature of an enabling provision.  It enables us to participate in extradition arrangements with, first of all, countries which are parties to the European Convention, and also with any other country.  The USA, for example, is a country with which we should like to have extradition arrangements but it is not, of course, a party to the European Convention.  Part II as it stands will enable us to make a suitable arrangement with the USA, as well as with other countries who have yet to become parties to the Convention. So far only six members have ratified it.  When this Bill becomes law we will have arrangements with <Col N="27" /> Denmark, Greece, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Turkey.  These are the members who are already parties to the Convention.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, differences in the arrangements made under Part II and Part III and I would emphasise first of all that in matters such as extradition, where agreement has to be reached between various countries, no Government can be a completely free agent.  The European Convention, for example, was drawn up only after long and painstaking negotiations in which a common formula was adopted by agreement between various countries, one of which was ourselves. Similarly, with regard to Britain and Northern Ireland, Part III of our Bill coincides with the corresponding Bill going through the House of Commons at the moment and both were framed after painstaking negotiations between ourselves and the British and Northern authorities.</P>
    <P>We were not entirely free agents in the matter which Senator Sheehy Skeffington mentioned, that is, the exemption from the category of political offence of the taking of the life of a Head of State or a member of his family.  This is a matter which European countries generally insist on having and if we want to ratify the Convention we have to agree with that too.  It is implicit in the idea of extradition that there must be give and take between one country and another. That is why there may be matters here which appear anomalous but without some element of compromise agreement would never be reached.</P>
    <P>It is obviously desirable that this measure of agreement should have been reached between us and the other countries in the Council of Europe which have signed the Convention and that this measure of agreement should have been reached between us and Britain.</P>
    <P>Another reason why there is a distinction between the arrangements in Part II and those in Part III is that Part II is necessarily of very general application.  It sets out the broad basis for concluding extradition arrangements with countries with <Col N="28" /> which up to now we have had little to do in the way of apprehension of criminals.  Part III, on the other hand, is putting in statutory form the special arrangements between us and Britain and Northern Ireland, arrangements which recognise that we are dealing with people with very much the same code of law and legal procedure as ourselves.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is practicable to cavil as Senator O'Quigley has done at sections 54 and 55 under which the Commissioner of the Guards and the courts may accept certain documents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It surely must.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view it is much better to leave a discretion to the Commissioner.  If he is not satisfied about a particular document, he can ask for further evidence.  In fact, the very effect of its being discretionary has an advantage which seems to meet the situation advocated by Senator O'Quigley.  Anything of a compulsory nature making it mandatory on the Commissioner or the courts to accept such documents on the evidence which is tendered would surely be contrary to the point of view expressed by Senator O'Quigley.  As we have it, we authorise the Commissioner to accept these duly authenticated warrants at their face value, but he has a duty, if he has any doubt, of not accepting the document and asking for further evidence.  That would appear to be a desirable situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington raised a point in regard to the Minister having functions regarding the release of a person apprehended in respect of an offence if the Minister takes the view that the offence is not an offence to which extradition applies.  This is in ease of the person apprehended.  It is an additional safeguard under Part II. Not alone is he safeguarded by being brought before the District Court and by being able to make the case that his offence is a revenue offence, a political offence or an offence under military law which is not an offence under ordinary criminal law, but he may go subsequently to the High Court or the Minister for a decision.  This power possessed <Col N="29" /> by the Minister to release the prisoner surely is in ease of him and ensures greater justice.  I could see Senator Sheehy Skeffington's point if it were in reverse and if there were powers which could authorise the Minister to direct a person to be extradited.</P>
    <P>Under Part III the Minister has power under section 44 to prevent the arrest of a person under a warrant by directing that the warrant will not be endorsed or executed.  In other words, as part of the administration process the Minister may direct the police not even to arrest a man if it is brought to his notice and if he feels for reasons of justice that the warrant is faulty and that the offence in his opinion is not an extraditable offence. He may before the arrest process gets under way direct that the warrant should not be endorsed for execution. The same position applies under Part II also.  So, to have these various avenues of protection for the person apprehended is I feel all important. The extradition of any person from the State at the request of any country is not a matter to be done lightly and it is, I think, in the interest of liberty and the interest of the citizens that the person against whom it is sought to be done should have the utmost protection possible.  The various matters I have referred to are designed to give the widest possible scope to a person who is caught in that situation to ensure that no injustice is done to him.  As I have said, we are providing ample safeguards both before and after arrest.  Where the warrant is executed and the person is apprehended he must be brought before the district court. He may not be removed from the jurisdiction for 15 days and within that period he may go to the High Court for consideration as to whether or not his offence is extraditable, or to the Minister and either one or the other may direct his release.</P>
    <P>Apart from the statutory right under section 50 to apply to the High Court or the Minister, we have spelled out here in section 48, as a result of an amendment in Dáil Éireann, that the person apprehended has the right of <i>habeas corpus</i> under the Constitution. <Col N="30" /> There is, therefore, the utmost protection that any citizen can reasonably ask for.</P>
    <P>The point was made that we cannot extradite any of our own nationals to countries covered by Part II but section 14 provides that this can, in fact, be done by an extradition agreement. We could make such an arrangement under Part II, which is largely permissive.</P>

      <P>The Act does not apply.  This is not a criminal matter, so that the courts in their interpretation of whether or not legal aid should apply in my view could not grant legal aid in cases or applications arising out of this Bill.  That is my view but it is entirely a matter for interpretation by the courts.  Legal aid is confined to criminal offences which are being tried here.  I do not think that cases to which this Bill would apply would come into that category, but it is entirely for the courts to interpret and far be it from me to intervene on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other points have been raised which would probably be more appropriate to the Committee Stage. This is a measure which I would like to see as perfect as is humanly possible because it is concerned with the fundamental matter of human rights.  We had a constructive debate in the Dáil and we incorporated certain amendments which further safeguarded the rights of persons to be extradited.  I would be very glad, indeed, if constructive amendments are put down for my consideration between now and the Committee Stage.  Some of the matters which have been adverted to would perhaps be best dealt with in that way and given full and proper consideration. If the matters warrant it, they <Col N="31" /> will be included as amendments to this measure, which we hope will provide the basis for extradition arrangements not alone with Britain and European countries but with many other countries so that we can regard this as one step further towards the universal rule of law that we would all wish to see established throughout the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to raise by £4 million the amount which Bord na Móna may borrow for the performance of its statutory functions.  The existing limit on such borrowings is £24 million and the Board has already borrowed up to the limit.  Of the total £21.044 million was advanced from the Central Fund; Messrs.  Guinness advanced £¾ million, the Board raised £2 million by an issue of stock to the public in May last year and the balance was raised by borrowings from an insurance company and the Board's superannuation fund.  The Board has already repaid £2,568,915 of the advances from the Central Fund and £184,917 of the loan from Messrs. Guinness.</P>
      <P>The main output of Bord na Móna is determined by the requirements of peat for electricity generation.  It is Government policy that all bogs which are economically usable for electricity generation are developed for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna supplies sod peat <Col N="32" /> for the electricity generating stations at Portarlington, Allenwood and Lanesboro which have a total generating capacity of 97.5 megawatts.  No further sod peat generating stations are planned.  Milled peat is supplied for electricity generation to the stations at Ferbane, Rhode, Shannonbridge and Bellacorick which have a total installed capacity of 250 megawatts.  The normal annual fuel requirements of these stations are 565,000 tons of sod peat and 1,860,000 tons of milled peat.  Sod peat and milled peat requirements for electricity generation at present account for some 75 per cent of the total sales of Bord na Móna.  Two further milled peat generating units are planned viz., a 40 megawatt extension at Lanesboro to come into operation early in 1966 and a 40 megawatt unit at Shannonbridge to come into operation about 1972.  When these two additional units are in operation the total requirements of milled peat for electricity generation will be 2,420,000 tons per annum.</P>
    <P>Generation of electricity from native resources as a whole, that is to say, hydro, peat and native coal, amounted to about 59.6 per cent of total output in the year ended 31st March, 1965. In that year 31.7 per cent of the total number of units supplied to the system was provided by peat-fired stations. Peat-fired stations now represent about 32 per cent of the total generating capacity of the ESB.  The development by existing methods of our peat resources for electricity generation will be completed by about 1972 when the second of the two additional peat-fired units is expected to be in operation. By then the proportion of total generating capacity based on peat will have fallen to about 25 per cent, as in the meantime a very substantial amount of oil-fired generating capacity will also have been commissioned.  For the information of Senators, I may add that the bogs on which generating stations are based are estimated to have a life of 30-40 years.</P>
    <P>In addition to the production of peat for electricity generation, the Board produces annually about 330,000 tons of sod peat for general sale as well as about 700,000 tons of milled peat for <Col N="33" /> briquette manufacture and 350,000 bales of moss peat.</P>
    <P>The development plans of Bord na Móna are set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> The following are the main lines of expansion envisaged:&mdash;</P>
    <P>First there is the new briquette factory, estimated to cost £1.75 million, to be built in the Shannonbridge area.  Production from the three existing factories in 1964-65 amounted to 295,000 tons.  The Board expect that the output of these factories can be increased to 320,000 tons per annum.  The proposed new factory is planned to produce 135,000 tons per annum which would give a total output from the four factories of 455,000 tons per annum or the equivalent of 300,000 tons of coal.  The quantity of milled peat required for the production of briquettes at the rate of 450,000 tons per annum would be about 1,200,000 tons per annum.</P>
    <P>The second main item is bog development estimated to cost £1.7 million.  The decision to divert some 300,000 tons per annum of the milled peat output of the Blackwater-Garryduff group of bogs to supply the fourth briquette factory has necessitated the postponement of the second 40 MW generating unit at the Shannonbridge station which had been planned for 1968-69 and which would have absorbed this output. The Athlone group of bogs now being developed to supply this unit will not be in full production until about 1972.  This is the last remaining bog area suitable for development for milled peat production by the Board's present methods.</P>
    <P>The third item is the Board's second moss peat factory which is being erected near Portlaoise.  This factory, which will cost about £300,000, will commence production this summer and will enable the existing output of about 350,000 bales per annum to be doubled. Deputies will be aware that about 80 per cent of the present moss peat production is exported.  It is expected that by far the greater part <Col N="34" /> of the output of the new factory will also be exported.</P>
    <P>The balance of the Board's capital requirements is in respect of increased working capital necessitated by the expanding scale of the Board's activities and of the cost of miscellaneous minor works.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill for the raising, from £24 million to £28 million of the existing limit on borrowings by the Board will enable the Board to continue its development work for another three years or so when the House will have a further opportunity of reviewing the position. On the basis of present estimates a further £2 million borrowing will probably be necessary at that stage for the completion of the Board's development programme.</P>
    <P>The average number of persons employed by Bord na Móna at present is 5,300.</P>
    <P>The opportunity of the Bill is being taken to repeal section 4 of the Turf Development Act, 1953.  This section provides that a contract fixing the remuneration, period of office, not exceeding five years, etc., of the managing director of Bord na Móna may be entered into with him by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance and the approval of the Government notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the general provisions relating to appointment, terms of office, etc. of members of the Board under the Act under which the Board was established.  This section was intended to give the managing director at the time security of office. No contract has been made with the present managing director.  In practice, the managing director is appointed by the Government for periods of five years at a time and this is a more convenient administrative arrangement than a formal contract.  The provision is, therefore, considered unnecessary and is being revoked.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna has been entrusted with the execution of a major aspect of national policy, the development of the turf resources of the country.  The success it has achieved and the beneficent effect of its operations on otherwise <Col N="35" /> economically backward areas of our country are plain for all to see.</P>
    <P>It is with confidence, therefore, that I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great pleasure that on my first occasion to speak in this House I find myself in a position to endorse what the Minister has said, particularly in his concluding paragraph.  We are all aware of the high reputation of Bord na Móna both under its former and its present managing director.  This is not a State body which has been subject to criticism as regards its dynanism or efficiency.  Quite the contrary&mdash;both in its manner of setting about the business of developing our turf resources and the energy with which it has tackled that problem, and also in the technical efficiency with which it has done the job, it has made a contribution not only to the economy, but also I think in some degree to our prestige abroad.  It is well known that visitors from other countries, and particularly distinguished visitors, are often brought to see the work of Bord na Móna which is something of a showpiece.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another feature of Bord na Móna is its high technological content and the fact that it provides a training ground for technologists of which we stand in great need.  Some aspects of its activities are, so far as can be judged, completely economic in character even judged by the most rigid standards. This is true, for example, on the peat moss side of its activity, and it is generally true also of the briquette production side, although one notes&mdash; and here I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments&mdash;that in the latest available report, 31st March, 1964, a loss is shown on the production of briquettes, and also milled peat from which they are made.  This may be a purely temporary phenomenon, perhaps, associated with development on this side of the business.  In the Progress Report on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> reference is made to some technical difficulties which had arisen at the briquette factories.  One wonders <Col N="36" /> whether they have since been resolved and if they arose at the briquette factories, in the plural, or whether there was some specific difficulty at a factory.  Have the difficulties been resolved, and can we look forward to briquette production being profitable in the future as it has been in the past?</P>
    <P>I also note in the Córas Tráchtála Report that exports of milled peat and briquettes were reduced in 1964. Exports of briquettes to Northern Ireland were down by one-fifth and exports of milled peat to Britain and Northern Ireland were down by a similar figure Is there some particular reason for this or can we look forward to a recovery in these exports in the period ahead?</P>
    <P>The criticism and views one would have in connection with this Bill do not really relate to the execution by Bord na Móna of the policy laid down for it but would concern the policy under which the Board operates.  The problem here lies in the fact that the milled peat which the Board produces, and which is purchased from it by the ESB for the production of electricity, is bought at a price which is very much higher than the price paid in terms of calorific value for other fuels, the difference being quite substantial. Indeed, this point was raised in part in the other House, and the Minister himself gave figures of the differences in the cost of output from different power stations using different types of fuel.  Those figures show that the cost even for the economic milled peat power stations was significantly higher than the cost for those using coal or oil.</P>
    <P>For some reason the Minister used the 1962-63 figures for this purpose, although at the time of the debate, a couple of months ago, later figures were available.  The later figures show that the position has altered for the worse since then.  It is true that the bulk of this deterioration arises from the fact that the load factors of the milled peat stations relative to those of the coal/oil stations have deteriorated. But even if one ignores that, and takes the fuel cost only, there is <Col N="37" /> still a deterioration in the relationship. The market has moved in favour of coal and oil still further since the period of the figure which the Minister used.  No one would propose on that account that the turf development programme should be abandoned.</P>
    <P>I am sure no one would even suggest that within the present structure of the existing power stations there should be a determined switch-over to the maximum use of coal and oil in order to save a certain amount of money if this would involve a reduction in the activities of Bord na Móna or would go so far as to talk seriously about reviewing the decision to proceed any further with turf-fired power stations. The Minister mentioned the plans in this connection and the work is so far advanced that we can hardly go back on them now.</P>
    <P>The question, therefore, is not really whether Bord no Móna should continue, as at present, to produce turf and the ESB should continue to take it to the extent they are doing at present, but rather is it a question of the price to be paid for it and who pays the price.  There are no grounds that I can find for forcing the ESB to pay as at present a price for turf which is fifty per cent or more above the economic price&mdash;that is the price the ESB would itself freely pay on the market if it had a choice in the matter.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the consumer of electricity and the taxpayer are, in fact, one and the some person and that it does not matter which is charged.  That is fallacious&mdash;they are not one and the same person because taxation could be so levied as to be borne primarily by the consumer and certainly the general burden of taxation falls mainly on the consumer and only to a limited extent on industry. Where it does fall on industry, it is on profits and does not necessarily affect costs.  But when the costs of the development programme are charged to the ESB as is done at present this involves a significant increase which bears heavily on Irish industry.  In this country at the present time with our plans for economic development and with the growing move towards <Col N="38" /> freer trade, I do not think we can afford a policy of making power dearer, which is what the present policy is doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister adverted to this in the Dáil and claimed that the cost of electricity in Ireland was lower than in Britain.  Even if this were true, it would not be relevant to the fact that Government policy here is pushing the cost of electric power higher than is necessary.  We, as a developing country, need cheaper power than elsewhere. Even if it were true that our power is cheaper than Great Britain's, this would not be convincing.  I should like, however, to ask the Minister what was the authority for his statement in this regard.  I have endeavoured to find the basis for such a comparison myself and I must admit I have failed to do so in the form of comparatively up to date data.  What I have found is a comparison prepared by OECD in 1958 entitled &ldquo;The Trend of the Selling price of Electricity&rdquo;.  Table 43 of this publication gives the average price per kilowatt in a number of European countries.  The latest year for which most of these figures are given is, unfortunately, 1955.  Converting these figures by the currency rates shown in Table 45 we find that the average cost per unit of electricity in Ireland in 1955 was 2.24 US cents as against 1.6 cents per unit in the UK&mdash;that is, our average unit cost was then forty per cent higher than in Great Britain.  I am not aware of any very substantial changes since then in the price of electricity in either country.  I am certainly not aware of any change in the price of electricity in Great Britain of such magnitude as would wipe out that differential between our price and theirs.</P>
    <P>It may be that there is some statistical problem here, but certainly <i>prima facie</i> it would not appear that power in this country is cheaper than in Great Britain.  I wonder whether there is any significance in the fact that the Minister referred to the cost of electricity and not its price.  From experience of reading Parliamentary Debates I have learned how important it is to read every word with care.  I <Col N="39" /> wonder if in fact the Minister intended some distinction between the cost of electricity and its price.  Would his comparison have referred to fuel costs, work costs, total generating costs or overall costs, including distribution and sales?  If, in fact, the Minister meant costs at all, what kind of costs was he referring to?  I think it is important that this point should be clarified and that we should not be vague on matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, in a developing country, that the cost of power is one of the most crucial factors.  The relevant cost of turf and of alternative fuels in the late 1940's and early 1950's was such that it was not unreasonable for the Government to embark on a policy of turf development, not alone on social grounds, but also on economic grounds.  Again, during the Suez oil crisis prices generally were pushed up, but there is, I think, no prospect whatever of a return in the foreseeable future to a situation where turf would be as economic as other fuels.  However, even if there is a difference in terms of cost, the policy of using turf, and even the policy of charging the electricity consumer for it, might conceivably be justified in a closed stagnant economy such as we had in Ireland in the 1950's.</P>
    <P>Our Government have, however, embarked on a free trade policy and on a policy of economic expansion which requires cheap power and not, as at present, a tax on power.  We should be thinking of how to make power cheaper, even, conceivably, by subsidising it.  We certainly should not be, as we are at present, taxing it to make it dearer.  I think a rethinking of this policy is required in the light of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>The same situation applies to transport, whose price is being pushed up by restricting the use of surplus capacity in private haulage and by limiting the entrance of hauliers to the haulage business, and to steel, for which protection is being introduced at a time when steel-using industries are being asked to face tariff reductions. <Col N="40" /> We cannot afford thus to increase the cost of electricity, transport and steel&mdash;basic requirements of a modern economy.  Such measures are quite inappropriate to policies of economic expansion and free trade.  I think the Government must face up to the fact now that with our problems and disadvantages we cannot face free trade with such policies.  I think that a statement of policy is required now from the Government on energy matters.  <i>The Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> gives us lots of facts and figures about generating power but there is nothing whatever about policy.  The aim of energy policy is stated in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> to be to ensure &ldquo;that energy supplies are adequate and that needs are provided from native sources as far as is economically possible.&rdquo;  Nobody, as far as I am aware, has ever defined what is meant by the last few words.  I think it should read to ensure &ldquo;that needs are provided as economically as possible, preference being given to native resources where this entails no significant cost disadvantage.&rdquo;  On page 170 of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> we read that the use of turf marginally increases the cost of electricity.  That seems to me to be an abuse of the word &ldquo;marginally.&rdquo;  The increase can readily be calculated as lying between £1 million and £1,250,000 a year which adds 5 per cent to the average cost of electricity throughout the country.  I do not think that in this country one can properly use the adverb &ldquo;marginally&rdquo; with regard to something that involves more than £1 million a year.</P>
    <P>There is one particular problem in this area and that is the problem of the small hand-won turf stations.  This problem is in fact highlighted in the Second Programme which reports, one must say, very discouragingly on the subject.  I do not know what conclusion the Government draws from this.  I should like to quote from Paragraph 5, Chapter 5, of the Second Programme:</P>
    <P>The ESB were directed by the Government in 1953 to establish four small turf-powered generating <Col N="41" /> stations to provide outlets for surplus hand-won turf.  The stations came into operation in 1957-58, and cost £1.46 million.  Each was designed on the assumption that a minimum of 30,000 tons of hand-won turf would be available to it annually.  Supplies have reached this level only at one station.  At none of the others has the average supply over the last five years exceeded 15,000 tons, and the quantities supplied to two of them have included large amounts of machine-won turf bought from commercial operators.  Losses have been incurred in the generation of electricity at these four stations.</P>
    <P>We all knew when these stations were established they would not be an economic success but that was accepted. It was hoped they would fulfil a social need by providing an outlet for hand-won turf in this area.  I am afraid we are back again with a case similar to the potato alcohol industry which was set up to absorb surplus potatoes, but for which molasses had to be imported after potatoes ran out. I hope we will not now find that we have to use large quantities of machine-won turf imported into these areas to keep these stations going.</P>
    <P>I consider some review of policy is needed in regard to this matter.  I should like to know what conclusion the Minister has drawn from that paragraph of the Government Second Programme or whether it is intended to continue to operate all these stations as at present despite the lack of local support.</P>
    <P>The Second Programme also states that by about 1970 all bogs capable of being worked economically by present methods will have been developed.  It says the problem will be to maintain output.  I am not quite clear what that means.  This means that turf production will decline after 1970.  Perhaps, the Minister will say something about that because, from the employment point of view, that would be undesirable for the area concerned.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I should like to make.  I wonder whether there is any possibility, in the light of the new relations <Col N="42" /> we have established with the Government of Northern Ireland, of co-operation in this particular area. I know interest has been shown in Northern Ireland, not simply by Nationalists, but by Unionists and supporters of the Government, in the possibility of turf development in that particular part of the country.  I hope the Minister will feel it appropriate to offer whatever assistance the Northern Government feel they would like to have from us in regard to this matter. Bord na Móna have gone as far as Pakistan to advise and assist other countries in their problems in this matter.  There is an opportunity now to offer similar assistance at home as part of the general movement towards closer co-operation between the North and the South.</P>
    <P>I would reiterate on my own part and on those on this side that there is no criticism of Bord na Móna in their work.  The sole issue is the Government's out of date policy in regard to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, first of all, that it is very interesting to find that the cost of power here has reacted unfavourably on the expansion of our industrial potential. That is my reading of the matter.  I do not think there is any country in the world where industrialists have got such mollycoddling with regard to quotas, protections, tariffs, subsidies and so forth as they have got in this country.  A case was made on this measure that these poor people are in a bad way because the Government insist on using native fuel instead of imported fuel for the purpose of power and so forth.  If we follow the arguments made so far in the debate and take up the point that we should allow oil to get priority over milled peat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I may not have made myself clear.  I made no suggestion that there should be any change in the policy of using turf.  The only point I made was in relation to the impact of the price of electricity on industry, on the expanding economy and particularly on developing industries.  I referred to <Col N="43" /> the price paid for turf by the ESB and whether it might not be more proper for the Government to finance this more directly instead of through the medium of the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I still have not changed my mind in relation to my interpretation of what has been said.  If you follow this argument to its logical conclusion you could say you can buy rashers more cheaply abroad than you can buy them at home.  It is the same in regard to the development of native resources, whether it is fuel or anything else.  We have a case made, in this particular instance, that oil is far cheaper for generating power in this country.  It is suggested that, at this stage, when we should be on the eve of the use of atomic power, we should hand ourselves over or commit ourselves to the care and goodwill of the oil interests and the cartel which can deliver oil to us at whatever price they like.  Is it suggested that we should buy oil from these people, as necessary, in order to destroy our native turf and coal industries?  That could be done tomorrow morning and this Government, or any other Government here have not the guts to stand up to the oil interests.  If Senators argue that oil should be imported because it is cheaper, why can they not go the whole hog and say there are other places abroad from which oil can be imported at half the price it is coming in here at present.</P>

      <P>You cannot have it both ways.  You cannot have the idea put abroad that you are in favour of aiding Irish industries if you suggest that preference must be given to foreign commodities.  Bord na Móna have got quite a number of bouquets from people in the other House, from both sides.  They have done a good job up to a certain point but we should not blind ourselves to the fact that there is quite a considerable amount of scope available if Bord na Móna were prepared to show the energy and <Col N="44" /> drive which we expect from semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>Members of the House will recollect an examination of the activities of Bord na Móna which was carried out some 12 years ago by an American firm of consultants.  The report was known as the Ibec Report.  On that occasion this firm of experts or consultants expressed the view that the approach by Bord na Móna to many of the problems they face is timid and lackadaisical.  I agree with that.  From my knowledge of the activities of Bord na Móna they are afraid all the time they will be presented with the annual accounts of profit and loss and are obsessed with the idea of showing their returns in black rather than in red ink.  When we are dealing with a body that has social implications in its set-up we should not frighten or intimidate those who are charged with the inspection of Bord na Móna's expenditure by saying: &ldquo;We do not want to see red ink on your report.&rdquo;  In Bord na Móna we have a body proudly boasting if they can show a profit.  I do not think it is essential for a body like Bord na Móna to show a profit in the sense of two sets of figures.  It would be better to see Bord na Móna breaking even and doing better work, rather than showing a profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker made a point that there should be co-operation with the other part of Ireland and that there are people in the North who are willing to co-operate.  I agree with that, and I should like to ask the Minister if he would elaborate further with regard to the use of atomic power in this part of the country.  I know the Minister said in the Dáil that it would be another ten years before we could contemplate the idea of the use of atomic power in this country.  In the same column of the Dáil debates as the Minister made that statement he pointed out that the present programme is planned up to 1972, using coal, oil and, of course, milled peat. He further went on to say that atomic reaction must operate 24 hours a day with a full load in order to be in any sense economic.  If that is the case <Col N="45" /> and if we have our requirements planned up to 1972, it is not logical or reasonable to suggest that we would be in a position in 1974 or 1975 to even contemplate the use of atomic power.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> On the use of cutaway bogs, I should like the Minister, when he returns, to give some information as to the plans which Bord na Móna, or other groups, have for the utilisation of these cutaway bogs.  That matter was dealt with in the Dáil and the answer given by the Minister was not satisfactory.  I feel that it is undersirable to wait for a long period of years until these bogs are cut away before the land remaining is utilised.  At this stage there is a percentage of cutaway bog that should now be in the process of development. It should be utilised in respect of crops which can be grown successfully on cutaway bogs, such as vegetables and similar produce.  I understand there has been no plan on the part of Bord na Móna to utilise cutaway bog.  It may be that experiments are going on and I agree with that.  This matter dates back to the time of the Turf Board.  That is many years ago now and we should not be putting this further on the long finger.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which the Minister might refer and that is in relation to power stations where water is utilised in the cooling towers.  What thought has been given by Bord na Móna to utilising the steam which is available in the cooling towers by piping it into glasshouses and utilising it for the growing of vegetables, fruit, and so on?  In parts of Germany where the cooling system is in operation there are vast acreages of fruit and vegetables growing under glass at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>You may be right in that.  But one point strikes me. Could I make the case that the functions of these two groups should overlap?  We could, at this stage, have a somewhat similar discussion on Bord na Móna as we have on the ESB.  One is only a supply arrangement for the other.  If we look into it logically, a strong case could be made for allowing the interchange of personnel between these two State bodies.  This is one matter the Minister should give his <Col N="47" /> attention to.  We have fuel experts in Bord na Móna and in the other body, which I cannot mention.  I should like to know why it is impossible for personnel who are skilled in one particular type of power utilisation in Bord na Móna to obtain a transfer to the other body.  Is not one of the things we are looking for at the present time, a widening of knowledge whereby greater experience is given to personnel by their interchange, thus giving them a sense of happiness?</P>
      <P>It would be an ideal thing if we, having two semi-State bodies working in co-operation, had an interchange of personnel in those bodies.  If this were allowed all the necessary details with regard to superannuation, and so on, should operate.  I know for a fact that it is impossible for a person or employee who is superannuated in one of these bodies to transfer to a similar body such as the ESB.  He might prove far better equipped for the work in the ESB than in his existing position. He could be a round peg in a square hole as far as Bord na Móna are concerned but a first class employee for the ESB.  We should ask the Minister in this House to make a study of that. Surely it would not be a big job at this stage to bring these groups more into line in that regard.</P>

    <P>I want to show also how it works as far as housing is concerned.  Bord na Móna have in the past built villages and at times it is a mystery to me why they planned the construction of villages in the middle of a bog.  We hear a lot nowadays about the idea of social amenities and a happy contented life for the workers, yet a State or semi-State body persists in erecting houses in the heart of a bog with no facilities of any kind for recreation or otherwise available for the families of the workers.  I know of one housing estate where the children come along and thumb a lift on the road going to a vocational school three or four miles away.  There is no sense attached to that type of planning.  Wherever Bord na Móna contemplate building they should do so on the basis that there is a community centre established, where a full life can be led by the people who <Col N="48" /> are going to work there.  That is something the Minister should give consideration to.</P>
    <P>Again, to emphasise the need for more co-operation between these two State bodies, let me point out in regard to this housing situation that if there is a vacant house which Bord na Móna control&mdash;and they have had vacant houses in areas for six or seven years&mdash;Bord na Móna refuse to allow men who are employed by the ESB to live in those houses although Bord na Móna themselves are unable to get tenants for the houses.  Surely there is a lack of co-operation between the two bodies in that regard.  I am satisfied that it is a technical difficulty and that there are people in both companies who could work out arrangements where there would be no legal obstacle to an interchange taking place.  The Minister has his own advisers as to what section of the Act would allow that situation to be altered in the interests of the people working in both groups.</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked in the other House about the question of what is planned for those midland areas in twenty years time.  Maybe that is a long time to look ahead, but prosperity has come to certain parts of Ireland through the activities of Bord na Móna and there are towns which it is a pleasure to enter today because of the signs of life and well-being and the spending of money that takes place due to the activities of Bord na Móna and the ESB, but we know that there is a limit of time for those bogs. There is a limited amount of turf to be cut.  If we pursue our development plans and utilise to the maximum extent our peat resources, have we any indication as to what the future of those towns is going to be if and when those bogs become cut away?  When we are told that our demand for power is increasing and going to increase rapidly over the next 10 to 15 years, is it not fair to deduce that our fuel resources in the line of peat are going to be rapidly used up?  I would like if the Minister could tell us whether any thought has been given to the future of those towns when this peat is utilised and cut away.  The same line <Col N="49" /> of thought applies here as to what I said about the cutaway bogs&mdash;the question is whether sufficient attention is being given to planning the growing of fruit, vegetables and so forth.</P>
    <P>There is little else I have to say on this in view of the decision of the Chair to suggest that I should not raise matters which are, perhaps, more appropriate on the Bill to deal with the ESB.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on the very full explanatory introduction he gave to this Bill.  We have also been treated by Senator Garret FitzGerald in his maiden speech here to a very fine economic analysis which raises many points very deserving of consideration. I think that Senator McQuillan rather misunderstood Senator FitzGerald's main point.  There was not any question of advocating that there should be a sudden shift from turf to oil as a source for generation and thereby reducing the cost of a unit of electricity.  As I understood it Senator FitzGerald's point was rather that the extra cost involved in using the home resources, turf, is at the moment being charged completely to power and that that in turn causes a certain price increase that is a handicap on the external market for our exports.</P>
      <P>If I interpret Senator FitzGerald rightly, he was saying that, perhaps, in certain circumstances there might be a case for considering some of that as a subsidy charge rather than as a charge to be levied directly as it is today on the price of fuel.  The development of our bogs has been a great national endeavour and a great national work that has yielded great national profits.  Even taking Senator FitzGerald's figures, using turf rather than oil means an extra £1 million a year on the fuel bill, I think that if we analyse the situation we can find that we are still making a profit by doing that rather than changing over the industry.  The total wage bill involved in Bord na Móna is over £3 million a year and the total output is over £6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take a very hypothetical case. Suppose a decision was made that it <Col N="50" /> would have been better if these stations had disappeared as it were and that we had this cheaper oil to supply our fuel.  If we did that it would mean that our total output was down by £6 million, but if you take the £1 million which is an overcharge or a subsidy we are still taking out of those bogs a gross output of £5 million a year.  That £5 million gets to work in a very real way in our economy.  We see it working in our villages and towns where Bord na Móna operate but it also circulates right through our economy and it appreciates in the exchange of services that it provides and in our national economy is magnified by a factor of anything from 1.6 to 2.  Taking the factor at 1.6, it means it increases the national income by about £8 million a year.  Our tax laws work on every £ of that national income as it circulates around, whether it is money on the pint, on cigarettes, or anything else on which tax is charged, and about one quarter is recouped to the Exchequer.  That means that the £8 million generates about £2 million in taxation, so however the short term view may appear, the fact is that that activity generates £2 million in taxation, and its total replacement would mean a saving on fuel of about £1 million, and a loss in taxation of £2 million.</P>
    <P>In other words, this activity is a very real national asset, and the question posed by Senator FitzGerald is a question of book-keeping in the internal components in our economy as to whether part of what appears to be the extra charge should not be taken directly by the taxpayer to enable the exporters to have lower prices on their products abroad.  In any case, let us not allow controversy on that point to detract from the great work done by Bord na Móna, and from a tribute to the initiative and foresight of our various Governments and the Civil Service Departments concerned in pressing ahead with and expanding the development of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Senator McQuillan said that a great deal more would require to be done on the social side.  That, of course, is putting up the costs to Bord na Móna, but it is a national charge which we <Col N="51" /> should face.  I know it is being faced on the long term basis by the Agricultural Institute in the experimental work they are doing to develop cutaway bogs.  It should be faced more positively on the short term basis. These recreation centres are part and parcel of the development, and whether they should be charged to book-keeping or some other Bord na Móna account, the fact remains that the work should be done.</P>
    <P>These centres should be treated as permanent centres, and not as something that will fold up when the working life of the bog is ended.  It is up to the nation and to the Government to ensure that, as the life of the bog ends, other industries are developed in those regions to hold and expand the centres that have been created. Anyone coming from rural Ireland knows the impact industries of that scale have on the countryside.  It cannot be measured in financial terms.  It uplifts the whole region, gives it a sense of purpose and development which flows out to other industries and activities in the region.  I appeal to the Minister for more Government concentration on and support for these efforts.</P>
    <P>As in the case of our other truly native developments like the Sugar Company and the ESB, we can take pride in the fact that Bord na Móna have been developed by our own efforts under our own Government, and in our own period and manned by our own people.  If we look at Bord na Móna to see the success pattern, the lesson to be learned is that they took and developed their scientific personnel, that they did not draw a rigid line between scientists and management, saying that management was in one class apart.  You cannot have a barrier between science and management, and virile economies in America and elsewhere have shown that is the key to their success.</P>
    <P>If we are looking for that key at home we see it exemplified in Bord na Móna and the Sugar Company, where many of their top management come from the scientific stream.  I am not <Col N="52" /> saying that all should come from it, but in our scientists, whether in the field of engineering or laboratory work, there is a real source of management skill and initiative waiting to be tapped, which we require for our development in this modern technological age.  The Minister has been very farsighted and courageous in this matter, and I appeal to him to see that his colleagues in the Government appreciate equally the contribution that science has made to our full development.  I appeal to him also to ensure that that principle applies as much as if not more so to the Civil Service as it does in an industry like Bord na Móna, the ESB and all the rest.  It is high time that a start was made in the Civil Service to implement that principle.</P>
    <P>We have also seen in Bord na Móna efforts to introduce modern techniques, work study, and contracts with the Battelle Memorial Institute in Ohio, all efforts at increasing productivity, and they are to be recommended. They set a fine pattern for others to follow.  Bord na Móna were also farsighted in enabling their employees to take training courses and to profit by short tours abroad.  A great deal more should be done in that regard.  A semi-State body like Bord na Móna as well as being charged with a specific national task such as the development of certain of our assets&mdash;in the case of Bord na Móna our bogs&mdash;should also at all times have the task of developing our manpower and the management ideal, so that out of Bord na Móna and the other semi-State bodies we would see trained men emerging to take their place at the helm in other sections of our economy. We know many men who have come from there, such as the former director, Dr. Andrews, and the impact they have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have been relying too much for development in our towns and villages on appealing to some foreign industrialist to come in and build a factory, <Col N="53" /> and giving him a grant to do so.  Why should not that development be carried out by young competent managers drawn from anywhere we can get them, from semi-State bodies, and other different sources?  The Minister may well look at Bord na Móna as having given a lead in that direction.</P>
      <P>Another point that should be understood in fairness to Bord na Móna and their case is the fact that they are rather unique amongst State companies in that they have been charged full interest on all their advances.  I note in the Bord na Móna Report for 1963, the return for the year ended 26th June, 1964 there was almost five per cent on the total capital, whereas other companies which are regarded in the public mind as being more successful and glamorous like Aer Lingus&mdash; who undoubtedly are doing a very fine job&mdash;have very large concealed subsidies due to the fact that they are paying little or no interest on the capital on which they operate.  It should be pointed out that Bord na Móna, right from the start, were charged with the full remuneration for their capital.  This is, of course, as it should be but it does show that the accounts are in every sense very real ones.  Also, Bord na Móna depreciation provisions seem quite realistic, whereas in other companies, as I have already pointed out to this House, the corresponding provisions were anything but realistic. All this redounds to the credit of Bord na Móna and should be taken into account in appraising the work they have done.  The greatest measure of the success of Bord na Móna is the impact they have had on our towns and villages.  Before their advent they were almost degenerating into ghost towns. These towns and villages now have a solid activity on which to base themselves. That has been one of the really positive developments that has come to the aid of these regions.  Naturally, we wish that the other towns, which have not got such development, could have something given them of the same permanence and stability that Bord na Móna employment offers in its regions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Lenehan Mr. Lenehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and hope that it proves to be another <Col N="54" /> important milestone on the road to development of Bord na Móna activities in this country and, perhaps, later, across the border.  I was very pleased to hear Senator McQuillan strongly advocate that all possible steps should be taken for the further development of Bord na Móna.  It is possible, of course, that many of the schemes advocated by economists may be workable in the next world but, in most cases, they do not happen to be workable in this world.  I am afraid it is those workable in this world which will have to commend themselves to us, be they economic or otherwise.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna were, as we all know, the brainchild of the present Government Party.  They have grown into a very sturdy youngster, giving very good service to this country and its people.  Anything we can possibly do to ensure further development should actively be done.</P>
      <P>It is an extraordinary thing that anybody should advocate here the importation of oil for the production of power while we have in this country untapped resources for its production at least up to the present time and for some considerable time to come.  I see no reason why we should import oil to subsidise sheiks of the Middle East and make the running of their harems highly profitable.  We have in this country yet untapped resources both in the line of peat and hydropower. We all complain at having too much water in this country and yet up to the moment, by any stretch of imagination, have we made the use of it that we could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna, in my view, have become a somewhat conservative body.  I am afraid they have been inclined to join hands with the ESB people in what I would call a clean-hands policy.  There are too many people afraid to dirty their hands with constructive work.  It is time that idea was got out of many people's heads because the day may come when they will have to dirty their hands to make a livelihood.  I see down in my own area&mdash;in the middle of the best bog of Ireland&mdash;briquettes being imported from the midlands in thousands of tons.  We have thousands <Col N="55" /> of acres of the best bog in Europe.  I think Bord na Móna should go in much more actively for production of sod peat.  We have within a few miles of where I live a factory forced to import briquettes from the midlands at a high price&mdash;and transport is expensive today&mdash;while, right beside us, Bord na Móna people are employed in the production of sod peat.  But, for some reason I cannot understand, they will not make this turf available to people who could use it.  I think that is a matter which deserves some consideration because this factory alone requires 12,000 tons of turf per annum to operate it.  It appears to me to be an extraordinary situation that turf should be taken down from the midlands while we are in the midst of bog and it could be produced there.  Bord na Móna should make their own turf available to that factory thereby giving local employment and preventing many people from leaving the country.</P>
    <P>It is possible that Bord na Móna are not particularly keen on development in the west.  I have to agree that the weather has not been particularly friendly towards Bord na Móna over the past three or four years but, taking the good with the bad, I feel that the climate in the west is as suitable for the development of turf by Bord na Móna as it is in any other part of the country.  I would ask the Minister, in so far as he can use his influence, to try to get this particular body to take a more active interest in the development of the huge bog areas of the western counties.  By developing these bogs, even at an uneconomic price, we will at least be making a very substantial and important contribution from the social aspect, which is highly desirable.  If it is taken into consideration that all those people are employed by Bord na Móna without any State subventions the question of poor economics may be looked at from a completely different angle.  Every man set free and every family set free to make its own livelihood by work, rather than by its dependence on State aid, certainly points to a very definite step in the right direction and one which we should advocate at all costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> If Bord na Móna or any other State-sponsored company are to be operated purely and simply from the point of view of economics, these companies would have to be closed down.  You can import bacon, sugar and other products of that type at probably two-thirds of the cost for which we could produce them ourselves but it would be a shocking situation if we did that.  People who advocate here that the activities of Bord na Móna should be restricted for purely economic reasons are completely out of touch with reality and the world today.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  Bord na Móna happen to have a tremendous amount of machinery which, for the greater part of the year, is not used at all. There are huge bog areas in the west which could be readily developed for agricultural purposes.  That has been brought to light very clearly in the developments in the peat experimental station at Glenamoy in my area and, perhaps, more particularly in the developments by the grass-meal company at Geesala.  These developments are very clear examples of what can be done in areas.  If the bogs could be developed and a considerable acreage made available to the local small congested farmers in the area it would be of tremendous benefit to them.  I ask the Minister, in his dealings with Bord na Móna, to have these people look into the possibility of using this machinery for the development of these vast areas for agricultural purposes now and in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, well known that when Bord na Móna finish with these bogs they should be used for agricultural purposes.  If this land were made available it would be of tremendous value to the uneconomic holder.  I appeal to the Minister, in his dealings with Bord na Móna, to ask them to examine the possibility of using this vast machinery potential for the agricultural development of those with very short grass which is so common in Mayo, Galway and other counties. This would be a very important activity on the part of Bord na Móna and it would bring very early results.  I certainly commend the activities of the <Col N="57" /> Minister in his efforts to ensure that the very important work of Bord na Móna goes forward and I wish him every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a short appeal on behalf of the 23 private companies in this country which are producing sod turf.  They produce about 100,000 tons of sod turf annually.  While I strongly support the Minister providing extra money for Bord na Móna&mdash;and I strongly support future expansion by Bord na Móna&mdash;I appeal to him on behalf of the small companies engaged in bog development entirely on their own initiative and entirely out of their own capital.  They should get some consideration from him.  I am aware that from time to time appeals were made on their behalf but so far they have been unsuccessful.  They were referred to the banks and credit companies but so far they have not met with any success.  No bank or credit company wants to advance money in respect of work of a developmental nature on a long term basis.  If we advocate that we should help people outside the State, it is not unreasonable that we should advocate a little help for the people who are making some effort themselves in this country.</P>
      <P>Many of the 23 companies engaged in sod turf production are reaching the limits of their resources.  I feel they have escaped attention simply because a case was never made for them.  I would strongly appeal to the Minister to give them special consideration. They have to compete with Bord na Móna which is a good thing.  I feel they are reaching a crucial stage at the present moment.  I would ask the Minister to bear them in mind and see if money could be made available to them.  I am not suggesting that we make grants available to them but I suggest that money could be made available to them in the same way as it is made available to Bord na Móna.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to raise £4 million from the Central Fund.  We have almost exhausted the £24 million that was available already.  That £24 million was <Col N="58" /> made up of approximately £21 million from the Central Fund, £2,500,000 borrowed and £750,000 from Messrs. Guinness.  The first thing that strikes me is why Bord na Móna did not try to float a public loan.  The Minister mentioned in the Dáil that the Board's first public stock issue in May, 1964, was heavily subscribed and that it reflected the confidence of the public in the Board's undertaking.  At the present time there are advantages to be gained from the floating of national loans in order to get in whatever slack money there may be available.  Since the 1964 loan was such a great success, an effort should have been made on this occasion by Bord na Móna to raise another loan.</P>
      <P>I was greatly impressed by Senator Garret FitzGerald's contribution to the debate.  He gave us the benefit of his very valuable technical knowledge in relation to economics.  I listened carefully to him and I noticed he explicitly refuted the suggestion of switching over to oil but he took the trouble to point out that electricity generated by turf for 40 years is dearer and that consumers were subsidising Bord na Móna to that extent.  Bord na Móna, by reason of their experience, have certainly proved to be an excellent body.  They have taken the trouble, as Senator McQuillan has said, to balance their books by charging a high price to the ESB for the fuel which will enable electricity to be generated. Bord na Móna are selling at a high price to make their activity economic and the ESB is the main outlet for 75 per cent of the Bord na Móna power outlet on a comparatively high priced basis.</P>
      <P>In the course of his speech in the Dáil the Minister mentioned that 80 per cent of the present peat moss production is exported.  That, again, shows that Bord na Móna are an enterprising body.  They have gone into a new field and I believe it is a field in which there is still a great potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far, and I should like the Minister to explain why, I notice that Bord na Móna have only succeeded in putting back £2½ million towards the Central Fund from which most of this finance was produced.  I assume if they had put back any more to the Central <Col N="59" /> Fund it would have increased the cost of electricity to consumers to a much greater extent.  All of us are in favour of developing our bogs to the greatest possible extent, so long as there is an adequate supply of turf available.  It was estimated some years ago, I think, that we had 30 years' supply of turf available at a certain level of output.</P>
    <P>We must look forward to the time when the production of turf, from an economic point of view anyway, will be exhausted and we must consider the development of the land remaining. I believe Bord na Móna should take an active part in carrying out experiments and various surveys which will ensure that whatever land is exhausted of its turf can be usefully employed in some other form of production.</P>
    <P>We are moving towards the possibility of the generation of electricity from the atom.  Although the Minister has said it is almost 10 years away, still I feel we must wait to see what the effect of this switch over might be on our economy.</P>
    <P>A Senator mentioned that there are large areas of bogs still available which can be used for development.  I agree with him.  Like most Senators here, I carried out a national survey about two months ago and I saw huge areas of turf.  There appears to be a great potential, indeed.  The main thing is to ensure that the cost of the winning of turf will be brought down to the lowest possible level.  In the long run, as we have seen from our discussions today, it is the Irish people themselves who have to pay, if you like, for inefficiency and if turf is being produced at a cost higher than it is possible to pay for it there is no doubt the consumers in general have to pay for that inefficiency, as, of course, do the industries which are connected with the use of electricity in relation to goods exported.</P>
    <P>Certainly Bord na Móna have been enterprising and progressive and seem to be improving in efficiency in relation to the output of turf.  The £4 million the Minister is asking this evening is essential.  Nobody is opposed to <Col N="60" /> it.  The only point I make to the Minister is I should like to know why Bord na Móna do not float a loan for this £4 million instead of having it added to the Central Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one small point I should like to make.  I welcome the Bill and I admire the work Bord na Móna are doing, especially in the midlands in Laois-Offaly where they have extensive works in hand.  However, there is one problem to which I am not satisfied the Minister or the Board has given fair consideration. It is a problem of the pollution of lands by Bord na Móna.  In particular, this includes the Blackwater bog in west Offaly.  I think it is most unreasonable of Bord na Móna and the Minister to turn a deaf ear to the injustice farmers are suffering consequent on their land being covered over by a layer of 6-12 inches of turf mud which comes up in the winter time in the Blackwater.  Some of the bogs in the vicinity of the Blackwater river have literally lost one half their acreage of grazing land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna, I think, very unfairly rejected responsibility for the matter.  I would appeal to the Minister to insist on the Board shouldering their responsibility in this particular regard.  Near the village of Croghan there are 14 farmers who have been particularly badly hit by this pollution.  What they have asked for would not be very expensive.  I think the Board should pay these people compensation.  In doing so, they should have regard to the section in the 1963 Land Bill regarding the three mile limit.  It would be very difficult for these farmers to get alternative lands within three miles of their holding.  If Bord na Móna agree to the request of the farmers to clean the drains from which the pollution comes during the winter a lot of the damage could be overcome.  I think it is disgraceful for the Board to treat these unfortunate farmers in the shameless manner they have treated them over the last couple of years.  It is high time the Minister got to grips with this problem.  It does not affect many but it is one that will grow.  I sincerely ask the Minister to get Bord <Col N="61" /> na Móna to pay compensation or come to reasonable terms with this section of the farming community who are particularly concerned in this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the members of the Seanad for their very constructive and helpful comments in their consideration of the Bill.  First of all, to deal with the points made by Senator Garret FitzGerald, I should like to say that the loss on the briquette provision was due to technical difficulties experienced with relatively new machinery.  I understand these are being overcome.  Briquette exports have been reduced to some extent due to tremendous demand for fuel at home and I think the reduction on these exports can be regarded as temporary. I have requested Bord na Móna to preserve their export trade and not to diminish it simply because of home demand as it is of fundamental value to the country.</P>
      <P>Senator Garret FitzGerald raised a number of questions in regard to the price position of Bord na Móna fuel relative to electricity costs.  All the fuel cost factors in connection with Bord na Móna production can be considered as variable.  For example in 1958-59 the price of oil in relation to the price of Bord na Móna milled peat was to the advantage of Bord na Móna milled peat.  The price of oil has gone down very much partly, as everybody knows, because of competition by Russia.  Nobody can foresee the future or how in the next 20 years the price of oil will relate to the price of milled peat, and that relates also to various alternative forms of fuel that are being developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard to compare the cost of electricity sent out from the ESB <Col N="62" /> and sent out in other countries.  I must take the statement of the ESB that the costs in general are comparable. One could make a very rough estimate that as a result of peat development here it might cost the ESB something in the region of one-seventh of a penny or, perhaps, a little more to produce electricity because of the existence of the peat stations.  This is a matter that could possibly be raised again on the Electricity Supply Board Bill, but, nevertheless, I find the ESB correct in its statements and they tell me that in general, taking it by and large, the cost of electricity here compares well with that in a number of countries.</P>
    <P>Again, the costs of electricity vary in different areas even in Great Britain, and they vary in relation to the generation demand on electricity boards.  In an area where there is a great deal of three-shift industry the effect on the cost of the abnormal peak time generation will be of less consequence. It is rather hard to make comparisons, but we can say that the situation is reasonably satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The cost of electricity in industry here varies from industry to industry. In the case of many industries it is very low in relation to other production costs.  I can say this, that I have had no evidence from the Industrial Development Authority or from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that any industries failed to start here because of the high cost of electricity.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, there are the other questions involved in this.  Senator FitzGerald initiated an argument in relation to transfer payments from one section of the community to another. I could argue on this question indefinitely, but let me put it this way&mdash; I think myself that when the Minister for Industry and Commerce provides grants through An Foras Tionscal, and the Minister for Finance offers export tax remissions, these are supposed to compensate for any increases in cost that arise from industry starting here. It has never come to me from any source or even from any political interest that these tax remissions and grants should be modified to take account of the fact that electricity may <Col N="63" /> cost a little bit more here to industry than it does in other countries because of peat development.  If that problem should arise the best way to deal with it is through Government grants for industry, tax remissions for obsolesce, rather than through transfer payments from or into Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald also asked a question regarding hand-won turf stations.  These have not been very successful. The amount of turf production has been continuously inadequate. These are not managed by Bord na Móna so that I should, perhaps, not refer to them here but this matter would arise on the Electricity Supply Bill.  Perhaps, I can speak about them as the point has been raised.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna has offered assistance to people interested in Northern Ireland in turf development, and recently an expert came down from the North to examine the possibility of applying Bord na Móna methods in the North.</P>
    <P>Senator McQuillan raised the question about Bord na Móna being required to show a profit.  The Board is not required to show a profit but required to balance its books and, therefore, balance one year with another to pay amounts due for the repayment of capital and interest.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I misunderstood the Senator.  In any event, they are only supposed to repay the interest on capital advanced to them.  I should like to make clear what I have said already, that I myself am totally opposed to subsidies that are paid as a result of current operating deficits.  I simply detest them, and as long as I am Minister for Transport and Power I am only going to accept them if they are absolutely necessary, as in the case of CIE.  In the case of the air companies the position has now been <Col N="64" /> reached where in future capital invested will be remunerated.  To my mind, deficit subsidies produce inefficiency, neglect and inattention to production costs.  The only alternative if anybody is going to suffer economically or socially as a result is that capital should be provided to someone else to enable them to overcome the difficulty.  That is my view and it is largely the view of the Government although there are exceptional cases.</P>
      <P>Although we make transfer payments to farmers, even in the case of farmers we do not say to a farmer: &ldquo;You made X-pounds last year and your cost was Y-pounds and we will pay you the difference&rdquo;.  We give them guaranteed prices for their crops and there is still an incentive for them to make profits.  There are quite evidently some operating deficit subsidies paid, but it is the opinion of the Government as well as mine that we should try to avoid this in relation to concerns such as Bord na Móna or the ESB.</P>
      <P>Senator McQuillan raised a point in relation to housing.  Bord na Móna does not intend to build any more houses.  I have had no complaints in regard to social conditions in the housing areas.  I hope that Bord na Móna will do everything they can, having established the houses where they are, to make the position satisfactory for the tenants.</P>
      <P>Senator McQuillan raised the question of the cutaway bogs, and in that connection the Senator no doubt would like to know that there has been set up a joint committee between Bord na Móna, An Foras Talúntais, the Department of Lands, the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture to further consider the use to be made of the cutaway bogs arising from Bord na Móna activities.  Part of the Lyrecrompane bog has already been taken over for forestry purposes. The question is whether the bogs should be utilised for agricultural purposes or for forestry, and I hope that whatever decision is arrived at as a result there will be continued prosperity in the towns and villages adjacent to the bogs concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> The question of utilising steam in the cooling towers associated with Bord na Móna and the ESB has been examined already, but I will refer the suggestion made by Senator McQuillan again for attention to see whether anything more can be done.  The first report we had, unfortunately, was adverse.</P>
    <P>The interchange of personnel between Bord na Móna and the ESB was also raised by Senator McQuillan.  I have constantly encouraged meetings between the two boards, and their officers meet to discuss matters of common concern.  Of recent date I have suggested even closer collaboration and I hope that will be effected.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to the help of science in Bord na Móna, and I agree with what he said.  I think the absence of a scientific attitude to life generally over the past 30 years is one of the principal causes of our economic difficulties.  In the case of Bord na Móna that does not arise, and I record it for the interest of the House.  Senator Quinlan knows there is a research department in Bord na Móna that has been doing its utmost to examine application for the use of peat for various purposes, and everything is being done to engage science in the exploration of developments associated with Bord na Móna.  The use of Bord na Móna products for gardens has been the result of botanical examination and inquiry at a very high level scale.</P>
    <P>The name of Dr. Andrews was mentioned and someone laughed caustically. That I will not allow.  Dr. Andrews was the founder of Bord na Móna and he spent three years doing his utmost to create the most perfect system of machinery for industrial relations with CIE.</P>

      <P>Senator Leneghan referred to bog areas in County Mayo. Bord na Móna are constantly doing work study on peat production to ascertain how labour costs can be reduced per ton of turf, in every way possible.  If there is any economic way to make use of shallow undulating bogs in Mayo, which are not already being used or not contemplated for use under the programme at Bellacorick, Senator Leneghan can be certain that they will be utilised.  Bord na Móna would have gone out of existence by now if it had not been for the resources of their scientists and the inventive capacity of their engineers, the results of which have been to bring the cost of turf whether for use by the ESB or for fuel within an economic range, in comparison with other fuels. Senator Leneghan can be assured that if possible the decision that the bogs are too shallow will be reconsidered if new methods of milling can be devised.</P>
      <P>The Senator also suggested that some machines in Bellacorick could be used for agricultural purposes in association with Glenamoy.  I can assure him that if there is idle machinery that could be used for agricultural purposes at Glenamoy, Bord na Móna would be only too anxious to lend it, except for the fact that the machinery requires very heavy maintenance during the winter months which might make it impossible.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan raised the question of private companies.  I have had no demand recently for any kind of assistance for private turf producing companies.  Road grants have been given to them and the position, as I understand it, is fairly satisfactory.  We regard Bord na Móna as the principal producer of turf in this country, but, nevertheless, we are always prepared to listen to any private company which asks for help of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Rooney asked about the <Col N="67" /> method of raising capital.  That does not arise on this Bill.  When this Bill is passed and becomes law, the Board of Bord na Móna will decide on the method of raising capital which will be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance, having secured my consent. The question of whether the capital is raised by stock issue by Bord na Móna or by direct advance from the State does not arise on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Rooney also asked about the repayment of interest and capital. The reason for the comparatively small repayment of interest and capital to date is that repayment begins when the bog comes into full development, and it is based on a pre-determined annuity system.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald raised the question of compensation for farmers affected by the falling of turf upon their land.  So far as I know, compensation has been paid to those farmers, but if Senator McDonald has any instance of a person who thinks he has not received adequate compensation I should be glad to hear of it, and the matter will be examined.  I thank the House for the constructive criticism received on the occasion of the introduction of this Bill.</P>

Turf development has gone on in a splendid way, and now we are allowing Bord na Móna to borrow money on their own credit.  I want to make the point that when we talk about the wonderful development of turf in this country we must remember that as far back as 1923 R. N. Tweedy was preaching what was started in 1946.  I remember also that in 1936 the Labour Party were going almost endlessly to the Fianna Fáil Government asking them to develop turf and suggesting we could produce electricity from turf.  The Fianna Fáil Government at that time were contemptuous of the suggestion and it was not until ten or 15 years later that it became possible to develop it.  I do not think the initial stages should be quite glossed over as if everything started in, and nothing was possible until, 1946.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The trustee savings banks, although they are private bodies, are supervised by the State in accordance with the provisions of the Trustee Savings Banks Acts.  The Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1863, which was a <Col N="69" /> consolidating measure is with certain amending Acts the governing statute. The legislation was brought up to date in certain respects by an amending Act passed in 1958.</P>
      <P>Since then the Banks have asked for further changes in the law to free them from certain administrative difficulties and to enable them to develop further in the interest of the community generally.  I am satisfied that in the light of present day conditions it is desirable to concede these facilities which is what the present Bill proposes to do.  The explanatory memorandum explains in detail the various provisions of the Bill which include such matters as the permitting of payments to third parties and of payments on production of passbook without recourse to the ledger, the provision of home safes, the admission of boys'clubs as customers, and so on.  The granting of the additional facilities to the Banks should not reduce the security of depositors.</P>
      <P>There are five trustee savings banks operating in the State&mdash;in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Monaghan and Limerick.  They were all founded between 1816 and 1820 and since then have made a valuable contribution to the development of thrift.  I would like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the work done by them in the field of saving.  Their net deposits have increased from £12 million in 1958 to £19½ million today.  I hope that the additional facilities provided for in the Bill will allow for the further development of the Banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which makes a few amendments, not of very great significance in principle, but which will facilitate, as the Minister has indicated, the operations of the Trustee Savings Banks.  These Acts apparently have been in operation for quite a considerable time and were evidently consolidated in 1863.  When I was looking up the 1863 Act, I was appalled to see provision that in the case of Savings Banks sending out rules for examination by counsel, counsel was only entitled to be paid a fee of not more than one guinea.  I did not <Col N="70" /> pursue my enquiries into the provisions of the 1863 Act any further.  I do hope if there is a consolidation measure in the offing that that particular provision will be taken care of and that the maximum will be increased somewhat.</P>
      <P>It struck me, upon reading this particular Bill, as an ordinary member of the public with some interest in the amount of savings, that I was not aware to any great extent, from advertising or from any other form of activity, of the extent of operations of these banks.  It may be that this is one of the lights that shine under the bushel and about which we do not know enough.  I would hope that section 3, which is designed to give the Trustee Savings Banks a little more scope in their activities, will be fully exploited by them.  It seems from the explanatory memorandum that this Bill will be directed more to providing safes and things of that kind to encourage saving.  If as appears to be the position, these banks have deposits amounting at the present time to £19,500,000, as compared with £12,000,000 in 1958, they should make a greater effort and, if necessary, provision should be made by legislation to enable them obtain the finance necessary to effect their contribution to the savings movement which is so necessary at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one small matter that occurs to me on section 2 of the Bill and that is the dispensing of the requirement that the depositor's book must be produced when deposits of small amounts are being withdrawn.  I am not sufficiently familiar with the operation of the banks to know whether this could be done by an order or something in the nature of the cheque which is used by the commercial banks or whether, in fact, you can take a depositor's book and go in and say I am entitled to draw £10.  It may well be that something of the equivalent of a cheque which is used in the commercial banks or some kind of order signed by the depositor might be a means of freeing some of the restrictions which would make trustee saving banks a more acceptable form or means of saving by the person with a small amount of money.  I wonder <Col N="71" /> whether this facility is envisaged in section 2 of the Bill.  Apart from these observation, the Bill is one which will commend itself to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the provision restricting the counsel's fee to a guinea had the effect of putting the Senator off and thereby presumably restricting discussion on this measure, it is not something I would be inclined to tamper with. With regard to the question of cheques, this matter has, in fact, been considered and I suppose it is true that it would be a facility and would facilitate persons having accounts in savings banks but I am told it would be quite an expensive procedure.  Investigations in Great Britain have shown that it would probably cost as much as 2/-per transaction.  In that event, its usefulness would be comparatively slight. Of course, the reason the ordinary commercial banks can give cheque facilities at such areduced cost is because of the clearing house arrangements. This, of course, would not apply in the case of the Trustee Banks. I agree fully with Senators in the necessity to encourage savings in any possible way we can.  I know all bankers are traditionally distrustful of appearing to compete with each other for deposits.  Probably the Senator is right when he suggests a little more effort might be made by these savings banks to encourage greater saving and more deposits.  I have no doubt they will consider it.</P>

    <Title>Pensions (Abatement) Bill, 1965: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amending legislation is concerned with the abatement of public service pensions where the <Col N="72" /> pensioner is re-employed in the public service.  It deals with pensions which are subject to statutory abatement provisions which can be amended only by an Act of the Oireachtas.  Where provisions for abatement in pension schemes can be amended by regulation or otherwise without recourse to legislation, they are not dealt with in this Bill.  The Defence Forces Pensions Schemes can be amended in this way and it is for this reason, and not any sinister one, that they are not included in the Bill.  It is intended that when it has been enacted, provisions which can be amended by statutory instrument will then be duly amended.  When the Bill was going through the Dáil, some members expressed concern about the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes but I can assure the House that, since then, I have received a proposal from the Minister for Defence to amend these Schemes on the lines of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, I should, perhaps, explain how abatement works at present and to what extent it will be changed by the Bill.  The normal abatement provision ensures that, when a public service pensioner is re-employed anywhere in the public service, his pension is reduced by any sum by which the total of his annual salary on re-employment plus his pension exceeds the annual salary which he had on retirement from the position in respect of which his pension was awarded. Take a simple example, say of a man who retires on a pension of £500 a year, having been employed at £1,000 a year.  He is subsequently re-employed in the public service.  The normal abatement provision at present ensures that whatever the pay on re-employment, only sufficient of the pension will be paid to bring the pay on re-employment plus the pension up to £1,000 a year.  Thus, if the pay on re-employment is £1,000 a year or more, no pension is payable.  If it is £500 or less, the pension is payable in full.  Of course, the normal case is where the pay on re-employment is just lower than that on retirement, say £800 a year in the example I have given.  Here, only £200 of the pension would be payable, that is just enough to bring the <Col N="73" /> aggregate of pension plus pay on re-employment to the £1,000 retiring salary.  This provision was based on the concept that if a public service employee was worth a salary of £1,000 a year and no more before his retirement, he should not be paid more than this by way of pension plus pay if re-employed subsequent to his retirement.</P>
    <P>So much for the existing provisions. The Bill changes these so that, in future, abatement will apply only where re-employment is secured in the same service as that from which the pensioner retires.  As an example, if a local authority pensioner were employed in the Civil Service, abatement would not affect his pension.  It would under the present law.  Thus, future abatement will be of much more limited scope than at present.</P>
    <P>Secondly, although the Bill retains abatement where re-employment is in the same service, it provides that the Minister for Finance, or in the case of local authority pensioners, the Minister for Local Government, may waive this abatement where the re-employment is in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Bill provides that where abatement still applies&mdash;because the re-employment is in the same service and it has not been waived on grounds of public interest&mdash;it will no longer be tied to pay on retirement from the pensionable position but rather, to that pay as revised from time to time to keep it in line with current pay levels.</P>
    <P>These changes are all for the benefit of re-employed pensioners and will effect a considerable improvement in their position.  Moreover, they will take effect retrospectively from the 1st January last.</P>
    <P>Strong representations were made in the Dáil to give the Bill even greater retrospection, but on consideration I think this is asking too much.  It is the old story of giving an inch and being asked for a mile.  In fact, in this case a lot more than an inch has been given in that the Bill as circulated provides for considerable retrospection.  The case for making the Bill retrospective to <Col N="74" /> an earlier date than that chosen was largely based on the fact that many Army pensioners have received demands for considerable sums of money because, due to the retrospective status increases recently awarded to them in respect of their present employment, abatement of their Army pensions was inadequate.  However, I have been in touch with the Minister for Defence on this matter and I find that, although there are some 25 pensioners affected by these demands, the amendment of the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes on the lines of the Bill with retrospection to 1st January last will result in the Minister for Defence owing money to 24 of them.</P>
    <P>In the other case, the man has a relatively large pension and his pay since he was re-employed in the public service about a year and a half ago has been increased.  For the future this man will be allowed to draw his relatively large Army pension without any abatement, so that he will be much better off than he was while in the Army, and very much better off than before this Bill was introduced.  I do not think his can fairly be described as a hardship case and it certainly would not warrant my making the Bill retrospective and thus give him still more benefits.  In all the circumstances, I think I must adhere to the decision that the effective date of this Bill will be the 1st January, 1965.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which I am sure the Seanad will find little difficulty in passing.  It is a Bill which seeks to remedy an anachronism in our legislation and in our thinking in employer-employee relations.  The old Superannuation Acts which this seeks to amend were all passed on the principle that pensions were granted as a matter of course, not as a matter of right and that is the legal position today&mdash;that a civil servant who gets his pension gets it as a matter of course from the Minister for Finance, that he has no legal right to it.  That concept was all right in 1834 when pensions were granted to persons who had been <Col N="75" /> appointed to the public service not on merit or not because they were competent but purely under the system of patronage which existed in 1834 and for 60 or 40 years prior to that.</P>
      <P>It is quite an anachronism in modern times to have pensions for public servants who give the best years of their lives in a not very rewarding, speaking in terms of remuneration, service, regarded as a matter of grace.  The truth of the matter is that nobody is ever denied a pension who is entitled to it. I suppose in nothing has the Minister for Finance, to whatever Party he may belong or for whatever time he may have been in office, shown us to be more human than in considering the granting of a pension to a person who seeks it under the superannuation code.</P>
      <P>The truth of the matter is that as far as the public service is concerned another concept has been developed in modern times.  That is that pension is deferred pay.  If a pension is deferred pay, when it comes to the time when a man is entitled under the superannuation code to receive a pension, of course, he is entitled to the whole of that pension.  That is why, I think, an abatement of pension is an anachronism. This abatement is something he is entitled to.  If he is getting employment that brings his pension plus the salary from his employer above the salary he had at the date of employment, he is earning both.  He has earned his pension and he is earning his salary at the time when the combined sum of his salary plus his pension is greater than his pension at the date of retirement.  Of course, this whole concept of the abatement of pension is, therefore, something that should be completely abolished.  To the extent that the Minister for Finance has found it in his heart to bring in this measure, one must hope that this little germ of reform will expand itself and that he will bring in a whole-hearted measure at some future time to get rid of this anachromism which applies most stringently, I think, to persons in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Minister for Finance, <Col N="76" /> talking in the Dáil, called in odd decisions or recommendations that have been made by civil servants under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  Again, the same antediluvian approach to pensions is manifest in the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme. You may debate hours and rates of pay and annual leave, but you cannot under the General Council of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme debate pensions and they can never go to an arbitrator.  That is the whole antediluvian attitude with regard to superannuation in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered, too, that civil servants' pay at the present time is, and always has been, reduced and kept reduced on the basis of the argument that they were getting a pension. It has always been said at conciliation councils, and I have some experience over a period of years of going into the Department of Finance on staff conciliation problems, that scales of pay were always kept depressed and the Department of Finance said: &ldquo;You are getting a free pension and, as compared with persons in the ESB and other groups, you have not to make contributions.&rdquo;  Again, that highlights the argument that the salaries were kept depressed because the employees were entitled to a pension. In other words, they would be getting a higher scale from the Conciliation Council or from an arbitrator if they were not getting a free pension.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it seems to me to be quite wrong in this day and age to reduce the pension of a retired civil servant or a retired local government employee simply because he returns to work in the same service. There is, of course, the concession being made in section 1 (2) of the Bill that the Minister for Finance will have power to waive this requirement that there should be an abatement if a man, say an ex-civil servant, returns to work.  All that kind of thing leads to unnecessary work with the Department of Finance.  Presumably the number of civil servants over the age of 65 who will return to work in the Civil Service after retirement will not be great. Normally, the persons who retire are persons who have expert knowledge, <Col N="77" /> as happened in the case of the Secretary of the Department of Local Government and as has happened in the case of the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  The present Consolidation Act and income tax laws are due to the work of former members of Revenue staff who had retired and came back to work.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that these people with their special knowledge when in their declining years they choose work rather than idleness never can get more than their former salary.  They have already earned their pension and the work they have engaged in entitled them to the remuneration they were getting.  If any member has any doubts about this, let me assure him, and I am sure the Minister will join in this, that nobody ever gets a salary in the Civil Service unless he is entitled to it.  The Minister for Finance never gives anything but the minimum salary. So when the retired Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners got £2,000 because of some aspects of Revenue law in which he is expert, when he comes back to work he gets £1,750. He has special knowledge and is certainly entitled to the £2,000.  Nobody ever gets more than the rates for the job and we as taxpayers should rejoice in that.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it seems to me that this Bill is to be welcomed because it indicates the initiating of the welcome process of reform which is invariably associated with salaries which is always a mark of any reform issuing from the Department of Finance.  I hope that some Finance official will be brought back under these provisions and asked to consolidate the Superannuation Acts from 1834 to 1963 and that we will then have an opportunity of striking out at one stroke of the pen on a later stage these antediluvian provisions in the consolidated Bill</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister just one thing, and that is in relation to subsection (3) of section 1 of the Bill. It appears that the waiver of the abatement is to be governed by certain conditions&mdash;that persons with particular <Col N="78" /> training and experience are required for particular work in a particular Department or office, that the person being re-employed has that training and experience, and so on.  I am wondering whether this reform at this juncture is attributable to the difficulty in recruiting staff which the Civil Service as I understand it is currently experiencing.  If that were so, I should rather be inclined to regard the introduction of this as a pretext to bring in retired people when, in fact, the Department of Finance should be offering sufficiently attractive salaries to bring in the superabundance of suitable talent which is available to the Civil Service if the Minister offers appropriate salaries.  I understand the situation in recent years has been that there has been a decline in the number of people offering themselves in the open competitive executive officers examination. The examination has been abandoned and recruitment is now via the leaving certificate examination.  I hope that the provision enabling people to be brought back to the Civil Service will not be used so as to keep up the establishment of the various Departments and artificially depress the salaries of existing civil servants.</P>
    <P>Having all that commendation to make on the Bill, there is only one regret I have.  We will all agree that the Civil Service of this country has undoubtedly great talent, and that the people who find themselves in the higher jobs in the Civil Service are persons who got there always on the basis of ability.  Some people do not get there as soon as they might.  Perhaps, that is because of the imperfections of the promotion system in operation.  But there is no civil servant who would take this Bill, show it to anybody and say &ldquo;There is a splendid example of draftsmanship,&rdquo; in view of all the parenthetical remarks&mdash;&ldquo;(in this subsection referred to as the allowance) of superannuation or of compensation payable under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1963 (excluding section 28 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963) to a person (in this subsection referred to as a pensioner)&rdquo; and so on.  It is impossible <Col N="79" /> for anybody unless they have great experience of the superannuation codes and the illumination of the Dáil Debates to know what the whole thing is about.  Even the Minister for Finance on this occasion did not do as he did on the Trustees Saving Act and provide us with an explanatory memorandum. I beg your pardon.  There was one but it did not come with my copy.  As you go on, one finds that the draftsmanship improved and by sections 6 and 7 the thing becomes tolerably clear.  One rather imagines that that was due to the fact that that was probably drafted by the Department of Industry and Commerce and another section by the Department of Local Government.  I appeal to the Minister and to those who are charged with responsibility of drafting measures of this kind that when they have an opportunity of enlisting the sympathy of the Oireachtas in their own cause they ought at least try to put before the Oireachtas something that will be intelligible in the same way as the Extradition Bill is intelligible.</P>

      <P>On the topic of pensions in general, I think something must be said that has been said often before.  It is this, that it is in terms of social justice both immoral and demoralising that the constant decrease in the value of money and the constant increase in the cost of living should be steadily impoverising men and women who have in their lifetime done the State good service. This is a vast and difficult problem. I am not competent to deal with it. I am not an economist in experience, but I have in the last few years grown more and more morally indignant at the spectacle of honourably retired civil servants sinking gradually into some degree of poverty.  It is true that the Government have taken certain piecemeal steps and in some ways have gone a fair distance to meet this, but to my mind none of these reforms in pension legislation has been far reaching enough.  It is a worldwide difficulty, of course.  It is going on all around us. It is not the fault of our Government <Col N="80" /> or of our businessmen and financiers, but we are living in an age when social justice means a good deal.  Fifty or 100 years ago, when an employee reached retiring age, he was given a gold watch, perhaps, or something of the kind and the blessing of his employer and was turned out to fend for himself.  Now we have gone beyond that.  We all give pensions now but, in fact, the pensions the Government and many respectable business firms are giving are steadily frittering themselves away.  They are half the value of what they were in 1947 and one-third of what they were in 1939.  I am simply putting it to the Minister without any detail that I hope the Government are reaching the point where they will make a drastic and far reaching revision of the whole pension scheme.</P>
      <P>The only just solution is to anchor pensions firmly to the cost of living. The only truly just method is that pensions should rise automatically as the value of money falls.  I could elaborate this a great deal but I do not intend to do so.  I hope the time is coming when piecemeal and patchwork efforts will cease and the real fundamental erosion of our social life that is going on will be stopped by what will have to be a gigantic Government decision. It will cost a great deal in terms of taxation.</P>

      <P>Debating this Bill there is complete agreement on the principle of the Bill, which is simply one to which the agreement of this House will be almost equally complete with agreement that it does not go far enough and that what we have here is but a minor measure attempting to deal with what is a major problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is two years now since we had the <Col N="81" /> last Superannuation Bill.  During the debate in the Seanad on that Bill, the Minister for Finance was happy to assure the Seanad that it was a temporary measure to meet certain urgent requirements, and that a consolidation measure was on the way.  On that occasion I suggested to the Minister for Finance, now happily our colleague in this House, that in spite of all the good intentions about a consolidation measure, those measures took years and even decades to appear in the form of legislation before the House. Here we are now two years later with another bit of piecemeal legislation, another Bill dealing with a tiny corner of the problem, and still no attempt to bring in a consolidation measure which would give us a superannuation code for our public servants that would be in tune with the second half of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>There is in that code, and there is even in this amending Bill which we are now adding to that code, still far too much of the spirit of 1834.  We will never by means of this piecemeal amending legislation be able to get away from what is the spirit and soul of the superannuation legislation which had its origin before the reform of the British Civil Service.  What we need is a complete review and a complete code which will incorporate all of value that has been brought into the superannuation code to date, something which will be unified, and something which will be in tune with the needs of the economy and the needs of the public service at the present time.</P>
    <P>Now, where is the initiative for this work to come from?  If we are to leave this matter merely to the initiative of the Minister for Finance I think it will be slow in coming.  What will happen in the future will be what has happened in the past.  We will get amending Bills brought forward from time to time, to meet the cases that have given rise to trouble in the establishment division of the Department of Finance, but it looks as if there is very little hope of our ever getting a full-scale review.  I do not think this is a case in which it would be appropriate for the Government to set up a commission <Col N="82" /> of inquiry of the usual type. Such a commission, one would judge by commissions which dealt with similar subjects in the past, would be largely a representative body, a large body, and a part-time body which would spend a great deal of time, and which would find great difficulty in giving a unanimous report which would have any real meat in it.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, open to me or to any other Member of the House to put down a motion for discussion in the Seanad in order to see if we could supply the initiative in this very necessary matter.  Such a motion, even if discussed, and even if passed, would be little more than a resolution of pious intent.  During the period of the Seanad election, and since then, many people have been exercised by the question of what should be the function of Seanad Éireann in the Oireachtas in the coming years.  Many people are concerned, and many Senators are concerned, because the Seanad is not being asked to play its full part in helping forward, by legislative action and by other means, the progress of the country.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, when a question of this type comes before us, and when we get a Bill which I feel, and which I think many Senators feel with me, is a mere tinkering with a major problem, the Seanad must ask itself: can the initiative come from Seanad Éireann?  Is there any way in which the Seanad as a collective body can perhaps supply this initiative?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir.  I was going to suggest that the existence of this Bill, and its failure to include a wider reform of the superannuation scheme, indicate that there is an absolute lack of initiative, and all I wanted to suggest &mdash;and I trust you will find it in order, Sir&mdash;is that the Seanad might well consider that this is a matter which a select committee of this House could discuss with profit, and, perhaps, make recommendations that would assist the Minister for Finance in tackling the monumental task of giving us a superannuation <Col N="83" /> measure which would be all we would hope it to be.</P>
      <P>While this Bill is welcome it does, as I say, smack far too much of the spirit of 1834.  There is still a great element of grace and favour about the provisions of the Bill.  All matters in the slightest doubt are at the absolute discretion of the Minister for Finance to decide.  While there is absolutely no question that the Minister for Finance is the most benevolent of despots, still I do not think that in a Bill coming to us at this time we should be carrying forward this spirit.</P>
      <P>I should like to give an example of what I mean.  It occurs in section 1, subsection (1), paragraph (b), subparagraph (i) sub-sub-paragraph (II). In this sub-sub-paragraph the position is that if any change has occurred in the rate of remuneration of a particular post between the period when a person is retired and the period when he is re-employed again in the public service then only such change in the rates as has occurred, as may be specified by the Minister for Finance, can be allowed for.  Here we have an unnecessary restriction.  We have here again the spirit of 19th Century legislation on superannuation, and that is something I think we should get away from in this day and age.</P>
      <P>As Senator O'Quigley said, the position is that when salary claims are being entertained, Civil Service salaries are judged on the basis that there is, in fact, a non-contributory pension scheme, and when salaries are being judged in comparison with outside employment, where people have to contribute to their pensions, this is brought forward as a reason why Civil Service salaries should not be equated with the salaries of outside employment. Yet, in the matter of pensions there still remains the spirit of grace, and I think it is reflected in this Bill, because if Civil Service salaries are being fixed in this way, the position under the Bill is that the person is not allowed to exceed his salary when he is employed later on in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that at least an allowance should be made, and that the <Col N="84" /> sum should not be allowed to exceed the original salary plus an allowance for superannuation.  If someone is seconded from the Civil Service the Minister for Finance insists on being recompensed to the extent of the salary plus an allowance for the pension of the individual.  The restriction in this Bill should not be to 100 per cent salary but rather to 105 per cent to 110 per cent.  The restriction to the net salary is an example of the ambivalent attitude which the Minister for Finance takes in matters of this kind. The fact is that the non-contributory nature of the pension is fully allowed for when the Minister is taking in money from someone else, but when it comes to the matter of the Minister paying out it is not allowed for quite so readily.</P>
    <P>On the question of retrospection, which the Minister dealt with in his opening statement, this was a matter which caused some concern during the debate in Dáil Éireann.  It is good to have the assurance of the Minister in the case of persons affected who were formerly members of the Defence Forces, that in 24 of every 25 cases, when all the sums have been done, it will end up by the Minister owing the pensioner some money rather than the other way round.  I should like to ask the Minister what is to be the position in regard to those people.  When this Bill becomes law, I take it they will be entitled to further amounts and I should like to ask the Minister whether the position will be that the demands which have been made on these officers for the return of money will now be suspended until the Bill becomes law. Does the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Defence&mdash;whoever is concerned&mdash;intend to press these demands that the money be returned and that a second money transaction take place in the opposite direction some time later?  I suggest to the Minister that it would be as well if these demands were now withdrawn, pending the settlement of the whole matter.</P>
    <P>There is one small point I would like to raise in regard to subsection (3) (c) of section 1.  It is the condition of the waiver of the abatement and in which it says that one of the conditions <Col N="85" /> on which this waiver is made is that the Minister for Finance is satisfied that it is not practicable to meet the requirements of the public service, other than by the re-employment of pensioners.  I should like to ask the Minister could he give us some idea of what meaning should be attached to the word &ldquo;practicable&rdquo;, in this particular instance.  I think the word could have shades of meaning going from one end rather close to &ldquo;possible&rdquo; and to the other end approaching &ldquo;convenient&rdquo;.  I should like to know just what is the meaning of the word &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; in this very important section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I regard the Bill as a welcome one for what it will do.  It is not so welcome, however, for what it omits.  I would suggest that there is in this regard undoubted need for a complete review and a completely new code in regard to superannuation.  I suggest to the Seanad and to the Minister that this review might well be work for the Seanad.  I think that the Members of this House, with their particular experience, and who would not be subject to the pressures other persons are subjected to, would be a very suitable body for the investigation of this whole problem.</P>
    <P>Finally, I see there appears in the Schedule to this Bill a repeal of the Superannuation Act of 1834, section 20.  I look forward with some hope, but not very much, to the day when the Seanad will be asked to pass a Superannuation Bill which will contain in the Schedule of Enactments a repeal of the whole Superannuation Act of 1834.  That is a proposition to which we would all readily subscribe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very briefly to associate myself with the Senators who have expressed the hope that in the near future we may have a much more comprehensive review of the pensions arrangements for civil servants.  I do not think the Government are the worst employers in regard to pension arrangements but I do think they could set an example which might be followed in other directions in this country and followed with a great deal of profit.  This Bill goes a <Col N="86" /> certain distance but I think on the one hand it takes away what it gives with the other.  It sets a ceiling on the amount a pensioner may earn in addition to his pension.  It is that level at which he was earning on the day he retired plus some vague amount to be varied.  The word &ldquo;varied&rdquo; is used but it does not say that the variation is going to be in an upward direction.  If it means that the ceiling may be set a little higher than that which he was receiving when he retired, why does it not say &ldquo;increase&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;vary&rdquo;? Possibly there may be some circumstances in which it would be varied downwards but I dislike this word &ldquo;varied.&rdquo;  It is very vague and I think it should be made clearer.  The principle on which this variation is to operate should also, I think, be specified. The position of the retired person in this country is becoming more serious every day.  It is one of the social injustices of our time.</P>
      <P>I mention just one example of a retired person I know who is positively afraid that he may live for another ten years.  He is not an old man but if he does live for another ten years, with the value of money continuing to diminish as it is at present, he will not be able to live on his pension at the end of that time.  I suggest to the Minister that he should get under way as soon as possible a comprehensive scheme to deal with these injustices, this pension position which would not only affect civil servants but would also bring pressure to bear on other organisations to have a decent pension scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill which is merely another step in the dismantling of the abatement machinery which never had very much to recommend it.  Certainly, as time goes on and as most categories have been relieved of the burden of abatement, it becomes more and more unfair that the remaining categories should still suffer under it.  I have in mind in particular, of course, the question of former members of the Defence Forces who are in a particular category because most of them, by reason of Army regulations, have <Col N="87" /> to retire at an early age and, consequently, they are men who have to look around for employment when they retire from the Army.  These men have to start life anew.  It is a particularly serious matter for them if they take a job in State or semi-State employment that their pension should be affected.</P>
      <P>The injustice of this abatement affects these men.  In many cases they are in the position that if they take a job of this kind they are going to get worse value and be in a worse financial position than if they got a similar job outside State employment.  Consequently, it will arise in some circumstances that a man who is ideally suited for a job in semi-State employment will not take it and the State and public, as a result, are at the loss of his service.  For these reasons I am very glad that the Bill has been introduced.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I hope the question of retrospection will be reconsidered by the Minister.  I understand the position at the moment is that it should be retrospective to the 1st January this year but, having regard to the fact that many other categories have had the benefit of the abolition of abatement for many years past the categories who are affected by this Bill should have the benefit of it for a considerably longer period than the 1st January of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all join in welcoming this Bill as far as it goes.  I particularly endorse what has been said by previous Senators on the necessity for producing a much more comprehensive measure and giving us a consolidated scheme.  As it is, it removes many difficulties and anomalies for employment in the public service compared with employment in private industry.  Consequently, it is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should like to have a clear indication of the orders that will be made by the Minister in the case of the Defence Forces.  We hope they will be more lenient with regard to them because they are a special category in so far as officers can retire much earlier than they can retire in <Col N="88" /> other parts of the service.  That is a good thing and it is something that should be encouraged.  They have got an army training and so they should be in the position of taking up other careers while they are still in their prime.  They have had army training and are specially trained in the handling of men and materials and could be of great benefit to our economy. Consequently, I appeal to the Minister, when drafting those conditions, to ensure that those people are treated generously and that there is no penalty imposed on officers who retire at the earliest possible moment.  Those people, when they retire early, should be in the position that they can take up new situations and with their drive and vitality they can be of great benefit to the community.</P>
    <P>There is another feature that the Government should bear in mind and that is the question of immobility of pension.  We know, of course, that the immobility of pension is used as a means of anchoring a man to a job. That is possibly a reasonable enough point of view for private firms to adopt.  They want to hold on to their men because, having trained them and so on, they want to get their full working life out of them.  The fact that they cannot take a pension with them deters them from  seeking openings otherwise.</P>
    <P>The State should set a headline in this matter because the State is concerned with the national welfare as a whole.  If they make it possible to have mobility in the public service it would contribute a great deal to ensuring that the men went to the job for which they were best equipped and made the maximum contribution to the national effort.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to make.  All the sections here seem to be in accord with one another except one.  They are all of the same pattern even one which I found rather interesting.  The President is provided for in the very unlikely event of his ever coming back to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If he did that he could bring his presidential pension with him.  There is one area which seems to be totally out of step with the others <Col N="89" /> and that is the section concerning the Attorney-General.  Here now he can receive a golden handshake.  That is what it is.  The provision repeals Section 23 of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938.</P>
    <P>This provision enables payment of a gratuity to a retiring Attorney-General except where he is appointed within 12 months of his retiral to a public office with remuneration at over £1,000 a year.  We can see the purpose of that.  It was to enable an Attorney-General to catch up in his practice if and when he left the post of Attorney-General. We would agree it is reasonable that a gratuity should be paid on that score but it is very unreasonable that a gratuity should be paid to an Attorney-General for his practice. Most Attorney-Generals have a very comfortable post in the High Court or Supreme Court and I do not think we should for one moment sanction the granting of a golden handshake on such an occasion.  I feel this repeal is totally out of step with the rest of this Bill and I cannot see any justification for it.  The figure for re-employment in the public service in 1938 of £1,000 a year, could, of course, be modified. Today it would mean £3,500 a year. If a person finds employment in the public service at over that figure surely we cannot subscribe to the fact that he is losing anything by serving as Attorney-General.  In fact, the post of Attorney-General is probably one of the most sought after and one of the most lucrative posts that is in the care of the Government.  I suggest this section should be deleted from the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is more liberal in its approach than any previous legislation, particularly at a time of changing money values.  I want to draw attention to another problem which is parallel with this.  I refer to the question of compensation which is paid by the State to people made redundant by CIE.  Recoupment is made to CIE by the Minister and there is provision for anybody made redundant taking employment subsequently with CIE or any other semi-State undertaking, the public service or <Col N="90" /> local authorities.  The pension or compensation is abated accordingly.</P>
      <P>We were told that the reason for that was that it was general practice and public policy at that time.  Apparently this policy is now being changed.  I welcome the change and I would ask the Minister to look into this problem which was put into the 1958 transport legislation simply because it was a provision in regard to pension abatement at that time.  The Minister should now arrange to have that provision adjusted in a similar way to the provisions in this Bill.  I hope the Minister will take the opportunity of looking into that matter.  It seems to be parallel with what is in this Bill. If there is good reason for making this change here, equally, I suggest, there is good reason for making the change for people who were formerly employed in public transport and who were made redundant in various re-organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to raise two points.  First of all, a number of executives of CIE who have retired more than seven years have got no pension abatement or allowance.  There is a retrospective clause in this Bill which goes back only to the 1st January. I doubt whether there are so many people in any other section of the public service who have been affected to a greater extent than the executives of CIE who retired a number of years ago.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear from the Minister that the Department of Defence will be dealing with pension abatement arrangements so far as Defence regulations affect such pensioners.  There is one point I should like to raise here and it seems difficult to interpret.  It is the provision in section 1&mdash;between lines 25 and 35.  Generally speaking, this is the effect of it.  In the memorandum it is explained that the provisions of section 1 will not apply to a pensionner who is re-employed between the 1st January, 1965 and the passing of this Bill unless he opts for them before the 1st January, 1966.  That can be described, if you like, as an optional clause of the Bill.  It goes on further to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he does not opt, the existing <Col N="91" /> provisions of Section 20 of the 1834 Act will continue to apply to him.</P>
    <P>I was wondering if the Minister did not consider that it would be to the best advantage for him to come under the new legislation.  Why does he leave the man in a situation where section 20 of the 1834 Act would continue to apply to him and where would the advantage be to the person concerned? I expect the present legislation will improve on any legislation that operated in the 1834 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the debate and I have struggled with the text of the Bill.  I think I now understand it.  I still feel a sense of surprise that this Bill should be welcomed as a progressive piece of legislation. I do not disbelieve that it is progressive.  This is an indication to us of how bad the situation was before. The Bill presents pensioners who are retiring from the public service with less pay than would have been theirs if the Bill had not been introduced. I think it is hard, therefore, to define the underlying assumptions.</P>
      <P>I think that Senator O'Quigley made all those points very well.  The very title of the Bill, before I come to that aspect of it, is very far from clear.  It is:</P>
      <P>An Act to modify certain statutory provisions relating to abatement of pensions, gratuities and allowances in respect of public service.</P>
      <P>I thought it should be made clear by saying &ldquo;in respect of superannuated public servants returning to the service,&rdquo; I think what is implicit in the Bill should be clearly set out in the Title or sub-title.  I think it takes a lot of wading through to discover that this applies, as the Minister told us, to pensioners returning to the Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with Senator O'Quigley when he put forward the view that Civil Service superannuation is, in fact, a form of deferred payment. A rate of pay is accepted which is less than that outside in a non-pensionable position.  I understood that at the end of service this deferred payment will be paid back.  I think it should be <Col N="92" /> regarded as not right and I think it is the general view that the pensioner has earned his pension.  It is not a special favour to anyone old.  Consequently, I would say to abate it in any way no matter what post he may take or how he may usefully return to the Service is unjust.  All abatement of pension that has been paid for in terms of service would appear to me to be unjust. I would also feel that this abatement given effect to in the Bill discourages certain people from returning to the Service.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason, of course, that we have subsections (2) and (3) of section 1 which allows the Minister to waive it in certain cases where the services of such pensioners are so urgently needed that you have to win them back by treating them leniently, that is to say by allowing them to retain their full pension.  I think this is an admission that you are treating the other civil servants who care to come back unjustly by abating their pensions, which I would regard as having been earned by them and which in my contention should not be abated at all.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying we are far too quick as a State to legislate for pension readjustment downwards, the abatement of pensions, but we are doubly slow to ensure pension readjustment upwards and this is a thing which is a distinct injustice to pensioners&mdash;when salaries go up pensions do not.  It is high time legislation was introduced to ensure parity of pensions with present salaries and not allow it always to be lagging behind. In other words, if we are to legislate thus for abatement we should also legislate swiftly for increase in pension rates when salaries come to be raised because of the rise in the cost of living.</P>

      <P>On the whole, there has, I think, been a fairly wide measure of welcome for this Bill.  I think that is reasonably justifiable because, despite the remarks of the last Senator, I think the Bill takes a reasonable step forward. Abatement now in regard to the public service has only been retained in a very narrow category of cases and to a large extent it has been abolished altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> A number of questions were put by Senators.  Senator O'Quigley was concerned to know whether the provision with regard to the waiver by the Minister for Finance was made necessary by reason of inability to recruit into the Service.  I do not think that would be a fair inference.  This provision is necessary because there could be circumstances arising in which it could be necessary to take back into the Service, or retain in the Service after their normal date of retirement, persons of special skill and experience.  In that connection, I think it was Senator Dooge who asked me to define &ldquo;practicable&rdquo;. It seems to me this would cover also the type of situation where, for instance, some urgent work had to be done.</P>
    <P>It could be that some new scheme had to be got under way urgently, or some work of that nature undertaken, where it would not be practicable to train people for this work in less than a year or two, and, therefore, the only way of getting the job under way immediately and ungently would be to take back into the Service people who had already had the special training or skill necessary.  That seems to me to be what is envisaged in this form of words used in this particular subsection.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley was critical of the drafting of the measure.  Of course, opinions always differ as to the merits of the drafting of any particular piece of legislation.  I want to say that when you amend and when you have to legislate by reference it is very difficult to escape the type of phraseology to which the Senator took exception. For my part, I always prefer to see any measure a consolidating measure rather than an amending one.  I think we should try more and more to get that when we are changing the law, that is, to consolidate it at the same time.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Justice I always tried to do that.  But, of course, it is much easier to do that sort of operation in the Department of Justice than it is in the Departments&mdash;I will not use the word &ldquo;busier&rdquo;&mdash;which are more involved in the day to day running <Col N="94" /> of the country and its trade and commerce and so on.  Things always have to be done quickly and staff is at a premium and there is always a great temptation to do a particular task that has to be done by means of a piece of amending legislation rather than by endeavouring to consolidate the law.</P>
    <P>There was some mention by Senators of the level of pensions as distinct from this question of abatement.  The suggestion was made by a Senator that pensions should be related to the cost of living.  I want to assure the House that that is, in fact, being done.  The Pensions (Increase) Act of 1964 enables pensions to be increased by regulation to take account of cost of living increases.  This is, in fact, being done in relation to the rise in the cost of living up to February, 1964 and the necessary moneys to do this are being provided in this year's Budget.</P>
    <P>I feel that I should take this opportunity of saying that the former Minister for Finance, who is now, as has been mentioned, a member of this House, was always very humane and humanatarian in his approach to this problem of public service pensioners. I would never have dared admit when he was still Minister for Finance that he was over generous, and now that he-is no longer exercising the reins or holding the purse strings it is only fitting that tribute should be paid to the progress made in this whole field during his period as Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>A great deal of reference has been made tonight to some particularly reprehensible spirit of 1834.  The only thing I can say about that is that there are some spirits of 1834 and if we had preserved them until this date they would be very attractive beverages by this stage.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Credit Bill, 1965: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The chief purpose of the Bill is to get the approval of the Oireachtas to increase the financial resources of the Agricultural Credit Corporation so that the Corporation will be able to continue to lend money for the benefit of the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>The last occasion on which the Oireachtas increased the Corporation's resources was in 1961.  The Agricultural Credit Act passed in that year increased the share capital of the Corporation from £300,000 to £2 million and it also increased from £8.3 million to £10 million the Corporation's authority to borrow money.  These additional resources are now practically exhausted.  The Corporation's share capital has been fully subscribed and borrowings have almost reached the £10 million limit.</P>
      <P>It is good to be able to record this increased borrowing which is in step with the increased activity in the agricultural industry.  The Corporation's lendings have greatly increased since 1961.  Between the start of business in 1928 and April, 1961, total lendings amounted to £10¼ million but in the four years from April, 1961, to April, 1965, practically the same amount, £10.3 million to be exact, was lent. One must allow for the fall in money values but even so the increase is remarkable.  I should also say that of the £10 million lent since 1961, about half was lent in the year ended April, 1965.</P>
      <P>The present Bill, therefore, in order to enable the Corporation to carry on its good work proposes to increase the Corporation's share capital from £2 million to £6 million and its borrowing powers from £10 million to £20 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other provisions <Col N="96" /> in the Bill and I hope that the explanatory memorandum which I have circulated will be helpful to Senators. There is one point I would like to draw attention to in connection with the explanatory memorandum. As a result of an amendment brought in by me in Dáil Éireann, the Bill as passed by the Dáil has a section&mdash;section 4&mdash;which does not appear in the Bill as introduced.  The purpose of section 4 is to enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee in full borrowings by the Corporation.  This is a necessary corollary to increasing the Corporation's borrowing powers.</P>
    <P>Section 5 in the Bill as passed by An Dáil is referred to as section 4 in the explanatory memorandum, with consequential renumberings in other sections.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the other provisions in the Bill&mdash;described in section 4 and onwards in the explanatory memorandum&mdash;is mainly to extend the provisions of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1961.  That Act as well as giving the Corporation additional financial resources also widened the range of purposes for which the Corporation could make loans and extended the means by which loans could be made.  The 1961 Act, for instance, brought in the &ldquo;charging order&rdquo; system which provides a fairly simple procedure when the Corporation takes a charge on registered land as security for a loan.  The 1961 Act also enabled the Corporation to engage in hire-purchase business.</P>
    <P>The present Bill proposes to enable a charging order to be used when the Corporation is making a loan to the personal representative of a registered owner of land.  Also, the Bill proposes to allow a registered owner to have his land charged as security for a loan made to another party as, for example, where a farmer guarantees a loan made to a son who is establishing himself in another farm.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to increase from £1,000 to £2,000 the limit up to which charges by the Corporation on land will rank prior to equities.  Priority to equities in the Corporation's favour was first fixed in 1928 and the <Col N="97" /> limit was then set at £400.  It remained at that figure until the Agricultural Credit Act, 1961, increased it to £1,000.  The Corporation have assured me that they are not aware of any case where a priority charge in their favour was a cause of loss to an equitable claimant.  £2,000 would be well in excess of the average loan made by the Corporation but in view of the Corporation's assurance and having regard to falling money values, I am satisfied that the increase in the limit is reasonable.  It facilitates considerably both borrower and lender in that normally pre-registration title would not have to be investigated in such cases.</P>
    <P>The limit on borrowings by personal representatives is also being increased from £1,000 to £2,000 and the Bill provides that the Corporation may guarantee loans by third parties to personal representatives.  Under the 1961 Act, the Corporation was given power to guarantee loans by third parties but this power was not specifically extended to guaranteeing loans raised by personal representatives from third parties.</P>
    <P>As regards the recovery of moneys due, the Bill provides that a certificate by the Corporation of moneys due under a hire-purchase agreement may be accepted in Court proceedings as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the debt. There is a similar provision under existing legislation as regards moneys due in respect of loans or advances but the existing provision does not extend to hire-purchase dealings.  I propose to remedy that deficiency.  I am happy to be able to say that the number of cases in which the Corporation has to resort to court proceedings is comparatively small.</P>
    <P>The 1961 Act gave the Corporation authority to accept deposits from cooperative societies.  It is, however, precluded from accepting deposits from sources other than co-operatives. I, therefore, propose to give the Corporation the necessary authority.</P>
    <P>Under the Agricultural Credit Act, 1961, the charging orders introduced by the Act were exempted from stamp duty and registration fees in the Land <Col N="98" /> Registry.  The Bill proposes to exempt from stamp duty and registration fees all mortgages and charges in favour of the Corporation, and also releases from such instruments.  This will place borrowers using mortgages or deeds of charge in the same position as borrowers using charging orders in so far as these duties and fees are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes certain provisions as regards membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas by directors, officers and servants of the Corporation. These provisions are in line with established provisions as regards membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas by directors and staff of State companies.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a very important measure to enable the agricultural industry to maintain its progress and I confidently recommend it to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to justify the Minister's confidence by welcoming the Bill.  We all know that in earlier years the Agricultural Credit Corporation made disappointing progress in the development of agricultural credit.  In 1961, only nine per cent of the total amount outstanding to farmers came from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and 91 per cent came from the banks.  Since that time great progress has been made. The amount outstanding doubled in the three years between 1961 and 1964, raising the proportion of total credit provided by the Corporation to 13½ per cent.  In the past year as the Minister has told us, the total amount lent was of the order of £5 million, which implies that the increase in the amount outstanding last year must be a figure of about £4 million.  So we have now reached the stage where almost half the increase in credit extended to the agricultural community is coming from the Corporation, and they are now making a really substantial contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is still some evidence that the Corporation are over-cautious in their approach to the provision of agricultural credit in many cases.  I have heard a figure of 25 per cent of <Col N="99" /> applications rejected.  I am not sure of the authority for it, and I would be interested if the Minister would confirm it.  If it is true, it seems rather a high figure.  It is understandable that a body of this kind should be rather cautious.  For some time past that has been the difficulty in several of these bodies.  The Government have found it difficult to get them to take risks, which is what they were established for.  If there were no risks their work could be done directly by the Civil Service.  We all know that in the case of the Industrial Credit Company, another body have had to be established to deal with the risky projects. Taiscí Stáit Teoranta were established in order to undertake loans in certain cases where the Industrial Credit Corporation were not too happy.  We must hope that progress will be made by the Agricultural Credit Corporation towards taking a more liberal attitude.</P>
    <P>One of their advantages, of course, is their low overheads.  They have a single office in Dublin with a half-dozen full-time representatives and part-time agents.  They manage to operate on a margin which should be the envy of the commercial banks. They borrow money at five per cent, or fractionally more&mdash;there is a slight bonus for people who leave money with the Corporation for a period of years&mdash;and they lend money at six per cent, which is a margin of one per cent or less, as compared with the four per cent margin of the commercial banks, with their much higher costs through their network of offices throughout the country.  The Corporation are thus an excellent example of a State activity to supplement the private sector.  It is interesting to note that it was established originally in 1923 by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, which were not generally considered socialistic in their tendencies.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal to enable the Corporation to accept deposits from any source and not only from the cooperative societies.  Is the Minister confident that this new proposal will open up the possibility of deposits from other sources and that there will be a strengthening of the Corporation's <Col N="100" /> resources?  What rate of interest would be paid on these kind of deposits, and to what extent would this involve the Corporation in competition with the commercial banks for deposits?  If they compete for deposits, and divert some deposits from the commercial banks, experience has shown that the money returns again to the banks.</P>
    <P>Not long ago, the German banks opposed a bond issue which would have diverted money from them, but they found that the money came back to them eventually.  In this case the farmers will get the money and will use it for useful purposes, to buy the things they require for their farms, and the money will thus go back to the banks.  I do not think we should be over-cautious on this question.  At present the commercial banks' deposits are rising all too slowly for our economic health, but I would not worry about the possibility of diverting some deposits to the Corporation because ultimately that would not affect the position of the banks.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the question of the directors of the Corporation and members of the staff and there is the provision in regard to the possibility of a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas being a director or staff member of the Corporation.  The justification given is the usual justification, which is as inadequate in this instance as in any other: &ldquo;It is in line with established provisions.  In a Bill of this kind one cannot fight a general principle of that kind, but it seems to me to be a general provision that needs to be looked at again.  In this country there is a tendency to narrow down the area of useful activity for members of the Houses of the Oireachtas outside the Oireachtas itself.  They are headed off the boards of State companies. Perhaps there are some good reasons for that, and one can see the difficulties, but they are also headed off from other activities.  They are rarely asked to serve on commissions and even private vocational bodies are reluctant to bring members of the Oireachtas into their affairs in case Party politics might be introduced.</P>
    <P>The fact is that members of <Col N="101" /> the Oireachtas are being deprived of the contacts they should have to do their job properly.  As someone who has not until now been a member of a House of the Oireachtas, I know something of this phenomenon.  In many individual cases it has been my experience that a Member of the Oireachtas has, in fact, been less well informed than other people of less ability, but who were more involved in the particular affairs under discussion. This is a tendency we should resist.  The talent resources of this country are one-twentieth of that of our neighbour.  Even if we allow that we are ten per cent cleverer than the people in the neighbouring country, that still leaves us with only one-eighteenth of the resources of the people next door.  In those circumstances we cannot afford to exclude any source of talent and the fact is that these State bodies have managed to acquire a high proportion of the talented people in the community and anything which discourages them from entering public life is something we should all resist.  This is not a matter which can be debated at great length on this particular Bill but I think a protest should be registered now and I hope that the protest would be followed up by some kind of action to consider this matter an a more general way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer very briefly to one particular subsection of this measure.  Senator Garret FitzGerald has already referred to the same subsection.  I would like to express with Senator FitzGerald my welcome of the measure.  It increases, as we all know, the borrowing limit of the Agricultural Credit Corporation from £10 million to £20 million and its share capital by £4 million, from £2 million to £6 million.  If this House was so inclined I feel we could discuss this whole question of agricultural credit for hours on end.  We could discuss, for instance, the reluctance of the agricultural community in this country to seek credit and to avail of it.  We could discuss the advantage of agricultural credit to the agricultural community and the nation as a whole <Col N="102" /> The Agricultural Credit Corporation have made wonderful progress over the past five years.  Some five or six year ago the lending rate per annum of the Agricultural Credit Corporation was less than £250,000.  Last year that lending rate reached the sum of £5 million and I confidently predict that the lending rate of the Agricultural Credit Corporation in the next year or two will double that, to reach £10 million. I feel that the Minister will be coming back to this House to seek additional financial provisions for the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation have made wonderful progress in recent years in the appointment of agricultural agents, the introduction of a very satisfactory hire purchase scheme and the encouragement to the farmers of this country to invest their monies in the Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the particular point I wish to make.  It is subsection (1) of section 10 which has already been referred to by Senator FitzGerald. This subsection simply states &ldquo;where a director of the Corporation is nominated, with his consent as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas or is nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann, he shall thereupon cease to be such director&rdquo;.  I cannot for the life of me see in this enlightened age why that provision should be included in any measure of this kind.  I agree with Senator FitzGerald that some such provision is included in Bills of a similar nature to this one but I cannot understand it. I agree with the provision that a member of this House should not be a member or a director of a Board such as the Board of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  But I cannot agree that once a man is nominated to seek election to these Houses that, on such nomination, he should be debarred&mdash; and seemingly debarred forever&mdash;from being a director of the Agricultural Credit Corporation or of a similar Board.  I cannot see any reason for such a provision.  It simply means that a top-class man, who could give excellent assistance to such a board and who is prepared to give his time, at <Col N="103" /> very great disadvantage on many occasions to himself, will be debarred.</P>
    <P>I would certainly appeal to the Minister to change that provision as far as the directors are concerned.  I agree that the provision might be left in practice, as it stands at the moment for officers of the Agricultural Credit Corporation but I would appeal to the Minister to have the provision with regard to directors altered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In approaching this Bill we are given an opportunity of having a brief look at the question of agricultural credit in so far as it is administered by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  We are happy that in the last couple of years the situation has improved very considerably and that the concept of the Agricultural Credit Corporation seems to be taking shape and that some of the resources necessary for a proper development in this field are being given to them.  We notice especially the returns for last year when more than £5 million was lent.  This is quite encouraging.</P>
      <P>I had some practical experience in connection with these matters recently when I was helping to get a young man and his family back from England to take over a farm here.  I saw the appalling way he was treated by the local bank when, for a fifty acre farm, just a trivial credit request for £900&mdash;which was much too little to do the development job required&mdash; was first agreed to by the bank and subsequently turned down by the head office.  This man was merely told to contact the Agricultural Credit Corporation. It was proof, if proof were needed, of the great credit squeeze being exercised by the commercial banks at present.  Were it not for the Agricultural Credit Corporation being able to meet some of the demands at present, the credit situation for the small and medium sized farmers would be very disastrous indeed.  As it is, I think the Agricultural Credit Corporation are doing all they can with the resources at their disposal, and which are scarcely adequate for the demands made on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the big developments in the <Col N="104" /> past few years has been the close link up between the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the local agricultural advisers in the drawing up of a plan for development.  This is an excellent scheme and it endorses what the farmers themselves consider reasonable. We are happy to feel that the Agricultural Credit Corporation in their decisions are far more influenced by the soundness of the plan or recommendation given to them than by the magnitude of the sum involved.</P>
    <P>We should, at this stage, try to glean some picture of the magnitude of agricultural credit which is involved.  I believe this £5 million is only trifling with the problem.  I raised this question and developed it in the discussions on the Land Bill in this House on January 20th last&mdash;volume 58, No. 4, column 250.  There I gave a calculation showing, in fact, that the capital input necessary to bring the standard of living of farmers of under 45 acre holdings up to what they might expect out of a holding of that size, was £110 million.  I think that is a fairly reasonable figure.  It would appear that this is something which should be tackled on a five to seven year basis at the most.  I do not think we could be happy until the present rate of capital input for these small and medium sized farms is at least four times the present figure.</P>
    <P>I hope the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Minister will see to it that we have a rate of development on a par with the Government's proclaimed policy of increasing and giving an adequate standard of living to the small and medium sized farmers and that this will be realised by giving them the necessary capital, either by way of grants or by way of loans through the Agricultural Credit Corporation to enable them to make a living which the Government and the Minister consider reasonable, out of the acres which they have got.  We will see, if that is done, very spectacular developments by the Agricultural Credit Corporation in the years ahead. We can, of course, be quite impressed by their new offices but there is plenty of scope for development at the Harcourt Street station office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> We should look into this whole question of credit and see what the funds we give to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and other bodies really achieve.  If we take average figures in this regard we find that an investment of around £130 in capital on a farm, say, for the purchase of more livestock or some other addition to its resources, will increase the total output from that farm by about £100 per annum.  That £100 average figure again shows that about two-thirds of somewhere over £60 should remain with the owner as a reward for the labour that has gone into producing it.</P>
    <P>The amount that has been created circulates through the economy and it picks up strength.  This eventually means that the national income is up by £160.  This eventually means that an average of more than £30 is deposited into Merrion Street.  Therefore, for £130 lent by the Agricultural Credit Corporation in accordance with a sound agricultural plan and for work carried out under the guidance of the agricultural instructors it might be expected to leave the farmer £60 extra and leave the Exchequer £40 better off.  Consequently, everybody benefits by that.</P>
    <P>There was mention during the last election of a scheme for giving interest free loans.  This is by no means an impracticable one for agricultural development.  After all, if you take the £130 capital that was required in the example I cited the interest on that was somewhere around £8.  I have shown it should deposit on an average about £40 into Merrion Street thereby giving a hand back of £8 and giving 40 per cent for the stake involved. There should be much greater annual funds available for the Agricultural Credit Corporation to really achieve the task of getting increased production from the farmer by its investment.</P>
    <P>You have of course, to realise that the figure of £130 I mentioned might in some cases call for pound for pound.  In the early stages of development a small farmer might have to look for a capital of £250 for that £100 output but, within those limits of capital investment.  I venture to say it will return far more than capital <Col N="106" /> which can be invested anywhere else in our economy at present.  Therefore, there is need to apply capital to agriculture and to the other ancillaries with the same liberality as applies in respect of industry.  Factories can get up to 50 per cent or 60 per cent of the factory buildings and I think 75 per cent of the equipment.  There is no such liberality in the agricultural field because I suppose the problem is so enormous and the costs in many instances are so great.  Every agricultural instructor and every agricultural person in the country is convinced of the wonderful return that can be got for investment in agriculture.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, pitfalls that have to be guarded against here.  The one guarded against at the moment in issues from the Agricultural Credit Corporation concerns replacement of capital.  That is a vital factor.  You may give a farmer a loan and he may buy stock with it.  He makes his repayments to the Agricultural Credit Corporation out of the extra income involved.  He has a little left over for himself and he spends that.  His stock has reached the end af their cycle and he is still in the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  In other words, there is not that provision for replacement or depreciation that should mark sound business activities.  Some form of automatic depreciation should be built into the abatements to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The person who has borrowed from the Agricultural Credit Corporation as well as paying to them their interest and principal should be able to pay through some co-operative or other organisation or a deduction could be made from the money as it passes through so that there would be a fund available when replacements have to be made.  It is only by that means that they can develop for the future.</P>
    <P>They can get an agricultural credit loan for seven years.  At the end of that time they pay off the loan for their stock but as the stock have to be replaced they have got to begin all over again.  They have got to get another loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation in order to replace their stock.  We should really tackle this <Col N="107" /> replacement problem in future legislation which may come before us dealing with co-operatives linked up with agricultural credit.  There is also, of course, replacement figures in another activity of the Agricultural Credit Corporation that is dealing with the question of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall explain both of those because they arise under he same Acts.  The Orders were made under the same Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated explains the main provisions of these measures.  In 1963, consequent on the Government's decision to reduce industrial protection by progressive reductions in tariffs and increases in import quotas, competition from low cost goods from certain countries became a matter of concern.  Such competition could come from countries where production costs were excessively low in comparison with Western European standards or from countries where export prices were artificially low because of State-trading practices.  Deputies will recall that in 1964 the Control of Imports (Amendment) Bill, 1964, was passed. At that time, my predecessor explained to the House that the purpose of the Bill was to permit selective action to be taken in relation to <Col N="108" /> imports from low cost countries, particularly in the textile field.  The present two orders have been made under this Act.</P>
    <P>Since it would not be feasible to distribute the quota appointed under the first of these orders, that is (Quota Order No. 51), owing to the wider variety of goods involved, the quota is being administered by the Revenue Commissioners on the basis that goods are charged against the quota as they are imported until the total quota is exhausted.  It is not proposed to issue licences for made-up articles subject to restrictions under this Quota Order when the appointed quota has been exhausted.  It may, however, be necessary to licence certain types of yarn.</P>
    <P>The Quota appointed under Quota Order No. 52 is being distributed in the normal way to registered importers in relation to their over all imports from the specified countries.</P>
    <P>These two Orders are designed to maintain imports of the selected commodities from the sixteen specified countries at their present over all level, and are purely of a pracautionary nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot but think that these Orders will be welcomed by the House.  The need for them arises, as the Minister has said, from the process of reducing tariffs which we have launched but which has been temporarily halted by the imposition of the British Import Surcharge and the consequent decision of the Government to postpone further tariff increases for the moment.  Undoubtedly some protection of this kind is required.  I do not think it is generally appreciated that our whole tariff structure is quite unlike that of other countries.  We have import restrictions and high tariffs far beyond the levels needed to protect Irish industry from normal competition.  The high level of tariffs provide adequate protection against dumping of imports from low-cost countries while by administrative action the Government have ensured that this high level of tariffs has not pushed up prices in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this peculiar structure, with no <Col N="109" /> protection by quota arrangements of this kind against imports from low-cost countries, and with a need also for anti-dumping legislation against dumping in the form of low-cost imports from developed countries, it has become necessary with the dismantling of our protective policy to introduce some type of provision to deal with this.  I am not certain that these Orders will work out smoothly. Difficulties may arise.  The Minister has almost hinted at that in what he said when he points out that it would not be possible to distribute the quota appointed under the first of these Orders owing to the wide variety od the goods involved.  It will be a question now of &ldquo;first come, first served&rdquo;. That is not a satisfactory basis for people rushing to get their goods in before other people m the first months of the year, and then having to wait for 11 months before getting in another, but in the circumstances it is difficult to see how we can proceed any other way for the time being.  We have to see how this works out.  It is an experimental measure but also a measure which is being taken in good time.  The action in the introduction of these Orders is taking place before these imports from low-cost countries become serious.</P>
    <P>Although one may not be convinced that this will work completely smoothly, it has to be given a trial, and it is timely that the Government should take this action.  Quite a number of industries admit that they were or a period quite disturbed at the absence of any provision of this kind. Many of our industries are able to stand up to competition from other developed countries or, if they are not able to stand up to it yet, they are able to get into the position of standing up to it.  Many such industries which are at the point of being competitive with industries in nearby countries or which are within striking distance of being in that position, were worried at the prospect of facing imports from Far Eastern countries, and the absence of Government action and the prolonged discussion that went on before a decision was taken to deal with the matter in this way gave rise, <Col N="110" /> particularly in some of the textile industries, to doubts about proceeding with adaptation measures.  They considered that if the Governments were not doing anything about this competition from the Far East there would be no point in investing money in new plant and equipment.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that this should be ended and that timely action should be taken to ensure that difficulties arising as we proceed towards freer trade will be overcome.  Therefore, as I say, although some difficulties may arise out of these Orders&mdash;we may have a period of some slight confusion&mdash;this seems to be the correct kind of approach to adopt.  It is not more restrictive than other countries in that all countries, with in some degree, the exception of the United Kingdom, do have restrictions of this kind.  When they talk of freeing trade they do not mean freeing trade with the countries listed here.  If these highly developed countries are unable to face this highly developed competition at the moment, we cannot afford to be quixotic about it.  Irish industry must first find its feet in competition with industries in Britain and the EEC countries and then together with them we can move gradually towards liberalisation of our trade with these developed countries.</P>
    <P>We have a duty over a period of years to increase our trade with these countries and to help them to raise their low standard of living and we can help them in their development better by trade than by aid.  But we can hardly be expected to set a lead in this respect and to open to these developing countries our market ahead of other countries in Europe, with the possible exception of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>On these grounds I would endorse these Orders in this form.  We must see how they will work out and we mav have to consider reviewing them in the future.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party welcome the provisions contained in these Orders.  I think the Minister is to be commended for his foresight in introducing these Orders at the present <Col N="111" /> time.  I do not think that it is any secret to suggest that many people are concerned with maintaining the high level of employment we give in this country.  According to some of the evidence at my disposal, quite a number of people are concerned with the possible impact of free importation of goods such as are provided for control under this Order.  We think it essential that some reasonable control must be maintained while we are moving steadily perhaps to a free system of importation.  We think that control of this type is essential.  We, therefore, welcome the order and commend its adoption to the House as a whole.</P>

      <P>There is just one small point.  I entirely agree that the Order is necessary, but apparently the Order was made as far back as the 30th December, 1964, and it only reaches us now in a flurry to meet a deadline date.  The Minister here is not responsible for that delay.</P>

      <P>I do think that, perhaps, a more leisurely debate and, perhaps, a more useful one could be had if we had a little more time.  This kind of delay imposes unnecessary restriction upon the Members of the House and causes the Leader of the House some concern to see that this Order goes through.  I commend to the Minister that when Orders of this kind come through in future they should be brought before the House a little earlier than this one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to one aspect, the selectivity which the Minister referred to in his statement in presenting this Order to the House.  To my knowledge, and I am sure to that of many Members of the Seanad, some of our exporters have grave difficulties in securing the prices which the export of their goods requires in certain of those low cost countries referred to.  Would it be possible in the enactment of Orders before us today and in general in the application <Col N="112" /> of the Control of Imports Orders to exercise some retaliatory measures on some of those countries to ensure that those of our industrialists who are engaged in exports to those countries will be met with the same fair play that we present to those people in their exports to our country as reflected in the volume of imports from them? Perhaps, the Minister might like to get specific information relative to the particular countries I have in mind.  I know of leaders of State having the magic carpet rolled out when they visited here, and when our people responded in establishing factories for export to those countries it has been impossible for them to secure any payment for the goods they exported. On occasion I have been with our Department of External Affairs and I am only too conscious of the opinion which is held in our Department relative to the standard of reliability one can place upon those people.  If we could in the exercise of Orders such as this pursue some measure o retaliation against such countries it would be in the interests of people engaged in this country in an effort to develop our exports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there is much to say except that the reason these Orders come before the House now is that under the 1934 Act the effectiveness of the Order would lapse if not confirmed by both Houses within six months.  The past six months has seen some interruption of the business of both Houses which explains this late stage of their being brought for confirmation.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell the Seanad that all the signs are that the quotas are working effectively and in spite of what one would imagine there has not been a rush.  More than half of the quota in actual value is still left unfilled.  This may, perhaps, be due to the reluctance of people to get quotas for material which may not be able to come in but it fits in with what we want to do anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Senator O'Sullivan has referred to raises a principle of a State taking responsibility for the private obligations of trading companies in <Col N="113" /> other countries.  I should like to think a lot more before I would make any comment on it at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few other points to make.  I had developed the necessity of paying proper attention to provision for depreciation in loans made by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  This provision for depreciation is even more important where the loans have been <Col N="114" /> given for buildings or for land improvement.  In such cases the provision should be made on the basis of a co-operative society charged with the job of the deductions being made by that society on a yearly basis, because this would enable the maintenance work to be carried out efficiently and promptly at certain stated periods in the year and the owner could do the work and pay back the deductions and the conservation would be attended to while the State would have the satisfaction of knowing that the assets were conserved.  That is the fundamental point and it has been missing from our approach to agricultural credit in the past.  Much of the good work of the various grants and loans has been lost due to a failure to attend to that provision.</P>
      <P>Finally, I was very heartened here tonight at this the first meeting of the new Seanad to find two new Members, Senators Garret FitzGerald and Browne, both coming in to attack the odious provision under which those nominated for the Dáil and Seanad have immediately to relinquish any membership or directorship such as in the case of the Agricultural Credit Corporation under section 10.  That is an odious clause leading more and more to bureaucratic dictatorship in this country.  It is one we must resist, and resist to the bitter end.  We have resisted it here in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This all began back in 1951 with an innocuous provision in some Bill which was put through the House, and ever since then, as each opportunity presented itself, this odious clause has been inserted into legislation.  It was in at least four Bills that came before us in the past five years.  We tried to resist it, but we were simply brushed aside, and the process has now become almost automatic.  I hope that on Committee Stage of this Bill we will again attack it, and we can attack it knowing that a fine case was made against it here tonight by Senator Browne from the Government benches. I hope we will be a united Seanad against it, because there should be no slur on anyone who lets his name go forward for public life, which is the highest service to which we can be called.  If it is all right for members. <Col N="115" /> of private bodies, all right for members of universities, all right for private citizens, whether they are farmers or publicans, to seek membership of these Houses and still continue in their avocation, the same should apply to local authorities and State and semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>We might look at the position in a highly successful country like Holland where civil servants can seek election to Parliament, and if they are successful, they merely get leave of absence for a period, and not leave of absence on the niggardly and unrealistic basis which we see in section 10 in relation to the Agricultural Credit Corporation &mdash;leave of absence with no salary increment or salary adjustment.  Is it realistic to expect anyone to give up a full-time position for the allowance given in the Seanad?  In Holland, the procedure is that if a public official, a civil servant or a member employed by a corporation or any such body, is elected to Parliament, he is given leave of absence and if there is any salary differential between his salary and the allowance given to a member of Parliament, he is given that differential by the body which gives him the leave of absence.  That means he does not lose by serving his country.  He does not gain, but it is important that he does not lose.  Many public employees in Holland have availed of that, and the general pattern has been that once they get into public life, they do not go back, and they make a marked contribution to public life.  This means they have recruitment to public life which we are denied in this country.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and the Government to start this new session with a different approach to membership of both Houses.  Let us remove the slur which section 10 implies in regard to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and remove it from other bodies also.  Membership of the Agricultural Credit Corporation is certainly no more important than membership of Bord Bainne and yet on Bord Bainne we have two freely elected Members of the Seanad, Senator Prendergast and Senator Ryan.  That is to the benefit of Bord <Col N="116" /> Bainne and this House.  They serve both and we can expect them to enlighten this House on the problems that beset the sales of our dairy products. In the same way I am a member of the Council of the Institute for Higher Studies and I do not think that in any way takes from my being a Member of this House.  I appeal to the Minister to use his influence to remove section 10 from the Bill.  We cannot afford to have apartheid in this country on the scale it contemplates. It narrows down the eligibility of members.  We already have to run the gauntlet of the press and of our appalling system of election which is hazardous enough, without bringing in the restriction in section 10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill as, indeed, I welcome any measure designed to help the hard-pressed farming community. In doing so, I should like to say that the improved public image of the Agricultural Credit Corporation over the past few years is a great step forward in the Irish agricultural sphere.  I sincerely hope that trend will continue.</P>
      <P>As we all know, agricultural credit is far too restricted in this country compared with the facilities enjoyed by our competitors in world markets, countries like Denmark, Sweden and Holland, to name a few, where I understand farmers are given credit at interest of only 1½ per cent or two per cent.  Our restrictive credit system is all the more difficult to understand when we consider the report made by Mr. Gilmore, Deputy Governor of the United States Farm Credit Administration, when he visited our country in 1959.  He estimated all farmers' assets at the important total of £885 million then, consisting of land, buildings, livestock, machinery, crops, money and credits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other side, liabilities were estimated at £75½ million, and consisted of amounts due to banks, merchants, co-operative societies, hire purchase companies, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, amounts due under the County Council Small Dwellings Acts, and including a sum <Col N="117" /> of £40 million under the heading of Land Annuities to the Irish Land Commission. The excess af assets over liabilities amounted to £809½ million in 1959.  When we consider the increase in the value of land and livestock since then, this figure must now be greatly in excess of £809½ million.  It has not been the practice to accumulate this type of information in this country but its importance cannot be overestimated. It shows the small extent of credit in relation to total assets and points to a definite need for the immediate extension of intermediate and long term credit.</P>
    <P>The role that credit and the Agricultural Credit Corporation are playing in agriculture is indeed vital and essential, but it is useless, unless in its application, it is accompanied by education and efficiency in all its aspects as to production and marketing.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation, I believe, also have a duty to ensure that their officers and personnel are efficient and educated in the needs of the agricultural community.  They should also be capable of assessing the merits of proposals and plans submitted by our farmers, and especially those proposals and plans prepared in conjunction with our agricultural advisory service.  It is distressing to note that not all of the plans prepared in conjunction with the agricultural advisory service and submitted to the Agricultural Credit Corporation are successful.</P>
    <P>For this reason, I would appeal to the Minister and the Agricultural Credit Corporation to consider this matter.  After all, our agricultural advisory service is one of the best in the world and these people are first-class officers in their field.  They know the farmers, the particular farms involved and the problems entailed. When these people submit a plan, I am sure everybody can rest assured that it is workable.  The officer, I am sure, is quite certain that the farmer concerned is capable of putting the plan into effect.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the Agricultural Credit Corporation should, perhaps, take on more of these risky proposals.</P>
    <P>As the Agricultural Credit Corporation <Col N="118" /> is a semi-State body, its role should not be merely to compete with the ordinary commercial banks; rather it should be prepared to take greater risks than the commercial banks.  When the local advisory service get down to working out a detailed plan for a farmer, I feel the obligation should be on the Agricultural Credit Corporation to facilitate that farmer to the best of its ability.  On that score too, I would like to see some system brought about whereby the poorer sections of the farming community&mdash;the 25 per cent we are told are refused loans&mdash;could perhaps obtain loans or at least cheap interest loans, thereby giving them a chance to get ahead.  All that has been necessary in the past for an unfortunate farmer to get into difficulty with his scale of payments was perhaps the death of one of his cattle or some other stroke of bad luck which was completely outside his control.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Agricultural Credit Corporation much more liberal in coming to the aid of the poorer farmers, that is, those under a £20 or £25 valuation, by introducing some system of cheaper loans so that they could all play their full part in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> I believe now that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is getting greater scope and more money it should devote at least some of it to this poorer section of the farming community.</P>
    <P>Whatever the form of credit, we in Ireland must realise how much we depend for our livelihood on our agricultural exports.  In the main, these exports go to pay for the raw materials necessary in our industries.  If there is to be extended development and expansion in our agriculture with inereased exports, there must be available extensive credit adequate to meet the needs of all sections of the farming community.  I would make a special appeal to the Minister to ensure that as many of our farmers as possible should be enabled to help out in this drive for increased production, so that we may all enjoy a better and higher standard of living.</P>
    <P>There are, I believe, two or three credit agents already appointed in this country.  These people have a very important <Col N="119" /> role but I do not think the Agricultural Credit Corporation should overlook the part that agricultural advisory service can play in this field. Let us at all times remember that the local agricultural advisers of county committees of agriculture are the first experts in this particular field.  They have all local knowledge of the various types of farming techniques and methods and know the quality of land from one county to another.  This is something that is not understood by everybody and, for that reason, it is best left in the hands of our local agricultural advisers to draw up plans for the individual farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to give authority to the Agricultural Credit Corporation to borrow up to £20 million for the purpose of making loans available to credit-worthy farmers.  I think it is a very good step in the right direction and comes at the proper time.  We are all well aware that there is a credit squeeze in force at the present time, no matter what anybody may say.  When it comes to buying a farm at the present time, it is very difficult to get the necessary accommodation from the commercial banks.  The same applies in other spheres, of course.  The extra capital being given under this Bill will facilitate agricultural expansion and the increase of agricultural stock.  Everybody familiar with agriculture will agree that the land of Ireland is under-stocked. Our land is capable of a far greater volume of output of live stock, crops or other kind of produce.  We have a vast quantity of fertile land capable of putting up a huge volume of production, but of course the question of marketing the produce also arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, with the credit squeeze being operated by the banks and no credit squeeze being operated by the Agricultural Credit Corporation &mdash;except, of course, the measure of discretion which its officers will exercise&mdash;this Bill provides good compensation to the farmers who need financial accommodation for the purpose of increasing their stocks or going <Col N="120" /> ahead with some enterprise they have in mind.</P>
    <P>Lack of capital in agriculture has been traditional.  Even if we examine, as Senator McDonald has just mentioned, the indebtness of agriculture at the moment in relation to the output from agriculture and the value of our exports, we can see that the attitude of the commercial banks has been more than conservative.  We must find some outlet for increasing the amount of capital investment in agriculture. We had the World Hunger Campaign only a few months ago when it was impressed upon us that half the population of the world was starving and actually down to hunger level.  At the same time, we have in this country fertile land capable of a huge volume of production but, having produced the goods, a marketing scheme must of course come into operation.  The cost of transport beats this country in relation to many of the goods we export.</P>
    <P>I feel the Agricultural Credit Corporation should continue expanding the amount of investment in agriculture. It should increase its organisations. There is, of course, co-operation as far as the various Co-ops down the country are concerned.  They do a very valuable job in financing agricultural enterprise amongst their members in the country.  With those co-operative societies and the extra capital available from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, we can expect greater expansion.  We cannot expect any dramatic expansion with a lack of capital so that anything that can be done to increase capital and organise marketing societies will be all to the good.</P>
    <P>We are all for developing a pattern of minimum price levels because it has happened only too often when farmers have had good crops, they were paid poor prices for them.  They had to take sacrifice prices for what they had to sell.  Therefore, we should, in addition to increasing the capital which will enable increased production to become available, go further with our marketing organisation.  Finance was actually made available for a marketing scheme but the scheme <Col N="121" /> never got under way.  Marketing is a real problem as far as agricultural produce is concerned.  We should not be afraid of increasing the amount of capital invested in agriculture, considering it has been the mainstay of our economy.</P>
    <P>While I am speaking about minimum price levels it is only right to mention in passing that the situation regasding pig prices is becoming difficult and the situation in poultry is also becoming difficult.  I am sure the Minister wiil be able to advise me in relation to one of these.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only mentioning pig and poultry production.  I should tike the Agricultural Credit Corporation to assist farmers to a great extent in connection with mechanisation.  The flight of agricultural labourers from the land is at the rate of 10,000 a year. This is causing farmers to mechanise more and more.  Unfortunately the depreciation in the value of this machinery is very heavy.  The result is that many farmers, who avail of capital far the purpose of mechanisation, find themselves in real difficulty after a few years because of depreciation in the value of the machinery and, of course, the collapse in the value of that machinery, once they have got it.  Much of that machinery is used only for seasonal purposes.  It is not used all the year around.  Therefore, the engine just lies in the farmyard and is used only at harvest time on the farm.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, finally, that I hope to see the Agricultural Credit Corporation expanding even still further.  The commercial banks, of course, are privately-owned.  They are private enterprise profit-making concerns and are, of course, interested only in selective investment, whereas the Agricultural Credit Corporation could invest in agriculture, subject to certain rules in relation to the type of investment and the type of person to whom these loans would be made available.  I believe the time has come when the kind of investment we get from the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be expanded.</P>

      <P>This Bill, in the main, provides for an expansion of activity by the Agricultural Credit Corporation. It also has provisions which will enable the Corporation to carry on its operations with a great deal more facility.  As such, I know it is warmly welcomed by the overwhelming majority of the Senators.  I think the debate has shown we are all agreed on the fundamental importance of credit in agriculture and the necessity for increased credit facilities for farmers.</P>
      <P>I am glad, also, there has been recognition of the fact by most of the Senators who have spoken that the Agricultural Credit Corporation has been doing a good job in recent years and that it has improved its methods, its approach and its outlook very considerably.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to commend the directors and the staff of the Corporation for their good work in recent years.  I am sure this good work wilt be continued and expanded in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The points of detail which have been made by most Senators are more suitable for discussion on Committee Stage.  Indeed, they can be more adequately dealt with by a Committee Stage type of debate because the vast majority of them concern specific points of detail in this piece of legislation. It would be better, on the whole, if I did not attempt to reply to them in any specific way at this stage but left them over for a more satisfactory type of discussion on Committee Stage. I want again to commend this piece of legislation to the Senators and hope it will be given a Second Reading.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Committee Stage ordered for Wednesday, 30th June, 1965.</P>

      <P>As most Senators know, <Col N="123" /> this Bill began its career here in the Seanad.  It was amended very considerably here.  I have no hesitation in saying it was vastly improved by the manner in which it was amended here. It went to the Dáil subsequently.  The Dáil, so extremely well had the Seanad done its work, could find only one useful amendment it could make to the Bill.  That amendment was to section 14, subsection (4) and consisted of substituting the words &ldquo;such roads&rdquo; for &ldquo;such places&rdquo;.  I think no greater tribute could be paid to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the section is concerned with the laying of poison and it was felt that the existing provisions with regard to the laying of poison and the use of the words &ldquo;public places&rdquo; was too restricted.  It could result, in the case of some small farms, in the laying of poison anywhere.  The suggestion was made that &ldquo;public roads&rdquo; would be more complex than &ldquo;public places&rdquo;. The amendment is sent back from the Dáil for the approval of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said practically all the things I was about to say.  The rumour has been moving about that the Seanad is not playing a full part.  I think this Bill has been sufficient demonstration to the public, and to the press representatives who do a lot of accusing the Seanad of not doing this and not doing that and not having enough meetings, that the Seanad is playing a full part. I do not wish to delay the House with any further references.</P>
      <P>This Bill was not sponsored by the Minister.  I think we imposed it on him.  It was a Private Members Bill on introduction.  He has said already that in this House we amended the original copy which was received on Second Reading and I think about a dozen amendments were passed.  In all justification to the Seanad, when this Bill went to the Dáil only one word was changed before it came back here tonight. I was responsible for many of these amendments.  I should like also to refer to the Mines and Quarries Bill for which a Member on the other side was responsible.</P>

      <P>If I may say so, I am referring to the usefulness of the Seanad.  The Seanad passed several amendments to that Bill which were accepted in Dáil Éireann.  I wish to say that this Seanad does serve a useful purpose, and I only hope we will have other cases similar to this. Only one amendment was received back from the Dáil.  I recommend that we accept it; I see no objection to it.</P>

      <P>The passing of this Bill will be the fruit of some eight years of co-operation between the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and four Government Departments, I hope I may take this opportunity of saying how grateful all those who cherish the welfare of animals are to the officials involved. A special thanks to the Minister who was then Minister for Justice and is now Minister for Agriculture.  He took a very helpful and friendly interest in the Bill before it went to the Seanad and after it came here.  He sponsored it in the Dáil and his officials in the Department of Justice were very helpful. Credit is due to the Seanad for the constructive debate on the Bill.  It lost some provisions.  That loss weakened it but I shall not talk about that.  As it stands, the Bill improves the welfare of animals an our country. A good deal more needs to be done before we reach the level of our neighbours in this measure hut it is a considerable step forward.</P>
