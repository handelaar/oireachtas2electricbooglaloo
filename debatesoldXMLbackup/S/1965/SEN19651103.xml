      <P>I have considered the application from Senator McQuillan to raise, on the motion for the adjournment of the House tonight, the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The invocation by the Government of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 in present day circumstances.</P>
      <P>I rule that it is not admissible for discussion on the Adjournment on the following grounds:&mdash;(i) there is no Ministerial responsibility involved, and (ii) the subject matter is, in any event, too wide and should be brought forward by way of substantive motion.</P>
      <P>I should also like to point out that I received notice of the matter only this morning, although the relevant Standing Order provides for notice by 3 p.m. on the day previous to the sitting.  I would like to draw the attention of Senators to this requirement as my discretion to accept matters at shorter notice will be used only in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Senator has been notified of my decision.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to you, a Chathaoirleach, for writing a note to me explaining your views.  I have no intention of disputing your right to make a decision but I feel that the question of the 3 p.m., which you mention as part of your argument against allowing the motion, is unfair, as you have authority, under Standing Order 25, in what you consider to be exceptional circumstances or a matter of urgency, to forget about the 3 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only point I want to make is that you stated as a major ground, when you replied to me, for refusing <Col N="116" /> time for this motion that there is no Ministerial responsibility involved.  I am very happy to hear that, since this motion went in, the Minister has taken steps to release the prisoners on hunger strike.  Let me put it clearly. It shows, therefore, that the Minister has a responsibility and, on the basis that you have ruled this out, I think it was a wrong ruling.</P>

      <P>The Chair said the Minister had no responsibility.  In fact, since this motion went in, the Minister has accepted responsibility by allowing out&mdash;and rightly so, and I congratulate him on so doing&mdash;the prisoners on hunger strike.  As the Minister is present here now, I should like, through you, Sir, to ask that this matter in connection with the arrests be considered as a matter of public importance.</P>

Under that Standing Order, I now ask you for permission to ask the Government to desist from the use of this legislation for the purposes for which it is being employed at the present time.</P>

      <P>I did not know Senator McQuillan would raise the matter on Standing Order No. 26. He has asked that the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act be rescinded.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to Paragraph (1) of Standing Order No. 26 which reads:</P>
      <P>A motion for the adjournment of the Seanad on a definite matter of urgent public importance may be made if a Senator, at the commencement of Public Business, rises in his place and states that he requests leave to move the adjournment of the Seanad for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance whereupon he shall state the matter and deliver to the Cathaoirleach a written statement of the subject to be discussed.</P>
      <P>I draw attention also&mdash;before mentioning the matter&mdash;to the fact that under Paragraph (2) of this same Standing Order if the Cathaoirleach considers it is a matter of urgent public importance and if five Senators rise, with the proposing Senator, then it can be decided to discuss the matter later that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter which concerns me is <Col N="118" /> not the necessity for rescinding the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act, which would appear to me to be a more long-term matter, but the Government's misuse of the powers vested in them under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  I have here the Offences Against the State Act and clearly section 28 allows such action as the Government have taken only against &ldquo;public meetings&rdquo; or &ldquo;processions&rdquo;, within half a mile of the Oireachtas in session.  I would contend that two men holding a placard do not constitute a public meeting or procession.</P>

      <P>On the Order Paper there are two motions, one of which has stood there for a long time.  The Leader of the House has suggested that we deal merely with No. 1.  We have three items on the Paper.  I would ask the House to decide otherwise, and to take item No. 2 and, if feasible, in the time at our disposal, to take Item No. 3, my motion on recent changes in Department of Education Rules.  We have two motions, and we have only one Bill to deal with.  This is an ideal situation to deal with at least one motion.  Senator Ó Conalláin has been very patient about the motion standing in his name.  He asked about it last week and I would ask you to consult the House as to whether they are satisfied with the Order Paper of the day, which includes three items, and we yet are asked to be content to deal with the first item only.  I suggest that this is a method of long-fingering motions which are found awkward by the Government.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>Before section 110 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  It shall be the duty of a testator to make adequate provision in life for his spouse according to his means whether by his will or otherwise.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where, on application by or on behalf of a spouse the Court is of opinion that the testator has failed to make adequate provision for his spouse in accordance with his means, whether by will or otherwise, the Court may order that such provision shall be made for the spouse out of the estate of the testator as the Court shall think just.</P>
    <P>(3)  Rules of Court shall provide for the conduct of proceedings under this section in a summary manner.</P>
    <P>(4)  The costs in the proceedings shall be at the discretion of the Court.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 110 which is the basic section in the Bill in so far as it is concerned with bringing in a legal right system for the surviving spouse.  I made it plain in the Dáil on various Stages, and in the Seanad on Second Stage, that I was open to receive amendments to every section in this Bill.  Indeed, a number of amendments have been accepted both in the Dáil and in the Seanad which I think have gone to improve the Bill to a considerable degree.</P>
      <P>However, this amendment in the name of Senator O'Quigley relates to section 110, and on this particular section, both in the Dáil on behalf of the Government, and here, I said that I intended to take a stand on the basis that the elementary principle in this Bill in regard to testamentary succession is that a spouse should look after his or her surviving spouse to some minimum extent: to the minimum extent of one-third of his or her property, if there are children, and to the minimum extent of one-half, if there are no children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have compromised in section 116 in regard to the original provision which provided a mandatory share of one-third for children.  The <Col N="123" /> reason we compromised there is that we recognised that the case of children is different from the case of a spouse who has lived with his or her other spouse over a number of years and has, in fact, due to that association, embedded at first in the marriage contract, acquired a stake in the property of the other spouse.  In regard to children, the question is one of dependency which we now allow to be decided by the courts in section 116.</P>
    <P>The principle embodied in this amendment is that a similar sort of court application should apply in regard to the surviving spouse making his or her claim for a minimum share in the estate.  I do not think that principle should apply.  We must remember that property has its duties no less than its rights.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington and Senator Honan on the Second Reading made the point that the property of a married man is the property of his family.  In particular, it is the property of the person who has been his partner over a long period of years and has contributed substantially to the development and enhancement of the property, but I should like to see it being held in common form by both parties to the contract.  This is the fundamental principle behind section 110 on which I am not prepared to compromise by way of any amendment.  On every other section of this Bill, I have been open to amendments and would be glad to consider&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not every other section&mdash;not on the intestacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been reasonably receptive, as will be seen if one examines the record.  On this section 110, there is a fundamental principle involved.  If I were to depart from it and accept Senator O'Quigley's amendment, I would be negativing that fundamental principle.  In regard to arguing the case for having a legal right reserved for the widow or widower, the widow in most cases, it should be stated that this is nothing new in the Irish situation.  I have already stated this on the intestacy sections, that 50 per cent of Irish properties <Col N="124" /> now devolve by way of intestacy and have so devolved over a number of years during which we have had a system of a legal right where the widow was entitled to one-third and where we are now giving her two-thirds. This is no strange system as far as the devolution of Irish property is concerned.  We are merely making it compulsory or mandatory on the man or the woman to give one-third in the event of children, or one-half in the event of no children to the spouse in the event of testacy.</P>
      <P>The argument has been made that this will induce some measure of fragmentation or of trouble in regard to the management of property.  This has not been the experience in regard to the 50 per cent of properties that have descended by way of intestacy.  It has not been the experience in regard to farm holdings, where the proportion of intestacies is far higher.  The widow has remained on the farm and she has had her right to the one-third but this right has not been enforced.  Similarly, we provide under section 110 that she will have this right to one-third where her husband dies testate, but it is not mandatory on her to carve it out of the property.  It is a legal right which I would envisage being used by her, as at the moment, in the case of intestacy, as a weapon in case she is, in some way, not getting her due after the death of her spouse.  Therefore, she has a legal right to insist on one-third of the estate which she&mdash;or he, in the case of a widower&mdash;must enforce after the taking out of representation, and, if not enforced after 12 months, this right lapses.  So the ogre of one-third or one-half being carved out of the estate, when examined closely, turns out to be, in fact, a legal right exercisable by a widow or widower but which will only be exercised in the ordinary practical way of things when he or she is being prejudiced in some way.  In the normal course of events, this right will not be enforced. That has been the experience in regard to the widow's intestate share over the years.  I see no reason why it should not be the experience in the future in regard to the legal right under section 110.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="125" /> It was mentioned on the last occasion here that apart from the Fianna Fáil Party, nobody else appeared to be in favour of this measure.  In reply to that, I mentioned that the Labour Party had supported us in the Dáil in the matter.  I confined myself to mentioning the Labour Party.  I met and discussed this Bill in great detail with the people who would fundamentally be most concerned with it, that is, the National Farmers Association, representing the farmers who are concerned with property rights and title to property. The National Farmers Association came to me and were in full agreement with the amendments I proposed to the 1964 Bill which are now incorporated in the Succession Bill of 1965.  They saw, as Christian gentlemen, that there was nothing at all wrong in any farmer having to reserve one-third for his wife or one-half for his wife in the event of no family. They were quite happy with that.</P>
    <P>The section of the original Bill with which they were most concerned was that which provided for a compulsory one-third for children.  Once that was deleted, whereby children from America, Australia or any other part of the world could come in for their particular minute share of one-third, they saw nothing wrong&mdash;and I am sure most people would agree with them&mdash; in having in our society a system whereby the widow, the mother of the family, who had contributed to the management of the farm, for instance, over a number of years, was entitled as of right, if she wanted to enforce that right, to a certain minimum share of the property.  They envisaged a situation where one son could get the farm by way of deed, as provided in the Bill, prior to the testator's death, right up to the date of his death, with the agreement of both spouses or, alternatively, where the son who had remained on the land would get the farm, subject to his mother having a one-third share, so that she, by reason of having that share, would be able to insist on certain minimum rights for herself.  The National Farmers Association were fully in agreement with this proposal.  The Incorporated Law Society, while not going the whole way <Col N="126" /> with the Bill, and still having opposition to section 110, welcomed all the other amendments which were introduced.</P>

      <P>I do not regard the Incorporated Law Society or any professional group, however much I welcome their assistance in the preparation of amendments or the drafting of measures, as having a superior mind to bring to bear on this problem as compared with the mind of the plain people of the country whose letters have poured into my Department over the past 12 months welcoming this measure and this aspect of it.  I do not regard them as having a superior knowledge to that of the Labour Party, the National Farmers Association or my Party, a cross-section of public opinion, as to how property should vest and how rights should vest.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley's amendment seeks in effect in a great number of cases to drive the surviving spouse into court to prove his or her right to a share in the property of the deceased spouse.  I cannot agree with that approach.  In my view it is not in accordance with the Christian concept of the rights and obligations created by marriage that the surviving spouse should be driven into court to answer questions and undergo mortification, difficulties, tension and trouble in order to establish her rights. In the judgment of certain people, she may have failed morally or may have been a spendthrift or an alcoholic.  I would be the last person to pass judgment from any moral standpoint but I do not see why we should drive such people into court to prove their rights arising out of a partnership which has been undertaken over a number of years in a particular property which has been held in ownership by the husband or the wife.  I do not see why he or she, on the death of the spouse, should have to go into court, and have family difficulties and troubles raked up in order to prove his or her right to a particular share of the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the nub of the difference between what is contained in section <Col N="127" /> 110 and what is in Senator Quigley's amendment.  There is nothing particularly radical in this provision in that it is a provision that dates back from the days of Roman law and is incorporated in the legal systems of most countries in the world.  The notion of absolute freedom of testation in regard to property is a peculiarly English idea that has found acceptance in no other part of the world, apart from England and Wales.  Even England has modified freedom of testation to some extent in the inheritance Act of 1938.  It has long been accepted in Continental Europe and in most of the American states, including New York, and it is now accepted in some of the Canadian Provinces and, indeed, throughout the whole civilised world, that it is the duty of a man who has lived for twenty, thirty or forty years with his wife that, on his death, he should allocate some portion of his estate to the widow surviving him. That is all we are seeking to do in this particular section.  When it is examined in that mode most of our people are behind it.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the legal view which has been put here, or at least a certain kind of legal view put here by Senator O'Quigley, that the problem of disinheritance of one's spouse is not a serious problem.</P>

      <P>A sizeable problem. I am using &ldquo;sizeable problem&rdquo; because these are the words used by Deputy John A. Costello.  I think I have more experience than Senator O'Quigley on the political level, though we may place ourselves fifty fifty on the legal level.  It has been my experience, representing a rural constituency, to hear regularly of complaints about selfish men who have lived with their wives over the years and have finally, for one reason or another, decided not to leave anything to their wives, particularly where they happened to be childless.  Such men, for some selfish reason or for reasons of vanity, decide to keep the farm in the family name.  I have known of <Col N="128" /> cases where a woman has served a man and managed his farm for 30 or 40 years and, just because she has not borne a son of the same name as the father, she finds she is left with nothing and the family farm goes back to some relative of the father.  I have known numerous such cases and, as Deputy John A. Costello says, this represents a sizeable problem.  The letters in my Department bear that out.</P>
      <P>It is all very well for lawyers to say this particular matter does not come up that often in solicitors' offices or in the courts.  The fact of the matter is that many people are very chary about going to a solicitor or entering into court proceedings.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Quigley has a cynical view on this.  I am personally aware of a number of sensitive people with rights who did not choose to insist on them and did not wish to be brought into court.  If they do go, under the present law, they have to prove that the testator was insane in order to achieve their rights. These people, particularly surviving widows, who are prejudiced by their husbands, represent a very sizeable section of the community, as evidenced by the letters which I have received in my Department and, indeed, received by my predecessor over the past two years since this matter was mooted.  I have had an official working practically wholetime replying to these letters. Since the Bill seems likely to become law I have had numerous letters, from women particularly, welcoming this particular matter and pointing out matter of wrong done to them or friends of theirs over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the point made by those who oppose the section is that the mandatory system of one-third or one-half does not take into account the spendthrift widow or widower, the alcoholic widow or widower, the person who may not be able to manage affairs properly.  This is the kernel of the case, the unfaithful widow or widower, against section 110. Taking the case on that basis, I would <Col N="129" /> certainly prefer to see justice done, in what I think are the great majority of cases, by having a basic guarantee given, and suffer what I would think would be a very small minority of cases where the wrong sort of surviving widow or widower might get his or her share.  In this connection, I do not see how any solicitor or any judge in a temporal capacity is to be the judge of who is, or who is not, entitled to a one-third or one-half share by reason of immorality or otherwise.  These are matters which are beyond the ken of most people to investigate, and are not matters which should be brought into court.</P>
    <P>On that particular aspect I would say, if we are going to have a system which will guarantee the basic rights of a spouse who has lived with her husband over the years, we can suffer the odd case where somebody who is said to be morally wrong is not entitled to the one-third or one-half share.</P>
    <P>I do not feel there is anything more I need say in this particular connection beyond emphasising once again, and I have said it so many times now I feel it should not need emphasis, that this is not a compulsory system obliging a widow or a widower to take one-third of the estate.  It merely confers a legal right.  The testator is still free to consult with his spouse, to give her a life estate, give her nothing if she so wishes, or to make any arrangements he or she wishes.  In effect, all it means is that the husband and wife should talk the matter over before his death.  In talking the matter over, the wife might sign a renunciation saying she does not want the legal right.  She might choose to enter into a deed whereby the testator gives everything to one or other of his children.  Or she may decide, within 12 months after his death, not to exercise her legal right.</P>
    <P>All that is inherent in section 110 is that the ordinary, basic, humane consultation should take place between man and wife about what they should do with their affairs.  I do not feel there is anything extraordinary in a Christian country in having this basic guarantee enshrined in a section of an Act of Parliament.  That is all that is <Col N="130" /> involved.  I feel that most reasonable people in the country see our way in this matter.  Indeed, I feel that the legal view of the Fine Gael Party has rather gone out on a limb in this.</P>

      <P>I knew when the Minister was making certain concessions on earlier sections of the Bill that he would undoubtedly come along on this crucial section and say: &ldquo;Look, was I not reasonable throughout this Bill?  I am not one of those hidebound people.  I accepted amendments when I knew they were right.  I am a flexible-minded man.&rdquo;  I knew the Minister, and I expressed the view the other night that I had not any great hope in advocating this amendment. Senator FitzGerald thought there might be some hope.  Over the weekend I was cheered by the thought that what was happening in Rhodesia might have some relevance here.  None of us thought Mr. Wilson would come back with anything from Mr. Ian Smith but, notwithstanding his hidebound, rigid position, to the surprise of the world I suppose, there has been some little give in Mr. Smith, although a day later he said they were still poles apart. At any rate, they are on talking terms, and none of us thought that great miracle could have been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister would not absolutely close his mind before coming here today as firmly as he seems to have closed it in his latest speech.  There is not that much difference between what the Minister said and what I am advocating, but I am absolutely convinced that what the Minister is advocating is wrong.  It is <Col N="131" /> wrong because it will not do the justice that should be done to a great number of widows who will be dispossessed by their husbands, or whose husbands might have it in mind to dispossess them.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a statement which is quite wrong.  I do not know whether he realises it.  He said this is not a compulsory system, and he went on to say that a man and his wife could get together and the man could leave the whole lot to his wife, and she could renounce it.  What I am concerned about&mdash;and I repeat it notwithstanding the Minister's mild sneer at lawyers, because in his concluding words he referred to the &ldquo;legal limbs&rdquo; of the Fine Gael Party: I thought we had got away from that&mdash;is the plight of widows who will not get sufficient under this Bill.  I want to remind the House that this whole idea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a minute.  The whole idea of making provision for disinherited widows first came to public light in the form of a motion put down in Dáil Éireann by members of the Fine Gael Party.  It first received publicity in that way.  We have always been, and we still are, concerned about the misfortunes of widows who are disinherited.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there is nothing compulsory in this, but it is compulsory, because if a widow is left nothing in a will she is entitled to get merely one third.  Where I fall out with the Minister and part company with him is at that point.  One third does not do justice to a sizeable number&mdash;to use the Minister's phrase&mdash;of widows who will be disinherited.  Let there be no doubt that is where the compulsion comes in.  A widow can have all the other rights given under this Bill, but she cannot get more than one third if the husband makes a will.</P>

      <P>What I am concerned about here&mdash;and I thought we had got our minds clear on this&mdash;is the vast majority of wills which do not provide properly or make adequate provision.  I am concerned with what the Minister calls that sizeable number and I am talking about that sizeable number.  What I am saying is that if a husband decides to make a will he is entitled to leave his widow only one third, but if he makes no will under the intestacy provision she gets two thirds so, by making a will, he can deprive her of 50 per cent of what she would have got if he had died intestate. If we are concerned as we ought to be in this House about the position and the welfare of widows who are going to be dispossessed by their husbands, we should not try to distinguish between the widow of a man who dies having made a will, and the widow of a man who dies without making a will.</P>
      <P>There is no logic whatever in the Minister's argument that the widow of an intestate person gets two-thirds of the estate, when the widow of a person who dies testate gets only half that amount, or one-third.  There is no logic in that, and there is not one single member of the Government Party who could come here and say that it is right to give a man power by making a will to disinherit his wife of one-half of the share she gets on intestacy.  That is the position and the Minister cannot deny it.  That is what is at issue on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about a modicum of justice.  I say that if we are concerned about widows one half share, or two thirds share, is worthless in a great number of cases.  I wonder if the Minister has ever had a look at the statistics that relate to this question.  I have here before me the annual report of the Revenue Commissioners for 1964.  In Table 92 there are some illuminating figures which show what kind of estates are left behind by people in this country, and how they are broken up.  All estates are liable to death duties.  They must come under the Revenue Commissioners.  You cannot take out a grant of administration or a grant of probate, even on an <Col N="133" /> estate of £5, without applying to the Revenue Commissioners and giving a schedule of assets.  These figures show the pattern.  We find in Table 46 at page 91 that the number of small estates not exceeding £300 in gross value was 480.  The number exceeding £300 but not exceeding £500 was 231. In the case of small estates the Minister proposes to give the widow merely one third.  Of what use is one third of £500 to the widow?  Does not commonsense indicate that she should get the lot?  If her husband dies intestate she gets only two thirds, and quite clearly she should get the lot.  The number of estates exceeding £100 and not exceeding £1,000 is 178.  The number exceeding £1,000 and not exceeding £2,000 is 38, and so on.  Of 2,711 estates which were examined by the Estate Duty Office in 1963/64 we find that 2,300 were under a valuation of £15,000, so the vast majority, the overwhelming majority, of the estates are the estates of small people, and it is in that context that I am urging that merely giving one third or two thirds, as the case may be, is not nearly sufficient.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to farms in rural Ireland shows an equally hopeless condition of affairs.  According to the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for 1964 the number of farms not exceeding £2 valuation is 45,004, the number of farms above £2 and not exceeding £4 valuation is 55,516, the number above £4 and not exceeding £7 is 39,577 and the number above £7 and not exceeding £10 is 32,569.  The number of farms with a valuation of under £30 is 288,474, that is, 80 per cent of the farms of this country are under a valuation of £30.  A farm with a valuation of £30 is quite a substantial and good farm but if you take 45,000 under £2.  55,000 under £4, 39,000 under £7 and the 32,000 under £10, I suppose about 110,000 or some figure of that order, what is the use of giving the widow whose farm has a valuation of under £4 merely one third if her husband decides to make a will and to disinherit her as to the two thirds?  My view is that leaving her one third is quite useless and even if she gets the <Col N="134" /> house and the farm that is quite useless and will not be sufficient.</P>
    <P>Most farmers make their will and many of them, in fact, the vast majority, are decent farmers who make proper provision for their wives. I am concerned with, to use a handy phrase, the sizeable number who would be disinherited by husbands leaving them merely one third.  That is quite senseless and useless when the valuation is under £7.  There is no validity in this particular section as it stands.  I am suggesting in this amendment that we proceed upon the basis that we state that a testator shall have the duty to make adequate provision in life for his spouse according to his means, whether by will or otherwise. After having made that clear statement of the law in this Bill, every solicitor, when a client is making a will, will tell him that if he does not make proper provision for his wife, if he does not leave her the lot, she will be entitled to go to court and his money will be only wasted on lawyers' fees because the court will find that adequate provision in life means in his case leaving her the entire farm.  That is the way that can be achieved.  I am quite satisfied that once this new idea of making adequate provision in life for a widow or widower, as the case may be, where the woman owns the property, is introduced, it will catch on and the number of cases where application to the court would be necessary will be extremely small.  The Minister says: &ldquo;Well, there may be alcoholics and there may be people who are bad at managing farms and all the rest of it.  Which is the best thing to do, get rid of your responsibility and leave them the money?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We will presume what the Minister says is in the Bill. The Minister says in the case of alcoholics and in the case of spendthrifts what you would do is leave <Col N="135" /> them one third and that rids you of all liability after that.  We should not sit in judgment on the morality or conduct of these people.  That just will not do and that is what a lot of husbands or wives would not want to do.</P>
      <P>It is well known that alcoholism is a disease and that people who are alcoholics will do anything provided they can get drink.  They will set upon the business of dissipating their fortune with a tenacity and sincerity of purpose which will enable them to achieve what they set out to do in a very short space of time.  Under this section, if a man had an estate of £15,000 and if it were provided that his widow be left £5,000, £10,000 or £15,000 to be held in trust, the income to be paid to her life that will not do although it would clearly be in the best interests of the surviving spouse, who is an alcoholic.  That person could through the court or <i>ipso facto,</i> by virtue of this Bill, be entitled to one third of £15,000.  How can you justify giving a sum of £5,000 to a person who is known to be an alcoholic? Mind you, the problem of alcoholism in this country is not as small as one would wish it were.  I recollect reading in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> during the newspaper strike that there were upwards of 40,000 practising alcoholics in this country.</P>

      <P>The plain truth of the matter is that the Minister was talking about life tenancies and so on. I am reliably informed by conveyancing lawyers in the Law Library that when making provision for husbands and wives, the answer is life tenancies. Conveyancing lawyers inform me, and I know it from my own experience but I would not rely on it as being comprehensive, that this is what is done and this is what answers the needs of families and the needs of properties and the needs of children.  On the last occasion, the Minister came in here&mdash; and this is why I demur about what <Col N="137" /> he says happened in the Dáil as being a correct recounting of what went on&mdash; and referred to the new Variation of Trusts Bill, 1958, in England.  I thought, in my proper ignorance of English law&mdash;I do not pretend to have a knowledge of it&mdash;that it made some far-reaching change in the law in regard to life tenancies.  I find it does nothing of the kind.</P>
      <P>That was the clear impression the Minister left in my mind and the impression he intended to give this House, that life tenancies had been found unworkable in England and they had introduced a piece of legislation in 1958 known as the Variation of Trusts Act to get rid of these tenancies. It merely recognises the existence of life tenancies and the existence of the shortcomings of the settled land Acts in relation to the powers of a tenant for right and of the courts in relation to settlements and wills.  The Act merely provides one further power in the courts to vary trusts, with the proviso that the trusts can be varied only when they are for the benefit of the person affected, so that completely disposes of the Minister's irresponsible statement that life tenancies were not used in England, that they were out of date and, indeed, that this Act had been brought in in England to rectify and modernise what he quite improperly and inaptly termed as a feudal concept.  They have been the order of the day in England and that has been the position in this country up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, under this section, however, a man cannot leave a life interest in all his property to his wife; he must leave her one third.  Among the cases where a man would appear to disinherit his wife would be the case where she was a spendthrift or an alcoholic, or might just be a bad manager or have a bad business head. In order that Senator Mrs. Ahern will not take offence, the same applies in relation to women when making wills and according the same treatment to their husbands.  I fail to see how, if the National Farmers Association, or indeed the Labour Party, understood what was involved in this Bill, they could agree that it was right that you should not be entitled to leave all <Col N="138" /> your property to your wife for life so that the income out of it would be paid to her, but that, in addition she must necessarily get one-third.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the farmers in this country, I have always understood it to be the position that one of the reasons why there were late marriages was that fathers, and to a lesser extent, mothers, who owned farms would not hand over the farms to their children.  It seems to me again that the normal procedure at present adopted, where a man settles his property perhaps on himself for life and after his death, to a particular son who can then get married, with provision for rights of residence, support, clothing and maintenance in a state fitting and proper to her condition in life to his wife&mdash;that kind of settlement has gone.  I cannot see how, if this section stands, any son or any daughter can ever again, during the lifetime of both his parents, take a farm and settle down on it.  That will not be possible because he will know that immediately upon the death of his father, his mother becomes entitled to one third.  There are many fathers who will not allow their daughters to marry into a place upon those conditions.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this kind of section will put an end to the family settlement, as it is practised in rural Ireland, and, indeed, practised all too infrequently, but its practice will be still more restricted in the future. There is an old saying, an old maxim in law, <i>lex non cogit possibilia</i>.  I suppose, in speaking on this motion at the present time, I am really offending that maxim.  It is quite useless for me at this stage to try to get the Minister to accept this because he has his mind closed.  It is very regettable that the Minister did not pay some regard to some of the statistical and other facts of life in this country as they are at the present time.  I have no doubt in my mind that if there had not been a general election, the Minister would have come in, equally convinced about and equally eloquent in defence of the first Succession Bill as it was drafted, so I am sure there was not a squeak-out of the Minister on the Second <Col N="139" /> Stage of the first Bill when it was being debated, or out of his Party. Perhaps it was not debated when the Minister was a Minister of the Government.</P>

      <P>I cannot allow an historical inaccuracy to go on the record, however unimportant it may be. The Succession Bill, 1964, was introduced by the present Minister for Agriculture, as Minister for Justice, last July 12 months.  It was made plain by him at that time that he introduced it as a matter for public debate and discussion, with a view to attracting the widest possible spectrum of views on it, so that everybody could contribute his views as to how it could be improved.  While the House was on vacation last summer 12 months, the Minister for Justice became Minister for Agriculture.  I became Minister for Justice and having considered the various views put forward during the vacation brought in, on Second Stage reading in the Dáil, proposals for an amended Bill.  The Committee Stage of the Bill was due to be taken when the general election was declared.  The Succession Bill, 1965, was introduced with further amendments, following on the discussions that had taken place in the Dáil on Second stage.  The views <Col N="140" /> incorporated in the Succession Bill, 1965, which is now before the House, are largely the views which resulted from the distillation of views put forward by voluntary groups such as the Incorporated Law Society, the National Farmers Association, the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, many of whose views I accepted on the Second and Committee Stages of the Succession Bill, 1964, and the Succession Bill, 1965, and these happen to be the facts of the matter.</P>

      <P>The only discussion on this was in the presence of the present Minister for Justice and the election had nothing to do with it. Deputy John A. Costello, on the Second Reading of the 1964 Bill in the Dáil, made a particular plea that this matter be taken out of politics, taken away from the chapel gate, which, indeed, it was.  I feel the record will show that the debate on this measure in both Houses has been of excellent quality and the contributions made have been very constructive and have helped considerably in what I hope will be a reasonable measure. You cannot have a measure such as this absolutely perfect, because of human failings and so on, but I feel it will stand the test of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to one other matter mentioned by Senator O'Quigley.  That is the matter of life estates.  I am still strongly of the view, as most practical lawyers are and people who want to see the community as a whole improved, that life estates &mdash;and this is acknowledged by anybody who thinks deeply about it&mdash;are a very bad form of tenure.  They tie up property during the life of the person who gets the property and, indeed, tie it up for the remainder man as well.  This type of property is not easily secured from the credit point of view.  Banks tend to shy away from that sort of property because it does not offer a valuable security to them. Property which is freehold, even though it may be subject to a legal <Col N="141" /> right which in the hands of the widow lapses after 12 months, is far better security as regards getting a loan from the banks or the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The sort of property which may be subject to a legal right of one third that lapses after 12 months is a far better guarantee than the life estate at which any bank manager will look askance.  The life estate, not being fee simple estate, will not constitute a sufficient guarantee for any credit institution advancing money.</P>
    <P>In fact, life estates, as I said here on the Second Reading, are the relics of the feudalistic period.  Both here and in Britain life estates were utilised where people wanted to withhold land for their wives and families.  Life estates are a furtherance of that sort of property holding which sought to ensure that property remained in the possession of a particular family over a long period of years.  This has been the case particularly with large holdings of land in Britain.  These holdings are owned by people who were never short of ready cash.  As far as Ireland is concerned, I can imagine no worse form of property holding than a life estate on which a man cannot raise the money to carry on and extend his business or farm.</P>

      <P>That is not my question.  Perhaps I might put the situation a little more clearly.  A man is dying, his wife is in such a situation that she needs all the estate to keep alive in decent circumstances.  There are no children.  He for some reason does not like his wife and he limits her share in his estate to one half.  Has that wife no right then to go to the court and say &ldquo;I need the whole estate,&rdquo; or not?</P>

      <P>I met that case to some degree on foot of an amendment put down by Senator Miss Davidson and Senator Crowley.  I might say it was a most constructive amendment and it is now incorporated in a Government amendment which we passed here last week.  Where a widow remained on in the house where she was living with her deceased husband and where that house was valued in excess of what would be one half the estate where there are no children&mdash;in other words, if half the estate came to £5,000 and the house was valued at £7,000&mdash;we have now got an amendment inserted that the widow has the right to remain on in that house and she cannot be ejected even if the value of the house is in excess of one haif the estate.  That goes some way towards meeting Senator Stanford's point.  You cannot devise a perfect system which will take care of all the isolated cases. I am trying to pursue the middle course in this matter.  I am beset by the conservative lawyers, primarily of the Fine Gael Party, who say there should be absolute freedom of testation and that a man can cut his wife off with nothing.  On the other side of the fence there are people such as Senator Stanford who ask why should the widow not get all the estate.</P>

      <P>Instead of a basic guarantee to the widow of one-half the estate you will throw her into court and impose on her the necessity to consult a lawyer.  She may have to enter into a contest in court with some other member of her family, have the facts of her life paraded before that court, and be put through all this in order to prove that she may be entitled to more than one-half.  I prefer the system which guarantees her one-half without driving her into court to prove she might be entitled to more than one-half. I prefer the system which provides that she must get one-half in any circumstances. In many cases a sensitive woman will not bother going to the court at all to prove her right.  There are people who will not have recourse to the courts but will carry on their own way because they are too sensitive to engage in litigation.  I feel there is justice in having written into the statute that she must have one-half. Unfortunately, it cannot be written into the statute that she will get it all.</P>

      <P>There may be circumstances that were elaborated on by the Senator's friends in the lower House when they were arguing the case for freedom of testation.  It was elaborated that there were sufficiently various circumstances in which the widow should not get all the estate because other deserving beneficiaries might be there.  I will not be drawn into that sideline.  The nub of the issue in this matter is whether you would prefer a system whereby there is an absolute guarantee written into a statute that the widow must, no matter what happens, get a percentage&mdash;one third if there are children and one-half if there are not&mdash;a legal right which she may or may not enforce, or whether you want a system which submits her to the risk and the trouble of the raking-up of family background, and expectations good and bad, in an action <Col N="144" /> before a judge, subject to his decision. The Labour Party in the other House have come down strongly in favour of what I feel is not alone the Christian way but the practical way that is operated in practically every legal system in the world.  It is only in the English and the Welsh courts that you have this notion of complete freedom of testation.</P>
      <P>The other system is operating in the United States, in parts of Canada and all over Europe.  In every case you have a guarantee of this basic right for the spouse who survives the partner and who was, over a number of years, a common manager of the property with the deceased.  It is in accordance with the principles that Senator Sheehy Skeffington spoke about of property having duties as well as rights.  When a man and woman are married and are together on a farm or business for good or ill, there may be troubles, with rights and wrongs on both sides, but out of that partnership there should be a right, written into a statute, to the survivor of that partnership by reason of the contract which gave rise to it, an entitlement to a basic share.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. But I can see that this is just one of the kinds of hardship involved. Obviously, there will be unfortunate effects.  But this is only one of the unfortunate aspects of this section: I will advert to more serious aspects of it in a moment or two.  There may be many cases in which a vindictive dying spouse can get away with leaving his wife, or the husband as the case may be, one third when it is obviously unjust by every moral principle that the wife does not get the whole estate.</P>

But if she considers that manifestly unjust is she <Col N="145" /> entitled to go to the courts?  For some reason which I find it hard to understand the Minister wants to check people, or save them the ignominy or embarrassment, as he puts it, of going to the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister is overdoing this fear of appealing to the courts, especially when the case is heard in chambers as might well be.  This is another minor unfortunate aspect of this particularly objectionable section, and I very deeply regret that the Minister is refusing to accept any amendments on this.  He has dug in now, so to speak.</P>
      <P>I must not hold up the House by repeating in detail all the objections I urged against this section on the Second Reading, but I must emphasise that I feel that very deep principles are involved here, and I must affirm that in my opinion this section introduces an unjust infringement of civil rights. It is striking at the very basis of justice in this country.  The law as suggested in this amendment and to some extent as it stands at the moment is securing that injustice will not be done&mdash;the courts will look after it.  This section is securing that certain injustices will be done and that, I think, is the point. It will bind certain injustices on the country while, if we leave things flexible and leave it to courts, there will be no injustices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two or three cases which I mentioned before and will refer to again briefly.  There are, first of all, cases where the surviving spouse is <Col N="146" /> rich, well able to look after himself or herself or, perhaps, not rich but young and active and trained for a job and well able to earn a living if she is not endowed compulsorily by her husband. It is even possible that the husband or wife might say: &ldquo;It would be better for my husband or wife when I die to go into a job and earn a living.&rdquo;  I can understand this.  But under the section it cannot be done.  She is bound to get one third of the estate.  Supposing the estate is worth £15,000 she is bound to get a nice £5,000 to keep her going for a good while.</P>
    <P>Supposing that in the case of a surviving spouse who is rich or well able to earn her living there are other close relations of the dying testator, a mother, brother, or sister who needs this money most urgently and needs all of it whereas the surviving spouse needs none of it.  The testator cannot now leave that money to the deserving relative without the consent of the surviving spouse.  The Minister is optimistic in these circumstances and says that in that case every surviving spouse will say: &ldquo;I do not need the money, give it to poor so-and-so.&rdquo;  I am sorry, but I am not optimistic about this.  I have heard of too many quarrels over wills to believe that in most cases the surviving spouse will not take all that he or she can get under the law.  It is extraordinary how generosity and magnanimity seem to fly out the door when this arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The second thing that will be hit by this is charities.  In similar circumstances, where the surviving spouse does not need the money, the testator might say: &ldquo;The Red Cross or some other deserving charity could do with this. There are people starving all over the world.  My big, well-upholstered, well-beloved spouse is well able to live for the rest of her life, and why should I leave her money in these circumstances?&rdquo; The Minister will say that he will persuade this fat and jolly spouse to renounce the legacy.  But <Col N="147" /> she will not.  I do not think she will. The result will be that certain charities which ought to get the money will not get it.  That is wrong and unjust too. I have not seen any good answer to this problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that these will be only occasional cases, but they will be occasional enough to make it a serious matter, with enough seriousness in the matter to make it a genuine injustice.  He says that the widow will not take her share.  Quite frankly, I do not believe that.  If I were a betting man I would name odds of 4 to 1 that she would take her share.</P>
      <P>To introduce a third reason why I disagree with it, the Minister told us that the moral theologians have told him that he is right.</P>

      <P>We are very glad the Minister consulted moral theologians in this country.  We are a Christian State.  But as soon as such people use this opportunity to make their opinions compulsory then we can begin to worry.  An eminent Cardinal in the USA has said that moral theologians do not seek to impose by law their moral views on other members of the society.</P>
      <P>There is an element of paternalism in this Bill, saying &ldquo;this is morally right, therefore, you must compel people to do what is morally right.&rdquo; I think this strikes at the very fundamental principles in civil liberties. This is a very big question.  Perhaps we should have a special motion down to debate this.  This is one of the reasons why I consider this section is reprehensible and objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> There is one other small point which I would like to mention.  Sometimes people could be tricked into marriage because the trickster or impostor knows he is going to get one third of the estate compulsorily.  This sometimes could arise and will be an inducement to people to trick others into marriage in this country.  They had not got this before.  We do not want to encourage any kind of trickery of that sort in this country. This section will do that in some areas.  All this to my mind involves both profound as well as minor objections to this section.  I am quite convinced that Senator O'Quigley's amendment is the right approach.  I am not going to repeat myself further but I should be very sorry, indeed, if this section, as it stands, becomes the law of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

      <P>I feel with so many references to modern lawyers and practising alcoholics, as a non-practising lawyer of some antiquity, dubious about intervening again lest I be shot down by the Minister.  I should like to take him up on a couple of points.  He talks about not being able to cope with isolated cases. We have had difficulties raised legitimately, where with regard to a small estate, a half was too little.  The small estates comprise a very high proportion of the cases involved.  In the case of the very large estates, where you insist on the legal right of a half, it may be too much.  The case here is that the spouse should not be given complete control for reasons of alcoholism or otherwise.  When all these are added up they are far from being isolated cases.  The section, as at present drafted, will not do justice to the majority of small cases.  In so far as it does justice at all it is rough justice and cut in such a crude way that it leaves jagged edges.  I do not think it is satisfactory in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said the other day, I do not like the idea of legal discretion unless it is essential.  But unless the Minister can offer a constructive solution or we can offer a constructive solution that he would acecpt, the section, as at present drafted, is so crude and in so many cases does the wrong thing, that <Col N="149" /> although the intention behind it is excellent I would have, with reluctance, to support the amendment of Senator O'Quigley.  It is very much less than ideal to leave such a wide measure of discretion but if no solution can be offered otherwise we are really left with no alternative.</P>
    <P>The problem of the small estates has been referred to and the Minister refers to dwellings.  It seems to me that in the case of an estate of £10,000 or £15,000, where the legal right of a half goes to the wife, it is not the dwelling, it is the actual total value of the estate that is involved.  The Minister referred in scathing terms to life estates.  He referred to life estates as feudalistic. This seems to me to be very much up in the air.  The only reference to life estates I have heard in modern times is in the way of cases where people leave money in life estates in order to avoid the problem of death duties. This is the ordinary problem that arises.  It seems to me, and I am open to correction by the Minister, that what this section is saying is that you cannot try to deal with the problem of death duties by legitimate reference to life estates.  I have always felt that the burden of death duties should not be imposed on the wife at all but only on the next generation.</P>
    <P>What this Bill is doing is, in fact, appropriating part of people's money by saying that people shall not legitimately avoid estate duty by leaving a life interest to the wife, which is the normal thing, but shall leave at least one half absolutely to the wife so the State can collect their share.  The Minister must, if he resists that interpretation, be prepared to ensure that suitable legislation is introduced in the next Finance Act to avoid this.  If it is the Government's intention to protect the widow it is a little bit thin when the State takes so much.  It should be left open that the money can be employed to the best advantage of the wife and the children.  Far from this being exclusively for the wife and children unless we have a change it will operate to the benefit of the State but to the detriment of the wife and children.</P>
    <P>This is another strong-armed piece of legislation which, even if it will not <Col N="150" /> often be employed, will involve injustice in many cases.  The Minister questions the maintenance of this complete freedom.  He suggests that concern about this matter is the monopoly of the Fianna Fáil Party with the Labour Party thrown in occasionally and that the Fine Gael Party are out for complete freedom of testacy.  Nothing like that is suggested in the amendment but I would be very interested to see what attitude was taken up in the other House and in this House with regard to this.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks about Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  If we are so concerned about the rest of the world I hope the Government in their coming legislation on workmen's compensation will remember that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point the Minister made was in relation to the legal right.  I am open to correction on this again, but I understand that the legal right lapses only if the bequest is taken up which is a very particular instance.  The fact is that if a legal right is left to people&mdash;and I share Senator Stanford's pessimism, if that is the word, on this&mdash;it will be made use of.  If people make use of the legal right, the Minister's point about its lapsing does not arise.  I do not understand in what circumstances the thinks it will lapse to such an extent that it will represent an argument in favour of this, and against life estates or annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that even at this late stage the Minister will consider the necessary amendments to this section to avoid its being necessary to press the amendment. I think a case has been clearly made that the section will operate in an unjust and inappropriate way. Unless the Minister takes the necessary action to alleviate all these difficulties, or most of them, we have no alternative but to vote for this amendment which is not in itself inherently desirable.  I should like him to say why he is not willing to amend the section which deals with small estates <Col N="151" /> where the share of one-half or one-third, as the case may be, will be indequate, and with cases where the condition of the spouse is such that it can be shown that it would be undesirable for the spouse to have complete control.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister unwilling to amend the section which deals with those cases?  He must advert to these cases.  There is no use in saying we must either have the section or the amendment.  The amendment was put down because the section is unsatisfactory, and the Minister seems to be unwilling to introduce the necessary amendment to make it satisfactory.  I think the Minister should introduce an amendment to cover those two aspects in particular, which are most important.</P>

The husband can leave his wife one shilling, and that woman will have to spend half of her life in the courts to get anything more. What is being sought in this Bill is that unless the estate has gone to hell altogether, she will get more than one shilling.  That is a very important point. There does not seem to be any extraordinary compulsion about the section because it provides that if a testator leaves a spouse and no children, the spouse shall have a right to one-half of the estate.</P>

Up to now the husband could leave his wife one shilling&mdash;I do not want to be repetitive &mdash;and she would have to apply to a whole crowd of lawyers, and of course they would be delighted.  Naturally all the legal profession want to keep the law the way it is so that they can get all the money possible out of it.  Fine Gael should not fool themselves.

About two or three per cent, or maybe less, make mistakes and this type of Bill is necessary to guard against that.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> If we try to achieve a perfect system in regard to the distribution of property we would be like Don Quixote going around on his mule tilting at windmills. Can we not drop this academic approach to this very important matter?  We are not dealing with a political question: it is really a social question.  It is along that line that we should approach the matter.  I fully appreciate that because of different mental attitudes and patterns, there is bound to be a serious clash of views on this matter.</P>
      <P>In regard to the principle involved in section 110, in so far as it proposes to ensure that a widow or widower, or a spouse, shall we say, surviving, is entitled, in the case of a widow with no children to one-half of an estate and in the case of a widow with children to one-third of the estate and that that right is to be exercised by the person with that right within a year.  That may be a crude approach.  It does not make any provision for finesse in relation to people with different mental attitudes and patterns in regard to the disposition of property.  All it proposes to do is to ensure that people who, for one reason or another&mdash;because of prejudice, pride or any reason you like, that they see fit; oftentimes, maybe, in advancing years or not always, I suppose, in advancing years &mdash;might desire to make a will which is contrary to good public policy, and it is good public policy that the property within a family should remain within the family as far as possible, will not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we have any regard to a social pattern at all, we must regard the <Col N="156" /> family as being the basic unit in society.  I feel strongly on this and although the section does not satisfy me, it certainly satisfies me better in the present form than with the proposed amendments.  I have sympathy with the views put forward by Senator Stanford.  He had in mind possibly real cases although he put them in a hypothetical form: the matter of the decay of the small estates.  Even in those cases, it would be making provision for appeal to a court.  If the estate is big, the widow is pretty well provided for.  If, at that stage, she wants to dissipate part of the estate in law costs, she may do so&mdash;and I have known cases where people deliberately did so.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a famous case of a newspaper proprietor in the west of Ireland, slightly west of the Shannon, who made his will in such a way as to ensure the dissipation of the estate in law costs.  You will always have cases like that.  However, in cases such as those mentioned by Senator Stanford, in the case of a big estate, the one-third or one-half share, as the case may be, would be sufficient to give reasonable security and reasonable protection to the widow.  The tendency to appeal to the court is very great from a human justice point of view. Our ultimate aim should be to try to have some rough or crude method of human justice.  If the word &ldquo;crude&rdquo; is used, I shall not dispute it because it really is crude but it is very difficult to have a finely balanced scale of justice in these matters.</P>
    <P>In the case of the small estate, whether a small farm or a medium sized farm, the family farm or the family shop, then it is a different matter.  If, under this, the widow is guaranteed a crude system of one-third or one-half share in the estate, as the case may be, according to whether there are or are not children, and if the principle of going to the court to look for more is established, I do not agree that it would be a good idea because since the whole estate is a small estate, a farm and possibly some other small sums such as national loan or securities of one kind or another, here is what would happen.  Once the <Col N="157" /> principle of application to the court is available, then the amount of the estate so dissipated&mdash;and I deliberately uses the word &ldquo;dissipated&rdquo;&mdash;in law costs would far outweigh the amount of improvement for the aggrieved person or the person who thinks himself or herself aggrieved under the principle embodied in section 110. Much more money would be used up in contesting the claim in a court: I do not want to go as far as my colleague, Senator Lenehan, went but much more would in fact be dissipated in law costs.</P>
    <P>That is my reason for arguing that it would not be a good thing that the matter should be changed, even though it is a rough form of justice. I think a more real justice and greater public good would be achieved by leaving the section as it is.  I have no doubt that the attempt to try to improve it by having applications to courts would not be in the general public interest.  I have had practical experience of this matter in rural areas. When people go to law and where small estates are involved we see how much is used up in law costs and we realise that it would be far better if some sensible person had got those two parties together, as I have done once or more than once, and said to them: &ldquo;So much money will be spent by you on one side and by you on the other side that if you both had commonsense and a little more charity, you would not go to court at all about this matter.&rdquo;  I have had that experience.  I argue that it is not a good thing to bring it in at this stage in this rather rough piece of legislation. Rough and all as it is, I am quite satisfied it will achieve more public good than any attempt to give this power to appeal to court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be forced to introduce my own amendments later on and there is a point which I think would probably be relevant to these amendments but I shall reserve it until then.  There is just one other matter I should like to raise on this amendment.  I am not quite sure that some little tinge of amendment No. 9 has not crept in, but Senator Stanford, and Senator FitzGerald in <Col N="158" /> particular, I think, are implying that where estates are left out of small farms, the whole lot should go to the widow.  I think they are not in touch with conditions in the country. Previous to the present time men lived and brought up families on what these people are now describing as small farms.  A son getting that farm will be able to do likewise.</P>
      <P>Another point is: supposing the widow gets this small farm, lock, stock and barrel, what is she going to do except sell it and then, probably, to annoy the whole family, she will, in nine cases out of ten, be an old woman at this time.  I think that would be wrong.  Had the amendment been redrafted in the form of section 116, it would have been better because, from the amendment itself, it seems to me that the testator must make adequate provision for the spouse, disregarding completely any property the spouse may already have.  There is nothing in this amendment to provide that a court should take into consideration the property the spouse has already, nor is there any suggestion that the court should take into consideration children of the testator.  I doubt very much if those points would be relevant if a spouse applied in court to have a will upset because she was inadequately provided for.  Perhaps my knowledge of the law is not as wide as Senator O'Quigley's.</P>

      <P>It has been said here today that the measure before us is an improvement on existing law and I think this cannot be questioned.  The amendment by Senator O'Quigley is no doubt dealing with a somewhat rare contingency, the case of a vindictive spouse wanting to do an injustice to the surviving spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with a lot of what Senator O'Reilly has said, particularly in regard to the big estates because a division there is quite a different thing from a division of a small estate.  In the case of the small estate, one-third or one-half might mean a terribly small amount of money and stock, an amount which would be quite useless, <Col N="159" /> even bearing in mind the fact that the Minister met my own and Senator Crowley's amendment very generously in regard to the house and chattels.  I detest the very thought of courts.  I detest the thought of anybody having to go into court but I feel that these are cases&mdash;and I should hope they would be very rare&mdash;on which a judge, either in open court or, preferably, in chambers, would hear all the facts concerned and would decide what was the best thing to do, having regard to all the circumstances.  I might say it was this consideration, the fact that the judge would hear the individual details of the particular cases, that moved me to accept the Minister's amendment to section 56.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, seeing that he has been so generous in other respects, to have another look at it to see if there is not something in the case made that grave hardship could arise for the surviving spouse where a small estate is involved.</P>

      <P>When we started off with this Bill, it was generally accepted that it was a legal man's paradise. We have heard quite a number of repetitions of opinions relating to small estates and large estates.  One misconception of &ldquo;small estate&rdquo; is probably the interpretation &ldquo;a small parcel of land.&rdquo;  Some people are probably thinking in terms of a small parcel of money.</P>
      <P>Under the section as it stands it is intended to establish a legal right. With the establishment of a legal right, I am in complete agreement, and everybody else with whom I have spoken is in agreement with me.  However, there might be a disagreement with regard to the extent of that legal right.  I can think of a hypothetical case where it might appear to be very just not to give any right.  I can also think of a hypothetical case&mdash;and some of them have been mentioned here today&mdash; where the full right should be given. There are so many interpretations of this that I would prefer to see it applied to general conditions as we know them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I live in an area where most of the estates are small farms of round about <Col N="160" /> £20 valuation in the case of 80 per cent of them.  The people concerned are very competent in the management of their farms and in their succession arrangements.  So far as I know most of the practical applications of the succession arrangements always provide that the succeeding spouse is protected in some way by giving her some rights in the house or some rights in money.  The widows have always been protected.  I think that when the Bill is going to be applied it will apply to a small number of cases.  If you give a legal right of one third to the spouse that puts the spouse in the position of being able to bargain for her rights without having to have access to the courts.</P>

      <P>If I was to be as liberal in giving specific cases as have been given here I could go on for a long time.  Any Bill that keeps the people out of court is a good Bill, because once neighbours and relatives go inside a courthouse it leaves a scar on their relations and the relations for generations to come that is never forgotten. Some of us could make hypothetical cases at the lower level or at the higher level but if we establish one thing, the legal right, then it is up to the people concerned, the families, relations and all the other people in the locality who usually make the best arrangements. I believe that if they get this a great improvement will have been made in this matter.  I have looked through the amendments and I can only find a difference as to whether there should be <Col N="161" /> more or less on the higher or the lower level.  You can do just as much injustice by insisting on one side as on the other.  The Minister's approach commends itself to me in view of the conditions of which I am aware.</P>

      <P>This is the last time I am going to speak on this amendment. It is now becoming more clear after the debate we had that the area of disagreement is much smaller than people thought at the beginning.  I think that Senator Lenehan had something to say about a lot of nonsense being talked here by the lawyers and so on.  If he reads his own speech which he made this evening and the speech that I made here the last day he will find phrase after phrase out of his own speech which corresponds exactly with what I was saying on the last day and again today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That could not be the case because you had not spoken on the last day.  We are not all talking nonsense.  Senator Lenehan's experience, and Senator O'Reilly's and Senator Honan's and all our experiences, are the same.  The only question at issue is the best way to deal with this problem of the sizeable number, to use the Minister's beloved phrase, of cases where a man disinherits his wife.  Somebody said that the Minister had taken a step in the right direction. Of course he has, but I want to push him another step.  Indeed, I want to say that it is not a step he has taken so much as a half-step.  Under the provisions of section 109 the widow of the testator who has no family gets half the estate.  Under the intestacy provisions the widow where there are no children gets all the estate.  I say that under section 110 the Minister is only taking half a step that he has taken in the section dealing with intestacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a variety of ways in which to deal with this.  One that I suggested is, as is agreed by everybody now, that the vast majority of husbands look after their wives properly. As I said on the last day, there was a <Col N="162" /> case of one solicitor who examined 50 or 51 wills and 48 of them left all the property to the wife.  That is the common experience.  What we are concerned with is the widow who under section 110 can be deprived by a stroke of the testator's will of half of what she would get if the testator had made no will in the case where there were no children.  Just by signing his name to a will he can deprive her of the lot. I say that that is quite unfair in the case of people where half the estate would not be sufficient to give them a decent livelihood.  There is no logic in the Minister's saying that where a man dies intestate leaving a widow and no children the widow should get all, but if he is clever enough to make a will he is entitled to deprive her of half of it.  There is no justification for that in the case of an estate of £5,000 or £10,000 or a small farm or business.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenehan says that the widow would get a shilling, but he does not even have to leave her a shilling.  He can leave her nothing under the present law, and that, of course, is what we all say is hopelessly wrong. We all agree on that.  That is all that we are trying to achieve in this amendment. I still hope that the Minister might reconsider the amendment.  It is quite clear that we cannot do more than rough justice for the widows of people who have small properties.  I anticipated that the Minister's mind might be absolutely closed to getting rid of this legal share.  Because of that I put down amendment No. 9 to provide that in a case of a farm the rateable valuation of which does not exceed £20 the widow would be absolutely entitled to the entire thereof with stocks, crops, implements and machinery thereon.  I took the farm of £20 valuation as being the kind of farm that could support a widow on her own in some comfort, but I am not tied to the figure.  Neither am I tied to merely agricultural land.  If anybody wants to accept the principle I am adumbrating in the amendment and to apply it to businesses of more than £5,000 or £10,000 or where the valuation is less than £10 I am quite happy. That is what I am trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>I would prefer if there was some <Col N="163" /> kind of discretion given to a man where he could leave it to his widow for her life and then appoint it to one of his children.  That might be very good from the point of view of the widow, that it would be left to one of the children and there would be no need for a settlement whereby she would appoint it to a child in order to keep the child at home on the farm and let him marry and settle down. The present section permits none of these things being done.  It is because it is so utterly rigid that no matter what way you move you are going to offend the section that I put down the amendment which would give more flexibility.  Once again I ask the Minister whether he would not consider some modification of section 110 which would enable the widow in the case of a small estate to get what is her due.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about justice, and that is what we are concerned with in this Bill, we should consider the widow of the person who dies intestate.  We should not enact legislation where justice for the widow will be a matter of luck, whether her husband dies without making a will or not.  Justice for the widow will be a matter of luck in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take very long.  I am sorry that the meeting of the Committee on Statutory Instruments prevented me being present during the debate this afternoon. Senator O'Quigley is correct when he says that the area of argument on this particular amendment is notoriously small.  I find myself, despite the case made by Senator O'Quigley and certain attractive features of this amendment, nevertheless coming down on the side of this very important section as it stands for two reasons.  One reason that has been mentioned by several Senators is that application to the courts, on the whole&mdash;this has been stated very readily by people who are familiar with the practice&mdash;should be avoided, if possible.  It will be avoided by many widows and widowers, especially the most deserving ones who would be most reluctant to parade their troubles before the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> This is one reason why I like to see a statutory right enshrined in the Bill rather than the right of appeal to the courts.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make is one which was made by the Minister the last time he spoke on this matter. It seems to me a very strong point that the aged partner, very often the wife who will survive her husband, will have her whole status in the family in many cases substantially heightened.  This seems to be a very important point and it is a much stronger one if she merely says, when her husband dies, she will have the right to ask the court to treat her lightly.  The relation between the statutory right to a portion of the estate and the status of the ageing spouse within her family before her husband dies seems to me to be a complete factor in my coming down on the side of the section as it stands rather than in favour of what is proposed in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with Senator O'Quigley's amendment and with what he said today.  In regard to subsection (2) of section 110 the Minister should merely specify how many children.  Take the case of a spouse dying leaving one child who is a minor.  When the child reaches 21 years the spouse will find herself or himself in a rather invidious position. The child is in possession of two thirds of the property.  The spouse who has worked down through the years since the death of the husband or the death of a wife, as the case may be, according to who owns the property, is in a rather awkward situation when there is just one child.  The child, in this case, has the right to two thirds of the property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what Senator McAuliffe has said, there is no question of the child having any legal right as a result of this Bill. The only legal right which is now written into the Bill is that of the spouse.  She gets one third.  The child, under section 116, can apply to the court for his proper share.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The widow has a legal right to two thirds under an earlier section of the Bill and, in the case of an only child, that child has a right to one third.  If there are no children of the intestate surviving, the spouse gets the whole lot.  If there are no children, in the case of a will, she gets one half.  I have normally got an open mind but the more I hear in this debate and with regard to what I have heard in the Dáil, the more certain I feel that the only approach to the matter is to do what Senator Sheehy Skeffington suggested, that is, have it written in in statutory form.</P>
      <P>I am not saying this is a perfect measure.  I believe it is beyond the wit of man to devise a perfect measure in regard to something like this, to ensure that every different case can be met.  I am modest enough to say that this is an improvement on existing legislation.  I do not claim it is perfect or that it satisfies everybody.</P>
      <P>There is one very important thing which I think should be emphasised here.  Senator O'Quigley, although this is not strictly in his amendment, spoke about the position of the widow and suggested that, where an estate is small, she should get the whole lot of it.  We are dealing here with property and the transmission of property and I would like to remind the Senator that there are certain provisions in the constitution in regard to this matter.  Article 43, section 1, paragraph 2 reads:</P>
      <P>The State, accordingly, guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership of property or the general right to transfer, bequeath and inherit property.</P>
      <P>It would be very dangerous to make it mandatory for a man to give all his property to his wife.  A number of people in the front benches of the Fine Gael Party in the Dáil attacked the Bill on grounds opposite to those on which Senator O'Quigley has sought to attack it here.  The main attack in the Dáil arose on the principle that freedom of testation should not be curbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now Senator O'Quigley has attacked me with regard to the one third or one half share for the widow.  He wants me <Col N="166" /> to give the whole lot to the widow in certain circumstances.  I am afraid that this would be wrong.  I feel it would be better to follow a middle course, although we have been open to attack from all sides because of this.  In this Bill we are trying to follow a middle course between absolute freedom of testation, which is a Victorian notion, because property has its duties as well as its rights, and a principle of complete direction to the testator as to how he should dispose of his property.  I think the middle course is to provide by statute basic guarantees which do not prevent the testator from giving over and above those guarantees.  This is a misconception which many people have.  Of course there is nothing whatever to prevent a testator from giving all the property, or any share he wishes over and above the basic guarantees written into the statute.  That is my point and I do not think it has been adverted to sufficiently.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the merits or demerits of life estates because my views on them are well known.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent a testator giving a life estate to his widow, or making any arrangement he may wish to provide for his widow and his children as he wishes so long as there is agreement between them.  All this Bill requires is that there will be reasonable consultation between husband and wife.  There can be renunciation by either spouse of the legal right by way of deed with the consent of the other spouse, or by way of the surviving spouse not exercising his or her legal right.</P>
    <P>Senator Cole emphasised the reverse of the point made by Senator O'Quigley.  He mentioned the son succeeding to the estate.  Quite often in rural Ireland, particularly in regard to small properties, the person who should get the greater ownership in the farm after the death of the man of the house is the son.  He should get it because he is a young man and has stayed in the home when the other children have been fixed up in occupations elsewhere.  He is the man who will carry on, and probably bring in a wife of his own and start a family.  He has the greater right to the property.  He <Col N="167" /> should get two thirds of the estate, subject to the one third statutory right residing in his mother, to make certain that he does right by his mother and treats her properly.  This is a weapon &mdash;and I want to emphasise that I envisage its being used very seldom&mdash; to ensure that he will treat his mother properly.  She can enforce her legal right and demand that she be given proper treatment.</P>
    <P>Despite what Senator O'Quigley and Senator Miss Davidson said&mdash; and I speak with knowledge of rural Ireland&mdash;in many cases in rural Ireland it would not be desirable that the widow should get the entire farm&mdash; especially in the case of small and medium-sized farms&mdash;after the death of the man of the house.  In many cases the right person to take hold of the property, to work it and expand it, is the young son who has stayed on the farm, is trained on the land and is bringing in a wife and family.  He has an incentive, by virtue of greater ownership of the land, to expand it and improve it.  It would be a retrograde step to have any scheme whereby the testator would have to leave the property in such circumstances to the wife rather than the son.  The son is probably on the brink of manhood and the testator should not be debarred by some mandatory provision from leaving the farm to him.  There are these cases on both sides, and I think we should seek to strike a balance, to meet the intolerable situation where a man could disinherit his wife and his children.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that that situation was intolerable.  It has been argued that that intolerable situation could be met by a system of court applications, but, although I am a lawyer, I am of the opinion that there are many sensitive people particularly women, who do not like the prospect of going to lawyers, and do not like the prospect of going to court.  They do not like to bring their affairs before a court however private it may be.  I should prefer to leave it in the form of a statutory right.  There is the basic right which arises out of the marriage contract, and there is a partnership in the common property between these people over a number of years.  I think, <Col N="168" /> on balance, that it should be written in in statutory form.  I think that is preferable to a system of driving the widow or widower into court.</P>
    <P>On that basis I would ask the Seanad to pass the section and to reject the amendment.  I would ask the Seanad to do this, not in a spirit of claiming that this is a perfect answer to all the problems in regard to testator succession, but in the spirit that this is an improvement on the existing situation. It is on analysis, the best that can be done to rectify as many injustices as possible, while not completely eliminating all injustices.</P>

      <P>Much of what the Minister has said is very reasonable.  The only difficulty is that it did not quite direct itself towards some of the points that were made. I see the case against leaving everything to the wife, but I do not think the Minister made a case against a larger share being left on small estates than on large estates.  The Minister has not met that case, and I think there is a case for some modification in regard to a larger share being left where there is a small estate.  I should like the Minister to think again about that, without being dogmatic as to what the share should be.  One half share as the right in every case seems to be too rigid.  There is a case for changing that. The other case the Minister did not meet is the question of life estates.  He mentioned the point about the husband and wife agreeing and settling it between them.</P>

The Minister has not adequately met that case.  He has not adequately met the case of the small estates, and he has not met the point about estate duty.

      <P>I should like to emphasise that under section 114, which provides for an election between legal rights and rights under a will, it is made quite apparent that the testator is still free to leave any bequest to the surviving spouse.  It can be a life interest or otherwise.  The only limitation to that right is that the widow has the option of exercising her legal right. She also has the option of taking a life estate, if that leaves her in better circumstances than taking a lump sum out of the estate.  That can be done. The legal right is forfeited by reason of her option for the life estate.  The legal right goes by the board.  Having regard to that, I think we are meeting that situation and providing for a more flexible approach on the part of the survivor.  I could not agree to importing a compulsory life estate into the system.</P>

I see quite a lot of properties of the type we seem to be dealing with, medium-sized and small farms, where widows have life estates.  The son is the person who should really take the reins because he has youth on his side and is better able to make a contribution to society, to the nation, and so on: families must go on.

        <i>(Longford):</i> It is a fact that I seem to have noticed. Maybe I am wrong.  However, that is one of the arguments which I could make if I were making a case against this section in any of its forms.  This is a social question.  I think I should bring to the notice of the House that, as far as my experience goes, in quite a large number of cases it is the sons of widows who seem to remain bachelors.  Anything that would tend rather to develop that would, in my view, be socially bad.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <P>Before section 110 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  It shall be the duty of a testator to make adequate provision in life for his spouse according to his means whether by his will or otherwise.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where, on application by or on behalf of a spouse the Court is of opinion that the testator has failed to make adequate provision for his spouse in accordance with his means, whether by will or otherwise, the Court may order that such provision <Col N="172" /> shall be made for the spouse out of the estate of the testator as the Court shall think just.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had covered most of the ground.  There is possibly one outstanding matter and that is the query by Senator Garret FitzGerald concerning the question of estate duty as it relates to life estates. This is a matter on which I cannot, naturally, make any comment.  It is purely for the Minister for Finance within the context of a Finance Bill, but, as Senator FitzGerald has raised it here, I will bring it to his notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the broader question so far as it affects this particular Bill, I should like to emphasise again that the question of accepting a life estate is a matter of choice for the beneficiary, or life tenant.  Assuming it is the widow&mdash;as the situation has been advanced here&mdash;if she wishes to avail of the life estate to avoid estate duty, she can do so, provided she is happy with that particular form of disposition and provided the arrangement suits her in the particular circumstances of her case.  It is not a matter for this Bill to say what should and should not be done by the widow in particular circumstances or by the surviving spouse in relation to a life estate.  The ball is back in the beneficiary's court, as it were.  If the life estate arrangement or some other arrangement has been worked out by the testator and his wife prior to the testator's death, then the wife can participate in that particular arrangement, be it an arrangement which evades duty, to the benefit of herself or her estate, or otherwise.  Under this Bill there is no compulsion, there is nothing to force her to adopt any particular attitude.  The freedom is hers and the choice is hers.  It is the survivor's choice to avail of whatever arrangement was agreed upon or, even in some cases, not agreed upon.  I am <Col N="173" /> not envisaging the husband and wife getting together in every case.  Even if they do not come together, if the testator makes an arrangement which suits the widow, she can adopt that particular course or not, as she chooses. It is for her to weigh the balance of advantage between that type of estate, if it involves a saving of estate duty, as against another type of estate which might give her a more firm security from the point of view of credit but might involve extra estate duty.</P>
    <P>I am not competent to judge on the scales of estate duty.  It is a very intricate matter involving various scales of payment, perhaps, upon different sources of estate.  I am, however, aware as a matter of practice that one advantage of a life estate arrangement is that you avoid having to pay estate duty twice.  If that is the arrangement that suits the widow in the particular circumstances, or if the testator enters into that arrangement prior to death, she can carry out that arrangement though it might not be the best possible from my point of view or the ideal form of holding.  If they wish to enter into that arrangement to avoid or not pay as much estate duty as under some other arrangement, it is open to them to do so.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise this voluntary aspect of the Bill.  At a very early stage it got off the ground in the wrong way.  The impression went abroad to the public that there was this compulsory one third share and that that was that, that there could be no other arrangement you could make, that after death your widow must get one third if there were children and one half if there were no children, and there was no alternative.  In fact, every alternative in the world is open to any testator or testatrix under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to emphasise the fact that I envisaged&mdash;and I am certain that it will work out this way&mdash;that the legal right principle will be the very last resort to be used by the surviving spouse to prevent himself or herself being in any way victimised. It is only in that context that I see it working, as a weapon to be used or not to be used, as something in reserve <Col N="174" /> which the widow knows she has and which everybody else concerned with the property knows too, to ensure fair play for her.  It is in that connection that I see the scheme operated.  It leaves wide open all the arrangements in the world from the point of view of legal and revenue aspects that a testator or a solicitor or an accountant can devise for the benefit of the estate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the point made by Senator FitzGerald and to hope that the Minister will be able to do something on that line. On the first occasion after the Second Reading of the Bill I actually put down an amendment which I afterwards withdrew when I promptly realised that it would be out of order under this Bill.  The substance of it was that an estate to the widow be her share of right here of one half, or one third where there are children, but if she subsequently gave with her estate any of the estate of the testator it would be regarded as a life estate. In other words, that if she took her share, say, one third of the estate, and subsequently passed that on on her own death to the children of the original testator that that would be valued then as a life estate and no further death duties would be paid on that portion which she passed on to the children of her spouse.  That would be a reasonably fair arrangement because a husband and a wife may probably be of the same age.  The husband dies and a half or one third, under this Bill, if the Minister does not amend it, will go to the wife.  As they are both about the same age in a very few years the husband or the wife will die and, again, the estate becomes liable to death duties.  That would be unfair.  It might in some instances induce the widow to forgo her share of the estate because she might realise that the death duties will again be deducted a few years after the death of the testator.  I would ask the Minister to bring this to the notice of the Minister for Finance when he is preparing the next Finance Bill.  I agree that some minimum share should go to the surviving spouse.  It would be unfair that the State should take a lump out of that sum on the death of the surviving spouse.</P>

      <P>I should like to give that assurance to both Senator Garret FitzGerald and Senator Cole. We are equally conscious of this.  In view largely of what both Senators said in this respect it seems inequitable that the legal right share should bear an extra penalty with regard to death duties.  This is not a matter for the Bill.  It is a matter for a Finance Bill. I shall bring the matter to the notice of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, between now and the next Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall accept that and I am very grateful to the Minister.  I was impressed when he said that this is entirely voluntary.  I do not think he appreciates the cases where it might not be voluntary.  I believe his attention was drawn to what Deputy John A. Costello, whom he quoted on a number of occasions in this debate, said about the case of a man whose wife is mentally incapacitated. This man has made substantial provision to ensure that she will be looked after in a home for the rest of her life.  Under this Bill she will have her legal right to one third or one half as the case may be.  She will not be able to claim that because of her mental incapacity and it will go to the next of kin.  This man has made complete provision for his wife but now, under this Bill, that is changed. Could the Minister help me with regard to this?</P>

      <P>I am very glad Senator FitzGerald raised this point. Deputy John A. Costello made a very strong case with regard to this in the Dáil and I saw much merit in it.  We introduced an amendment which is now incorporated in Section 115 in which we provide:</P>
      <P>Where a testator, during his lifetime, has made permanent provision for his spouse, whether under contract or otherwise, all property which is the subject of such provision (other than periodical payments made for her maintenance during his lifetime) shall be taken as being given in or towards satisfaction of the share as a legal right of a surviving spouse.</P>

      <P>There is this difference.  This Bill was not in the minds of the people who were party to this arrangement.  It would obviously be inequitable now to bring in a legal right at this stage and upset an arrangement which the parties concerned did not contemplate.  This legal right will be brought to the notice of the parties concerned in the future.  There is a distinction between those two situations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot for the life of me see why the Opposition oppose this section.  When I spoke earlier in the evening I was under the impression that a man had to leave one shilling or something like that before he could justify his will.  I now understand if he leaves a dog, a cat or nothing at all, as long as he makes it clear in the will that he knew the spouse existed it is all right.  It could be challenged in the courts but even if it was challenged it would be shown that the man was in his right senses.  He knew he had a wife <Col N="177" /> and he left her what he thought she was worth.  Only a very small percentage deal with their wives in that way.</P>
      <P>This Bill, when it goes through, will, as I said earlier, provide for a very small percentage of our people in the way most of us who are Roman Catholics, and Christians as well, provide for our wives.  That is the way we, on this side of the House, deal with our wives.  We deal with them as considerately as we possibly can.  We are all fairly reasonable people and the people we represent are reasonable people as well.  It is unfortunate that the people on the other side of the House appear to be arguing on the side of what does not exist at all in this country.  As far as I know, there are no such people in this country.  If there are such people they are probably one tenth of one per cent.  I do not think you can frame a Bill on behalf of the negligible majority who do not care.</P>

      <P>I am not saying it never happens at all.  The reason the Bill is brought in is that it does happen, but it happens in very, very few cases.  As I said before, as the law stands at the moment, a man can leave his wife one shilling, or he need not leave her anything at all, so long as he clearly indicates in his will that he is sane.  He can tell her to take a jump at herself, and leave her nothing.  The Minister is trying to improve that position, and Senators on the opposite side of the House started arguing and telling him that is not the position.</P>

The Minister is providing that a man must leave his wife something, without exaggerating things altogether. No one could bring in a Bill that would cover every single point.  We must have commonsense.  We are all ordinary Catholics and Christians and we are not a crowd of pagan desecrated lunatics.  The Minister has gone a long way to be helpful.  Any man with any commonsense at all does not want to be purely obstructive.  Senators over there are looking for cheap advertisement.</P>
      <P>Let us compare the present situation with what the situation will be under the new Bill.  Is that not the fairest way to do it?  As I said before, if this Bill proves to have faults, it will not be the last Succession Bill to be brought in here.  We can be quite sure of that.</P>

      <P>I should like to say at the outset that I agree with Senator Lenehan on one point only, that is, that the Minister has made a genuine effort, a very commendable effort, to improve the legal situation in relation to succession.  I think we are all agreed that this is a measure of great social importance.  We have seen by virtue of the amendments put down that there are varying opinions in relation to the section and the amendments.  Although I think this amendments is commendable, I do not think it would be workable in practice. I think it represents an attitude which is in the interest of the spouse, if it could be worked.  I expressed my view on this on the last occasion.  No judge is the proper person or is properly equipped to implement an amendment such as this.  Secondly, I think it is far too vague, and I believe it could lead to an overwhelming amount of litigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that everyone should realise that there is far too much aimless and, I think, absolutely common criticism of the legal profession in relation to this Bill.  I do not say this as a member of the legal profession, but I think the legal profession play a reasonably important part in society. <Col N="181" /> It has been pointed out time and time again&mdash;and he himself has pointed out &mdash;that the Minister has had the benefit of the advice of eminent lawyers on the Fine Gael side in the House, as well as from the other side of the House. I object to the attitude which presents lawyers as self-opinionated nincompoops whose only anxiety is to make fools of those people who have to appear in court.  That was not my intention when I took up this profession. Indeed, I think it comes badly from politicians, because there is a substantial body of people who take the same view, and say the same about politicians, and particularly about Members of this House.  It is about time we adopted a more reasonable and more mature attitude on this question.</P>
    <P>I refrained from intervening in this debate because I expressed my views on the last occasion.  I think the section as it stands represents a very honest and a very commendable effort to ensure that the surviving spouse, and particularly the widow, will have a definite right which she can hold against all comers.  A lot of effort and study has gone into these amendments. The amendment may be commendable in spirit, but in practice, it is not likely to succeed.  It might well lead to an overwhelming amount of litigation, and I do not think the courts are the proper place to air these views.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), line 11, after &ldquo;estate&rdquo; to add &ldquo;for life.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is a little embarrassing now to have to request the Minister again to reconsider the position after he has so very firmly put down his foot.  I feel that the Minister, particularly on his Second Reading concluding speech and, indeed, on various occasions when he spoke on this Bill, came before the House with the attitude &ldquo;I must do something and I think this is the best way I can do&rdquo; or, if I might say so:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" />&ldquo;Don't hit me now with the widow in my arms&rdquo;.  Something makes me feel that he would like to compromise a little but is afraid to move one foot in case he should slip altogether.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister that these amendments of mine are sincerely meant to be constructive and sincerely meant to reflect opinions I have heard throughout the country.  My amendments are simply that, instead of a complete estate&mdash;absolute, a half and a third&mdash;the surviving spouse takes that share for life.  I spoke on previous sections and I suggested that this would cause fragmentation, particularly in farms.  If I direct my remarks particularly towards farms or the countryside in relation to the application of this Bill, I hope the House will excuse me because it is for the reason that perhaps I know a little more about that section of the community.</P>
    <P>However, I think it will give rise to fragmentation and it will make this difference.  Take, for example, a son living on a farm.  At present, we will take it that the testator makes a will and gives his son&mdash;this is the usual form, I think&mdash;the farm and gives his wife or widow a right of maintenance or a room sometimes, to live on that farm all her life.  In other words, she practically has a life estate on that farm and that is a very common will in the country.  Under this, if the Minister puts it through as it is now, the wife or the husband&mdash;and in that respect I would point out that not so long ago somebody in this country pointed out that at least half of the land in this country is held by women, so it might very often be a husband &mdash;will take an absolute estate in one third of it.</P>
    <P>The son who is left has to wait until the widow dies, accepting that it is the widow.  She may be a young woman.  In the country she is very often much younger than the husband or else he gives in and says: &ldquo;This is hopeless&rdquo;.  I can think of several different situations which may arise in a case like this.  Take the spouse who does marry again and has children by a second husband and who owns one-third of the farm.  I wonder which child, if she makes a will, will <Col N="183" /> get that third?  I feel it is her youngest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Her husband must get one-third of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fragmentation. I feel she will probably leave the youngest child the place, if they are in need or they may be in need when she dies, if they are very young children. I fail to see where all this will lead in many cases like that.</P>
      <P>Somebody mentioned the improvident spouse, let it be a man or a woman.  Should that person get an absolute estate, supposing he falls out with the family.  The family has no use for him; the eldest son or whoever remains on the farm has no use for him; and they fall out completely. She has an absolute share in one-third, less probably the house, and she accepts, within the year, and demands. I admit that these cases will be very few and far between but this is the case this Bill is legislating for. Then you have the surviving spouse with more than enough means of her own.  You have a man with perhaps nothing but a small farm.  The wife comes in with a fairly large dowry of her own.  He wants to leave that small farm to a son perhaps who does not agree too well with his mother, and so on, or <i>vice versa</i>.  These must get their share of the farm, if they want to take it, although they might be very well off on their own.</P>
      <P>We have discussed already the mentally defective person who is not mentally defective enough to be put in a mental hospital but who definitely is not a person to be entrusted with a share: it may be a large or a small estate.  Those are the people I am thinking of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In replying to some points which were raised, the Minister made a point about a person who wants to raise money on the farm perhaps to make improvements.  He argues that in the case of a farm owned by a son as to two-thirds and a widow as to one-third absolutely, the son can raise money more easily than a son with the whole ownership, apart from a life estate to his mother, who is probably fairly well on in years. <Col N="184" /> Surely, the son whose mother has only a life estate, after which the farm will go to him absolutely, can get credit far more easily for improvements on the farm than the son whose mother has the one-third share?  I think the son who has a mother with only a life estate or a father with only a life estate, who is a progressive young chap and wants to raise credit has only to say&mdash; as soon as my parent, be it father or mother, goes I have absolute estate in this farm.</P>
    <P>I should like to make this one final point to the Minister.  In the case of the surviving spouse, who elects to take one-third in one case and in the other have a life interest, what is the material difference to them?  In either case if they want to realise that share they will have to put the farm up for sale. Otherwise they are simply having it there so that they will have a right of decent maintenance for the rest of their lives.  I do not see any material difference to them except they want to raise financial aid.  To my mind that is the kernel of the whole matter. I would think the Minister should reconsider whether a life estate would not be a more suitable way to arrange this section.  Listening to the debate from both sides of the House, I feel that it would satisfy a great many people in the country and I think both sides of the House.  I feel also it would be the answer to nearly all the queries which have been raised by various Senators on both sides of the House with regard to the life estate.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that a minimum estate for the surviving spouse should be kept in the Bill, that is a minimum absolute estate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think much of the talk we have heard seemed to be aimed at exceptional cases, whereas it is for the general good we must legislate. For me I think this addition of &ldquo;for life&rdquo; is a vote of no confidence in the surviving spouse.  That is the main thing it conveys to me.  It is a relief and I think by having it only &ldquo;for life&rdquo; the surviving spouse has no lever against the person who is eventually supposed to get the estate.  It is a vote of no confidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Lenehan Mr. Lenehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely disagree with this amendment.  I think the Minister's attitude to this whole question of life interest is a much more practical one.  As I said earlier most men are responsible, they have some commonsense and deal relatively reasonably with their wives.  We have to face this from the point of view that most people are reasonable.  With regard to the life interest if we allow the widow who has a family to inherit the whole estate it could easily happen that she could treat her family wrongly. Therefore, I think the Minister's attitude towards this problem is a much saner one and ensures that the family of that marriage will at least have something rather than leaving it arbitrarily to the widow who might&mdash; again, in the one case out of a thousand&mdash;be the cause of the trouble. I think everybody's needs are met, at least to some extent, in this particular Bill.  I shall not go so far as to say that everybody's requirements are met. No Bill could do that but this has gone a long way.</P>
      <P>The question of, say, the husband dying and the widow getting the one third and the family two thirds has been brought up here in connection with the creditworthiness of the estate. It would be very interesting to know before the man died at all how creditworthy was the estate.  As a result of this, would it be any less creditworthy? Where will those people seek credit? Will they go to the bank for it, will they go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and ask one of us to accompany them or what will they do? After all, the people who will give the credit will investigate the whole position from A to Z anyway and it probably will not matter two hoots one way or the other whether it is one third in the widow's name, two thirds in the family's name, <i>vice versa</i> or any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You find the most extraordinary things happening.  For instance, you have the famous case where a fellow goes into the bank and takes in his blue cards for his cattle&mdash;we will say he has ten cows&mdash;and the bank manager gives him a loan on the position of the cows.  That is a well-known <Col N="186" /> fact.  Now he cannot sell the cows as the bank manager has the cards.  Being a Mayo man, he has brains and he says he has lost the cards.  He, therefore, gets new tests, new cards and he sells his cows.  That is happening all over the country.  I am not giving anything away.  Everybody knows it except people who have no intelligence at all.  You are in the very same position in the other case.  The bank manager will take into consideration the overall case, not merely the fact that the widow or somebody else owns the place.  You can be sure the bank manager will not give the widow or her family any more than one tenth of what the place is worth, no matter who owns it, so it will not make much difference anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in supporting this amendment and the very reasonable case made on it by Senator Cole.  Senator Mrs. Ahern who spoke on it said this was essentially a vote of no confidence in the spouse but surely the whole Bill is designed for exceptional cases.  That is why the legislation is necessary, for the one out of twenty or the one out of thirty who may act unfairly.  Consequently, we have to look at this section as well as the other sections in that light; in other words, to protect the family unit against unfair action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at that in conjunction with section 112, which provides for the renunciation of the legal right, it would seem to me that a husband in making his will, or, indeed, a wife, would consult the other partner and, having agreed on how they were going to dispose of the property, then the other partner would sign in accordance with section 112 a renunciation of the legal right in favour of the provision that has been made for the surviving spouse under the will.  If I am right in that it seems the logical and natural approach and one that we would all like to see adopted, that is, an agreed disposition of the property.  Then there is a situation that will possibly be only an exceptional case where the husband and wife do not agree on this, where the other party is unreasonable, for instance, if the wife takes the attitude that she is going to have half <Col N="187" /> the farm eventually even though she has to wait until the end of her time to realise it she can force under section 110.  We all agree that adequate provision should be made, and I do not think that the provision under section 112 is completely adequate because you may get things arranged very amicably and very fairly before the spouse dies and afterwards it may turn out that that settlement does not provide the protection that the dying partner thought it would provide for his spouse, yet she has renounced once and for all the legal right by signing under section 112.</P>
    <P>I would like to see some cover for such a person in the event of things turning out unfairly afterwards.  The cover provided in section 110 is an absolute cover.  It is much too severe, because it means that an old person who under section 110 has a legal right to have the property and yet has agreed on a disposition that a certain son or a nephew is going to have the place and she actually is living with that person, then it may turn out that as the person gets old and, perhaps, her faculties become impaired&mdash;we know how difficult some old people can become&mdash;then near the end of her days she is prevailed upon to have some other member of the family come along and say: &ldquo;You are treated very unfairly.  Why not come and live with me?&rdquo;  Realising that the old person has very little time left in this world, for giving a home for that little time the person concerned stands the prospect of getting half the property, that is, the legal right of that person.  I think that all that will be guarded against if the person has a legal right, as is proposed in the amendment, to use the property for life.  It means then that there is no incentive there to anyone to come in to make trouble within the family in the hope of gain, because the person entitled to the legal right would have a yearly annuity which is sufficient to provide for her livelihood even if she does leave the house and goes to live with somebody else.  There is no incentive of property gain attached as is left under section 110.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider this very much in conjunction with section 112.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> One other point I would like to raise is the principle enshrined here of the absolute ownership of half the estate. It seems to go against the principle that was recently introduced by the Government and welcomed by all Parties in connection with the 1965 Land Act, where to encourage elderly people to hand over their places for the relief of congestion and so on there was provision for an annuity offered, and people were encouraged to avail of this.  Personally, I think that there is not half enough use made of the provision of annuities for all elderly people.  I meet quite a few who have a certain amount of money in the bank.  In one case the person is 80 and has a couple of thousands in the bank. The interest from that is relatively meagre and provides a meagre livelihood, and I tried to persuade the person to invest in an annuity where she could get four or five times that amount, yet she would not because it would die with her and there would be no property left behind.  That is surely the principle we should try to get across to our people, that at least their first responsibility is to make provision for themselves and that if they cannot do that by direct interest out of capital, leaving the capital intact, then the obvious thing surely to do is to use up some or all of the capital by means of an annuity, something that the Government are encouraging very rightly and successfully under the recent Land Act.  If the amendment is met here it will be a step in that direction also.</P>

      <P>I agree entirely with the general views expressed by Senator Cole and Senator Quinlan on this amendment, and, indeed, in passing I must remark that it is extremely odd that in an enactment as recent as the Land Act, 1965 it is right and proper for the Oireachtas to provide that old people shall surrender their farms and get an annuity on the actuarial value&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about that kind of situation, that people <Col N="189" /> should surrender their farm, retain the dwelling house and get an annuity. The Oireachtas as recently as 1965 enacts that that is good enough and that is a good situation, but if a man were to make the same kind of provision under his will for his widow that is not good enough because the surviving spouse can come along and demand the one third share.  The more you go into this Bill and the more instances that are cited the more you become convinced that the provisions of section 110 are so utterly rigid that the section is all wrong in principle. Having said that, one can only highlight it as another instance of the way we are being inconsistent.</P>

The Minister has discovered a disease that life estates suffer from which to my mind no other lawyer or business person I know of has discovered.</P>

      <P>If that is the case there is nothing in the world to prevent the Oireachtas from amending the Settled Land Act under which the powers of tenants are liable to be determined.  It is not good enough to say, even if the Minister is correct, that because life tenancies suffer from some dissipation we must disallow them completely.  If a man creates a life tenancy that is good enough. The truth of the matter is that most of the wills made by people at the present time and most of the deeds made by farmers are under marriage settlements or when they are handing property over to sons for the purpose of obtaining the old age pension. Most of the marriage settlements are made for the husband and wife for their life and to such one or other of their children who may survive them.  That has been found to work quite satisfactorily.  Senator Lenehan and Senator Ahern are quite right when they say that this Bill will not affect the vast majority of cases.  It is regrettable that people like this should be brought into the Bill.  When the husband and wife agree everything is all right but this legislation is for the small minority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lenehan spoke about the small minority this evening.  It is because of this small minority that the Bill has been introduced.  I do not agree that it is beyond the wit of man to amend this Bill in such a way that it will cover everything.  We are talking about improper wills and the kind of will that would not give a life estate to the surviving spouse or that would give her a fixed share.  As the Bill stands the cantankerous surviving spouse could get a life interest.  She is entitled to demand her one third share from the other beneficiaries under the will.  The idea of paying one third the value of a small farm, a small public house or a small grocery shop is quite impracticable.  It will blister the business or the farm with <Col N="191" /> debts that will be a very effective brake on production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Lenehan Mr. Lenehan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I find I cannot agree with the proposed amendment.  In the ordinary course of events in the case of the father and mother with children when one spouse dies, the owner of the property, this section, as it stands, provides that one third of the estate must be left to the surviving spouse. Those children are the children of both parents.  They have an obligation of filial duty, respect and affection to both parents.  No problem arises whatever in the ordinary course of events if they have been properly reared.  The child who the father said should carry on the business or farm, the child who is industrious and thrifty is the child who the mother also feels should carry on the business or the farm.  A very serious problem arises, as most practising solicitors know, when the child marries.  I have found, with very few exceptions, that while any cabin may be big enough to hold two men there are very few castles big enough to hold two women.  The daughter-in-law and the mother-in-law do not agree.</P>
      <P>The daughter-in-law is young, just married and starting in life.  The mother-in-law is old, perhaps, a little impatient, a little lonely, perhaps, feeling she has come to the end of her days and she may also be a little unreasonable.  You must make allowances for the failings and weaknesses in those old people.  A child is prepared to do so but a daughter-in-law very frequently is not prepared to do so.  If the mother has a bargaining power of one third of the estate she does not have to exercise it.  It is a bargaining power that is given to her to ensure she is treated properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A son brings a bride into his home. His first duty is to his wife over and above his mother.  He can reason with his wife if she is unreasonable.  He can say to her: &ldquo;Look, mother really owns one third of this place.  We must be kind to her.  You must try to be a little patient with her.&rdquo;  The net result, as I see it from my own practical experience in preparing marriage <Col N="192" /> settlements, is that I put in a certain provision for the father and mother. I also invariably put in a bargaining provision or penalty clause to the effect that if the father or mother has to leave home, because they are not treated kindly, the penalty which is imposed is such that the young couple can scarcely bear it.  That penalty is never intended to be taken into account.  It is hoped it will not have effect except as a last resort but it must be there.  I have found in example after example in cases where there is a young woman with young children who, perhaps, because they have irritated her, is tired, and they are crying on her knee, is apt to be impatient. The mere fact that the penalty clause is there and her husband can remind her of it frequently makes her more kind to the old couple.</P>
    <P>I am wholeheartedly in favour of the surviving spouse getting a definite fixed sum, whether it be capital or income of some sort provided the penalty clause is there.  With regard to the one third of the estate, I do not know how you could measure it. I do not know how you could deal with it and how you could arrange a farm.  If extra capital is required it would create immeasurable difficulties in that respect.  I also think, in addition to the fact that it is not practicable, that giving the surviving parent one-third of the estate enables his or her child to persuade the other partner to be a little more patient with old age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Nash has largely made the case I would have made.  Indeed, the points for and against life estates have been made on earlier amendments, both by me and by other Senators.  Not only as a lawyer, and as the holder of my present office, but with a knowledge of rural Ireland, I can think of no worse form of estate than a life estate which ties up the estate in the hands of the surviving spouse, say, the widow.  The son may want to bring in a wife and rear a family, and try to make a go of the farm, but he has only a remainder interest in the farm.  He has <Col N="193" /> not got any assets with which he can negotiate.  He has no security to raise money, and the result is that he does not get married.  As Senator O'Reilly said earlier, we often have the spectacle of the mother holding on with her life estate, which is no use to her, and the son waiting for her to die with his remainder, which is no use to him. I agree with Senator O'Reilly that this sort of situation has led to more injustices in rural Ireland, more delays in regard to marriage, and more rundown farms, than any situation I can envisage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a life estate of one-third only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is even worse. Everything I said already in regard to life estates is magnified one thousand fold when it is a life estate of one-third.  That is the sort of estate that ruins the title.  Bad as a life estate on its own is, when it is one-third, it is useless from the negotiable point of view.  I do not see any merit in it at all, any more than in a later section I see any merit in tenancies in common which we are, in certain respects, getting rid of in this Bill.</P>
      <P>When the surviving spouse has a right to one-third, she can, in the last resort, protect her interests, but as I said before on numerous occasions, I would envisage that that would be exercised only in the event of victimisation taking place.  In the ordinary course of events, the son carrying on the farm, after the death of the father, will be in a position to register the farm in the Land Registry, and his mother's one-third will be registered as a charge on the land.  He will have an absolute freehold title registered as his own.  He can extract his land certificate and go anywhere with it.  A similar situation arises in the case of an industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certain a practising lawyer like Senator Nash will agree that from the negotiating point of view, this is practical so far as small businesses and small farms are concerned.  Because the son is the registered owner, he is encouraged to bring in his wife and children, and all he has as a charge <Col N="194" /> is the one-third which is reserved for his mother.  That son is in a far better negotiating position to raise credit than a life tenant or a remainder man. I am certain any practising lawyer and any practising businessman will agree that that is the best way.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this matter with Senator Nash and, while I do not say that he is the bible on this matter, he agrees with me and he said so here. Any experienced lawyers I have talked to who have thought deeply about the matter agree with me.  I know there are old fashioned tendencies towards the creation of life estates, encouraged by the fact that in the case of large estates they are an escape or a way out.  That does not apply to small farmers who do not pay estate duty because they are under the scale.  Therefore the creation of life estates on small properties is incomprehensible to me.</P>

      <P>I would make a fairly safe guess as to what would happen in that case: the son and his new wife would go.  I have seen it happen in two cases.  I want to go back to the point raised by the Minister.  He argues on behalf of the son that in the case where he has two-thirds absolutely, and his mother has one-third absolutely, his share is more valuable to him than in the case of an estate where he has two-thirds absolutely, and his mother has the remainder for life only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand how this is not seen.  What I envisage when the legal right comes into operation&mdash;that is a legal right to one-third of the assets and, as I have already said, I do not envisage this being enforced except in the last extremity&mdash;is that this person can go to the Land Registry and get himself registered as the absolute owner, the freehold owner of the whole lot.  As I have said before, 50 per cent of Irish properties descend by way of intestacy. The son will be able to go to the Land Registry and get himself registered, subject to charges in respect of the shares due.  The son with the two-thirds share will go to the Land Registry and get himself registered as the absolute freehold owner, with a charge added on in respect of the one-third right reserved to the mother, and with that in his hands he can go anywhere. He could not go anywhere if he were a remainder-man waiting for his mother to die.  No bank would look at him if he were hanging on to a farm where his mother was the life tenant with all the rights of management and dealing with the property entirely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is precisely the same situation there.  You are creating a life interest which is not as negotiable as an absolute freehold, where the son can go with a 100 per cent absolute freehold in his hand, subject to a one-third charge which is covered in the folio.  He can have a land certificate issued to him which is negotiable security on which he can <Col N="196" /> raise money.  He will not get that sort of certificate on which to get security, in respect of the other arrangement.</P>

But I own two-thirds&rdquo; and his brother comes on the farm and says &ldquo;I own this farm absolutely except for a life estate to my mother who is 65 years old now.&rdquo;  Surely he is far better?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is far less security for her.  It cuts both ways.  We are seeking to have a middle road here whereby the widow is adequately catered for by her one-third share and whereby at the same time the son can raise money if he wants to.  The scheme is for the middle of the road. It does not go to either extreme in the way of hardship to either party. There is protection to the widow and at the same time there is a negotiating asset on which the son can raise money to expand the business or the farm.  If you go to either of the other extremes, you prejudice one or the other.</P>
      <P>In the case Senator Cole has mentioned, in the life estate case, the widow in this case has no guarantee beyond a life estate.  The life estate is not nearly as strong an asset as far as she is concerned as the one-third outright share.</P>

      <P>Similarly, the position freehold-wise of the whole estate, subject to a charge of one-third is as least as strong from the point of view of security.  You have the written-in rights for the widow and at the <Col N="197" /> same time the freehold going to the son subject to the charge in her favour. If the objective here is to do justice to the widow and the son, you do it best by having a situation where he can negotiate on the basis of being freehold owner.  At the same time, she has her weapon in the last resort to enforce if he treats her badly.</P>

      <P>A moment ago, you were arguing from the son's point of view.  The Minister has now shifted over.  I am not quite sure that there is any difference in the hands of the widow in that instance to her materially where she owns one-third of the estate absolutely or one-third for life because in neither instance, if she has to enforce it, she is going to wreck the family life and farm.  If she has to enforce it in either way she will have to claim that and put the farm up for sale and claim one-third of the cash they get.  There is no other alternative for the widow if it comes to that.  In either case, I am not quite sure it makes much difference. For the son's sake I think I would settle for the life estate in the widow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before a decision is taken I would like to appeal to the Minister to reconsider this again.  We have all got very close and intimate experience of these things. You can go too far in either direction. Senator Nash surely would not like to envisage a situation where a spouse, having been kept on a farm and having been well treated for 10 or 15 years and having reached the age of 85 and having a dissatisfied son who thought that in the original settlement he did not get sufficient and he then comes along and in the 85th year of his mother he capitalises on her infirmity and the fact that she feels they are not treating her well&mdash;something is getting on her nerves&mdash;and he says &ldquo;That is right, mother, why not come and live <Col N="198" /> with me and you do not have to put up with this.  You own one-third of the place.&rdquo;  Senator Nash in his bargaining power is creating a weapon there that would enable the mother to be taken from home after being treated well there for 15 years, just three weeks before she dies and then, as a reward for the three weeks, giving the whole of the one-third share of the farm over to this discontented son who felt he did not get enough originally.  That is the situation you are creating.  I agree with you and I know the whole thing is very complex.  I have given much thought to it in practical cases with which I have been very closely connected.  The more you think of it the more difficult it does become to create a bargaining power for one that is not unfair at either extremity.  The one given is too unfair and is liable to be exploited at the very end of the person's life.  We all know that scarcely a will is made anywhere where the rest of the children feel that the son at home who got the farm got far too much and they who got education off the farm or are in positions feel he has got everything.  You can rest assured that there are many cases in the country where this would be exploited almost on the deathbed of the spouse and it would create ruin on the homefarm so I think the Minister should think again on this. Perhaps the amendment as it stands is not sufficient.  It may be over simplified but the Minister should surely think on it again and try to meet the very legitimate points that have been raised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Think again on it.  The Minister very convincingly tried to disprove Euclid tonight to prove that the part is greater than the whole.  He tried to prove that a farmer who owned absolutely two-thirds of the place and his mother the other third was in a better position, in other words, he had more assets, than a man who owned absolutely two-thirds and was going to get the other one-third when his mother died&mdash;in other words that one-third that was to come to <Col N="199" /> him had a capital value that any actuarial company would calculate in advance.  They would take the parent's age.  If the mother was 70 they would say the life expectancy is seven or eight years at that stage and calculate the present value or the present worth or this one-third property that, by actuarial standards, would come in seven years and that is a positive addition to the two-thirds he already holds, so that he is in a far stronger position. He has more assets and more borrowing power than the man advocated by the Minister.  I could not leave that demonstration by the Minister that the part was greater than the whole, to go unchallenged.  It contradicts every rule of logic that I ever heard of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) of section 110 says:</P>
      <P>(2)  If the testator leaves a spouse and children, the spouse shall have a right to one-third of the estate.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Shall have a right...&rdquo; It provides for cases where the will does not leave the spouse less.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) of section 114 says:</P>
      <P>(4)  The right of election conferred by this section shall not be exercisable after the expiration of one year from the first taking out of representation of the deceased's estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I would agree wholeheartedly with Senator Quinlan if that subsection were not there.  We will say the father dies, the mother stays on and the son decides to get married.  Then, for the first time, they think of taking out representation or administration.  The young woman comes in&mdash;and they say that sometimes a man courts a smile but he marries the whole girl&mdash;she may be kind to the old woman and no problem may arise.  If she is kind to the old woman when they are taking out representation and they are with their solicitor, if the old lady is left less when they are making title, then she agrees to that.  If she is not being treated kindly then within a period of 12 months from her taking out administration she must make her election.  She cannot wait until she is 85.  If she is <Col N="200" /> being treated kindly during those two years unless she decides at that stage &ldquo;I am going to have a showdown with my son and my daughter-in-law and I am not taking what is bequeathed to me in the will,&rdquo; she cannot decide to do so afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that reveals the absolute weakness of Senator Nash's case.  In other words, he is providing this mighty atomic weapon, this bargaining power to frighten everyone in saying it is only effective for one year, so they have got to be nice to the old person for one year only.  After that her right to revert to the legal right is gone and you are leaving her absolutely at the mercy of this frightful daughter-in-law of whom Senator Nash has painted a picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not think it is frightful.  It gives the widow the right, having seen her daughter-in-law and having lived with her during that year, to make up her mind within that year what bargain is fair and reasonable and will hold the scales equally between herself, her son and his wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This shows the difference.  In other words, I am objecting to the one third right as giving too strong a bargaining power to the spouse.  Senator Nash's position, as revealed here, is that he is satisfied to give bargaining power just for one year and no longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should clear up this matter.  What we are seeking to do here is preserve the middle of the road, doing justice both to the son remaining on, who will work and develop the property, while at the same time doing justice to the mother who has given the property so many years of her life in partnership with her husband.  We have here in this Bill precisely what will do justice in this case.  I repeat again that the son has a better chance in a situation where there is one third residing with his mother as a legal right.  We have thrashed this out with the Land Registry. I would suggest to Senator Quinlan, when he speaks of examining <Col N="201" /> administration when dealing with TDs and Senators, the most important aspect is to examine how the administration of these matters works out in practice.  I have thrashed it out with the Registrar of Titles in the Land Registry and it is quite clear, under the Registration of Title Acts, that you cannot register a fee simple property subject to a life estate.  That sort of animal does not exist.  If you are envisaging a life estate on the lines proposed in this amendment, the Registrar in the Land Registry cannot give you a clear folio or a full title on the basis of that for the purpose of raising money.</P>
      <P>In the situation where you have a one third legal right residing with the mother and two thirds with the son, what the son will do is go into the Registrar of Titles in the Land Registry and say: &ldquo;There you are, under this will I have two thirds of this property, my mother is entitled to one third, and I want to keep that for her as she is staying on in the house&rdquo;.  The Registrar will say: &ldquo;You can be registered subject to the one third residing in your mother.&rdquo; In other words, a charge will be registered on the folio and the son will be registered as full owner subject to this charge.  He could not be registered in that fashion if there was a life estate in one third reserved for his mother or anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot register a life estate on a fee simple. What would happen is that the mother, or the life tenant, would be registered as the limited owner and a limited ownership in regard to registered land is not nearly as negotiable as a full freehold.  On the other aspect there is no shadow of doubt that the full one third is a far better weapon for the mother to have than the life estate, which is practically worthless from her point of view.  With the life estate she is entirely at the mercy of the remainder men&mdash;she can stay on in the property but she cannot exercise her strength in any way.  It is far better that there should be a clear section in ordinary straightforward language, <Col N="202" /> with no complications, to do the greatest good for the greatest number of cases.  I think it is beyond the wit of man to devise the perfect system in regard to testamentary disposition. You have in those two sections, so far as it is possible to devise, a system that will do justice in a marriage&mdash; on the one hand, give protection to the surviving spouse in the form of this legal right and, on the other, ensure the greatest degree of flexibility to the testator to do justice to the particular circumstances of the farm or business.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree.  It might short circuit the discussion at a later stage if the Minister would clear up this point.  I cannot agree at all, even if the son gets himself registered as full owner with a charge in favour of his mother extending to one third of the assets of the deceased, that that is any kind of title on which a bank will lend money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>With intestacies it is done because you are dealing with ascertainable shares.  I want to make a point which the Minister seems to have overlooked.  The son, if he is going to become registered, can only become registered subject to his mother's right in one third of the assets of her deceased husband.  The Minister has emphasised, and rightly so, in this debate earlier that it is one third of the assets that she is entitled to.  The first thing the bank manager will say: &ldquo;Here you are entitled to this property as full owner subject to your mother's right to one third of the assets.  One third of the assets may be worth more than half the value of the farm.  The farm may only compose a small part of the assets.&rdquo;  If a man leaves £1,500 in cash, the widow would be entitled to an interest in one third of the land and one third of the stock&mdash;crops, implements and chattels and any money in the bank or any other kind of personal property that the deceased had. The bank manager will say: &ldquo;Your mother is entitled to one third of the <Col N="203" /> assets of your father.  What did that amount to?  If it amounted to £500 is that paid?&rdquo;  And, of course, the value of the property goes down immediately by one third of the personal assets.  In most cases when dealing with stock and implements you are including the value of crops and all the rest of it. This is a kind of floating charge registered on the land, and no bank manager with any sense, not even the kind Senator Lenehan was talking about earlier, is going to lend money not knowing what one third of the personal property of the deceased amounted to.</P>
      <P>It may be said that somebody can bring in a schedule of assets and say that that was the value of the personal estate of the deceased.  Bank managers know about valuations in probate actions.  They are not that silly.  It is not at all correct to say that the personal property where the owner is registered as full owner subject to outstanding shares on intestacy in the land is confined to the land.  Now it will be one third of the assets plus one third of a non-ascertainable or a not readily ascertainable sum.  That is what the bank manager is up against. It is a much less valuable security in the case of the son than if he owned two thirds and the mother one third.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to appear as a legal lecturer, but the fact is that in the case of intestacy it is a one third share for the widow in regard to registered land and property.  What we seek to do is precisely the same in regard to the legal right as has been done since the initiation of the Registration of Title Act, 1891.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Behave yourself, please.  What we are bringing in here relates to the fact that, since 1891, 50 per cent of Irish properties have descended on intestacy.  The more I look at the law of succession the more I think that we are doing justice in the provision we are making regarding the one third share for the widow.  Fifty per cent of property <Col N="204" /> is at present being dealt with on intestacy.  The Land Registry deal with property on this basis in precisely the way I mentioned already, issue the folio to the person in possession of the land who has a limited interest, and if there are other interests they are registered as charges.  Precisely this approach will follow in the case of the legal right interest.  I can assure the Senator that there will be no legal difference between the approach of the Land Registry to intestate shares and the approach to legal right shares when this Bill becomes law.  They are in both cases a share of the assets of the estate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously if the one third legal share is not going to be realised straight away by selling the property and giving over the proceeds to the person the workable arrangement that will be made is that a fixed yearly sum being the produce of the one third will be paid over to the person holding the legal right share.  That has to be paid whether the legal right terminates or not.  Then when the legal right does not terminate, in other words in addition to having that charge to substitute the equivalent of that as well the owner of the two thirds is liable on the death of that person to pay the whole capital sum, unless it is willed to him, consequently you do not need to rise to any flights of either legal complications or mathematics or anything else.  The position of the person under the amendment proposed by Senator Cole is obviously stronger and more creditworthy, and he is more likely to make a success of the farm under the provisions of section 110.</P>

It is elementary that if that cannot be done it should be done and the Minister should have an immediate Bill to do that.  He should turn the attention of the law reform section to this.</P>

They are two entirely different types of estates and you cannot ever run them together in the one fashion.  A life tenant has certain rights.  A fee simple owner has certain rights.  You cannot run the two together.  You cannot have ownership registered in property where a life estate and full freehold reside at the same time.  That is just elementary law.  The Registrar of Titles, therefore, cannot register such a deal or arrangement and, in the absence of a land certificate issued by the Registrar of Titles, the person has no chance of raising funds for the development of his property.</P>

      <P>Agreed.  I do not intend to take up very much of the time of the House on these two amendments. Much of what could be said has been said already.  What I did try to do was to anticipate that the Minister would adopt the attitude which he has adopted, that he would not make any change whatever in section 110.  I felt that if he adopted that rigid attitude, perhaps, we might make a little addition to it that would not interfere unduly with the principle which he regards as sacrosanct.  The Minister has somewhat shaken my confidence in my legal knowledge this evening by having recourse to the Constitution. There was a time when I always read Bills with an eye to the Constitution because I felt that it was incumbent on the members of the Dáil and Seanad to have regard to its provisions so that no law shall be enacted which is repugnant to or inconsistent with any provisions thereof.  I felt that the duty lay upon us to do this, and, indeed, the courts have taken their decisions on the basis that the Legislature has had minute regard to the provisions of the Constitution, and they start off with the assumption that every Act of the Oireachtas is consistent with the Constitution unless its repugnancy is clearly established.  My faith in the Constitution has been somewhat shattered in recent times and I think that no Act we pass in relation to this particular measure will accord with the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Minister refers to Article 43 of the Constitution which deals with private property.  My amendment does not conflict with the provisions of that Article of the Constitution.  Further, the Article says:</P>
      <P>The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think what we are trying to do, and this was very rightly and very cogently stressed by Senator O'Reilly here, is in accordance with the principles of <Col N="207" /> social justice, having regard to the needs of widows and dependants and that takes into account the capacity of those who have a moral and legal obligation to look after those needs.  While I say my faith is somewhat shaken, I do not think the Supreme Court, which ultimately determines this kind of matter, would find that we are trying to make a proper provision in life for the widow of a man who dies with £5,000.  She should get all of that money.  If the man dies leaving £3,000 the widow should get all of this, whatever way he disposes of it.  The concluding portion of Article 43 of the Constitution is:</P>
    <P>The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>That, in another way, is what Senator O'Reilly was saying this evening and what we are trying to do for the common good.  That brings me to the first of my amendments which states:</P>
    <P>but in the case of a farm, the rateable valuation whereof does not exceed £20, she shall be absolutely entitled to the entire thereof together with all stock, crops, implements and machinery thereon.</P>
    <P>That was to give her the whole lot as a going concern.  If anybody suggests that a valuation of £20 would be too much for a widow to support a family, I am quite prepared to say that it should be lower.  When it is considered that there are so many farms with a valuation of under £10&mdash;there are about 120,000 in this country&mdash;it would not be reasonable to say that in the case of a farm where the husband, during his lifetime worked for the county council or Bord na Móna, which is the main source of livelihood to supplement the income from the small farms, that would be too much for the widow.  It was on that basis that I thought the Minister might accept the amendment.  Subsection (1) reads:</P>
    <P>If the testator leaves a spouse and no children, the spouse shall have a right to one-half of the estate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> I want to add to this that in the case of a farm of £20 valuation she would be entitled to the lot.</P>
    <P>I was trying to reconcile the position of the widow of a man who makes a will with that of a man who does not make a will.  Under the section, which deals with intestacy, the widow gets all of the man's estate, no matter what the valuation is.  In the case of small property in the shape of a farm of £20 valuation we should equate the position of the two widows, the one whose husband dies testate and gets the lot and the widow whose husband owns a small farm and dies intestate that she should get the lot.  I do not believe it would be wrong, constitutionally, to do that.  When we are making that provision for the small property owner we are doing what is in accordance with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>I am not wedded to confining this to a farm but one can take a small farm with a rateable valuation and look at that.  You can then refer it to other forms of property and an amendment could easily be brought in on Report Stage.  That is the position I would like to achieve in the case of a widow who has no children.  Under subsection (2) I want to make provision where there are children and to provide:</P>
    <P>but in the case of a farm, the rateable valuation whereof does not exceed £30, she shall be entitled to the entire thereof for her life or until the youngest child of the spouse shall attain the age of 21 years and upon the youngest child attaining such age the spouse shall then be entitled absolutely to one-third of the estate.</P>
    <P>My idea was that in the ordinary course of events it would be right that a spouse who would be father and mother should try to look after the children as long as possible, that she should be given the entire estate to prepare the children for life until the youngest child was catered for.  If that happened you would then give one third, which is her legal share, to the surviving spouse.  Although there is no provision in this legislation for a widow in the case of a man dying with <Col N="209" /> a widow and children the emphasis is on what the widow gets.  Every widow who has children has to look after them and we are not making any automatic provision in this Bill which gives a widow the assets out of which to provide not only for herself but also for her family.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 meets that situation where the widow is entitled to all the property.  I included a farm in the amendment in order to provide for property of particular value.  I say she should be entitled to all the property until the youngest child has reached 21 years and that at that stage she should be entitled to one third absolutely. We are not making any provision in this Bill for those widows and children.  We are making quite different provisions for widows and then we have provision for children under section 116.  I do not like that.</P>

      <P>What the Fine Gael Party did in the Dáil and what we do in this House are different things.  The Fine Gael Party in the Dáil went upon their own lines.  One of the criticisms of this House was that we merely trotted out and repeated the things done in the Dáil.  I think the purpose of this Chamber should be to take our own point of view on legislation. I suppose I did not have the facilities for reading the debate in the Dáil, but I did not read the debate in the Dáil. I think that when we read the debates in the Dáil it means that we have here a rehash of what was said in the Dáil, and I do not think that is the way to improve legislation.  I prefer to take a fresh approach, if it so happens that it is a fresh approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 116 merely gives a right to children who feel they have been deprived, or that they have not been properly done by, by their father in his will.  That could apply to adult children who are physically handicapped, or to adult children who are mentally handicapped.  The section is all right so far as it goes, but what I am concerned about is that there is <Col N="210" /> a unit which is quite clear and distinct in my mind, the unit of the widow and children.  There is no provision in section 110, or anywhere else in the Bill, for the unit of the widow and the children.  I say we ought to bestir ourselves and make such a provision for the widow and children.</P>
    <P>I am taking the case of a farm and saying that where the rateable valuation of a farm does not exceed £30, the widow and children should be entitled to the entire estate until the youngest child is over 21 years.  Someone may say that 21 years is too old, and that he should get out and work at 18 years. In that case I would say until the youngest child is provided for.  It would then revert to the legal share and the mother would get her one third share.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>The chief difficulty I see in these amendments is that the yardstick which Senator O'Quigley suggests should be used&mdash;£20 valuation and £30 valuation&mdash;is not the proper yardstick in the sense that £20 valuation in one county is not the same as £20 valuation in another county.  I do not mean that land in Meath is worth £2 and that it is worth 10/- somewhere else.  I mean that by the time&mdash;and this is brought out in the report of the Commission on Valuations&mdash;the valuations were completed, the measurements used had changed in value, with the result that the value of land is not the same in various parts of the country.  So, we cannot use valuations in one place as a yardstick, and then go into other property and use the <Col N="211" /> same yardstick in relation to it, in some as yet undefined way.  The Senator I think is probably exaggerating when he says it would be quite simple on Report Stage to bring in an amendment which would extend this type of yardstick to other property. I think there would be great difficulty, and as I do not agree that the valuation on land is the proper yardstick for the whole country, I would not agree with this amendment at all.</P>

      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the second amendment. I am against the first amendment because, as Senator Sheldon has pointed out, £20 valuation in one place is not the same as £20 valuation in another.  There is another aspect.  A £20 valuation farm could nowadays have very substantial outbuildings which were not valued at all.  There is very little limit to the amount of building which could go on where a farm was being intensified to produce pigs or chickens or something like that. They could be very important assets. I have great sympathy with what the Senator is trying to do in the second amendment.  In the case of a widow with many young children, one feels she should have the whole estate until the children are at least 21 years, or until they are capable of taking over. I take it the widow in that case would have an interest in the rest of the property, let it be real or personal. Would that not suffice if she has the whole of the estate for life?  Unless she is capable of managing the estate, I think it is useless to put it that way.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Quigley has put forward very cogent arguments and one cannot help sympathising to a great extent with the first amendment. A man may die and leave a widow with no family, and the estate may be so small that one half is not adequate to provide for her and give her a reasonable way of life for the rest of her days.  He is endeavouring to cover <Col N="212" /> that case by this amendment.  It does not, however, appear to me&mdash;and I think, perhaps, on reconsideration he may be disposed to agree with me&mdash; that it is practical for a few reasons. One is the reason already given by Senator Sheldon that we are adopting an uneven yardstick.  Senator O'Quigley would probably be the first to agree that all people must be equal before the law, but he is legislating specially for a farmer who leaves a widow with no family.</P>

      <P>I was saying that Senator O'Quigley will, I think, agree with me that one of the fundamental principles of jurisprudence is that all people must be equal before the Legislature and in relation to any Act of Parliament passed.  He is very properly endeavouring to provide against hard cases.  The difficulty I see is this.  A man dies and leaves a small shop from which there is a small income.  There is no provision there for that.  Will you take it on the average profits for some years and make provision in such a case or will you take it on the turnover?  Suppose a man dies and leaves a little house and money.  The money and the house may not be adequate to provide for the widow with no family.  He could have a little house and perhaps £1,000. What will you do in that case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way I see in which that could effectively be met, but unfortunately it has not commended itself to the House, is that if a man with no family dies and the widow can establish to a judge in chambers that half <Col N="213" /> the estate is not sufficient to provide for her, then the judge will have discretion in making for her such further provision out of the entire estate as he thinks fit.  That line of approach did not commend itself to the House.  I do not propose to go back on what has been said but I cannot see in what other way provision can be made.  If that can be done, then you would provide for the case and it may be a serious case and there may be very grave injustices done where a man dies and leaves a widow with no family.  If he leaves a widow and a family, the same problem does not arise at all because, by and large, most children in this country do follow the fourth commandment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said this afternoon, we have already met the case of the widow who stays on in a house the value of which is in excess of one-third or one-half of the estate, where she might be prejudiced by reason of being ejected from it.  We have decided to provide for that particular case.  I saw merits in that situation&mdash;the matter being brought to my attention by Senator Miss Davidson&mdash; that there was a danger of the widow, who had been living in the house all her life, being ejected if the value of the house was in excess of the one third.  We have dealt with that in an earlier amendment and I do not see any point in going much further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senator O'Quigley's amendment is very drastic in that the contends the whole lot should go to the widow. In my view, in this amendment, Senator O'Quigley tends to be riding two horses at the one time.  The earlier amendment sought to drive the widow into court to prove her share of any part of the estate and now you have a complete turnabout, a situation where you suggest that in any case of a farm under £20 valuation she shall be absolutely entitled to the entire. I think that that is going too far.  At the moment she is entitled to nothing. She can be cut off entirely.  We are taking a long step in improving her situation by giving her one-half the estate in the event of there being no issue.  That is as far as we should go <Col N="214" /> prudently having regard to the testamentary right of the individual.  In the case of property under £20 valuation you would have no testamentary rights, because, as the amendment stands, all the property would have to go to the widow and, therefore, the testator would have no right to dispose of even half of his property or leave it in any way he wished.  I think I can see the sentiment behind it, but it is going too far.</P>
    <P>We should preserve the middle course between extremes by going from a situation where the widow may be cut off entirely, which is the present one, to one where she is entitled to one half.  That is going far enough having regard to the fundamental rights which are set out in the Constitution. I think we would be in danger in providing for a situation which would cut off a man from any right of testamentary disposition.</P>
    <P>The second amendment is, in my view, a bit confusing, but I think I know what Senator O'Quigley is getting at.  I feel that it is already met in the Bill as it stands.  A widow with dependent children surviving her husband gets one-third absolutely.  Under section 116, in regard to the other two-thirds of the property, she can apply to the court on behalf of the children and become a trustee of the remaining two-thirds, so that, in effect, by virtue of section 110 and a court application under section 116 she can become absolute owner of one-third and trustee owner in regard to the balance, which I feel is the situation that Senator O'Quigley is trying to get at in his second amendment, where he suggests that she shall be entitled where there are dependent, children to the entire estate for life until the youngest reaches the age of 21 and thereafter to one third.</P>
    <P>It is a bit confusing in its drafting, but I think I am right in interpreting what the Senator is getting at as being met by what I have suggested, where the combined effects of section 110 and section 116 can give rise to this situation of trusteeship for two-thirds and an absolute right to one-third.  She can, in effect, manage the whole property <Col N="215" /> until the children come of age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get rid of one notion that the Minister has raised.  I am not trying to ride two horses.  My preference is to look at the situation as we find it and know it to be in this country, and the first amendment, No. 7, was designed to deal with that situation.  That is the way I would like to go after it, but I am realistic enough to see that you cannot have it that way, so I then tried to make the best of what I have got in the Bill, and that is where the second horse appears to come in.  I tried to amend what is here.  I do not like this section but I am trying to improve it within the limits of the principle enunciated in it and from which the Minister appears to be reluctant to move.  I am accepting the Minister on his own ground and trying to add something to make the section more favourable to the widow and children.</P>
      <P>The Minister earlier tonight conveyed the impression that he recoiled with horror from the idea of widows having to go to court in order to assert their rights.  This is where the Minister is riding two horses on this occasion, because he does not want the widow to go in looking for the one third for herself but he sees no objection in section 116 to making her go into court to look for property for her children if her husband did not look after them properly.</P>

      <P>What I am saying is that we should try to get rid of that in a great number of cases which would be covered by the £30 valuation and try to provide as nearly as possible to what is done by prudent fathers dealing with property and looking after their children.  What I am seeking in this amendment is to provide no more than what a prudent and affectionate father would provide in the vast majority of cases.  Such a father would arrange to give the whole lot to his wife for life or until the eldest child is 21, and that when the children are all done for then she gets the legal <Col N="216" /> right share to one third.  There does not seem to me to be anything revolutionary or wrong in that when we are providing for an entity which Senator O'Reilly correctly described as the basis of the society in which we live, the family.  There is no provision of the kind we ought to make in this Bill for the widow and children.</P>
      <P>As I have said, since we cannot have the first amendment, No. 7, then I think we ought to go this distance in relation to properties of this size and we ought not to put properties of this size to the expense of court applications. I would ask the Minister to consider this between now and the Report Stage.  I am not too concerned about amendment No. 9 because there might be some difficulty about the constitutionality of it, but I would have no doubt whatever as to the constitutionality of amendment No. 11.  I want to assure Senators Sheldon and Cole first of all that I am not in any way tying it to a farm.  This can apply to property of all kinds and it is for the Legislature to try to work out what is the appropriate sum.  That is not an impossible task.  The Legislature has already done this, as Senator Boland will remember on the Intestates Estates Act, 1954 where a distinction in relation to widows was made.  It was provided that the widow would get £4,000, I think, of the husband's property and then half the balance.  The Legislature did work out what was the kind of figure that should be fixed and I think Senator Boland was Minister for Justice at the time.  There was a fair amount of give and take in the Dáil, and, finally, £4,000 was fixed upon as the first cash sum the widow should have and then half the balance.  There is no difficulty either in cases of this kind in fixing in relation to personal estate what the sum should be or in relation to a farm. You can take whatever valuation you like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheldon was perturbed and troubled in his mind about the unevenness of valuations from county to county, but there is no other standard by which you can judge farms in this country and no other practicable standard.  If you are dealing with housing you deal with the rateable valuation, <Col N="217" /> and it is the same in the case of farms, though, of course, the farm in Meath of a valuation of £50 is immeasurably richer than a farm in Donegal or some other county with the same valuation.</P>
    <P>We have to be practical and accept the best standard available.  Senator Sheldon was not perturbed when section 6 was going through and he assented wholeheartedly to including the provision to give jurisdiction to the circuit court in relation to estates the rateable valuation of which exceeds £100.  It never perturbed him in that case.</P>
