      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to meet the intention expressed by the Seanad on the Report Stage here when the view was expressed, to which I acceded, that in the case of attempted murder there should be allowance to the effect that forgiveness might be made by the victim of the attempted murder and that such person should not be prevented from providing on his or her death for the person who committed the offence.  I sought to meet that on the Report Stage by the simple deletion of the words &ldquo;attempted murder&rdquo;. I thought at the time, and the Seanad thought also, that it would meet the point of view expressed as regards forgiveness.  In point of fact, in the event of the simple deletion of the words &ldquo;attempted murder&rdquo;, a situation would arise, in respect of a bequest made in a will prior to the attempted murder taking place, that that particular bequest would be allowed.  This would be completely contrary to public policy and it would not involve the element of forgiveness. In other words, a bequest in a will made prior to attempted murder would be allowable on the simple deletion of the words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amendment, which was passed in the Dáil, stands, the wording will make it quite clear that attempted murder is included, except in respect of a share arising under a will made <Col N="741" /> after the act constituting an offence. A person guilty of murder, attempted murder or manslaughter will not be entitled to a bequest under a will made prior to the crime; but, if the victim of the crime subsequently makes a will, he is now, under the suggested amendment, being allowed to forgive, as was the intention of the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill represents a further stage in the process of streamlining parliamentary financial procedures and adapting them to modern conditions. It seeks to improve the machinery of considering Government financial policy so as to ensure that the time devoted to this purpose may be put to the most effective use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the principal instruments of parliamentary financial control are: (1) the Vote on Account and subsequent Central Fund Bill; (2) the Budget and Finance Bill and (3) the Estimates and Appropriation Bill.  The first of these&mdash;the Vote on Account and Central Fund Bill&mdash;arises in the spring and has as its object the provision of sufficient funds to enable the supply services to be maintained until the end of July by which time the Dáil would have dealt with all the estimates.  The Vote on Account is debated, by the Dáil only, in February or early March when full information regarding overall policy is not normally available. The Government's expenditure and taxation proposals, together with up-to-date information regarding the state of the economy, are not known until the introduction of the Budget.  In the absence of this information, the Vote on Account debate in the Dáil <Col N="743" /> is, to a considerable extent, ineffective and tends to be repeated at Budget time.</P>
    <P>The Central Fund Bill, which gives statutory effect to the Vote on Account, is introduced in March and is the occasion of a general debate in this House on Government expenditure policy.  However, the effectiveness of this discussion also is impaired by the absence of the information normally published just before the Budget.</P>
    <P>The Budget, is not, of course, debated in the Seanad, but the Finance Bill, which gives statutory effect to the taxation proposals in the Budget, affords this House a further opportunity of debating financial policy. This Bill must be enacted by the beginning of August because, otherwise, taxes imposed at Budget time would cease to have effect.  While the Finance Bill is being debated, the individual Estimates for the supply services are considered by the Dáil and, as I have said, are disposed of by the end of July.  At that stage, the Appropriation Bill which gives statutory effect to the Estimates is introduced and must be enacted in early August.  This Bill affords the Seanad a further opportunity for a discussion of the expenditure policies of the Government.</P>
    <P>The present system of parliamentary financial control, which I have just outlined, is unsatisfactory in two respects. First, the effectiveness of the debates on the Vote on Account and Central Fund Bill is greatly reduced by the absence of full information regarding Government financial policy and the state of the economy in general.  It happens in practice that a great deal of the ground covered by these debates is again traversed during the debates on the Budget and Finance Bill when this information becomes available. This means that the earlier debates took up a considerable amount of valuable parliamentary time which could have been devoted to other purposes.</P>
    <P>The second disadvantage of the present system arises from the pressure of parliamentary business, particularly in the Dáil, in the summer session, because the Finance Bill, all the Estimates <Col N="744" /> and the Appropriation Bill must be disposed of before the end of July. This had led to complaints that the time available for consideration of the Finance Bill is unduly restricted.  The present Bill will enable Estimates to be debated in the autumn session thus relieving the congestion of financial business during the summer and facilitating consideration of the Finance Bill by the Dáil.  This in turn should leave the Seanad with more time to debate the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the present Bill, an annual Vote on Account and Central Fund will no longer be required. Instead, there will be a permanent authorisation for the issue of moneys from the Central Fund to maintain the supply services until the individual Estimates have been considered by the Dáil.  The amount to be issued will be sufficient to maintain the supply services until December.  The Appropriation Bill will be introduced, as hitherto, when all the Estimates have been dealt with by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the present Bill provides that the Minister for Finance shall be authorised to issue from the Central Fund, in any year from 1966-67 onwards, an amount not exceeding four-fifths of the amount appropriated for each particular service in the preceding financial year.  Section 3 requires that this four-fifths provision be adjusted according as individual Estimates are passed by the Dáil.  Thus, if the amount of an Estimate exceeds four-fifths of the amount appropriated for the same service in the preceding year, the amount authorised to be issued under section 2 of the Bill will be increased by the amount of the excess when the particular Estimate is passed by the Dáil.  Similarly, if an Estimate is less than four-fifths of the previous year's appropriation, the issues authorised under section 2 will be reduced.</P>
    <P>Section 4 covers issues in respect of new services which were not included in the Appropriation Act of the preceding year, together with existing services for which the Estimates may have been passed by the Dáil before the commencement of the financial year to which they relate.  These latter <Col N="745" /> would be Estimates which were passed by the Dáil in accordance with the revised procedure, introduced in 1964, whereby selected Estimates may be taken before the Estimates volume is published.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that, in March of each year, the Minister for Finance will lay before the Dáil a statement of the amounts he will be authorised to issue in the following financial year under sections 2 and 4 of the Bill.  This statement will be in substitution for the present Vote on Account White Paper.  It is intended to present the statement to the Seanad as was done in the case of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is a transitional provision designed to cover the change-over from the old to the new system.  It provides for the issue of moneys in respect of Estimates passed by the Dáil in the current year between the enactment of the Appropriation Act, 1965, and 31st March, 1966.  Issues in respect of Estimates passed after that date will be covered by sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 gives the Minister the borrowing powers hitherto granted each year in the annual Central Fund Act. Section 8 provides that, for the purpose of determining the amount the Minister is authorised to borrow under any Act, amounts which have been repaid within 12 months after the date on which they are borrowed shall be disregarded. The need for this arises from the fact that some short-term borrowing takes the form of Exchequer Bills which are repaid and renewed every three months.  At present, such borrowings are regarded as cumulative and the statutory limit could be reached merely because they were renewed.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to remedy difficulties and defects which have arisen under the present procedures, without lessening the degree of parliamentary control over expenditure on the Supply Services.  I realise, of course, that most of these difficulties arise in relation to the Business of the Dáil rather than of this House although, as I mentioned earlier, the Seanad debate on the <Col N="746" /> annual Central Fund Bill, like the Dáil debate on the Vote on Account, takes place under conditions which are not conducive to fully informed discussion.</P>
    <P>Members of this House may consider that their opportunities of discussing expenditure on the supply services will be curtailed with the disappearance of the debate on the annual Central Fund Bill which would, of course, correspond to the disappearance of the Dáil debate on the annual Vote on Account.  If the House so wishes, however, this point could be met by broadening the scope of the debate on the Finance Bill so as to include such expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which the Minister is proposing to us this afternoon can be viewed from many aspects.  I think there are three particular aspects that are most important. Firstly, we can look at this Bill from the point of view of the general arrangements for public finance in this State.  We can look at the Bill from the point of view of the organisation of financial business in Dáil Éireann or we can look at the Bill from the point of view of the organisation of financial debate in Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>In discussing the Bill in Seanad Éireann it is natural that we should concentrate on the first and the third of these&mdash;the effect of the Bill on the general arrangements for public finance and its effect on the proceedings of Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>It is the practice in all democratic countries that the greater part of central government expenditure should be the subject of an annual Vote.  This is something which happens in all democratic countries.  A quick glance at our current Book of Estimates indicates that in this country 70 per cent of Government expenditure, both capital and current, is voted annually, the remaining 30 per cent being standing charges which are not considered by the Dáil and the Seanad in each individual year.  It is with this 70 per cent, these voted services or Supply Services, that we are concerned in the Bill today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also the practice of all democratic countries that these voted <Col N="747" /> moneys should be the subject of a very careful scrutiny by one or other of the Houses of Parliament.  Adequate control of this voted money implies such substantial discussion. Indeed, the Bill before us today arises largely because Dáil Éireann has found that four or five months is not a sufficient length of Parliamentary time for the adequate discussion of those voted services because all this discussion must take place, it is necessary in some way or another to make temporary provision during the early part of the financial year for the Government to carry on the services pending their final approval and final appropriation by Parliament.</P>
    <P>There are three ways in which this is normally done.  Some countries adopt the procedure of just allowing the Government to carry on, and then finally passing the appropriations for the voted services.  This is the practice in some Scandinavian countries.  The second way of tackling the problem is to allow the Government to carry on, not with complete freedom but on the basis of the Estimates for the financial year that is passing and nearly spent. This is the practice in Switzerland and many other continental countries.  The third way of tackling this particular problem is for Parliament to pass a provision making available a sum of money on a temporary basis by means of what is traditionally called a Vote on Account, a system which we in this country took over from Britain and have operated up to now.</P>
    <P>The Minister has described for us in his speech recommending this Bill the system which we follow&mdash;the Vote on Account and the accompanying Central Fund Bill &mdash; which give the Government four months' supply of money until the passing of the Appropriation Bill sometime before the first week of August, when this temporary supply would run out.  It has happened, as the Minister has described, that Dáil Éireann has found these four months insufficient.  They have tried to meet it in recent years by various devices.  They have tried to meet it by starting to debate the Estimates before <Col N="748" /> the Book of Estimates was out.  They have resorted to the device of debating the Estimates on token Votes after the Estimates had actually been legally passed.  These temporary measures the Dáil now considers, by the passage of the present Bill, to be undesirable expedients which would be better replaced by some more rational permanent procedure.  Accordingly, the Minister comes to us now with this Bill, which has passed through Dáil Éireann, and which empowers the Government to spend up to four-fifths of the old year's Estimate instead of the present one-third of the New Year's Estimates.  The Bill also, in contrast to the old Central Fund Bill which merely granted a lump sum, appropriates these provisional Estimates to the several services and makes provision for the amount of provisional supply to be adjusted as the Estimates are passed.</P>
    <P>These things are all desirable and, I think, will be accepted by the Seanad without very much debate.  But, the Bill goes further.  The Bill not only increases the amount of supply from one-third to four-fifths, not only introduces detailed procedure for doing this, but goes on to make this a permanent provision.  The Bill not only alters the nature of the supply which is given but, in doing so, abolishes the annual nature of the Vote on Account, the annual nature of the Central Fund Bill.  Accordingly, because this involves the removal from the Seanad calendar of events the debate on the Central Fund Bill, it is something which should be carefully examined by Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>In this examination we want to be quite clear about what the role of the Seanad is in matters like these.  There is no difficulty in getting headlines to guide us in regard to the relevant roles of the Government, the Dáil, and the Seanad in monetary matters because these are actually laid down in our fundamental law, they are actually spelled out in the Constitution, Article 17 of which lays down quite clearly that the right of initiative in regard to financial legislation rests with the Government, and the Government alone.  It is only on the basis <Col N="749" /> of a message signed by the Taoiseach that the Dáil can proceed to discuss financial matters.  So here we have clearly the right of initiative belonging to the Government alone.  It is equally clear in Articles 17 and 21 of the Constitution that the right of decision on financial matters belongs to the Dáil alone, not to the Government, not to the Seanad but to the Dáil. It is made clear, in that Money Bills can only be initiated in the Dáil, that the Seanad can only make recommendations on Money Bills, in contradistinction to other Bills where the Seanad make amendments.</P>
    <P>It is also embedded in the Constitution that the Seanad has only 21 days to deal with Money Bills, as against 90 days in regard to other Bills.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is also clearly spelled out in the Constitution that the Seanad has rights in regard to financial matters, these rights being the right of review and the right of making recommendations to the Dáil, because the Articles of the Constitution that limit the power of the Seanad to make decisions in regard to Money Bills also give it a specific right in that the Constitution lays down that every Money Bill must be sent from the Dáil to the Seanad for its recommendations.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we should be quite clear that while the right of the Seanad in these matters is a subordinate right and while the role of the Seanad in these matters is a distinctly smaller role than that of the Government or the Dáil, nevertheless, this is a basic constitutional right.  The Seanad has not only the right but it has at all times the power conferred on it by the Constitution to deal with the Money Bills sent to it and to deal with them not as things which have to be automatically approved of by the Seanad, not to deal with them as a matter of routine business needing only a rubber stamp, but the Seanad has a constitutional duty to examine all Money Bills with great care with its own particular expertise from the point of view of the collective wisdom of this Seanad in the general public <Col N="750" /> interest.  This is something which is true of all Money Bills and, of course, it is true of this particular Money Bill which is before us today.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill to us today the Minister has adduced several arguments.  He told us, in his opening address, that this Bill &ldquo;seeks to improve the machinery for considering Government financial policy so as to ensure that the time devoted to this purpose may be put to the most effective use&rdquo;.  The Seanad, I am sure, will be eager to help the Minister in this particular respect.  In debating this Bill, it is for the Seanad to discuss its provisions from the point of view of ensuring that the time devoted to the purpose of considering Government financial policy in the Seanad will be put to the most effective use.</P>
    <P>In proposing the Bill to us the Minister has indicated that there are two grounds for criticism of the present arrangements for the conduct of financial business in Parliament.  The first of these grounds is that &ldquo;the effectiveness of the debates on the Vote on Account and the Central Fund Bill are greatly reduced by the absence of full information regarding Government financial policy and the state of the economy in general&rdquo;.  The second disadvantage the Minister quotes is that which &ldquo;arises from the pressure of Parliamentary financial business, particularly in the Dáil in the summer session because the Finance Bill, all the Estimates and the Appropriation Bill must be disposed of before the end of July&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said and proposed to us there are&mdash;and here I agree with the Minister&mdash;two main faults in the present procedure.  Firstly, there is the fault the Minister has put forward of the duplication of debate and the holding of debates at a time which, in the Minister's opinion, does not allow for effective debate.  Secondly, there is the fault that the Central Fund Bills passed up to this allowed for only four months' supply, which meant that a tremendous amount of work had to be crowded into the four months between April and July.  The Minister proposes two <Col N="751" /> remedies.  The remedies he proposes are to increase the amount of supply from one-third to four-fifths and also to make the Central Fund Bill a permanent measure.</P>
    <P>I would suggest there are two faults and there are two remedies but I would like to distinguish between them carefully. I would like to suggest that a very large measure of what is unsatisfactory about the present financial arrangements, both in the Dáil and Seanad, could be met by a revised type of Central Fund Bill which increased supply, without necessarily making that a permanent provision.  There is a double onus on the Minister if he is to convince the Seanad of the wisdom of what he is doing here.  He must prove it is necessary to increase the amount of supply from one-third to four-fifths of the year.  Beyond and above that, which I think will be a relatively easy task, he must also convince the Seanad that the exigencies of public business in both Houses demand not only that the supply should be increased but that the principle of annuality should be lost in regard to the temporary grant of supply and that what is needed is a permanent rather than a temporary measure.</P>
    <P>To deal first with this question of the extended amount of supply, the position that arises at the moment due to the restriction in temporary supply to four months is that the Dáil finds that it cannot complete its work on the Estimate by the end of July.  This not only hampers the Dáil in its conduct of financial business but also distinctly hampers the Seanad in its review of financial resolutions sent to it by the Dáil and in the conduct of its own debates on financial policy. The result of the fact that the Dáil cannot complete the Estimates in time leads to creating, as the Minister said, during the summer session the circumstances recurring year after year whereby the Seanad has received the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill very close together.  These two Bills, one dealing with taxation and revenue and the other with expenditure and matters of administration, come <Col N="752" /> into the Seanad one on the heels of the other.  Indeed, as the Minister will recall, in the year in which we still are these two Bills were discussed by the Seanad in a single debate.  The relatively short four month term of temporary supply disturbs not only the business of the Dáil but also that of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Dáil has considered this matter, and has considered that it prefers to extend the period of temporary supply of money to what is in the present Bill rather than to curtail discussion of the Estimates.  This, of course, is a matter essentially for decision by the Dáil, but it is quite appropriate here to say that in my opinion it was a wise decision of the Dáil to extend the period rather than to curtail the discussions.  It is one that will be welcomed by the Seanad, because it will also solve the recurrent problem that the Seanad is faced by the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill both coming to it in July, the Finance Bill frequently coming too late to be discussed with effect and too late to be amended to any effect due to the fact that it has frequently been discussed here in the Seanad when the Dáil has already adjourned.  These are problems which will be solved under the present Bill.  The Appropriation Bill will no longer come to us in July.  It will come around November or December, at the end of the year and this, indeed, is something which the Seanad will most heartily welcome.</P>
    <P>In reference to this question of the timing of these Bills I should like to ask the Minister a question.  Am I right in understanding that there still is an obligation that the Finance Bill will have to be dealt with within four months of the Budget resolutions?  As I understand it the position at the moment is that under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act of 1927 there are certain time limits after which Budget resolutions passed by the Dáil cease to have any statutory effect.  I would like to ask the Minister if it is his intention to leave the law un-amended in this particular State.  Why I raise the matter is this: if the Minister finds it feasible to bring his <Col N="753" /> Budget in somewhat earlier in the year there might be some advantage in extending the period in which these resolutions have statutory force from four to six months.  In the general work of introducing more flexibility into the working of financial business both in the Dáil and in the Seanad this is a point to which the Minister might well turn his attention.  There is, as I say, very little reason for the Seanad to disagree with the proposal that the Minister is making to extend the supply period.</P>
    <P>However, when we turn to the question of the Minister's proposals to make the provisions of this particular Bill permanent provisions, this is a matter on which agreement will be much less ready.  I feel that this is a distinct point.  The Minister is asking the House to agree to two distinct things in regard to the amount of supply and in regard to the question of a permanent measure.  If the Minister had brought in an annual Bill incorporating the principles of the present Bill and had merely left out in the relevant sections the phrase &ldquo;in every subsequent financial year&rdquo; the Bill would, indeed, have got a very ready and hearty endorsement from the Seanad.  But in making the measure a permanent one, the Minister has brought in a Bill which in this respect may well benefit the Dáil but certainly will not benefit the Seanad, and this I think is where the nub of the debate on this measure in the Seanad should come.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the financial debates of the Dáil and of the Seanad and contrast the position in those two Houses.  The Seanad devotes far less time to financial debates than does the Dáil.  On matters of general expenditure the Seanad at the moment debates these matters once a year on the Central Fund Bill.  In a sense it is true, as the Minister has said, that this corresponds to the debate which occurs over a much longer period in the Dáil on the Vote on Account.  As Deputy Corish mentioned in discussing this measure when it was going through the Dáil, the Vote on Account is not the only occasion on which the Dáil <Col N="754" /> discusses general expenditure and general financial policy from the expenditure point of view.  These matters are frequently topics of the two-day adjournment debates which occur in the Dáil before the close of the sessions.  They also, of course, frequently form the larger part of the discussion which takes place on the question of the general policy of the Government on the Taoiseach's Estimate. Thus in the Dáil there tend to be several occasions on which general expenditure is discussed as against a single occasion in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>On the matters of detailed expenditure, these are discussed once a year in Seanad Éireann when the Appropriation Bill comes to us at the end of the year.  Very often, and I would say most often, the Appropriation Bill comes to the Seanad after the Dáil has adjourned.  To this single Seanad debate of two days there correspond discussions in the Dáil on the Departmental Estimates, discussions which up to now have taken five months of Parliamentary time and which under the present Bill will occupy up to ten months of the year.  The Bill is before us because the Dáil has not found these five months adequate to discuss matters of detailed expenditure, so that against very many opportunities in the Dáil to discuss these particular matters we have one single debate in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We turn to the other side of the ledger to look at the question of taxation and Government income, and we find once again a single occasion for debate here in Seanad Éireann on the Finance Bill when it comes to us.  In the Dáil we have a lengthy discussion on the Budget resolutions&mdash;particularly on the general Budget resolutions&mdash; followed by a lengthy debate on the Finance Bill.  It is clear then that it is hardly fair to talk as if as a result of this measure both Houses would be, as it were, giving up the same thing.  It may be that in absolute terms one can speak of the Seanad giving up one debate on the Central Fund Bill and the Dáil giving up one Debate on the Vote on Account, but if we look at the total amount of time devoted to financial <Col N="755" /> business in both Houses we realise that the giving up of one single debate by the Seanad has a much more severe effect on the allocation of its time for financial business than the elimination of one debate in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated, and the Dáil appears to agree with him, that there is little harm done in eliminating the Vote on Account debate in the Dáil because this debate has apparently been duplicated by other debates. The Minister seems to feel&mdash;Deputies in Dáil Éireann made no objection to this &mdash; that this was an ineffective debate and that it was impossible to have an effective debate in the Dáil on financial policy in February or March.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the situation is the same in Seanad Éireann.  I do not agree, and I do not think the majority of Senators will agree, that debates which have been held here on the Central Fund Bill from year to year, have been ineffective or uninformed debates.  I think the Minister would have a good case, which could easily persuade the Seanad to allow the Central Fund Bill to disappear and the debate on it to disappear with it, if he could show that the debates in the Seanad have been ineffective or uninformed or debates which have been poorly supported by the members of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I believe the Seanad will agree with me that this debate has always ranked of the nature of an event in the Seanad's calendar.  It has always been a two-day debate and the number of speakers offering has always been so great that later speakers are inevitably curtailed in their freedom of speech by the necessity to close the debate at the end of two days.  Indeed, I can recall only one occasion on which the debate did not last two days and that was in the present financial year when many of the members of the House were physically engaged elsewhere, it being polling day in the mid-Cork by-election, while the others who attended in the Seanad had their thoughts elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Central Fund discussion in the Seanad can be defended on the ground <Col N="756" /> of a high standard of debate down through the years.  It has been of interest, not only to members of the House, but to others outside who are interested in having the views of the Seanad as a whole, and of individual Senators, on general Government policy at the particular time of the year.  I do not think it can be said that it has been an ineffective debate and I do not agree with the Minister when he says it is not possible to have an effective debate in February or March on general financial policy.  I do not agree with him when he says it is essential to be provided with the Book of Estimates, the economic statistics and the Budget proposals to have an effective economic debate.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the proof of this is the fact that the Seanad has had effective economic debates in February and March and that a great deal of information is available for effective financial debate at this time of the year.  It may be that the official Government estimate in regard to the national income for the previous calendar year is not yet available to the House but the estimate made by the Central Bank for the national income of the previous calendar year is available well before March.  I doubt if the Minister can point to any year in which there was a difference between the estimate of the Central Bank and the final official figure which would make any difference to a financial debate.  The general economic statistics for the calendar year are available by March and, considering that our national income accounts and also our social accounts, are based on the calendar, rather than the financial year, there is, I think, an advantage rather than a disadvantage, in having a debate at this time, which could be looked at from the national income and expenditure point of view. Indeed, this has been the theme of many good Central Fund debates in this House.</P>
    <P>There is the further point that the Minister, in framing his Budget statement, goes to a great deal of trouble to consult various interests about what their views are before he takes his last look at the economic situation and <Col N="757" /> makes up his mind what will be the Government's financial policy for the ensuing financial year.  I see no reason why the Minister should not continue to consult, in open forum, Seanad Éireann, and have the benefit of the collective wisdom of the Seanad and the individual wisdom of Senators as well as having the recommendations of those other people who have, perhaps, more private interests to look after in regard to the Minister's proposals in his following Budget.</P>
    <P>If this debate is to go, as the Minister suggests, what then is to be done? I consider the Minister is being unduly glib in saying: &ldquo;Yes, there are three debates now.  These can easily be telescoped into two.  It is quite easy to unite this debate with the debate on the Finance Bill, everything will be all right and Senators may, indeed, be better off than before&rdquo;.  I do not think this is so.  I consider the Minister could have brought in a splendid Bill which would have cleared up most of the difficulty about the Central Fund Bill and still keeps it as an annual Bill.  I am realistic, and I do not think there is any great hope of persuading the Minister, at this stage, to revert to the idea of an annual Central Fund Bill.  If it does not suit the Dáil to have a debate in March, this is no compelling reason why the Seanad should be forced to telescope two of its major financial debates into one.</P>
    <P>The Seanad would have the option of combining the present Central Fund Bill either with the Finance Bill or with the Appropriation Bill.  If we attempt to combine it with the Finance Bill we will find ourselves in some degree of trouble.  We already have in the Finance Bill, even without going into the details of the proposals of every year's particular Finance Bill, enough to discuss here on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill.  We have to consider, every time the Finance Bill comes up to us here, the general problem of the burden of taxation.  We have to see also what are the different taxes which the Minister has proposed in his Budget speech, which is not debated in this House.  We have to examine these proposals to see what is their effect on the <Col N="758" /> allocation of resources; we have to examine the Minister's proposals for certain types of taxes in regard to their effect on different individuals and organisations; we have also to discuss the details of the individual taxes he is proposing.  I think there is enough material here for a two-day debate on Second Reading without bringing in the whole question of the expenditure side and without bringing in the whole question of general Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>I believe we may well be in difficulties here and we may have inadequate debate if we attempt to combine this in this fashion.  This may well defeat the very object of the present Bill. The Minister has said the object of the Bill is to streamline proceedings, to get a more effective discussion and to get the best use out of parliamentary time which is being devoted to financial matters.  I think, indeed, this very purpose might well be defeated if we attempted to combine these things in one debate.</P>
    <P>Let us see what could well happen if we attempted to combine the present debate on the Central Fund Bill with the debate on the Appropriation Bill.  I think that here again we are getting two broad subjects mixed up together. At the moment the Seanad discusses general Government expenditure and general Government policy on the Central Fund Bill.  It discusses details on the Appropriation Bill.  It has to discuss on the Appropriation Bill all the details which the Dáil takes between five and ten months to discuss on the Departmental Estimates.  The Seanad would then be faced with the problem of having to debate both the question of general expenditure and the question of detailed expenditure in the one debate. This would be unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Dáil itself, I think, recognises the fact that you must make a distinction between detailed Estimates and general Government expenditure.  When it comes to the end of the Departmental Estimates and is faced with the Taoiseach's Estimate, what does the Dáil do?  The Dáil on the Taoiseach's Estimate <Col N="759" /> does not spend the time allocated to it discussing the operations of the Central Statistics Office, which could be a fruitful subject for debate.  The Dáil does not spend its time on the Taoiseach's Estimate discussing the operations of the Government Information Bureau, which could well be a fruitful subject for debate.  It discusses Departmental Estimates for months, and then decides there is need for a debate to deal with the broader issues, the Departmental issues having been dealt with, and the Dáil then does that on the Taoiseach's Estimate.  The Dáil can do that on the Taoiseach's Estimate but, if this present proposal goes through, the Seanad will be asked to do both of these things in the one debate, a thing the Dáil itself is not prepared to do.</P>
    <P>If we look to the practice in other countries we find the same sort of thing.  We need look no further than to Britain because, of course, it is the one which is closest to our own institutions. We find that the British practice is to distinguish quite clearly between a discussion on the Estimates from a general policy point of view, and a discussion on the Estimates from the point of view of detail.  So much so, that the Estimates Committees to which the selected British Estimates are sent&mdash;and the reports of the Estimates Committees are published and are of great value to anyone trying to understand how the Departments operate&mdash;are absolutely precluded from discussing general policy.  These Estimates Committees are concerned only with the details of expenditure.  They are concerned only with the question of whether value is being got for the money which is being spent.  The question of policy is outside their ambit.</P>
    <P>I think we will run into very severe difficulties if we try to telescope three debates into two, no matter how we try to do it.  I submit to the House that a separate debate on general financial policy, a debate on general expenditure policy is necessary.  Indeed, I think we should have those debates and that in the future as well as in the past March would be a suitable time for such debates. <Col N="760" /> In the future we will have the Finance Bill in June, I hope, and not in July as happened in the past.  I hope that when the Minister talks of freeing parliamentary time that this is not a vain aspiration and that we will get the Finance Bill in good time.  I hope we will get it in June and that we will get the Appropriation Bill in November or December.  I think this House can contribute a great deal to the public discussion on financial policy by also having a debate in March.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to meet the House in this regard, and I ask him specifically to meet the House in this regard by agreeing that the statement which under section 5 of this Bill he will present to the Dáil every March, in regard to the amount of temporary supply to which he is entitled, will also be laid before the Seanad.  I ask the Minister specifically to agree to come to this House for a two-day debate after that statement has been tabled.  The Seanad will have something to offer the public and something to offer the Minister by having a two-day debate on general financial policy at that time.</P>
    <P>To summarise then my attitude on this Bill.  I should distinguish between the two purposes of the Bill: the extension of the time of temporary supply, and the making permanent of the Central Fund Bill.  The extension of the period on temporary supply will, I think, be heartily welcomed by the Seanad as a help in solving some of its difficulties as well as those of the Dáil.  In regard to the way in which this is done, I think it is better to leave the details to be discussed on Committee Stage and to concentrate on discussing the broader points during the Second Stage debate. I believe the making of this as a permanent Bill will rob the Seanad of a major debate and that no case has been made that this is desirable in the public interest.  I believe some provision should be made for a two-day debate in March, and I think if the Minister would meet the Seanad in this respect the Seanad would endeavour to provide, and would succeed <Col N="761" /> in providing, what the Minister is looking for in this Bill&mdash;informed and effective discussion on Government financial policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief because I gather that there seems to be a great deal of agreement between the Parties on this measure so far as the other House is concerned.  After all, when it comes to a question of finance, I think the other Chamber, whether we like it or not, is the more important body in matters of that nature.  Senator Dooge has suggested that this measure might well benefit the Dáil but not the Seanad.  When I consider it, I believe it will benefit neither the Dáil nor the Seanad.  In fact, it is designed to do away with democratic procedures so far as the control exercised by the public in financial matters is concerned.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks the Minister said:</P>
      <P>This Bill represents a further stage in the process of streamlining parliamentary procedures and adapting them to modern conditions.</P>
      <P>At the end of his statement he said:</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed to remedy difficulties and defects which have arisen under the present procedures without lessening the degree of parliamentary control over expenditure on the supply services.</P>
      <P>Let me say that that second statement does not bear examination.  It is not accurate in my opinion.  Prior to this measure coming into the House, I had discussions about it, and I argued it on its merits with other people who, I regret to say, took the side of the Minister, the Department and the Government on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Taoiseach's mind.  When I say that, I feel I know his mind so far as the Seanad is concerned, and the Dáil.  I think he is a man who does not like to be delayed after he has made any decisions.  I can sympathise with him, at times, in his anxiety to get things done, but I feel there must be an understanding of what the Taoiseach has in mind, and an understanding of what proposals he has <Col N="762" /> in mind.  I believe both Houses are there for the purpose of enlightening the public with regard to what is taking place, and also to force the Taoiseach to let the public know, through both Houses, what he has in mind.</P>
    <P>It can be said that up to the present there has been a great deal of repetition in the Dáil when financial matters are discussed, but if that is so, is this the proper way to end that boring repetition which may be taking place? We can see the analogy here of using a sledgehammer to kill a fly.  We are anxious to avoid repetition and to get over the difficulty of cramming in three major financial matters between March and July.  In order to achieve both of these objectives, we alter the entire set-up as far as financial control is exercised in both Houses.  It is one of the most revolutionary changes thought up in years in relation to the decisions that can be exercised by the elected representatives of the public.</P>
    <P>Up to this, in the early part of the year or in the latter part of the previous year, a discussion took place on the Vote on Account.  We are now told that that discussion was in fact incomplete and ineffective because full information on future expenditure, and so on, was not available when the discussion took place.  That Vote on Account was to give authority to carry on Government services for a period of four months.  I figure that the amount involved was one-third of the total estimated expenditure.  That situation is to be remedied at this stage by eliminating the Vote on Account and giving the Minister power to issue four-fifths of the total amount laid out or appropriated in the previous year's issue.  We are now giving the Minister power to issue four-fifths without any discussion when, up to the present day, the most that could be issued was one third of the total amount involved and a discussion would take place, over a period of two or three weeks, before that amount was sanctioned by the House.</P>
    <P>The main reasons put forward for that revolutionary change are that repetition took place, that the discussion itself was incomplete, that the <Col N="763" /> same type of discussion took place later on in the Budget and on the Appropriation Bill.  That is a very serious change to make and it is especially serious in the light of one of the points put forward by Senator Dooge that the change is not an experimental one but will go into the form of permanent legislation.  We are not prepared to say that this system has worked for 40 years and that, if we are to alter it, we should do so by degrees and see what improvements we can bring in.  Instead of that, a revolutionary change on a permanent basis is insisted upon by the Government. That is a major criticism of this Bill.  If the Government were so anxious about adapting procedures in both Houses to modern conditions, they might have taken a first step and a second step and a third step and improved the situation a lot, without taking away the powers of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, as, in my opinion at any rate, they are doing under this measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that all the discussion on the Finance Bill, the Estimates and the Appropriation Bill must be finished by the end of July. That has been the position up to the present.  One of the arguments put forward is that we have repetition, and so on, in the various speeches made during that period.  There is no question or doubt that that is a crowded session but I think the Minister will agree with me that one of the reasons it is crowded, apart from the repetition, is that much legislation is introduced in that session that could well be introduced in the autumn or at some other time of the year.</P>
    <P>I was often present when legislation was discussed in Dáil Éireann.  Perhaps two hours were given one evening to a new Bill and then, the following day, a further two hours and in between, Estimates were brought in.  I believe that that is bad planning on the part of the Government. After all, they have a good idea of the position when the draftsmen are finished with a particular Bill that is to come before the House.  It is a fair <Col N="764" /> criticism of the Government to say that very often legislation which has nothing to do with the financial matters we are discussing here&mdash;the Estimates, the Finance Bill or the Appropriation Bill&mdash;is introduced during the period these matters should be discussed for the purpose only of upsetting the apple cart as far as the Opposition are concerned. It is a matter of tactics as to how to utilise the time available in the Lower House.  It was good tactics on the part of the Government to introduce other matters at that time, thereby reducing the amount of time available for the discussion of the Appropriation Bill and the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Without this drastic alteration in legislation, the Government could have done two things.  Firstly I would agree personally with the idea of a token discussion of perhaps a day on the Vote on Account which would then give very valuable time to spare for other very important matters.  Secondly, in the period from April to July, only in very exceptional circumstances should proposals for legislation, outside what are referred to here, be introduced for discussion in the Lower House.  If these two steps were taken, I feel it would not be necessary to introduce the changes that are being made here.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that at the present time people are critical of Dáil Éireann and its powers to influence legislation one way or the other.  There is a genuine feeling of, shall we say, frustration amongst the public that Dáil Éireann is becoming a rubber stamp or that the Houses of the Oireachtas are becoming a rubber stamp as far as legislation is concerned.  This legislation will put the stamp fully on that: it will confirm the public's view on the Dáil and on the Seanad because now the Minister can, without consultation with the Dáil, issue four-fifths of the amount of money laid out in the previous year's appropriations.  When we bring it down to brass tacks, it means that the Dáil and the Seanad are empowered to discuss and criticise only one-fifth of the amount that is to be spent in the following 12 months.  In both Houses, we shall be dealing with a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> I suggest to the Minister that we have a very useful body, composed of both groups, I think, known as the Committee of Public Accounts which, to my mind, is a watchdog on expenditure. My big criticism that could be levelled at the workings of this body is that it functions only when the damage has been done.  It can criticise only what has taken place.  I do not want to be unfair altogether&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I can see a great comparison between the Committee of Public Accounts and both Houses now.  One or the other, to my mind, is surplus.  If you say you have power to deal with or criticise one-fifth of the amount of expenditure to be allocated, that would be the great difference between the powers exercised by the Committee of Public Accounts and Dáil and Seanad Éireann.  I feel, for the sake of the few weeks involved and that is all it amounts to, the Government could have produced a far better measure without impinging on the democratic rights of the elected representatives here in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In page 2 of the Minister's address he states:</P>
      <P>The present system of parliamentary financial control which I have just outlined is unsatisfactory in two respects.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear.  We know of the two respects the Minister refers to.  Firstly, there is the repetition, the ineffectiveness&mdash;according to the Minister&mdash;of the debates on the Vote on Account and the Central Fund Bill.  Secondly, there is the overcrowding of that period in the summer session with discussion on the Estimates, the Appropriation Bill and the Finance Bill.  The Minister's argument is that that system is unsatisfactory and that the parliamentary control is not as it should be.  The fact is, whether it is satisfactory or not, Parliament did exercise control before the money was expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this new system it is proposed by the Minister that Parliament will not exercise control except over one-fifth of what is to be expended.  The Minister <Col N="766" /> has power, without any discussion in Dáil Éireann, to go ahead and sanction expenditure of four-fifths of the amount involved without discussion. To my mind, this measure lessens rather than increases parliamentary control.  I do not argue here from the point of view of trying to put the clock back or trying to suggest that the Government should be thwarted in whatever steps they are taking to speed up progress and to bring in good legislation for the benefit of the community. But, there are governments which are enabled to bring in legislation, governments which are streamlined already in other countries, who do not bother at all discussing with the public their proposals or their legislation. This measure resembles very much that type of mentality.  I am referring to those countries who do not believe in a democratic process.  This measure is moving into the category of those people who feel the less the public know about this and the less time we take about discussing it the better&mdash;we at the top know it all and let us use the Dáil and the Seanad as a rubber stamp.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which gives to the Seanad something in the nature of a bout of nerves.  We do not know what we will get in return for what we are giving, or being asked to give, under this Bill.  The Seanad, up to the present time, has been the subject of a great deal of criticism, sometimes justifiable criticism, because of its failure to fulfil its functions as a House of Parliament.  In great measure, let it be said that that failure is attributable directly to the Government. The reason it is attributable to the Government is that the Seanad, in the ordinary course of events, can only meet to enact the legislation which is proposed to it by the Government. We have had here time and again&mdash; and the Minister was one time Minister in charge of a Bill which enacted legislation when he said: &ldquo;I know it is wrong but what can we do about it?  The Dáil has risen&rdquo;&mdash;to enact legislation which was not as satisfactory as it could have been made if sufficient opportunity were given to the <Col N="767" /> Seanad to deal with it properly.</P>
      <P>I think I would not be wrong in referring to the Succession Bill which finally left the Houses of Parliament today.  It is a Bill upon which 41 amendments were made in the course of its passage through this House.  If that Bill had come at a time when we did not have a proper opportunity of amending it, I am quite satisfied it would not be as satisfactory as it is, because we had sufficient opportunity to amend it.</P>
      <P>Here we are dealing with a Bill which, according to the Order Paper, is a certified Money Bill.  The Government know quite well that, under the Constitution, we have 21 days in which to deal with this Bill.  Upon what date does the Government present it to the Seanad for consideration?  On the 14th day of December it is sent up from the Dáil and the 21 days will have run out over the Christmas period and into the 4th of January.  That is the measure of the Government's concern about the Seanad's reaction to this Bill.  They do not take the trouble with a Bill, which will regulate the work of the Seanad for years to come and which will make an impact upon the opportunities the Seanad will have to debate economic and financial matters, to allow the Seanad 21 days in which to consider it.  We are faced with the proposition of having to meet next week, in the middle of Christmas week, or meet sometime on New Year's Eve.</P>
      <P>We must deplore the fact that the Government treat the Seanad in this way.  I will always endeavour&mdash;while a Member of this House&mdash;to see that the Seanad, which has these constitutional functions clearly laid down in the Constitution, is given a full opportunity of exercising these functions and that we are not cheated, for want of time, by passing measures which we think ought not to be passed in an imperfect state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read section 4 of the Bill and I have some experience in reading and construing legislation.  I must say that, for the life of me, I do not know what section 4 means.  The whole Bill is a highly technical Bill and one would <Col N="768" /> have thought that the Minister, in introducing a Bill which will have very far-reaching consequences upon financial organisations in this country, would at least have done us the courtesy of furnishing us with an explanatory memorandum.  The first time I received any information about this Bill was from the Minister's speech today and, even after hearing that, I do not know what section 4 of the Bill means.  I grant you we are not entitled to get explanatory memoranda with all Bills.  If the Government choose to introduce a Bill in such a way that it reaches the Seanad a very short time before Christmas and we are not allowed even 21 days in which to deal with it, I would expect that in those circumstances we would be afforded the assistance of an explanatory memorandum with the Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of criticism by this House on previous occasions about the way in which we have been given legislation and asked to pass it with very little opportunity of considering it.  I must confess that while I am greatly concerned about expediting the business of the Seanad and would welcome this particular Bill if we had some assurance that it would lead to a more orderly flow of business through the Dáil and Seanad, I am not at all satisfied that that is going to be the result of passing it. We have had the position here on numerous occasions that the Finance Bill comes into the Seanad late in July and that on occasion a resolution has had to be passed by the Seanad authorising the President to sign it earlier than the fourth day.  This is the kind of way in which the financial business of the State and the Dáil programme of legislation has been organised. It is not fair either to the Seanad or to the citizens who pay us to be here.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech does refer to this fact and I believe that in the debate on the last Finance Bill here, the report of which is not available yet, he referred to the fact that the Seanad was being crowded out and not given sufficient opportunity of discussing the Bill, and he gave an undertaking <Col N="769" /> that that would be the last occasion on which that would occur. But the Minister in his speech today does not go very much further than the general undertaking he gave last July, because after indicating that it was intended that there would be earlier consideration of the Finance Bill by the Dáil, he says that this should leave the Seanad with more time to debate the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister ought to give an assurance here this evening that it would be the Government's aim that the Finance Bill will be introduced not later than 1st July, that is, if the Dáil is not going to rise before 31st July, and that certainly it would never be introduced later than four weeks before the projected date upon which the Dáil will rise, because we must have 21 days in which to consider it &mdash;and the last Finance Bill was an example of the kind of Bill that should be subject to a fairly searching Committee Stage debate&mdash;and then there must be time for the Bill to go back to the Dáil, which if the Minister were disposed to accept amendments here, would probably accept amendments made by the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The quite complicated sections of the Finance Bill relating to income tax and death duties are matters on which the Seanad might well make acceptable recommendations, both to whatever Minister for Finance is handling it and subsequently to the Dáil.  That opportunity can only be provided if the Government make sure that the Finance Bill reaches the Seanad at least four weeks before the projected date on which the Dáil is to rise.  If the Minister were to give that undertaking as the aim and object of the Government, it would go some distance towards meeting the criticisms which have been made of this Bill here.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge referred at some length to the opportunities given to the Dáil as compared with those given to the Seanad for debating Government expenditure and financial and fiscal policy.  The plain truth of the matter is that up to the present we have had three opportunities&mdash;the Central Fund <Col N="770" /> Bill, the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill&mdash;and it is quite clear now from what is proposed in this Bill that one-third of these opportunities will be taken from us.  While it may be desirable from the point of view of the Dáil to have a permanent Central Fund Bill, it certainly is equally desirable from the point of view of the Seanad that there should be some substitution for the opportunity the Seanad had of debating general Government policy and expenditure on the Central Fund Bill.  That can only be made in the way suggested by Senator Dooge. I hope the Minister will, in fairness to the Seanad and as a measure of his regard for the constitutional status of this House, agree to provide in this Bill an opportunity for the Seanad in the springtime to discuss general Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>There has been some talk about the lack of adequate statistics and information for the Vote on Account debate up to the present.  It seems to me that when it comes round to debating the Appropriation Bill in December, any statistics that were relevant in March and in July will then be nearly out of date.  I do not quite see what the complaint is about the lack of statistical information or that it has any bearing on a Bill of this kind.  The Appropriation Bill will be debated in December when the statistics will probably be nine months out of date. I cannot see what argument is to be based upon the complaint that you have not got full statistical information in March when we are going to be asked to debate the Appropriation Bill with out of date statistics.  In any event, it is not so much a question of being able to produce statistics here in a debate of this kind when we ought to be concerned with debating in a general way, and on some subjects in a particular specific and detailed way, what we think ought to be done.</P>
    <P>I rather think that the Seanad should not concern itself alone with mere criticisms of Government activity and inactivity but that being that much further removed from the exigencies of political life which Deputies have to experience, should always be in a <Col N="771" /> position to give a lead to public opinion in the kind of things that require to be said and done.  Members of the Seanad are in the position in which they do not have to have as deep a concern for the things they say which require to be said as perhaps do members of the Dáil.  Debates in the Seanad should have a bent in that direction and whether or not we have statistics is not of very much importance at all.  What is important is to make proposals and criticisms that will inure to the benefit of the community. That in my view can well be done whether or not we have up to date statistical information.</P>
    <P>There has undoubtedly been a great crowding of legislation in the Dáil between April and July, and it has been our experience here that we have had to discuss half a dozen Bills in July, some of which, like Social Welfare Bills, authorise payments to be made on 1st August and so necessarily have to be enacted before 1st August. Against that&mdash;and this is a matter upon which the Government should exercise their mind and one on which I have had some discussion with the Leader of the House here&mdash;the business of the Seanad should be so organised that more use is made of the constitutional provisions enabling legislation to be initiated in the Seanad. At the present time the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Bill is before the Dáil.  I cannot think of any piece of legislation more suitable for introduction in this House than that Bill.</P>
    <P>It deals with workmen and employers. The Seanad has a panel on which there are people experienced in organised labour, and on the industrial and Commercial Panel, we have members. On the Cultural and Educational Panel, we have a scattering of lawyers who have been concerned, up to now, with the Workmen's Compensation Act.  Those three groups are organised and elected on a vocational basis. They are pre-eminently qualified to deal with the question of occupational injuries and workmen's compensation. It seems that was a Bill which was most suitable for introduction in this House.  Instead of that, it was introduced <Col N="772" /> in the Dáil.  It seems to me that an intelligent approach to organising business and to making the fullest use of this particular House would have suggested that a Bill of that kind should certainly have been introduced in this House and, having passed this House, it could have been dealt with by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Senator McQuillan suggests that legislation should not be introduced in the Dáil between April and July.  There is a great deal to be said for that if the Dáil is so cluttered up with financial business and Estimates at that time, and if legislation has to be introduced then, this is the Chamber in which it should be done.  There are certain types of important Bills which the Government should quite rightly start off in the Dáil but there is a wide variety of Bills&mdash;we have the Coinage Bill and a currency Bill&mdash;which are of no great consequence and there is no reason in the world why they should not be introduced in this House.  There would then be much more time for discussing financial business in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We would have got rid of that before July every year and we would have much more time to debate the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill.  I would make a very strong plea to the Minister and, through him, to the Taoiseach and the Government, to give very positive and serious consideration to reorganising the legislative programme in such a way as to make sure that the fullest use is made of this House for initiating legislation and, furthermore, to ensure that the kind of situation we have had here in which we have enacted legislation, and let legislation go through, with the feeling that we have done a bad job, does not arise in future.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain when I say that, and make that plea to the Minister, and, through him to the Taoiseach and the Government, that I am voicing, not only the sentiments and the wishes of the people of my own Party and of those on this side of the House, but on all sides of the House.  I believe that in making that plea, I am expressing what the public are demanding from the Government in the various criticisms <Col N="773" /> they make of the utility and, sometimes, indeed, the necessity, of having the Seanad.  While the Constitution remains as it is, and while this House is one of the two Houses of Parliament, then that fact ought to be recognised by the Government.  Recognition of that fact involves making the fullest possible use of the Seanad as one of the two Houses of Parliament. Furthermore, which is not unimportant, we will be giving to the people who send us here and who pay for us here, proper value for the considerable sums of money they expend in maintaining this House and its members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that I appreciate the manner in which Senators have approached this Bill. They have made their points carefully and, with a slight qualification, objectively.  It cannot be expected that they would be completely objective in that there is some invasion of Seanad time for dealing with financial business in the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that one of my main purposes in seeking Dáil and Seanad approval of this measure is to give the Seanad a more reasonable opportunity of dealing with the Finance Bill.  I am always very concerned about coming into this House with a measure, which the Seanad is constitutionally entitled to amend, but in respect of which, by reason of the Dáil having risen or some other exigency, that power is not available to the Seanad. It was particularly evidenced in the Finance Bill of this year and, indeed, in the Finance Bill of many other years in which reasonable amendments were suggested by the Seanad, amendments which, although they might not have improved the Bill, were certainly worth considering, but which it was not possible to consider because of these exigencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to set the record clear as far as Senator O'Quigley's reference to the undertaking he said I gave.  The Seanad debates have not been published but I can repeat now, from a copy, what I said on that occasion for the benefit of keeping the record straight. <Col N="774" /> At the end of the debate on the Finance Bill I said:</P>
    <P>I understand that the Seanad have certain difficulties about Bills like this coming up at certain stages and about not being in a position to amend them. I announced in the Dáil during the passage of this Bill that as a result of my experience, I felt there would need to be an overhaul of the financial business of both Houses and I propose to introduce amending legislation to rationalise the procedure so as to give an opportunity to both Houses to discuss such measures more fully and also to give more background knowledge of the financial position of the country at any particular stage.  I am just giving advance information to the Seanad that I expect that in future years they will be in a position to discuss these matters at particular intervals and be given more opportunity of making amendments and recommendations.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get out of any commitment or undertaking I made but I have repeated this in view of what Senator O'Quigley suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I look upon the Minister as a generous man and I thought his undertaking was generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dooge, in his usual thorough way, dealt very closely with the Bill and with the implications he saw it had for the Seanad and for the control of financial business generally.  I want to say, in reply to the general points he made, and the particular one Senator McQuillan made, that the Bill is not designed in any way to limit parliamentary control of Government expenditure.  It is designed, on the contrary, to ensure that parliamentary control will be more effective in that Government expenditure will now be discussed more fully as part of the general Budget debate. As I said, there will be more background knowledge available to make the debate more effective.  It will also give more time to the Dáil, at any rate, to debate the individual Estimates. As Senator McQuillan knows, <Col N="775" /> in his time in the other House, there was this telescoping of Dáil debates coming towards the end of June and July and important Estimates were not fully discussed.  The device introduced recently of debating Estimates before the publication of the Book of Estimates did not, I think, wholly remedy this unsatisfactory position.  We had the other device of passing the Estimate, subject to an undertaking by the appropriate Minister to introduce a token Estimate for £10 to cover the service, in order to provide an opportunity for a debate on the Estimate. Now, less resort will be had to those devices because the four-fifths provision for expenditure will carry authority for this expenditure up to the end of December, and will enable debates to be more evenly spaced out. Individual Estimates can be discussed in the summer and in the autumn terms.</P>
      <P>I might say in this respect, too, that the other device to which I have referred, which was agreed I think between the Taoiseach and the Leaders of the Opposition Parties&mdash;the device of introducing Estimates and having debates in the Dáil in advance of the publication of the Book of Estimates which was one such step as Senator McQuillan suggested&mdash;was not entirely adequate in the event, so it is not revolutionary to suggest that something else might have been tried.  In fact, something else was tried and did not turn out to be a complete remedy.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, too, in regard to the point made by Senator Dooge about the efficacy and value of the debates on the Central Fund Bill in the Seanad, that there is no intention whatever of suggesting that the standard of the Seanad debates was not high, as it certainly was.  The standard was high, and the contributions were useful, but the fact is that the Government's overall proposals in relation to expenditure and taxation are not disclosed until the Budget is introduced.  Obviously this lack of information, and the lack of the general economic statistics published with the Budget, must impair the effectiveness of the debates in the Dáil, and in the Seanad as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> Another specific point raised by Senator Dooge was whether there would still be a necessity for the four months provision, that is, the Finance Acts having to be passed in order to implement the resolutions of the Budget. That will still be the case, and if there appears to be a necessity for extending that four months to six months as the Senator suggests, it can be looked at, and suitable legislation can be introduced if necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley asked what does section 4 mean.  I dealt with it in my opening statement.  I did not think an explanatory memorandum was necessary but, in effect, the position is that the Central Fund Bill, if passed in the manner I propose, will authorise the Government to make payments up to four-fifths of the expenditure in the previous year.  The tendency has been that each year Government expenditure is increasing.  Therefore it is obvious that four-fifths will normally be sufficient up to the end of the December of the particular financial year, but, being four-fifths of the expenditure of the preceding year, it will cover services which are already in existence&mdash; in other words, services the principle of which the Dáil has already approved. It may be that in a particular year a new service will be introduced for which there was no provision in the preceding Estimate, and section 4 will now give permission to enable expenditure to be made on that new service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question which I think I already asked him.  Is he prepared to come to the Seanad for a two-day debate on general financial policy in March of each year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have referred to that.  I do not think that would be possible.  There is no point in prevaricating about it.  That would mean the Seanad, in a sense, would be getting more power than the Dáil.  It would be giving the Seanad that extra right to discuss financial business.  I do not think I could give that undertaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 1, I should like to ask the Minister where does one find a statutory definition of &ldquo;supply services&rdquo; which runs through this Bill.  There are continual references to &ldquo;supply services&rdquo; throughout the Bill.  &ldquo;Supply services&rdquo; is not defined in the Appropriation Act.  Can the Minister say where it is defined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not any definition of &ldquo;supply services&rdquo; or &ldquo;supply service&rdquo; in the singular.  This is a traditional term that goes back for many years&mdash;for centuries, in fact. There should not be any need for a definition of every word and every phrase in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely in a new Bill like this when the Minister says that we are in the process of streamlining procedures, we should have incorporated in the first section of the Bill a definition of &ldquo;supply services&rdquo;. This Bill deals with nothing else but supply services, and I feel this should <Col N="778" /> not be left hanging in the air.  We may copy very much from Britain, but we are distinct from them by the fact that we have a written Constitution and they have an unwritten Constitution. Our legislation should be consistent with the Constitution and self-consistent. It is a serious omission in the definition section if the words &ldquo;supply services&rdquo; which are the heart of the Bill, and the whole matter of the Bill are not defined.  In future in a Bill such as this, the Minister should take care to put this definition beyond doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be good enough to give us his definition of what is meant by &ldquo;supply services&rdquo;? The reason I ask is that I think the Minister can decide something is a supply service.  Under section 4 I think he can decide that he can issue a grant out of the Central Fund in respect of a new service which he would deem to be a supply service.  That is my understanding of section 4, if it is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that &ldquo;supply service&rdquo; is a service for which the Dáil grants supply annually: that is my definition and that is the generally accepted definition.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, on Committee Stage, I must rise to express extreme regret that this Bill, admirable in so many ways, is a permanent Bill. Section 2 would be a far better section, <Col N="779" /> and the Bill a far better Bill, if the words &ldquo;every subsequent financial year&rdquo; were omitted.  I agree that what Senator McQuillan said this afternoon that this new development which the Minister is recommending to us would have been made better by first changing the annual Central Fund Bill into a new type of Central Fund Bill and postponing consideration of the second part of the change, the making of it permanent.  It could have been quite easy for the Dáil, if the Dáil does not wish to discuss the Vote on Account, to pass the annual Central Fund Bill within one day and pass it on to the Seanad which would still have the power to have a Central Fund Bill debate of the type which it has had.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the Seanad is to be precluded from debating general financial policy in March because the Dáil does not choose to discuss it.  The Dáil does not wish to have a debate in March and accordingly the Seanad is to be debarred.  If the Dáil does not wish to debate this matter the better thing would be that the Dáil should allow the Bill to go through as a matter of course and let it come to the Seanad.  There would be no interference with the rights of the Dáil in regard to this matter.  There would be no interference with the Dáil's constitutional position.  If the Dáil should, at any time, change its mind and decide it wanted to discuss these matters&mdash;if special information were available which indicated that there could, with advantage, be a debate at this point in time&mdash;the Dáil would then be free to blossom out from a perfunctory passing of the Bill into a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, applying not only to the next financial year but to every subsequent financial year, is necessary, we are told, because the Dáil does not wish to discuss these particular matters.  Because the Minister thinks these debates ineffective, and the Dáil agrees with him, the Seanad also is deprived of this opportunity for debate.  I would ask the Minister if he would not reconsider the question of having a Seanad debate in spring on <Col N="780" /> these matters.  If the Dáil decides it does not want to discuss something, this should not mean that the Minister should be prevented from coming in here and taking part in a debate in this House and having the benefit of a two-day debate in this House on general financial policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That goes to the fundamentals of the Bill.  I would not agree that the measure should be of a temporary nature&mdash;in other words, that the provisions of the Bill would apply only to each particular year.  Let us be a little realistic on this point.  The Dáil does not usually debate the Central Bund Bill.  It passes, at the end of the debate on the Vote on Account, or hitherto it has passed, almost automatically. There is no preclusion of a debate, but it does not take place. Equally, in the Seanad, it often happens that the Appropriation Bill goes through hot on the heels of the Seanad debate on the Finance Bill and sometimes it is not debated at all in the Seanad.  So, in effect, generally speaking, there have been two such financial debates, the Central Fund Bill debate and the Finance Bill debate and only on occasion a separate debate on the Appropriation Bill.  You have this telescoping of activity even in the Seanad in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>Now, the Finance Bill will be debated in good time, I hope, for the possibility of the Dáil's considering recommendations made by the Seanad in the Summer, in June or July, and the Appropriation Bill will be debated in the autumn, possibly about November or December.  Therefore, there is a much better spread of the Seanad debating of these financial matters.  As a result, I think the debates in the Seanad will be more effective.  Because of the spread in time, the Seanad will have an opportunity to look at the effectiveness of the Government's proposals in the finance legislation.</P>
      <P>It is short cutting, if you like, and debating it fairly fully on the Appropriation Bill.  Therefore, I think you will have two much more effective debates, better debates, from the point of view of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe twice. Senators will recollect having refrained, on occasions, from raising certain matters on the Finance Bill thinking they were more appropriate on the Appropriation Bill and then, when they raised them on the Appropriation Bill, they found they should have been raised on the Finance Bill. I have had quite an amount of experience of that.  So, in fact, they were nearly always debated separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is expressing hopes about when the Finance Bill will be debated in the Dáil and hopes it will come in here in time to give us an opportunity of making recommendations on it and sending it back to the Dáil.  Can the Minister give any indication as to the likely programme in the future?  I take it that the Budget will be introduced in April, as at present.  Would the idea then be that, after that, the Finance Bill would be introduced in the Dáil some time in May so that it would come up here some time in June?  For the life of me, I cannot see why the Finance Bill takes that length to draft because a variety of these recommendations are already made and approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  They are ready for the Minister for Finance and are almost in draft form.  I do not think a lot of such sections of the Finance Bill as are necessary for the imposition of taxation require that much time.  In any event, that is a matter which should be remedied by having sufficient draftsmen working upon the Bill. It is a bit too bad to say that the powers of this House are being hindered because of the failure to employ one additional draftsman in the Department or in the Revenue <Col N="782" /> Commissioners.  That is what it amounts to.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should go some distance now and say that the aim and object of the Government would be that, at the minimum, the Finance Bill should reach this House not later than four weeks before the projected date for the rising of the Dáil.  If we were to get that assurance then it would mean there would be twenty-one days available to us in which the Bill could be considered.</P>
    <P>At the end of his Second Reading speech the Minister said that if the House wished, the scope of the debates on the Finance Bill could be broadened so as to include expenditure.  I do not think there would be too much difficulty about that.  I would also like the present Minister, as the Minister for Finance, to give us an assurance if he were handling an Appropriation Bill, say, in December of 1968 and if the Financial policy of the Government were brought up on that, that he would not say it did not properly arise on the Appropriation Bill.  If he were to agree, on the Appropriation Bill, that the kind of debate which formerly took place on the Central Fund Bill were allowable it would go some distance to meet the requirements of this House and to replace the valuable debate which took place on the Central Fund Bill.</P>

      <P>I will take the last point first.  I did say, as Senator O'Quigley points out, I was willing to have the scope of the Finance Bill debate broadened in order to include a debate on expenditure.  I am really not concerned as to which Bill, the Finance Bill or the Appropriation Bill, would be widened.  That is a matter about which I made inquiries from the Seanad officials before I committed myself to this suggestion.  I understand that the appropriate place to have this done would be by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I think it should be arranged accordingly.  I take it that whatever recommendations come from the Committee will be acceptable to the House and that the Cathaoirleach, or Leas-Chathaoirleach for the time being, will <Col N="783" /> be able to operate whatever suggestion may come.</P>

      <P>I take it then if this matter goes before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges we can then say, as far as the present Minister for Finance is concerned, if the Committee of the House agrees to widen the scope of the debate so as to include Government expenditure the Minister has no objection to that?  Likewise, perhaps the Minister would go a further distance and say that, on the Appropriation Bill where strictly only Government administration would be open to debate, if we want to introduce Government finance and financial policies and so on, other than taxation, we will not be precluded.  At any rate we should like to be reassured that the Minister will not take exception to that on the Appropriation Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley is very fond of looking for undertakings from me. Even if I wanted to give an undertaking about the time available to the Seanad for discussion of the Finance Bill it would be impossible for me to do so because I could not limit the Dáil debate on the Finance Bill. Accordingly, I could not say exactly when the Finance Bill would leave the Dáil.  I want to assure the House it will be my intention to introduce the Budget as early as possible in April <Col N="784" /> and, with the usual couple of weeks which will elapse, then the Seanad could reasonably expect the Finance Bill in early May.  This year was exceptional, of course, in that we had just finished a general election.  I was new in the Department of Finance, I did not fully understand finance legislation and it took me some time in the first place to come to grips with the amending proposals put forward by the Revenue Commissioners.  The general election put the debate back as well.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, as Senator O'Quigley knows, grave difficulty about parliamentary draftsmanship.  I am told that no matter how good one is as a lawyer that does not necessarly mean that one is a good draftsman, and it takes considerable time to train a man to be a draftsman.  That fact always limits the capacity of the parliamentary draftsmen's office to work sufficiently quickly to satisfy both Houses at all times.  Again, it is my intention to ensure that amending proposals in finance legislation, which are not immediately the concern of the Budget of that particular year, will come to me in sufficient time so that I will be ready and have these things cleared out of the way and have got Government approval of them in good time so that there will not be this suggestion that the fault lies with the draftsmen's office.</P>

      <P>On section 2, I should like to ask the Minister was the question of Appropriations-in-Aid considered when this permanent Central Fund Bill was being drafted? The position has been up to this that the Appropriations-in-Aid were not part of the annual Central Fund Bill but were merely brought in at the Appropriation Bill stage.  There is a very wide spread in time between the start of the financial year in April and the passing of the Appropriation Bill in December.  Might it not be appropriate to examine here the position of <Col N="785" /> the Appropriations-in-Aid, both from the point of view of the authority of Departments in regard to them and also in regard to the question of ordinary control of accounts in this respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something I am not completely <i>au fait</i> with. Apparently it has been the practice that Departments are always regarded as free to use Appropriations-in-Aid as from the first day of the financial year, each year.  But, if there is something requiring to be done, I can undertake to Senator Dooge that I will look favourably at any suggestions which might be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not myself <i>au fait</i> with this particular matter. Indeed, I am not even certain of whether Departments have any statutory basis for so doing other than the annual Appropriation Bill.  If they have not, then we were in the position that every Department will be diverting these moneys to particular purposes for a period of eight months of the year without statutory authority.  If this is so, it is undesirable.  Indeed a change might have been made and the statement which the Minister brings in under section 5 should include the Appropriations-in-Aid.  If this Bill is to be a permanent one and if there is no hope of changing the Minister's views in this respect, the permanent Bill should have provided not only for temporary supply but also provided for the authorisation of the Departments to use four-fifths of the previous year's Appropriations-in-Aid in this respect. If there is no other statutory authority I think that this would have been the better way to handle the whole problem.</P>

To follow seriously, this is a point that could well have been considered if we had been taking this Bill with intervals between the Second Stage, the Committee Stage and the Report Stage.

      <P>What I am going to deal with, section 4 will probably deal with, but I am not at all sure that it does.  Section 2 provides that where there was a surplus in the previous year dealt with under the previous year's Appropriation Act in the following year four-fifths of that may be used, or the Minister may make advances to the extent of four-fifths for that service.  The Minister referred in his Second Reading Speech to a new service.  What I do not understand in relation to section 2 is, if it is desirable to introduce a new service as from the 1st April in a particular year, how supply for that service is to be made available.  It has not been in the previous year's Appropriation Act.  There is, therefore, no question of advancing four-fifths in relation to it.  It seems to me that section 4, from what the Minister says, has something to say to that, but what section 4 means is beyond my wit.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise a question of what happens following the passage of this Bill if a general election intervenes between the <Col N="787" /> passing of the Estimates and the passing of the Appropriation Bill.  This lapse of time was a matter of four months previously but it is now to be stretched to eight months.  Will the position be in the future that if a general election intervenes at any time between the 1st April and the end of December the Estimates will have to be repassed before the final Appropriation Bill in December?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the simple answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  You do not have to wait for the Appropriation Bill anyway to continue the services up to December.  I cannot deal fully with that question, unfortunately, because it has been pulled out of the blue by the Senator, but I do not think that there is any danger that there would be any hiatus in the authority of the Departments to expend moneys in the event of there being an election between April and December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no doubt about the Departments being able to go ahead, but the question is whether following a general election it is necessary in the new House to again pass the Estimates, again cluttering up business, more particularly business which is the very thing this Bill seeks to remove.  Again this is a question which if we had time to go into it fully might have enabled us to put a section into this Bill that any Estimate passed before a general election would hold after the Dáil reassembles.  These are points that arise when this Bill is being made a permanent measure and which would not tend to arise if we dealt with an annual Bill.  I feel that there are a number of points like this which present themselves to anybody reading this Bill from a Committee point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that any difficulty need arise.  After all, no matter what occurs about a general election there is always a Government <Col N="788" /> there.  The fourteenth Dáil is ended, and the fifteenth Dáil comes in, and surely as in the case of most measures it takes on from there.  The Government is in power up to the time the new Government takes over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>

      <P>If we had an opportunity of discussing this question the final decision might have been perhaps that we should leave things as they were, but on the other hand clauses of this Bill deal with tidying up financial business.  Now we are making the present provision, we can take it that an Estimate once passed need only be dealt with again in the Appropriation Bill and it does not necessarily fall to the ground as a result of a general election and the coming in of a new Dáil?  Changes have been made in regard to the question of ordinary legislation in this respect.  Up to a few years ago legislation had to start again at the beginning. Now it takes up at the point it had reached before the election. When engaging in a job of streamlining there should be total design of the whole operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that there is more than that involved.  Streamlining may be desirable in many respects but there is a fundamental principle involved here, that an outgoing Dáil or Government should not be able to bind an incoming Dáil or Government in respect of their business in a particular financial year.  The incoming Government and Dáil should have control of their own affairs, so to speak. In the case of legislation passed by a previous Government or a previous Oireachtas there is always the facility of having that legislation changed on the advent of a new Government. Therefore, I think that the same provision should be available in the case of Estimates passed before the general <Col N="789" /> election.  If there is a change of Government the new Government and the Oireachtas generally should have freedom to act as they see fit in the resolution of these matters.</P>

      <P>It is designed to cover two particular cases&mdash;(1) the case of a new supply service for which a sum was not appropriated in the previous year, and (2) a service to which supply was granted by the Dáil before the start of the financial year to which it relates.  Taking the first, expenditure on a new service under existing practice cannot be incurred until the Dáil has approved of that particular service.  The present Bill will preserve this aspect of Parliamentary control over Government expenditure. A new service would not have been included in the previous year's Appropriation Act and it is, therfore, necessary to provide this statutory authority for the issue of the sums required for such a service when the Dáil has granted a supply for it.  In the second case, of a service for which supply was granted by the Dáil before the start of the financial year to which it relates, the consideration of the Estimates for the financial year may take place before the start of that year.  This is particularly likely to happen under the revised procedure to which I referred earlier introduced in 1964 whereby certain selected Estimates are circulated and considered in advance of the publication of the Estimates volume itself.  In the case of these categories the Minister for Finance is authorised to issue the full amount when Dáil Éireann has approved the Estimates and granted supply for the services.  I hope that that is reasonably clear.</P>

      <P>In lines 12 and 13 to delete &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Throughout this debate we have been putting forward to the Minister that the Seanad is being injured in its function by the provisions of this particular Bill.  I feel, in the drawing up of section 5, that the Minister has unduly kept his nose close to the absolute letter of the Constitution in merely placing the statements of the amounts of money which are to be drawn before the Lower House.  The Minister has, in his Second Reading speech, indicated that he proposes to circulate this to the Members of the Seanad. This, indeed, is what one would expect of the Minister who has no desire to keep information from the Seanad, that he would, in practice, treat the Seanad the same as the Dáil in this respect.  I consider the Seanad is entitled to ask the Minister to look at the logic of this particular attitude and to include the Seanad with the Dáil for the circulation of this material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there are reasons why this should be done and that the Minister should, in this respect, circulate this document and make it a statutory circulation to the Seanad as well as the Dáil.  This is not a matter of merely injured pride on the part of the Seanad in regard to this Bill or its general position but it is a practice which <Col N="791" /> could be followed in regard to all Money Bills.</P>

I want to give the most firm undertaking I can give that this document will be presented to the Seanad.  There was never any question of its not being done, but, so far as a solemn undertaking can be given, I am giving it here and now that this document will be presented to the Seanad.

It seems a pity that the Minister is unable to accept this particular recommendation. Again, of course, we have from the Minister an undertaking.  It seems to me, as time goes on, in regard to matters of this sort, the Seanad is a repository of several undertakings. It appears all the Seanad can do in this regard is to get an undertaking from the Minister.  This is not a healthy state and if it proceeds much further it may become a matter not of an undertaking but of undertakers.  That would be the appropriate word to use in regard to the Seanad.</P>

    <P>The position is that in March of next year the Minister, under section 5, will be obliged to lay a document before the Dáil, and, in accordance with his undertaking, to circulate it to the Seanad, which will contain the amounts which will be authorised by sections 2 and 4 to issue out of the Central Fund.  The insertion, during the Committee Stage in the Dáil, of <Col N="792" /> section 6 means that the Minister will also be empowered in that particular year, but not in subsequent years, to issue certain other amounts.  I think, without the recommendation which I propose here, the Minister's statement which he would issue next March, would be an incomplete statement without the amount the Minister was authorised, under the Bill, to issue during the financial year 1966-67.</P>

      <P>I should like to return to the question of whether or not it is appropriate to hold debates on the general financial policy in the Seanad in March.

The second time it sounds a bit hollow. There is this difficulty of duplicating debate in the Seanad.  It is just a natural reluctance that any Minister would have.

Can I have an undertaking that we will not have in future a repetition of the situation in which, at the end of the sessions, we were debating measures here and making recommendations which, if accepted, would involve bringing the Dáil back, with attendent expense?  I understand this Bill will obviate that in future and there is no need for Senator Dooge to feel that the effectiveness of the Seanad has been lessened.  We have power only to make recommendations and when we make those recommendations, the Dáil has adjourned.  I understood this Bill was to obviate that in the future.</P>

      <P>This Bill has secondary effects, and one of them is to remove from the Seanad calendar a <Col N="794" /> two-day debate on the Central Fund Bill.

      <P>I was talking about time pressures on the Minister himself. The fact that the Vote on Account debate will not take place in the Dáil will facilitate the Minister and his officials to get on with the Budget proposals, and will ensure that he will have the Budget proposals and the Finance Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot understand the Minister's suggestion that the time for the Seanad to make effective recommendations is after the Budget is introduced in the Dáil.  It seems to me that the time for a useful debate on the economic situation in this House, which could be of some value in guiding the Minister in regard to policy, is prior to the Budget, and with whatever information is available.  It has been suggested that the economic statistics would not be available, but the OECD Report and the NIEC Review of industrial progress would be available, and we would have that data to enable us to discuss the economic situation and to suggest the measures that might best be taken in the Budget.  That is the time when measures are taken which influence the course of the economy.</P>
      <P>To wait until after the Budget is to wait until it is too late for anything that is said in this House to have any practical effect on policy for that year, unless the Government contemplate regular autumn Budgets as well, and I hope that even under the present Government our economy will not deteriorate to that extent.  Therefore, I feel the case that has been made for such a debate in the Seanad in March is a strong one.  The fact that the Minister will be relieved from having to attend a debate in the Dáil makes the case stronger rather than weakens it.</P>

Before I entered the Seanad or even contemplated doing so, I read always with interest, and I think always with benefit, the debates in the Seanad at that time of the year.  They seemed to be constructive for the most part and, in fact, they were generally constructive and helpful in the formulation of policy. It seems a pity that the opportunity for a useful discussion in the sometimes more objective atmosphere of this House should be lost as a result of a change which is intended to be beneficial and helpful.  I think it is a pity that the Minister should feel reluctant to agree even to come here for the discussion of a motion on the economic situation.  I hope that on thinking it over he may reconsider his position on that point.</P>

As I understand it, the meaning of the phrase is merely that the ordinary charges on the Central Fund are quarterly but when the Parliamentary draftsman wants to talk about day to day expenses he does not talk about the Central Fund but about the &ldquo;growing produce thereof&rdquo;. In a Bill of this type, this phrase is out of harmony.

      <P>Quite independently of what Senator Dooge has said, I had intended to raise another point on this section, or on the Title of the Bill.  I can never understand why the Parliamentary draftsman always starts off a Bill with a few words and then goes into brackets.  This seems to me to be quite silly.  For instance, we have the classical example of the new Social Welfare bracket Occupational Injuries bracket Bill.  Everyone will refer to it as the Occupational Injuries Act when it is passed, and everyone will refer to this piece of legislation as the Permanent Central Fund Act, 1965.  Why can we not state that?  This is intended to be the Permanent Central Fund Act and instead of that we call it the Central Fund bracket Permanent Provisions Bill, 1965.</P>

Again, it is too late to do anything about it, but I hope the Parliamentary draftsmen's office will find it in their hearts to depart from these brackets and more brackets in future legislation.  That is what I would call real streamlining.</P>

      <P>The Institute of Public Administration has sought assistance from the Government in the matter of financing its accommodation requirements.</P>
      <P>The accommodation at present occupied by the Institute is at times found inadequate, so that it is necessary to rent outside accommodation on a temporary basis.  There has been an expansion in the Institute's activities in recent years, particularly in providing training courses for civil servants and local authority employees and overseas training, i.e., of students from the developing countries, and due to the establishment of the School of Public Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To cope with this expansion, the Institute has arranged to purchase a house adjoining the two houses which the Institute already owns.  Funds are needed to cover the purchase and to reduce the Institute's bank overdraft. Arrangements have been made to borrow the necessary funds on a long-term basis, subject, however, to principal <Col N="798" /> and interest being covered by a State guarantee.  The Government have approved the giving of the necessary guarantee and to implement this approval it is necessary to add the Institute to the bodies scheduled to the State Guarantees Act, 1954, with a maximum amount of £30,000 to be guaranteed.  The draft Order of which this motion seeks approval will implement this intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Order.  It may not be out of place&mdash;I trust it is not out of place&mdash;to remark, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, that you yourself were a founder member of this organisation.  Though I have never had the honour of being a public servant, I have been a member of the Institute for many years. Indeed, in recent years, I have been a member of the executive committee.  I have been so impressed with the value and importance of this work that I have been anxious to support and assist it in any way.  I trust I have now declared my interest in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Institute now has 1,200 members throughout the public service as well as the support of all the county councils and corporations in the country, the Civil Service departments and nearly all the State-sponsored bodies as group members.  Its activities are very wide-ranging and deserve the support of this House.  In the past year, it had 48 training courses covering a wide range of different matters&mdash;career development, the development of personal skills and new techniques.  In addition, its School of Public Administration has been providing a type of post-graduate course in public administration for people drawn from various parts of the public service and some people overseas.  It is also responsible for the provision of diplomas in local and central administration and for assisting notably in the training programme we have had here for people from developing countries, particularly Zambia, 50 public servants from which have been trained at the Institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another development is the fact that it established, several years ago, a social research committee and asked the United Nations to provide an <Col N="799" /> expert to recommend on social research here, which is bearing fruit in widening our social research activities.</P>
    <P>Thus, in many different ways, the Institute has contributed to raising the standards of public servants.  It has helped public servants to perform effectively their functions of advising the Government, of putting before the Government alternative policies and of helping the Government to formulate the kinds of policies needed for the economic, cultural and social development of the country.  Some of us at times feel that the Government do not always seem to benefit by this advice.  However, any step to assist this Institute, through the untiring efforts of its staff, to improve the standard of the public service is worth taking.</P>
    <P>The work of the Institute and of its staff, as I have observed it at close quarters over the years, has made a significant contribution to the progress we have made in many quarters. Accordingly, I should like to welcome this Order which is designed to ensure that the Institute will have adequate accommodation to carry on its important functions and I am very glad to have an opportunity of supporting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that any institution, such as the Institute of Public Administration, which does anything to improve the public service must command the support of the House, and indeed of the public. Indeed, in so far as the Institute of Public Administration endeavours to achieve that laudable object, I quite warmly support it.  Of course, the Institute, having started off from being a body with the intention of effecting some improvements in the administration of the public service, of making them aware of their responsibilities and of helping them to develop their potentialities, has grown into quite a large organisation.  We should be pleased to note that, as well as our missionary efforts abroad, we are now, through the agency of the Institute, helping to train public servants for the emergent nations of Africa.  In the Institute, they will of course get the kind of <Col N="800" /> training and background and outlook upon human liberties and democratic institutions that we should like to see growing and developing in the young nations of Africa.</P>
      <P>What Senator Garret FitzGerald has said about the work the Institute has been doing is entirely true, but it is necessary, I think, to issue some words of caution as to the kinds of things that may develop, if indeed they are not developing, in the public service of this country.  It would be difficult for me to assess the extent to which the Institute of Public Administration has been responsible for this.  I cannot help recollecting an article written by one of the leading members of the Institute of Public Administration in its journal <i>Administration</i> some years back.  The purport of that article was that where Ministers of State do not know their job and are not doing their job, it is the duty of public servants to push them into doing their job and, in effect, to take over and do what the Ministers are not doing. I did not think that this matter would come up for discussion this afternoon or I should have more extensive quotations from the article in question.  I remember being appalled at the time to read that it was the duty of public servants, where Ministers fell down on their job, to push them into doing what they considered was in the public interest.  The public service was to take over, and be the arbiter of what was right and necessary to be done in the public interest.</P>

      <P>This is the astonishing thing.  One cannot but wonder, when one sees the kind of legislation that has been passing through Parliament in recent times.  If one looks back at the Succession Bill, at certain sections of the Land Bill, at certain sections of the last Finance Bill, there is no doubt that these are not all the products of respective Ministers; these <Col N="801" /> are the outcome of the views of public servants who think the Minister does not know what is right and proper and urgent to be done.  It is because of that that we have this kind of legislation which is not acceptable to the public but which is being foisted upon Ministers and being passed in spite of all the grumbling and protests of the public at large.  That is a very unwelcome trend.  A warning should be given to the Institute of Public Administration to lay off a policy of that kind.</P>

      <P>I should like to continue the debate on this matter, which appears to be a debate among the Fine Gael Front Bench in the Seanad.  I think Senator O'Quigley, on reading the statements he has made here this evening and reflecting upon them, will realise that in drawing attention to an article by an individual which appeared in a journal published by the Institute of Public Administration, he has drawn conclusions from this which are not warranted.  Furthermore, he is tending to make recommendations which he himself would be the first to condemn, having looked at them in cold print.  It is not correct to say, as Senator O'Quigley has suggested, that the <i>obiter dicta</i> of an official <Col N="803" /> of the Institute of Public Administration or every suggestion in an article in the Journal is the policy of the Institute of Administration.</P>

      <P>I should, moreover, like to say that I think the suggestion inherent in what Senator O'Quigley has said&mdash;that when granting money to a particular body, we should review what has appeared in an individual article in the organ of that body and that we should issue a warning that this money is being given because they are bodies worthy of support but that this sort of thing must not be published&mdash;is not going to help anyone.  This is an indirect censorship of the most undesirable kind and not in keeping with the liberal attitude which Senator O'Quigley normally displays in this House.</P>

      <P>It would be very bad that the Institute of Public Administration should be curbed in any way.  If administration in this country is to be improved, there are many things which must be done.  One absolute pre-requisite is free discussion. Without absolute free and uninhibited discussion of the defects of public administration in this country, whether they be the defects of civil servants, the defects of Ministers, the defects of Deputies or the defects of Senators, unless these are discussed openly and without any inhibition, we will make very little progress <Col N="804" /> towards curing these faults.  It is up to those of us who are Members of the Oireachtas to see&mdash;in our own particular spheres, whether we are members of political Parties or not&mdash;that the standard of Deputies and Senators is one which becomes increasingly less subject to criticism and to see, through our organisations and through our working here in the House, that this country gets Ministers who are as able, as patriotic, as energetic and as well informed as they possibly can be.  If we work towards this end it will not matter what anyone says in any journal in this country concerning the way in which any particular body in the public service should carry out its duties.</P>
      <P>I feel it is due to Senator O'Quigley himself that I should disagree with him on this point and point out the disparity between his views in this particular speech and his general attitude in the House.</P>
