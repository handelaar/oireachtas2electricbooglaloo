      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance, that is to say:</P>
      <P>(1)  the relativities that are appropriate between the rates of remuneration payable to recruitment clerical grades in the employment of the principal State-sponsored bodies, including Aer Lingus Teoranta, Bord na Móna, Córas Iompair Éireann and the Electricity Supply Board, and to corresponding recruitment grades (other than departmental grades) in the civil service and the service of the local authorities, with due regard to the staffing structure and the circumstances of each employment and to the interests of the national economy.</P>
      <P>(2)  the absolute levels of pay for the grades mentioned that with due regard as aforesaid, are appropriate as the basis for the application of any future general increase in pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to enable a tribunal to be set up under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, with the terms of reference indicated. The House will, no doubt, wish me to outline the reasons which have prompted the Government to act on these lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time past the Government have been concerned at the serious implications for the economy of the apparently unending series of pay increases occurring between or independently <Col N="301" /> of agreed national increases in pay.  This tendency has been particularly marked in the field of clerical employment.  The deficit in external trade and payments is such that much more of the impact of policy measures to protect the economy must fall on capital expenditure and imports, and, therefore, on employment, unless income increases are in line with national productivity.</P>
    <P>When, in 1959, the upturn in the economy made possible the seventh round of wage and salary increases, it was hoped that, for the future, the rise in the national product would permit of the improvement of the living standards of all our people in a just and orderly way.  The years since then have seen substantial improvements. Pay levels for salaried workers, in particular, have increased to a considerable extent.  There was, first of all, what has been called the eighth round. That round, on account of the period of time involved, was not self-contained. On various grounds, such as fair comparisons, loss of status and efforts to secure uniformity or near uniformity in clerical rates of pay, a number of adjustments of eighth round settlements were effected.  All resulted, of course, in an increase in take-home pay.  Then, there was, in addition, the 12 per cent ninth round increase.</P>
    <P>The situation over recent years may fairly be summarised in this way.  On the one hand, a large body of clerical staff have been seeking parity with the highest rates while, on the other, the holders of these rates not merely have not accepted such parity but have claimed the continuance of pre-existing differentials.  In the result there has been a chain of increases in the various employments, each giving rise to further claims with neither finality nor consistency emerging.  It is clearly in the public interest that there should be an end to this leap-frogging with all its inherent dangers to the country's economy.</P>
    <P>Part of the difficulty has been that a number of arbitration bodies have been operating in this field independently of each other.  When a particular grade puts forward a claim to its appropriate <Col N="302" /> tribunal, normally comparisons are made with grades in other employments. A major defect in the present system is that such comparisons are dealt with in the absence of both employer and staff representation for these employments with the result that no comprehensive findings emerge.</P>
    <P>It appears to the Government that, if a reasonably stable system of relativties is to be established, wage and salary increases generally should be brought within the purview of one central authority such as a reorganised Labour Court.  Time is running out, however, and much serious economic harm may be done before a unified authority can be established and gradually evolve such a system.</P>
    <P>The best immediate course appears, therefore, to the Government to be to set up a tribunal to consider pay levels of the recruitment clerical grades in the main State-sponsored bodies, such as Aer Lingus Teoranta, Bord na Móna, Córas Iompair Éireann and the Electricity Supply Board, and corresponding recruitment grades in the Civil Service and the local service. Between them these services contain the bulk of clerical employment.  The tribunal would be asked to report on what in its view constituted appropriate pay relativities in this sector, account being taken of the staffing structures and the circumstances of each employment and the interests of the national economy.</P>
    <P>The tribunal would also be asked to report on what absolute levels of pay for the grades concerned are appropriate as the basis for the application of any future general increase in pay. If the tribunal satisfactorily establishes differentials, that in itself will set levels. Unless there is some very significant change, it is in the interests of stability and of the economy as a whole that these levels should be regarded as norms and not to be departed from. Absolute is used in this sense and should be so interpreted.</P>
    <P>This will be first occasion when all these grades will have their pay rates examined simultaneously by an authoritative body in the light of all available material and evidence.  This <Col N="303" /> will obviously be an improvement on the existing procedure to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The present proposal has been formulated to meet an immediate and pressing need and to meet that need with the minimum of delay.  For this reason, its terms of reference have been confined to the basic recruitment grades, since, for practical purposes, these grades are pivotal in pay matters in their own organisations.  There is no foundation for the criticism that these grades have been singled out for harsh treatment or that there is discrimination between them and higher grades.</P>
    <P>Even though the tribunal will be concerned only with recruitment of clerical grades, I realise that its task will be a formidable one but, in view of the urgency of the problem, I intend to ask the members to set 1st March next as their latest target date for reporting. Doubt has been expressed that the tribunal could deal adequately within this period with the grades involved. I feel, however, that, if employer and staff sides in the various employments submit adequate written memoranda, the time occupied in the taking of oral evidence&mdash;which will probably be the most time-consuming part of the tribunal's work&mdash;should be correspondingly curtailed and that it should be possible to report before 1st March.  If the tribunal finds that this period would not be sufficient, it can of course spend a longer time at its deliberations.  It should also be remembered that existing tribunals have to engage in the exercise of comparison between different employments when a claim is made on behalf of a particular grade but, as I mentioned, in the absence of representation from the organisations with which comparison is being made.</P>
    <P>The inquiry will be held under the provisions of the 1921 Act to which I referred which enables a tribunal to be set up with certain powers of the High Court to inquire into definite matters of urgent public importance. The tribunal will cease to function when it presents its report.  The report will be published and will be available to existing tribunals in dealing <Col N="304" /> with salary claims.  Its only force will be that it proceeds from an authoritative investigation into pressing problems.</P>
    <P>Pending receipt of the tribunal's report, it would clearly be contrary to the national interest that its findings should be anticipated.  The Government have, therefore, decided to defer and to request other employers in the public sector to defer, until the tribunal's report is available, the granting of any pay increases to groups whose rates are to be the subject of investigation by the tribunal or to directly related groups.  This does not involve any hardship as all the groups named in the motion have already received an eighth round increase, at least one adjustment of that increase and the 12 per cent ninth round.  What it is sought to achieve here is that no fresh increase will be granted in this area until the tribunal has had an opportunity of examining the main employments simultaneously.  It will be evident, therefore, that by no stretch of the imagination can this deferment be properly regarded as a standstill on wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>The decision will not affect claims awaiting hearing by the Civil Service Arbitration Board.  The vast bulk of Civil Service grades have already been dealt with on the basis of key decisions given by the Board bringing pay into line with rates previously in operation outside.  The claims still to be heard by the Board concern small numbers in departmental grades and are based largely on internal relativities with grades which have already had revisions.  It would clearly be unfair to prevent these small groups from processing their claims in the same manner as the larger groups have already done.</P>
    <P>I have come to no final decision on the composition of the tribunal but it would be my wish to have it drawn from the Labour Court with some additional members, including in that number an economist.  This would be in line with the Government's policy of enlarging and strengthening the Labour Court and giving it the ultimate responsibility for dealing with salary as well as wage claims.  The pay <Col N="305" /> structures and relativities in the clerical employments with which this tribunal will be immediately concerned are, of course, only part of a wider problem which the Government intend should come within the scope of the responsibility of a reconstituted Labour Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of a number of measures introduced by the Government to deal with an economic situation the development of which in its present form is at least partly attributable to past Government policies.  Other measures taken included price control and credit control. These different measures all have one thing in common: they have all been undertaken too late.</P>
      <P>The right time for the extension of price control legislation was in 1963 when the turnover tax was introduced, or by early 1964 when the first round took place following price increases, not all of which were justified.  Yet measures to deal with prices were postponed for 18 months or two years, until in fact a state had been reached where it was possible to say that all possible causes of price increases were, for the moment, in abeyance.  Wages have been stable in industry for some time past and productivity is still rising. Therefore, it was not appropriate or, indeed, very honest to wait until this moment to introduce such a measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I should like to make is in regard to credit control. The obvious time for credit control was during 1964 when the banking system was allowing credit at a rate and in a manner that could not be justified.  This action was postponed until this year.  At the time of the general election the idea of Fine Gael in this respect was pooh-poohed by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Finance in terms which could be described only as irresponsible.  They imputed to Fine Gael ideas of grabbing hold of people's deposits.  We have this action now being taken against leap-frogging in the Civil Service. The right time to do that was in the years 1960 and 1961 or thereabouts when in fact this process started.  It started in the spring of 1960 and became quite marked in 1961.  To wait <Col N="306" /> until now when the process has gone on for five years shows that the Government were not alive to their responsibilities.  It is another matter referred to in Fine Gael's policy statement.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael also called for price modification but this was also waved aside at the time.  Yet within six months the Government adopted this part of Fine Gael's policy also.  In addition, Fine Gael drew attention to the need for a monetary policy which is precisely what was lacking in the past year and the lack of which has allowed our economy to get out of gear.  Quite clearly it was a temporary problem which could have been solved.  Finally, Fine Gael called for an incomes policy. Practical proposals were made in the Fine Gael policy statement in that respect and I take it the Government have now arrived at the stage when they are prepared to adopt that part of Fine Gael policy also.</P>
    <P>One must certainly agree that the measure now proposed, if overdue, is something that needs to be done.  It is a problem that has needed looking at. The Government's record in regard to wages and salaries has been particularly bad.  In a period in which we have had economic progress, the Government have claimed credit for this progress but their record in this field has not been by any standard a satisfactory one and has led to a growing lack of confidence in the Government's competence in this field.  The see-saw exercise carried out by the Taoiseach and other Government spokesmen during the past five years is impossible to justify economically, if it can be explained politically.</P>
    <P>We had the Taoiseach's denunciation of the seventh round in 1960, a round moderate in character&mdash;seven to eight per cent&mdash;appropriate in time, necessary and desirable economically and socially and against which I do not recall any serious economic judgment having been made to the effect that it was excessive or occurring at the wrong time.  It was denounced in March, 1960, by the Taoiseach in the Dáil.  There was then a pause during which the Government had nothing to say until the electricians' strike in the <Col N="307" /> summer of 1961.  There was then repeated Government intervention, for which the present Minister for Finance was responsible, and this led to a jacking up of the offers made by the ESB to the electricians until the final amount offered and accepted involved a 17 per cent increase in salaries and a 12 per cent increase in general wages. This was responsible for raising the level of the eighth round from the eight per cent which it had looked like up till then, ending up in the 12 per cent with which we are now all familiar in the context of the ninth round.  Responsibility for raising the ante in that way rests with the Government.</P>
    <P>This electricians settlement led immediately afterwards &mdash; it can be documented &mdash; to wage settlements of above 12 per cent &mdash; working out at 22/6d per week for an adult male&mdash; and the whole level of wage increases was thus affected in that way, So, having denounced a moderate and timely increase for the seventh round the Government pushed up the whole level of wage increases to the inflationary level at which they have since stood.</P>
    <P>The next move was the closing of the gap policy in early 1963.  The need for this arose because fluctuations in the economy led to a slowing down in the rate of output per worker, and a gap emerged between the growth of output per worker and industrial earnings. The Government sought to close this gap.  Indeed, this document here is entitled <i>Closing the Gap</i>.  Nine months later, the Government announced that the gap was closed and that the next round could take place.  One can argue about the appropriateness of that.  It has been suggested that there was a political reason for it.  If there was, the timing of the round was nevertheless reasonably sound economically, coming at the beginning of a period of rapid economic growth, although a postponement of some months might have been better.</P>
    <P>But the Government stated that the gap was closed.  The gap shown in this document and in this graph was, according to my calculations, 9½ per cent.  That is, whereas in the years 1958-61 the productivity output per <Col N="308" /> worker and earnings were reasonably in harmony with each other, moving at almost the identical same rate, in 1962, a gap emerged between them of about 9½ per cent.  In the following year, productivity and earnings continued to rise, but at the end of that year, the gap was 10 per cent&mdash;½ point larger than a year earlier.  To suggest that the gap was closed was, therefore, dishonest.</P>
    <P>I think one can make a case that there was no hope of closing the gap at that stage and that some wage round was desirable, was going to come and was inevitable, and the timing of it may not have been far wrong&mdash;but the suggestion that the gap had been closed and that the Government had completed the job they had set out to achieve, was completely unfounded.</P>
    <P>Then we had the Taoiseach's intervention in the ninth round itself which was too late.  I am open to correction on this because there is confusion as to precisely what happened, but I think he suggested that eight per cent was an appropriate figure at a time when ten per cent had already been offered.  His intervention in any event came so late as to be quite ineffective.</P>
    <P>Since then, we have had the expansion of this leap-frogging in the public service salaries.  It started in 1960, and became more acute since.  The Government stood by without taking action. In reply to a Dáil question earlier this year the Government explained this whole process away and said that the increases being given to the civil servants were simply to enable them to catch up with outside employment. Now, they are telling a different and a truer story&mdash;that these increases were part of a leap-frogging process, and not simply a matter of civil servants catching up with outside employment but with other groups in the public service&mdash;State bodies and semi-State companies, whose salaries were already ahead of those of manual workers in industry.</P>
    <P>The result has been that there is in fact no confidence in this aspect of the Government's policy among manufacturers and workers and even people who, at least until <Col N="309" /> recently, had confidence in the Government's general economic policy have not felt that the Government's handling of these matters has been satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the fact is that the Government, better late than never, have decided to try to tackle this problem.  The Government's proposal is designed to meet a real problem.  In this country, unlike some other countries, clerical workers in the public service, the State bodies and some of the larger private companies are highly organised in trade unions, most of them being affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They are organised in this way to a degree which is far greater than in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in this country, to a far greater extent than in the United Kingdom, the leadership in the movement of salaries is taken by the Government and State bodies.  The initiative generally comes from the State bodies but the skill and speed with which public servants and those in the service of local authorities join in the leap-frogging exercise keeps them well up to par.  In the United Kingdom, the leadership in the salaries groups is not in the public sector but in the private sector.  The combination, in Ireland, of a highly organised group in the public service and this practice of leadership in salary movements within the public sector, has been such that clerical salaries in this country have risen faster and in general to a much higher level than in the United Kingdom&mdash;in contrast to the position of the manual workers whose wage levels are generally lower than those obtaining in Britain and for semi-skilled and female workers the levels are very much lower.</P>
    <P>Let me give the House some examples.  At the moment, the typical earnings of a clerical officer in the entry grade in the State bodies is about £1,175 per annum at maximum level. Anybody fortunate enough to be privileged to enter one of those bodies, so long as he does not assault his boss, will automatically rise to this salary. The equivalent in the United Kingdom, as will be seen from a study of the analysis of clerical salaries published <Col N="310" /> every three years and a copy of which is available in Trinity College&mdash;and, one would hope also&mdash;while doubting &mdash;in the Department of Finance&mdash;the equivalent figure in Britain is around £900 to £950.  I would not want to specify a figure too precisely because there are higher London rates than elsewhere in Britain and there has been a certain movement in salaries recently but I think we can say the figure is around £900 to £950.  There are institutions such as the Coal Board, Air Companies, and so on&mdash;the same kind of bodies as we have in this country.</P>
    <P>There is here an extraordinary anomaly that clerical workers' salaries rise automatically to a level of the order of 20 to 30 per cent higher than similar salary levels in the United Kingdom, whereas the wages of manual workers in this country are from 40 to 45 per cent lower in some cases in similar occupations in this country than in Britain, particularly as regards women workers.</P>
    <P>Not only are clerical salaries at a higher level but they have risen faster.  The increase between March, 1960, and March, 1965, a period of five years, in industrial earnings in this country has been 43 per cent, from an average of £7 7/- a week to £10 8/11d.  The figures themselves are not significant: they are an average for all workers in this country, juveniles and women included, and the figures would be higher for adult males.  The increase in the maximum salary for entry to clerical grades in State bodies and the Civil Service has been over 50 per cent and the maximum for the clerical officers had risen by 57 per cent from £712 to £1,117 since 1960.  We have, therefore, a situation in which these salaries have risen faster than manual workers' wages to a level higher than elsewhere.  This has been primarily because of this leap-frogging exercise which the Government have watched but have done nothing about during the five years since it started in the spring of 1960.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental problem here, in fact, which has to be faced and will not be dealt with by this tribunal.  It will require a broader prosion. <Col N="311" /> It is a problem of social philosophy, of agreement on just what kind of society and what kind of structure of society, in regard to remuneration for work, we are moving towards.  Up to 1960 it was the tendency in this country as in other countries for differentials between different levels of pay to be narrowed. This was achieved through flat rate increases rather than percentage increases. This led to a certain levelling up in society.  Nobody's standards were lowered during the 1950s but the lowest paid had their standards increased more rapidly than better off people.  This seemed to agree with the general philosophy most civilised countries have nowadays.</P>
    <P>Since 1960, however, this process has been reversed in this country but not because the people of Ireland have decided on a new social philosophy or, have decided to raise to new levels the remuneration for clerical work and to keep manual workers further behind.  This has happened because of the failure of the Government to manage the affairs of the public sector.  This development seems to me to run contrary to the social philosophy which people in this country would broadly accept.  One might have thought we had reached the stage here where we would be moving in the general direction of some measure of parity of status and remuneration between different types of workers with similar skills or qualifications. We have very skilled workers in the country now.  The standard of mathematics required by them is now substantially higher than that for entry into any of the State bodies in his country. While this narrowing of the gap between educational standards has occurred&mdash;this catching-up process regarding the standards of manual workers&mdash;the pay gap has widened and there has been no sign that any of the privileges of clerical employees, incremental scales, pensions or month's notice have been generally extended from the clerical workers to the manual workers.  This gives rise to the question as to what is our concept of social justice&mdash;more for those who <Col N="312" /> have, and grind the face of the poor? Is it to maintain and widen social distinctions?  I think that the Government and the trade unions must think on this again.  It must be said that this process has been brought about by the efforts of the trade unions on behalf of the organised clerical workers which has been much more successful than on behalf of the manual workers.</P>
    <P>We must consider, if we are moving towards an incomes policy, whether it does not involve some idea of narrowing the differentials and relating of remuneration ultimately not to social status, but to ability and educational qualifications earned in conditions of equality of opportunity which we are so far away from at the moment.  This is a matter on which we on these benches must speak out.  The Government have not faced up to this question. The Labour Party and the trade unions have not faced up to this question.  Somebody must say something on the issue of what has been happening here over the past five years. If something is not done about this the legitimate dissatisfaction of the manual workers could prove a destructive force and it would be difficult to reject the arguments they would put forward against the widening of the gap that has occurred.  The attitude of the trade unions with regard to the points I have been making has been somewhat perfunctory.  They realise this measure is one designed to prevent the development of social injustice operating to the detriment of the bulk of their members but they are inhibited from saying so.  Their reactions to this policy to some extent reflect this fact.</P>
    <P>The need to deal with this situation is all the more serious because of the fact that we are not simply dealing with clerical grades, who are not highly paid people, but we are dealing with a system under which any new increase becomes generalised upwards and upwards to the very top in the public service and, so far as one is aware, in State bodies also.  The recent status increases started at the bottom of the local authority service where the clerical entry maximum salary had fallen far behind the equivalent salary in the State bodies who had been <Col N="313" /> leap-frogging each other with great success.  They got an increase to bring them into line with State bodies.  This was finalised upwards through the local authority services to about county accountant level and, I think, further at a later stage, and then moved across to the clerical officers in the Civil Service and thence to the top rank in the Civil Service.  We are talking about the whole body of people engaged in administrative work in the whole public sector and the relationship between them and manual and skilled workers.</P>
    <P>This measure is justified as this stage and it is largely for the reasons I have stated.  I note the Minister in his speech made reference to moving towards a uniform arbitration system.  This would be justified at this stage.  I do not understand the Minister's attitude with regard to any form of compulsory arbitration.  I cannot see that an arbitration tribunal dealing with a number of grades should interfere, to any great extent, with collective bargaining.  Some proposals may be accepted and others rejected.  It is quite true that for some of the workers involved the results may be less satisfactory in outside bodies.  The purpose is to prevent leap-frogging but I do not think it involves any interference with collective bargaining.  I would like an assurance on this.</P>
    <P>I would also like an assurance from the Minister on a point in his speech. He said:</P>
    <P>The Government have, therefore, decided to defer and to request other employers in the public sector to defer, until the tribunal's report is available, the granting of any pay increases to groups whose rates are to be the subject of investigation by the tribunal or to directly related groups.</P>
    <P>He also says further down:</P>
    <P>The claims still to be heard by the board concerns small numbers in Departmental grades and are based largely on internal relativities with grades which have already had revisions.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the distinction between these two categories of directly related <Col N="314" /> groups.  There may be a distinction with regard to the groups who have had revisions but it is not clear to me. I would like to be clear whose claims are being affected and whose are not. There are, in fact, a number of consequential claims based on status, claims of people who have fallen out of line because of the general upward movement. I should like to know whether in fact they are not affected as is indicated. As far as I can see from the last thing the Minister said they are still open for negotiation.  This affects the police, whose claim some years ago brought them to a point which is still behind the status increases which have now been given.  It also affects the universities which have always had salaries in line with the Civil Service salaries but which have not obtained status increases.  The Minister should make it clear whether these groups are affected.  Do they come within the category to which he referred later?</P>
    <P>I should like to support this motion while claiming that it is much too late. I would also like to suggest, in the light of what has been happening in the past couple of months, that the Government ought to have another look at the Fine Gael policy&mdash;I read it again myself yesterday&mdash;because there are still many good things in it which could be used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come straight to the point.  I shall not give the House an analysis of the Fine Gael general election policy as Senator FitzGerald has done.  I shall say that we in the Labour Party are opposed to this motion.  The first point I wish to make&mdash;because the Minister left it a bit unclear in replying to the debate in the Dáil&mdash;is in relation to this question of consultation.  I want the Minister to accept this and to acknowledge it in reply to the debate, that there was no prior consultation with the trade unions on this decision of the Government.  The Minister, I believe, called in the National Employer-Labour Conference who were meeting that day on another subject.  He presented them with a Press release he was making that afternoon and answered some questions on the Press release.  It is quite wrong to give the <Col N="315" /> impression&mdash;and the impression has been given&mdash;that there was consultation with the trade unions on this decision of the Government to set up this tribunal.</P>
      <P>Why do we oppose this tribunal?  We oppose it because it is virtually a wage freeze, and we are opposed to wage freezes in a situation where there is no effective freeze on profits and on prices. If we are to have stabilisation of incomes, if we are to have an incomes policy, then it will have to apply to all incomes and not simply to wages and salaries or, as is provided here, to one section of salary-earners.  The newspaper heading the day following this announcement by the Government said: &ldquo;Wage freeze for civil servants&rdquo;. In fact, it is a wage freeze for many other people, the clerical people in a variety of semi-State undertakings in this country.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to accept that a problem exists.  The problem exists because there are a number of semi-State undertakings, some of them large, employing quite a number of clerical staff.  It is general policy among the semi-State undertaking that they recruit their clerical staff at Leaving Certificate standard.  There is the very natural desire that the clerical employees in the base grades, the recruitment grades, in the semi-State undertakings should aim to reach the level of salaries being paid by the best of semi-State undertakings, in other words an aim and a policy of levelling up.  That has been happening in the past few years among the semi-State undertakings. The wide differences that existed previously have been narrowed, not closed.  There are still some substantial differences but there is a contraction in the very unfair differences that applied some five or seven years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a natural thing.  It is understandable and the point should be made that the present level of salaries obtaining for the clerical people affected by this freeze of the Government and the appointment of the tribunal, has been obtained not as a result of strike action but in all cases <Col N="316" /> as a result of the findings of impartial tribunals through conciliation or arbitration machinery.  I think it is true to say that they have all been determined by negotiations or by some impartial person adjudicating on the issue and making a recommendation or a finding which has been accepted and implemented by both sides.  This problem could have been solved long ago by recognition among semi-State undertakings that there must be a levelling up and if there had been an acceptance on their part of this desirable policy and a working towards it, we probably would not have the situation we now have.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald seemed to criticise the levels of salaries paid in the semi-State undertakings.  He certainly gave me the impression he thought they were unduly high.  He was making a comparison with those paid in Great Britain and it seemed to me he was saying that clerical workers in this country are overpaid.  I am speaking from my own personal experience which is in regard to public transport and it is my task, unenviable sometimes, to try to get the best for clerical staff in public transport, in the railways, both north and south of the Border, and the north tends to follow the levels determined in Great Britain. If a clerical worker in the recruitment grade on one side of the Border in the south gets a maximum salary of £1,125 per annum, and a clerk in the base grade in the public transport on the other side or in British Railways across the water gets £730 per annum, it is very easy to say the man employed in CIE is very much better paid.  Of course, that is only half the story because to get £1,125 the man in CIE has to serve 21 years.  He starts off at £392 and by increments every year he eventually gets to this £1,125.  The British Railways figure of £730 is reached in the ninth year and it is paid both to male and female clerical workers and, if the person entering the service has GCE level which is approximate to the Leaving Certificate level here, he would get that maximum in the sixth year.  Therefore, it is not simply a comparison between figures <Col N="317" /> of £1,125 and £730.  It is a comparison of £1,125 after 21 years and £730 after six years and of £730 paid to both male and female clerks.  This is the dangerous sort of comparison that can be made.</P>

      <P>The Senator made a general comparison between clerical employees in this country and clerical employees in Britain and he went on to imply that clerical employees here are better paid than their counterparts in Great Britain.  I am saying that is not true.</P>

      <P>The equivalent salary is not higher, and we can discuss this somewhere else, possibly.  I am speaking from my own personal experience and quoting an instance of which I have personal knowledge.  What I say is largely, in both undertakings, a reflection of the salary levels obtaining within the different economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I go further in this?  I will not for a moment suppose that my members of CIE are very much better off than their counterparts across the Border.  They are living in different economies.  What springs to my mind immediately is that the salaried worker in this part of the country has to attempt to purchase his own house whereas his counterpart in the north is operating in a situation where he can rent a house from the housing trust or housing is available from the local authority without his having to mortgage his future for 30 or 40 years.  This will probably come up under the Housing Bill, but the situation here where the white collar workers have to mortgage their future to purchase houses is an encouragement to inflation.  They have a vested interest in inflation in trying to relieve the heavy burden placed on them in their younger years with low salaries or trying to purchase houses and make repayments to the local <Col N="318" /> authorities or to a housing society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must reject the comparisons made by Senator FitzGerald which might give the impression that clerical workers in the Republic are&mdash;and this again is implicit in his comparison at the expense of their fellow-workers&mdash;better off than their counterparts in Great Britain. Senator FitzGerald also referred to pension schemes, sick pay and these sort of fringe benefits which are general for salaried and clerical workers.  I would like to say that the trade union movement agrees that there should be a levelling up of these fringe benefits. It is quite wrong that manual workers simply because they are not regarded as salaried staffs, should not have the same cover in regard to superannuation, pensions, sick leave and other fringe benefits which are general for white collar workers.  There should be a levelling up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A problem has been created in another way apart from the natural desire and ambition for a levelling up of the position of these white collar clerical workers in the semi-State undertakings.  These semi-State undertakings are comparatively large employers of clerical staff.  They all have the same entry standard and there is obviously a comparison to be made and there must be a levelling up.  What is going to happen arising out of the appointment of this tribunal?  The ambition of these people to level up to the position obtaining in clerical rates of pay is going to be stymied.  It is all right to say that there should be an objective examination, that relativities should be established and recommended, but the motion goes on to talk about what will happen in the future.  It asks the tribunal to say what the absolute levels should be for the grades mentioned and what should be the appropriate basis for the application of any future general increases in pay.  This seems to me to mean that not alone are we <Col N="319" /> going to have a wage freeze for these people for the period while the tribunal will be examining the position but we are going to have a continuing wage freeze afterwards.  The tribunal is being asked to determine the absolute levels appropriate as the basis for the application of any future general increases in pay.  Suppose that the tribunal says, for example, that the relativity which at present exists between Aer Lingus and the ESB is not right and proper, and that Aer Lingus should in fact have a higher relativity, what happens? This does not mean that the relativity is going to be corrected.  It means that it will continue for some time, in other words, that for this section of workers the wage freeze will continue.  I should like the Minister to deal with that aspect of it in his reply.  Are we going to have a situation where the position that at present exists will be frozen, and the efforts of the unions to correct anomalies that might exist will be frustrated not alone up to March but for a long time after that?</P>
    <P>The motion we are asked to approve also refers to the staffing structure and circumstances of each employment.  The staffing structure will create quite a problem for the tribunal, because here again you can make very easy and false assumptions as Senator FitzGerald did, and say that, for example, in one of the semi-State undertakings the proportion in the base recruitment group is 50 per cent and in another undertaking it is 25 per cent.  On the face of it that would seem to mean that the people in the undertaking where the 25 per cent are in the base group have better opportunities for promotion than the others.  That again does not necessarily follow, because the promotional opportunities are to a great extent affected by the age structure of the staff in the higher grades.  In these semi-State undertakings the general position is that the recruitment grade is not a particular group.  It is part of the whole structure.  The people entering it have opportunities for promotion. They become in effect the administrators and the middle management of the semi-State undertaking. <Col N="320" /> They are very much involved in the promotional opportunities obtaining within their own employment because there is not, up to now anyway, any inter-movement between the semi-State undertakings.  They do not move from one employment to the other.  They enter a particular employment which is their whole field and their opportunities for the rest of their lives.  This question of the salary structure is going to create a problem.</P>
    <P>I wonder what exactly the Minister has in mind in asking the tribunal to have regard to the circumstances of each employment.  These semi-State undertakings are set up to do a particular job.  Bord na Móna was set up to develop the bogs and provide fuel and, incidentally, does a very good job.  These bodies operate in particular fields and in different circumstances, in the sense that one undertaking can make a profit on its operations while another, no matter how efficient or cooperative the staff may be, cannot make a profit but must possibly depend upon a subsidy.  It would be quite wrong that the tribunal should be asked to have regard to the profitability or otherwise of a semi-State undertaking in a field laid down by the Oireachtas.  Each is given a certain job to do and the circumstances vary in the fields in which they operate.  The degree of profitability has no necessary relationship to the efficiency of the undertaking, and it would be quite inequitable and not acceptable in fact that the profitability or lack of it should affect salaries or the relativity of the salaries paid to the clerical staff in a particular undertaking.</P>
    <P>For those reasons we oppose the motion to set up this tribunal.  We think it is unfair to one section of the community.  It is freezing the incomes of one section of the community, a section who obtained their present standards by way of recommendations or decisions of impartial tribunals and conciliation and arbitration machinery. It is unfair to single them out from the community as a whole and we, therefore, oppose the motion before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Murphy has <Col N="321" /> made my task a very easy one.  I should like to congratulate him on his excellent presentation of the very serious aspects of the problem posed to the community as a whole and particularly those affected by the present motion. I am glad he closed on the note he did because that is one of the most important and objectionable features of the motion.  It is undoubtedly discriminatory. It is defended by the Government because, they say, it is intended to cure the leap-frogging which they say originated with the class of people to whom the motion is directed.</P>
      <P>I wish to say that in fairness the Government must realise that leap-frogging, if it has occurred to any severe extent, has not been confined to this sector.  Does anybody in the House have to be reminded that we have had leap-frogging in prices and profits for quite a considerable number of years?  Has anybody said anything about it or attempted to cure it or imposed restrictions on the people who benefited from that sort of operation? In my candid opinion that is the most serious and objectionable feature of the motion&mdash;the fact that it has been confined to the people who will be affected by the motion.</P>
      <P>The second aspect I wish to emphasise, as Senator Murphy did, is the importance of the Government's realisation and admission that as far as the claims, whether after the eighth round in necessary adjustments or in the ninth round, are concerned in this sector they have had to be justified publicly either before conciliation and arbitration or the Labour Court. Nobody would accuse any section of the group affected by the motion of having grabbed something to themselves by their own strength and determination, something they were not entitled to.  They had to justify it before one of these fair tribunals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is more than can be said for the adjustments that have been made in other respects.  Here I am alluding particularly to the group affected by this motion, in his presentation of which the Minister states that wage and salary increases have in fact outstripped <Col N="322" /> the level of national production. I am not in a position to contradict that statement and I shall not pretend to do so, but it is only fair to point out that if these levels have been outstripped they have not been outstripped by this group alone but by thousands in receipt of wages and salaries from industry and by thousands of others in profitable businesses.</P>
    <P>If the Government were serious in their alleged desire to do justice to the country there was only one way they could have done it and that was to impose the same restrictions on every section of the community&mdash;the profit-maker as well as the wage-earner, the wage-earner as well as the salary-earner&mdash;so that everybody would be asked to contribute equally to the cost of putting the economy back on its feet.</P>
    <P>This motion is discriminatory and because it is it has produced a lot of suspicion and distrust of the Government. It is right the Government should be told that.  The people affected by it resent the fact that they have been singled out as one sector of the community for this type of treatment.  They can hardly be blamed for not alone resenting it but, as I expect they will do, for reacting violently to it.  One of the great dangers is that we may well witness the death of law and order in the regulation of salary claims in the public service which up to now has been the basis for conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>Do the Government realise this yet? They should have looked at this aspect because if harm is done here to the principle of conciliation and arbitration it will be irreparable damage and do incalculable harm to the economy of the country.  If the Government force this sector to act militantly this may well be the upshot.  For those reasons I am glad to have had the opportunity of endorsing the points made by Senator Murphy.  One final point I should like to make is that whatever the Government may say, this motion imposes a virtual standstill so let us be frank and honest enough to admit it.  That is what the sector <Col N="323" /> affected by this resent and deplore.  If there must be a standstill it is only fair and proper that it should apply to every sector, big and small, rural and urban.  That is what I deplore in the presentation of the motion before us.  It is what the people affected deplore and resent.  They will react rather badly and even at this late stage the Government would be well advised to go back and look at the problem again before they do real damage.</P>

      <P>Senator FitzGerald, in starting his speech, gave the impression that he was not opposed to the motion but that, at the same time, he was not prepared to give it his full approval.  This is rather typical of the approach of the Party to which he now belongs.  In his historical review of the advance during the last six or seven years, I do not think he could be regarded as being objective but when he went on to the economic programme the facts he gave us were interesting. He was not in full agreement with Senator Murphy.  His facts appear to be well supported, very interesting and apposite to the subject.  I have looked up how the clerical officers in the Civil Service have fared in the past few years and I found that when the last Government before Fianna Fáil were leaving office in 1957, clerical officers had a certain salary and now, at the top at any rate, they have practically doubled that salary.  The percentage is much higher than that given by Senator FitzGerald.  His percentage may have been correct on the average but on the top salary it is too low.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may well be.  The big fault Senator FitzGerald found with the Government is that they did not act soon enough.  We all see that now.  It would have been better if something could have been done three or four years ago.  However, the Government are in fairly good company because a great many Governments have made the same mistake and find themselves in the same <Col N="324" /> trouble.  During the years Senator FitzGerald spoke of, 1961 and 1962, I never got a warning from Congress or from other parties concerned that we were going too quickly or paying too much.  It is well to have sense after the event.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy admits that a problem exists but does not agree with the solution proposed by the Government. He said it is only natural for any group to try to bring their pay up to the amount paid by other employers. We all agree that is natural but the difficulty here was that when B and C succeeded in getting their salaries brought up to the level of A, A came forward and said there always had been a differential, that they wanted it maintained, and then B and C came forward again.  You had, therefore, as the Minister mentioned in the Dáil, this leap-frogging contest between the various bodies.  It became necessary that something should be done.  I do not know whether the disagreement between Senator Murphy and Senator FitzGerald with regard to the salaries paid on public transport is right on one side or the other.  It would appear to me from Senator Murphy's argument that, after nine years, they are better off, but not up to nine years.  I may be wrong but I assume that is the argument.</P>

      <P>I thought there was something in what Senator Murphy <Col N="325" /> said but now I am beginning to see that there was not much in it.  Senator Murphy goes on to criticise some of the wording of this motion.  He first dealt with the second part&mdash;the absolute levels of pay for the grades mentioned and so on.  He refers to this as a wage freeze.  Surely, when there is a wage freeze.  Surely, when a motion says &ldquo;... that with due regard as aforesaid, are appropriate as the basis for the application of any future general increase in pay...&rdquo; you cau hardly call it a wage freeze?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>A correction: a freeze on the existing anomalies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrJamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather a fine point for the Labour Party to hold on to that there is a wage freeze.  If the Government think that this matter can be regulated better by fixing a basic wage, or agreeing on a basic wage, whatever it may be, they are not prohibited from saying it may be higher or it may be lower but I do not see how the basic pay on which increases will be awarded in the future could be a wage freeze.  That is the point.</P>
      <P>Then the Senator goes on to talk about &ldquo;the staffing structure and the circumstances of each employment.&rdquo; I think that is necessary.  Surely, if the tribunal goes into this, in all probability one of these bodies will come along and say: &ldquo;Our people are doing work which is higher than the clerical officer grade are doing in the other place&rdquo;.  Therefore, we must examine that and see if they are doing work which is higher than a clerical officer should be or is paid to do.  Is it not, therefore, necessary to have those words there, that they would examine the circumstances of each employment of the staffing structure?  In criticising the wording of the motion, therefore, I do not see that Senator Murphy has any very important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Crowley went on to talk about the adjustments that were made. It is true that, after these increases had been given, the eighth round, in particular, a number of these bodies came along for adjustments.  They said they were treated badly in comparison <Col N="326" /> with another body.  When B and C got their salaries brought up to the level of A, then A came and said that they had been on a higher scale.  That is what caused the trouble and it was necessary to do something about it,</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hate to tell an arbitrator that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrJamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear to me &mdash;in fact it did appear to me before I left office&mdash;that some authority should be found to settle these relativities.  If they are all doing the same type of work and can all be regarded as clerical officers, then it would seem to any sensible person that they should all be paid the same scales.  It is possible that some of them might be paid more than others and that is a matter for the tribunal to decide.</P>
      <P>It would be a great thing, indeed, for the future if, these relativities being fixed, they would be there, then, as a guide for future arbitrators who might be awarding an increase in pay to clerical officers generally.  These people have been singled out, we are told. Well, the clerical officers generally in this country are a big body of people. There is a big proportion in the Civil Service, a big proportion in the State bodies, in local authorities and in private employment.  In big organisations, generally the same pay is given. If you take carpenters, plumbers or painters, the same pay, practically, is given all round.  As there is not the same machinery for deciding that in the case of clerical officers, maybe this is the best way it should be decided. I think we should at least let the tribunal report.  No sanction is laid down on anybody as to how this report should be received.  We want to see the report first and then we shall see what will be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a standstill&mdash;I think this is what Senator Crowley referred to&mdash;for three months: that is true.  However, I think anybody would say it would be rather an oversight if the Government, who put down this motion, left out that part of it and then, while the tribunal was sitting, some section of those clerical officers came along and got an increase; in other words, a <i>a fait accompli</i><Col N="327" /> before the report was presented, and especially as the clerical officers have all got an increase within very recent times, with the ninth round, as it is known, as Senators are aware.</P>
    <P>There is no increase due until the ninth round expires next June.  I do not see that any hardship at all is inflicted on clerical officers, therefore, in saying that there should be no increase between now and next March. Therefore, I do not think we have had any very cogent or strong arguments that would induce us to reconsider the passing of this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is an attempt so far as it goes, to deal with a problem we all know exists. This problem has played a great part in creating the spiral with which we are faced now.  Consequently, the effort by the Government to assume some responsibility for State-sponsored bodies is something we welcome, even though it comes very late.  Too often in this House and elsewhere we have the spectacle of the Government washing their hands of the acts of State-sponsored bodies.  Indeed one of the main justifications advanced for the recent increases over and above the 12 per cent, that is, the status increases, as they are called, was that the semi-State bodies had already set the pace: in other words a confession that the Government machinery, as constituted at present, is rather incapable of handling effectively the vast complex of semi-State organisations that has grown up here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see something more positive emerge from that and I think many times in this House and elsewhere we have called for a Committee of the Oireachtas to assume the task of regulating the activities of semi-State bodies, to act as a co-ordinating body with regard to their grievances and so on.  That is long overdue and the Minister might well consider following up what is attempted here by calling on the Oireachtas, and especially on the Seanad, for aid in an effort to evolve a satisfactory means of dealing with these bodies. &ldquo;Dealing&rdquo;<Col N="328" /> is perhaps the wrong word.  I do not impute anything wrong but I say that the fact that semi-State bodies are not under Government control and are under Government control, that they are in a type of no-man's-land, calls for more Parliamentary control than we have at the moment.  That can be provided for by a Committee of the Oireachtas and the Seanad might well play a good part in such a Committee.</P>
    <P>I am not happy that this motion relates only to the recruitment clerical grades in these bodies.  Surely this is only a part of our problem?  Our problem is the clerical, the administrative, the professional and technical grades and how these are in line.  If there has been leap-frogging between bodies, it has certainly been leap-frogging by the clerical grades over the professional grades who have suffered by reason of the fact that they are not as highly organised as the clerical grades. Numerically, they were never strong enough to press their claims as forcibly as the clerical grades.  Consequently, the above average young man finds that the clerical grade provides him in fact with a better ultimate chance of success than if he were to try to exploit his talents further by going on to take a degree, become a teacher, an engineer or anything else.</P>
    <P>This is the relativity we need and if we are doing something at present with regard to these workers, why not have a look at it once and for all and let us see the real relativity, a relativity that encourages a young man to go and study and acquire a degree or a profession and build himself up in that way?  That means he will be better able to make a contribution to the advancement of the economy. Surely it is an anomaly today that the pay of the recruitment grade of clerical workers in CIE is £1,125 when technicians, of whom there is such a great shortage at the moment, rarely attain £1,125, or £22 a week.  This figure will be attained only by those who have qualified as senior technicians, with BSc of London as their qualification. You will see all this set out in an advertisement in yesterday's paper by the Institute for Industrial Research <Col N="329" /> and Standards looking for technicians and setting out the gradings.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald posed a question as to whether mathematics for technicians had to be of a higher grade than those with honours Leaving Certificate entering the various semi-State bodies. It has, of course, as can be seen if you look at the standard of the Intermediate Certificate of the BSc in London.  It is indeed a very high standard, much beyond our Leaving Certificate standard.  You will find that the incentive for those people with honours mathematics in the Leaving Certificate to train themselves to become technicians for the future is not very great compared with the incentive there is if they apply to become a clerical officer in either the Civil Service or a semi-State body.</P>
    <P>That is all wrong.  There is a very pertinent phrase here and I should like to see much more emphasis on it. I hope the tribunal will place great emphasis on it.  I refer to the circumstances of each employment.  The circumstances of clerical employment in this country are, to my mind, very perilous, because more than any other group, they are going to take more and more the full brunt of the second technological revolution with the computers, with their enormous capacity for filing away records and presenting them to the man who wants them in a minute.  That is primarily what many of the clerical grades are doing.  They do this work for their superiors: they dig out papers; they look after the files and bring them to their superiors when required.  This, it seems, will all be mechanised in the future and will cause considerable redundancy in the clerical grades.  Therefore, it seems, again, that the circumstances of each employment in the clerical grade are most difficult today.  What is really called for, in relation to clerical workers, in an advancing and progressive economy is a tremendous range of retraining schemes and encouragement to try to get a second string to their bows while yet in their teens and capable of going to night school or elsewhere to acquire the necessary skill.  They could equip themselves for <Col N="330" /> something else in the technical line.</P>
    <P>These are the main problems which should be agitating clerical workers today.  I think there is a freeze for three months in this proposal but I do not think those grades can have a serious objection to it.  So far, the Government have shown complete reluctance to face the same problem in relation to profits and I must say it is highly demoralising to me to read of those speculations on the Stock Exchange, the take-over bids by private bodies who buy up existing businesses in quick take-overs and within a year or two sell them again at very great profit.  The Minister for Finance must be there at every take-over bid to see that he gets for the citizens of this country his fair share of the proceeds of the venture.</P>
    <P>Only in the past two days, in the Minister's constituency, we saw a threat to one of the oldest business houses in Cork, namely, T. Lyons &amp; Company. As far as I know&mdash;I am still awaiting more facts and figures&mdash;it is a case of a group of cute businessmen getting in and buying the shares and standing to get double or treble the value of those shares within a year or a year and a half.  The result will be that another 80 people will be thrown on the scrapheap in Cork city because this business will be closed down.</P>
    <P>Sacrifices are needed from the various sections of the community and we should all be prepared to make sacrifices in the future.  The Government should set the headline by introducing a capital gains tax here.  That will show realism in dealing with such speculators.  Apart from that, I welcome this measure as far as it goes but I would like to see the Minister extend it along the lines I have set out, at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this resolution is to have a job evaluation in relation to clerical staffs of the Civil Service and State-owned companies in the hope that this evaluation would be of assistance generally throughout the country.  In other words, it is the first step in a modified incomes policy.  An incomes policy is <Col N="331" /> not something that can be written out in one chapter and submitted as a Bill to the Dáil and Seanad.  It is something that must gradually evolve, something that must have the good will not only of the parties concerned but of the country at large.  Heretofore in so far as salaried grades in the Civil Service and in State-owned bodies are concerned, there was the unhappy situation of those unions that were strongest attacking the sectors that could least oppose, claiming increases and insisting on those increases because the country could be held up to ransom. Thus certain wages and salaries were increased.  Others then came along and said: &ldquo;There was a differential between those people and us originally. They claimed they were doing as much work as we were doing, that they had as much responsibility as we had, and they have got their salaries practically on a par with ours.  Heretofore there was always a differential. We always had a claim for a status increase above them and we now want that status increase.&rdquo;  The status increase was given and then the others came along and there was this constant practice of leap-frogging which has led to the utmost confusion.  That confusion was aggravated by the fact that there were separate conciliatory bodies dealing with each section.  In many instances these bodies followed different principles.  Their findings were not correlated.  They came to different conclusions on different premises.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this measure is to achieve a simple job evaluation.  If the basic salary for one grade is £x then it should be possible to ascertain that the basic salary in another section should be £x + £y, thereby evolving some system that would be based on justifiable principles, that would be based on the education required, the work and responsibility involved, the prospects of promotion and all other factors which would enter into the normal job evaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested by Senator FitzGerald that this has come too late, that it should have come five or six years ago.  He says it should have come when the arbitration system was <Col N="332" /> first introduced.  I do not agree with that.  I believe that if it had come then it would have come too early, that people were not prepared for it.  In the first place, this is a thing that must be accepted by the community at large.  In the second place, since the arbitration system was evolved, the various sectors have come before the arbitrators and their cases have been presented in the strongest possible light.  All that information is available there.  No sector will present any aspect or any feature which would detract from its importance, or from its claim to higher pay.</P>
    <P>I have heard Senator Murphy this evening suggest that £730 as a maximum in England after six or seven years is as good as £1,125 after 21 years.  We must assume that one climbs to the £1,125 gradually.  Perhaps, after eight or nine years, what started at £400 has reached £730.  It would have reached it two or three years earlier in England or in Northern Ireland but it continues to climb.  There is a deficit for two or three years but it continues to climb for another eight, nine or ten years until it reaches £1,125, on which the pension is ultimately based.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy has put forward arguments that suggest that that £730 is as effective as the £1,125.  These are the kind of arguments that have been put forward by the various grades before these arbitration bodies.  The records and findings of all these bodies and the evidence given before them are now available.  This is the sort of job evaluation that, if it is to be done effectively, must be done quickly, because if it is not done quickly there will be the constant leap-frogging in the meantime.  Therefore, it could not have been done effectively at the early stage suggested by Senator FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald also suggested that prices should have been controlled very much earlier, if I am correct in my interpretation of what he said.  While that is not relevant to the motion before the House, may I say that his argument in that respect is slightly subjective.  The Prices Bill was introduced in 1958 and I am not aware of any strong objection on its introduction <Col N="333" /> that it was not effective for all purposes.  Price control is not something you can have every and any day of the week in a free economy.  It should and could be exercised only in special circumstances and only on special goods.  It is not a thing you can have invariably, otherwise you depart from free competition which is the surest way of keeping prices down, because if you fix prices by statute or order what you fix as the maximum price in 99 cases out of 100 will become the minimum price.  The surest way to keep prices down is if a man cannot find a market for his goods unless he is prepared to sell lower than his competitors will sell.  There are special cases and special circumstances when prices should and must be controlled&mdash;where there are monopolies, where people are taking advantage of wage increases in order to have an excuse to increase prices to something they should not be&mdash;but in the normal course of events price control is something that should be used sparingly and only in special circumstances.</P>
    <P>He refers again also to the increase in prices as a result of the 12½ per cent wage increase of the ninth round, and said that prices should then have been controlled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

      <P>I think that Senator FitzGerald will agree with me that when price committees were established <Col N="334" /> under the 1958 Act there were always representatives of the trade union movement on them, and in many instances&mdash;again I am subject to correction&mdash;where matters came before those committees it was held that the prices charged were completely justifiable. That in so far as I am aware, has been the history of the matter.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party apparently opposed this resolution on the ground that it leads to a wage freeze.  I cannot see anything whatsoever in the wording or phrasing of this resolution to justify the use of the words &ldquo;wage freeze&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious that while the tribunal is sitting that except in those instances where claims are already, so to speak, in the pipeline, already being investigated, we should not have a continuation of the leap-frogging that has been going on up to the moment.  You must have stability for some short period, and as the agreement on the ninth round carries on for a further four or five months and as the report of this tribunal will be expected prior to that time I cannot see any great hardship is being done.  I think there is no justification whatsoever in those circumstances for the user of the term &ldquo;wage freeze&rdquo;. I think in fact that it is unfortunate that it has been used.  We all frequently use terms for the purpose of giving a completely different colour and taking matters out of their context, and I think that the use of the phrase &ldquo;wage freeze&rdquo; in the context of this resolution is a complete distortion of the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in introducing this motion both in the Dáil and here gave as his major underlying reason for it the aim of achieving &ldquo;a more orderly development of income increases&rdquo;.  I would agree, therefore, with Senator Nash that it is not a question of at any rate permanently freezing wages, but the suggestion is that there should be a more orderly development of income increases.  There is also the suggestion, <Col N="335" /> and I think that this is what Senator Murphy was objecting to, that there should be a freezing of status, of existing grades, a stabilising which might not in every case be justified.  I notice that in talking about this more orderly development of income increases the Minister has referred, either directly or indirectly, only to wages and salaries.  This point has been made by Senator Quinlan, and I think well made.</P>
      <P>There is no question in the Minister's mind apparently about a more orderly development of the rush for profits, the grab for unearned income out of land, or takeover bids or any type of profit legitimate or illegitimate.  To think in terms of salary increases only when one is professing to be speaking about a more orderly development of income increases would seem to be speaking of only part of the problem.  Senator Crowley has wisely put to the Minister, and the Minister should comment on it, the question as to why this temporary standstill, to last until March 1st at any rate, should not be of a general character and should not apply to dividends and profits as much as to wages and salaries.  I think that that requires an answer.  It is obvious in our economy that there is an outcry if a demand for more pay by one section or another leads to a strike which inconveniences the public and holds up the economy.  But there is no outcry, or very little, certainly none from the Government, if a demand for more profits leads to that process which might be called the process of cell division whereby there is an issue of new shares, sometimes an issue of share for share, new interest-bearing shares within a company for which the money, instead of being reinvested in the company and ploughed back into it, is shovelled out under this method, which is in fact merely a concealed or partially concealed method of grossly inflating the profits taken from a particular industry.  This does not cause a shock.  It only causes a shock if the worker demands a greater share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that the real or fundamental purpose of this resolution and the aim of setting up the tribunal <Col N="336" /> is that given in the words of the Minister today, and which he also told the Dáil.  When he said that &ldquo;the Government have decided to defer and to request other employers in the public sector to defer until the tribunal's report is available, the granting of any pay increases&rdquo; to groups whose rates are to be subject to investigation. The Government says: &ldquo;We will defer any further wage increases for these people, and we appeal to employers in the public sector to defer also.&rdquo;  I suggest that this is a delaying process. The Government could in fact come to terms straight away by negotiation with organised labour on this whole question of grading salaries and so on, but this tribunal is a way of long-fingering the problem, putting it off until March 1st, and then the time for the Government to receive the report, for the report to be published and debated and so on, in the hope, Micawber-like, that something meanwhile will turn up.</P>
    <P>I suggest that one of the Government's failures, as illustrated here, is their hope always that something external will turn up&mdash;the Common Market, the Free Trade Area with Britain, which as I mentioned before, seems to be a new phrase for an old idea, the old idea of a United Kingdom. The feeling is that sometime the Government is going to be saved by something external, and not by the Government's own activities, so the Government says: &ldquo;Let us set up a tribunal and something will turn up in six months' time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator develop his suggestion about the Government coming to terms with the trade unions in a private way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to deal with that.  I do not believe it to be unreasonable.  Senator Quinlan spoke frankly of the semi-State companies, and said that any time any member of the Oireachtas asks a question about them he or she is told the Minister has no responsibility and cannot do anything about it.  In regard to semi-State companies, there is no Ministerial responsibility.  There should be Government <Col N="337" /> responsibility, and I say to the Minister that the shouldering of responsibility for these semi-State companies could and should quite easily be assumed.  They could be recognised for what they are, State companies, with Government responsibility for negotiations on grades and rates within these companies just as in the Civil Service. I believe this should be, and that the Government should thus negotiate and come to agreements with the organised trade unions.  However, the Government prefer to say these are only semi-State bodies, that the Government have no authority, no responsibility, and so the Government push the thing off to somebody else in a way that does not seem to me to be efficient.</P>
      <P>After 40 years of independence, the Irish economy can be said to be slow but sure&mdash;slow in almost every case to take action, and in almost every case sure to be too late.  Senator Murphy quite rightly took up a point made by Senator FitzGerald in a speech which I thought contained a lot of valuable material.  I do not think Senator FitzGerald was justified, however, in making comparisons of salary scales as between clerical workers in Britain and clerical workers here.  Clerical workers in Britain have access to free health services, unemployment and welfare benefits while clerical workers here enjoy only a tiny proportion of such benefits.  Therefore, pound for pound, clerical workers here and in Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but we have to pay attention to the <i>caveat</i><Col N="338" /> entered by Senator Murphy and not forget the health, educational and unemployment facilities available in Britain and to a considerably lesser extent here.  Our economy here, I am sorry to say, can be regarded as a marginal economy&mdash;marginal on Britain's economy.  Very largely we have invisible exports such as tourism and remittances sent by emigrants in Britain and elsewhere.  Quite an astonishing proportion of our so-called national product is made up&mdash;and our balance of payments is made considerably better&mdash;by these two factors which really represent money coming in from outside.</P>
      <P>I also notice there is a marked contrast in this regard between Government preaching and Government example.  The Government preach that we must keep down demands for money because if there are higher salaries the people will be spending more money and this will lead to more imports than are necessary.  But the same Government introduced a turnover tax and it was quite obvious to anybody knowing anything about commerce and trade that the turnover tax would be regarded as something that would add markedly more to our prices structure than was justified.  Furthermore, the Government themselves made no apology when they themselves put up postal and telephone rates, for instance, not by 2½ per cent or 12 per cent but by 25 per cent and 33? per cent.  The Minister and others are very keen that our industry and commerce should be kept competitive but in a matter like this, if you compare postal rates in Ireland, where they used to be lower than elsewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>One would think we were pocketing the increases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no suggestion that you are pocketing the increases, and I regard the interjection as not very soundly based.  The point I am making is a point the Government are fond of making&mdash;that to keep our trade and commerce competitive we have to keep down our basic costs.  The Government are putting up those costs to the ordinary <Col N="339" /> businessman who, some time ago, could post more cheaply than his colleague in Britain.  The postal services are the lifeblood of trade, but the Government have put up the charges not just to the level of the British rates but well beyond it.  This seems to knock the stuffing out of the Government preaching about keeping basic costs competitively low because, by example, they think nothing of themselves adding 25 per cent to a basic cost.  It is, of course, nonsense to say I implied that they are putting it in their pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean it in that way.  The Senator knows the context in which I made it.  These increases were sought for community purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the Minister is saying that wherever we like, we can trammel in trade by means of higher basic expenses, higher than in Britain, on the ground that the State are short of funds.</P>
      <P>I turn to another point, the import levies which are being introduced.  I remember sitting in this House and listening to Deputy Sweetman as Minister for Finance telling us how necessary the levies were and Fianna Fáil Senators receiving his remarks with a certain amount of scepticism.  Now they are imposing the levies and I find it hard to distinguish between the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael policies. Will the Minister say on this occasion that it is necessary for the Exchequer to impose the levies or that it is because there is an inflationary tendency to import too much?  I get the impression that as between two Governments, when Fine Gael were in coalition and Fianna Fáil by themselves, a curiously similar pattern seems to exist.  Perhaps this is the reason, rather than the electoral system here as in Canada, why the electorate find it very difficult to entrust a large majority to either of the Parties, when these seem so strikingly similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister&mdash; the point has been well made by my fellow socialist, Senator Quinlan&mdash; whether the Government have considered the question of introducing a <Col N="340" /> capital gains tax, and if not why not? Senator Quinlan is quite right.  It is something that should be faced.  I have not heard any Government spokesman being concerned with it.  A question linked with it relates to land speculation. The fact is that a great amount of community development, paid for by the taxpayers, has put large profits into the pockets of land speculators buying land around a community development area and then selling it, without having added an iota to the value of the land itself.  Do the Government intend to do anything about this?</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald said he is glad the Government have decided to &ldquo;tackle the problem.&rdquo;  Have the Government really decided to tackle the problem?  Is this the way to tackle it?  I do not think it is.</P>
    <P>Now, in relation to the sale of any commodity it is usual to say, within our system, that the sale value of the commodity is dependent upon two major factors, the quality of the commodity and the need for it or the demand, the quality of the product and the demand existing for it.  It is true that there is a common fallacy whereby people sometimes fail to distinguish between two kinds of demand, the human demand which may not be backed by money, and the effective demand, which is the demand that tends in practice to be satisfied, which is the demand of the people with money.  When you say that in the system of supply and demand, a demand is satisfied by the supply, you mean the demand of the people with money.  Within a free enterprise, a profit motive system, effective demand is satisfied, demand of the money classes, except in such situations where, by reason of State or municipal interference, subsidisation, demand is satisfied at points where private enterprise fails to do so: I think of slum clearance and so forth.  In general, it is an economic proposition in a society such as ours to produce expensive, luxury, high-powered cars but not an economic proposition for private enterprise to supply our housing demands.  It is an economic proposition to supply luxury hotels but not ordinary housing, recreational <Col N="341" /> facilities, swimming pools, and so on: these will not be satisfied by the private sector.  Within this system of ours, of which I am critical, we are told that the producer or the seller of the commodity is entitled to the &ldquo;market value&rdquo; of his product or the commodity.  Very well, I say.  Within this system, the same should apply to the only commodity that the worker, whether he be clerical or manual, has for sale, namely, his work, his skill. He is entitled to its market value, which depends on the quality of the commodity, his skill, and the demand for it.  If you do not interfere with profits, if you do not interfere with speculation, if you do not interfere with the satisfaction of the demands of the greedy for large unearned increments, on the grounds that these people are merely getting the market value of the product or the service concerned, then you have no right to interfere with the worker's right to sell his commodity, namely, his work, at the highest price he can get for it.  Therefore, I am in favour of collective bargaining by the workers on the basis of the market value of the commodity involved, the work, skilled, unskilled or semi-skilled.</P>
    <P>Therefore, and I conclude with this. it strikes me that the setting up of such a tribunal would prove largely a waste of time; I hesitate to say a deliberate waste of time but I would say a waste of time convenient to the Government, because they could say for the next three months: &ldquo;We must wait until the tribunal has made its recommendations, or we must wait until the tribunal has printed its report. We promise to do nothing until the recommendations have been fully examined.&rdquo;  The danger lies in always postponing, putting off, deferring from one day to another, in the hope, like Mr. Micawber, that something will turn up.  I believe it should be perfectly possible for the Government to have direct negotiation with organised labour on all these questions of grading relativities among the workers in Government service and in the semi-State bodies, which I think should be more fully State bodies.  This would be a valuable negotiation but, in order <Col N="342" /> to bring it to full fruition, the Government, in relation to these companies, must assume their full responsibilities, and not stand aside and pretend that in relation to them no Ministerial responsibility is involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the Government, a follow-up to another Fianna Fáil Government, have, for a period of office, sought to impose a wage freeze or a wage control and, on every occasion on which they sought authority in Dáil Éireann or in the Oireachtas or through the Oireachtas for the imposition of control on the wages of the workers, they were either beaten or were forced to withdraw the proposed legislation.  I think it is a tragedy that they are about to succeed for the first time in their vicious plan to control and freeze the pay packets of the workers and to utilise the serious financial state of the country in order to have an excuse to bring in that type of legislation that would enable them to carry out this vendetta against the workers.</P>
      <P>Let us be quite clear about it that in the Minister's opening statement he sought to suggest, in his own words, that the deficit in the external trade and payments is so serious that the injection of fresh purchasing power cannot go on.  Why use those two very significant terms when you are dealing with what the Minister and the Taoiseach describe as a mere attempt to prevent leap-frogging in wage demands amongst certain categories of the Civil Service and State and semi-State bodies?  If it is merely a question of this leap-frogging, why is it necessary at this stage for the Government to issue a directive to all over whom they have control to allow no increase in wages or salaries until the report of this tribunal is available?  The Minister states that the Government have, therefore, decided to defer, and request other employers in the public sector to defer, until the tribunal's report is available, the granting of any pay increases to groups whose rates are to be the subject of investigation by the tribunal or to directly related groups.</P>

      <P>No matter how Fine Gael may try to wriggle out of this, we had the position here today that Senator FitzGerald, a leading Fine Gael representative in the Seanad, put up a damned good case against this proposal and, yet when he was finishing, he said that Fine Gael would support it.  I am satisfied that what I have said in the past 18 to 20 years is correct, namely, that there is no difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in their policy with regard to the workers of this country.  They are both reactionaries, Tories, years behind even the present Tory outfit in Opposition in England.</P>
      <P>Nobody denies that this country is in a serious mess unless it is the Minister for Finance who says we have a touch of inflation.  There was no sun this year worth talking about, so I will not suggest the Minister is suffering from a little touch of sunstroke when he comes out with that kind of rubbish.  The fact is that the situation is serious financially and any way we may like to look at it.  Why, however, is it that we must deal with categories of civil servants and allied groups as a major means of remedying this serious economic situation in which we find ourselves?  Are there not prior matters to be examined and dealt with?  Are the culprits, in this serious situation that is arising, the lower grade civil servants and the workers in the ESB and in Bord na Móna?  Are they the culprits?  Would that bring about the serious situation which we know obtains and which leaves this country in a worse position economically than it has been in during the last 25 to 30 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last July, in the other House, the Taoiseach informed the Dáil that the position did not look too good and that the Government had certain <Col N="344" /> measures under consideration.  He made this speech on the 13th July.  He said:</P>
    <P>Certain measures or proposals are under consideration to solve the serious financial crisis and the deficit in the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>At the same time as the Taoiseach was talking the Central Bank issued its report pointing out that the Government must take action on the question of incomes.  That report of the Central Bank and that warning were followed up in the bulletin issued in the last fortnight by the banks in which, on several pages, they exhort the Government to deal with the question of incomes. I am not saying it was because of any direction by the banks but certainly the pressure exerted by the banks must have played a great part in persuading the Government to take a decision because in their White Paper on Capital Expenditure the question of incomes is repeated on numerous occasions on pages 5, 6 and 7.  Paragraph 17 states:</P>
    <P>Amongst those of particular relevance to public finance, reference has already been made to the need for avoiding further increases in personal incomes at present.</P>
    <P>On page 6, paragraph 13, this document states:</P>
    <P>This, of course, is a tentative estimate which will need to be reconsidered in the light of what appears in various fields over the coming year, not least in the field of incomes.</P>
    <P>This is in relation to the current balance of payments deficit of the nature of £20,000,000.  In paragraph 12 they say:</P>
    <P>The demand on spending power arising from incomes is on the upward trend and it is essential that this trend is slowed down to accord more closely with the actual current rise in national productivity.</P>
    <P>What are the Government doing?  The Government are introducing a piece of what I call petty, vindictive legislation and carrying out what the Taoiseach said on the 13th July, one of the measures by which he proposed to solve the balance of payments problem. <Col N="345" /> The evidence of further increases in personal incomes is one of the major measures announced on the 13th July by the Taoiseach.  I know of no other legislation or proposal to hold incomes. I have heard nothing about holding down the salaries of higher civil servants. I do not want to be taken as criticising higher civil servants when I speak about this but I have heard of no criticism or attempt by the Government to deal with the question of incomes in the higher paid groups in the State service.  I heard no word from the Government or the banks in relation to the payment of dividends or any examination of the directors' fees or the other means utilised by companies to pay, shall we say, expenses, in various forms, to their directors or employees.  It makes me very depressed to think commercial banks in this country have, for the last six months, exhorted the Government to deal with the question of incomes, to prevent the workers' wages from rising any further.  While the banks were preaching their own profits were increasing, their own dividends were expanding and their own directors' fees were rising.</P>
    <P>Our Government, to their eternal shame, took the advice of the commercial banks on an issue of that nature and proceeded to hit those sections of our community &mdash; even though they may be well organised as far as trade unions are concerned&mdash; which are not the strongest and are not in a position at the present time to hit back or hold their own in this type of legislation.  The fact is that they will not realise what the real implications of this legislation or this proposal are until it is put into operation.</P>
    <P>I regret when this case presented itself that the Party which now pretends to talk about a just society is prepared when the die is cast or when the chips are down to turn round and support the Government in a reprehensible proposal&mdash;that is all I can call it&mdash;of this nature.  Somebody in the Dáil described &ldquo;tribunal&rdquo; as a dirty word in Irish politics.  Of course, it is a dirty word in Irish politics.  The first <Col N="346" /> mention of the tribunal goes back to 1921, a time when those now in power, sneered at the word.  They were prepared to utilise the self-same tribunal when they came in and recognised what is now known as the Twenty-six Counties Oireachtas.  They were able to utilise a tribunal for their own ends. We know what they have done in the past in this community and to the people in it.  Fine Gael are prepared to support the tribunal and if anybody has any doubts as to what this Government are prepared to do as far as the workers are concerned they have only to go outside the gates here and see one of the foullest pieces of legislation on the statute books invoked against decent boys and girls when they wish to make a protest against conditions of pay.  That is all they are doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to stay awake worrying about it.  When the Minister talks about the deficit in the balance of payments and the danger of an injection of fresh purchasing power, does he think, for instance, bringing it down to practical terms, it is a just decision that a road worker&mdash; and he will be included whether Senators realise it or not&mdash;a married man with £7 or £8 a week, perhaps with five or six children, or more; they are always the type of men that excel in that&mdash;should find his wages frozen at that figure?  Does he think the forestry worker who can never hope, under this Government, to secure pensionable employment, and who may be 25 years working in a temporary capacity in a State body and at the same rate of wages as is paid by the local authority in the area, will be treated fairly when this measure becomes law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking these two questions because up to this the discussion has been purely about the white collar worker, but the directive has been issued to local authorities.  I am satisfied, without this legislation going through at all, that the Government, by telephone, are prepared to tell county managers and county secretaries not to give wage increases of any description.  A large section of our people are living on a starvation wage.  Nobody can tell me that a man who has a wife and family who gets £8 a week has a living wage. By this legislation, we are imposing on <Col N="348" /> that large section of our people a standstill order.  Does this House agree with that proposition?  Even if, tomorrow morning, there were negotiations on behalf of what I call a very junior category in the Civil Service, white collar workers, and the manual workers to whom I have referred, namely, road workers and forestry workers, the most they would get is an increase of 10/- to £1 a week. That would appear, on the face of it, to be a magnificent increase, but what benefit would that be under present circumstances, with the cost of living as it is?</P>
    <P>Is there any moral justice in what the Government are doing?  We have had a terrible lot of humbug from the Taoiseach that he preferred to see a better distribution of the existing cake. I am not talking about increasing the size of the cake.  He would like to see a better distribution of the existing cake.  How does he propose to do it? By restricting the pay of manual workers and the lowly-paid civil servants, and allowing the company directors, the higher civil servants and the other well-paid categories in our society to increase their allocation of the same cake.</P>
    <P>Supposing the cake does get bigger as a result of more production and better output.  We are, while that cake is growing, imposing a standstill on the pay of the ordinary worker, or else he must, under this legislation, satisfy a tribunal set up by the Minister that he is entitled to a little extra out of the cake.  Nobody suggests that the man who is in receipt of fees as a company director should be subject to any inquisition or any inquiry as to whether he is entitled to an increase.</P>
    <P>Certain Senators have praised this proposal and then at the end of their remarks about the necessity to bring order into this leap-frogging which is going on, they have, as a slave to their conscience, suggested that &ldquo;It is not right that directors should be let away with it or that people who are dealing with shares and so forth should be allowed freedom in that regard.&rdquo;  If they believe that this should apply to company directors, to the issue of fresh <Col N="349" /> shares, then instead of supporting limited legislation they should say: &ldquo;We will not support this because it will hit the poorer sections of the community.  We will hold out until the Government realise their responsibility and bring in legislation which will hit those who can afford to be hit.&rdquo;  There is no use in saying: &ldquo;This is necessary but we would like it to apply to so-and-so&rdquo;, knowing as we do that the Government have no intention of making these proposals apply to these people to whom I have referred.</P>
    <P>Some Senators, and Deputies too, have traced the situation which has developed back to the turnover tax. We had an amazing contribution here from the father of the turnover tax, Senator Dr. Ryan.  I found it hard to grasp what he was at here for a while but what I did grasp astounded me. This is the Senator who, as Minister for Finance, said in the Dáil, when the case was put to him time after time that the turnover tax would be availed of by certain elements of the community to double and treble their profits: &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  These people were making wild statements.  They were irresponsible.  The distributive trade was so honest that no grocer or shopkeeper would increase his profits over and above the 2½ per cent.  Perhaps he might add another half per cent, according to the Minister.  The highest he could see increases in prices going would be 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>What is the position today?  What has happened as a result of the Government's messing about with that tax?  I have here an example in a body set up by both Houses of the Oireachtas, of what is happening in regard to costs in health.  The people with whom we are dealing here in this proposal will have to look to this type of body for their health services, namely, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. This is what they have to say in their reply in the last fortnight to applications for a Voluntary Health coverage: &ldquo;Since 1962 the maintenance charge for a patient in a public ward has increased from £6 6 0 to £17 10 0 per week&rdquo;.  That is from an organisation set up by this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not going to get away with that, because that argument is nearly as fallacious an approach as his colleague's, Deputy Lenihan, the Minister for Justice, when he went down the country and told people in Boyle that the turnover tax would not affect food prices, it would only affect fur coats and Mercedes cars.  This remark was just as much in keeping with the realities of the situation as the Minister's own statement in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to go further on this particular issue of what is behind the Government's move.  In March next this tribunal's report will be ready.  As Senator Sheehy Skeffington rightly pointed out, this is a question of waiting for something to turn up.  This Government is always good at that, but on this occasion they have in mind what they hope will turn up.  They are not looking forward just in the hope that the Americans or the British will help.  They are looking forward to next April when they propose to increase the turnover tax.  At this stage the standstill order is coming into operation when this legislation has been passed.  After that the tribunal will be in operation, and in spite of what the Minister may say, that it has no power and can only recommend, nevertheless he went on to say that the findings of a responsible tribunal of this kind will obviously receive the closest attention from all concerned in fixing rates of pay in individual employments.  In other words, there is to be a standstill all round next May and we are going to have another 2½ per cent increase in the turnover tax. I am making that forecast here now. <Col N="351" /> If the Minister likes, I do not know which page it will be but I will eat the page in public for him if there is no increase in the turnover tax in the next Budget tied in with this particular issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have great pleasure in witnessing that operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister does not believe me I should like to quote him the forecast on page 5 of the White Paper on Public Capital Expenditure, which says: &ldquo;The spending power released by public capital expenditure is the remaining large element on the demand side and here the minimum requirement is that the Second Programme allocations be adhered to as closely as possible. Public saving through a surplus on the current budget is in principle another way of diverting demand from consumption to capital purposes but before this course could be adopted price and income reactions to the higher taxation needed to achieve a surplus would need careful consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, before the Government taxes in order to have a surplus in the budget they need careful examination in regard to price and income reactions.  In so far as they are in the majority at the moment the Government's aim is to increase the turnover tax in the next budget and meantime freeze the worker's wages so that he will not be in a position to look for what he will be rightly entitled to as a result of the Government's further taxation.  Make no mistake about it, the money is not coming into the kitty.  I hope that the loans that we have are filling, but they will not be sufficient to meet the outgoings as far as the Government is concerned without an increased turnover tax.  Senator Dr. Ryan said that we are all learning now, that we did not recognise what was going to happen when the turnover tax was put on but we will be wiser the next time.  In other words, the Government have learned a lesson, but the trouble is that it is now going to be applied to the worker, not to the <Col N="352" /> dividend earner or the company director or the higher paid civil servant. It is the man at the bottom who will be hit.  On an issue like this we should reject it forthwith.</P>
    <P>The fact that it is coming in is proof of the failure not of the so-called Second Programme but of the First Programme, the first five year programme produced by this Government. We are supposed to be in the beginning of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  I want to make clear my opinion that programming without planning is a waste of time and can lead to complete anarchy.  That is what we have here.  Suppose there was a programme arranged down in Croke Park or in the Mansion House and the people responsible produced their programme saying: &ldquo;We have a series of events for the next 12 or 14 days&rdquo; but did not make adequate arrangements for transport, for policing the grounds, for admission and for the collection of the money, would not that programme be a joke?  All the Government did was to produce a programme on paper and say: &ldquo;This is what we hope will be achieved by 1970&rdquo;.  They took no active steps to plan out how that could be done. There is only one way in which it can be done, and that is through socialist legislation.  It is only now that we are beginning to realise the effects of it in so far as our State and semi-State bodies are concerned.  Without these organisations this country would now be in a far more serious position than it is today.  Still we are not prepared to say that as far as the saving of the country is concerned we honestly admit that only the socialist type of planning is the one for us.  When it comes to planning it is a question of restraining the worker and it is he who suffers. When it comes to planning as far as the economy is concerned we are told that it is a free-for-all, there can be no restriction, private enterprise is the sacred cow which must be protected, protecting the right of the wholesaler, the distributor and the manufacturer, giving him what margin of profits he likes, letting the foreigner buy what land and property he likes.  You cannot <Col N="353" /> exercise any control whatever on interlocking companies, but when the worker demands an extra 10/- a week if he is in receipt of an income which is not a living wage he must be restricted, he is a danger to the stable community.  It is a stagnant society that we are living in here.</P>
    <P>When I hear people on the wireless and the television in Horizon talking about social justice it makes me vomit. I am not too slim, I am lucky enough, but when I hear well-fed people&mdash;I do not care what section of society they belong to but none of them is a worker in the actual sense&mdash;who expound on the duties of the worker and how well he is doing, I believe that they do not know the first thing about what they are talking about.  I do not think they meet the workers or have any direct contact with them.  If they do, then the only description for them is that they are humbugs.  I would prefer to believe that they are genuine in not knowing the facts, because the other description would be a pretty severe one to give to them at this stage. The Minister on numerous occasions in the other House told us it was impossible to exercise control over prices. He had from 1958 until now to do something about prices.  What he did was to allow prices to go up all along the line.  He carried out some kind of inquiry on soap, God help us, only to find that soap was another of these things controlled by interlocking groups, all controlled, in turn, outside the country.</P>

      <P>Will he now tell us that external circumstances have brought about this situation?  He will not get away with it because this is an internal matter.  It is no use locking the stable door when the horse has gone.  The Minister has expressed himself on numerous occasions, as has his leader, to the effect that price control will not work.  Will he tell us where he said controls would work only in exceptional circumstances?  Perhaps the Minister may not agree with the Taoiseach who said he does not believe in price controls and that we do not want them.</P>
      <P>This, however, does not stop the Minister from controlling the wages of workers.  He has no compunction in doing that.  I do not think there would have been any difficulty in getting co-operation from the workers if the Government had said to them: &ldquo;The position is not good.  It can be remedied and we propose to take steps to remedy it with the co-operation of all sections of the community.&rdquo;  If that line had been taken, the workers would have appreciated the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of that, no workers' organisations were asked for their views.  The Minister said he invited them to come along.  What did he do?  He told them: &ldquo;This is what the Government propose to do.  This is what the cabinet have already decided.  Would you like to make any comment.&rdquo;  That is the Minister's version of what happened and yet he expects co-operation.  If he had been able to say he had also sent for company directors, for bank directors and other such people, and had told them they were making plenty <Col N="355" /> of money and that legislation would be introduced to freeze their profits, he would have had a different reaction from the workers and there would now be a more encouraging atmosphere in the country.  The Minister can take it that this legislation through a tribunal, the name of which stinks in the country, will be regarded in the same way as legislation being used at the moment against young people outside this House.  It will be treated with the contempt it deserves.</P>

      <P>Listening to Senator McQuillan, one got the impression that he was the authority on how the workers will judge this legislation.  The workers showed their judgment on him when they had the chance recently. He referred to the increase in hospital charges from £6.6.0 to £17.  Where did the £11 go?  Surely it went on the food and wages of the class of people the Senator speaks about.  I come from a rural part of Ireland where people are more concerned about work than in any other part of the country. The only complaint in this respect is that the Labour Court is not serving its purpose.  Nowadays you will not get a man to drive a bus or conduct a bus because he does not feel secure, in view of the situation in regard to the Labour Court.  The same applies to the Post Office strike.  They would not leave it to the ability of their trade union to get results from that court.  In the interests of the workers, it is time we had some tribunal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would have been tempted, had I been called upon to conclude before the House adjourned for tea, to chase all the hares raised during the course of the debate and, anticipating that I might be called upon to reply before then, I did not take a very full note of what many of the Senators said. <Col N="356" /> Then, during the tea adjournment, a lot of the contributions went out of my mind.  Therefore, I think it would be better that I should confine myself to the fundamental points which were raised.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald traced, or purported to trace, the origin of this action by the Government.  He related it, as did the members of his Party in the Dáil, to the imposition of the turnover tax and linked it with what he alleged to be the Government's failure to control prices at an early enough stage. As Senator Dr. Ryan rightly pointed out, it is only in recent weeks that we have been hearing complaints from Fine Gael about the necessity to control prices.</P>
      <P>I remember well, when the 1958 Prices Bill was going through the Dáil, with the provisions it now has, with whatever weaknesses it might possess having regard to developments since, that there was no objection to it from the Fine Gael benches.  On the contrary there was full support for the provisions of the Bill, for the type of price control it sought to set up.  Above all, there was no demur of any kind from the Labour Party.  I made this assertion in the debate in the Dáil and many times previously&mdash;and many of the members of the Labour Party in the Dáil now were of the Labour Party in it at that time.  Senator McQuillan was in the Dáil then.  I am sure he will forgive me if I cannot remember to what Party he belonged at that time but he was there and I heard no demur from him either.</P>

      <P>I never appeared on any platform until I appeared on a Fianna Fáil platform.  The first time I appeared in any guise in the political field was at a Fianna Fáil rally in Cork in 1932.  If I may follow Deputy McQuillan's suggestion, it is true that I was approached in 1947 by the Clann na Poblachta Party to stand for them.  A message was sent to me through a friend of mine in Cork from the then Leader of the Clann na Poblachta Party, Mr. Seán MacBride.  I told this gentleman to tell Mr. MacBride that, realising that the Party he then headed was born of malcontent and also that I never had any interest in the kind of politics which Mr. MacBride professed, I had no intention then or ever of standing for Clann na Poblachta.  If that is affiliation with Clann na Poblachta, Senator McQuillan is quite welcome to have it.</P>

      <P>I still believe that price control in ordinary conditions is not a very effective weapon.  I think it was Senator Nash or Senator Ryan who, speaking on this particular subject, said that price control involves at some stage or other imposing maximum prices and maximum prices inevitably tend to become minimum prices.  There are many spheres in relation to particular commodities in which it is very difficult to control prices.  I need only instance meat with all the cuts and the qualities of cuts. In any event, the point I am making is that price control as such is not a very effective controller of the prices people will pay unless in times of special difficulties.  Times of special difficulties have come in this respect and the Government saw fit at this <Col N="358" /> stage to impose the measure of control reflected in the new Prices Act and in the Order made since then.</P>

      <P>What trend of higher prices is the Minister guarding against?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator who is usually wide awake to changes in economic trends must have overlooked the fact that only yesterday the Minister for Industry and Commerce announced in the Dáil that, following a meeting, he had no fewer than 30 applications from firms to increase the price of their commodities.  That is some indication that there is still an upward trend in prices which should be controlled.  I do not want to go into prices legislation or go too deeply into all the aspects that could be imported into this motion because I spoke at some length on the same matter yesterday in the Dáil.  It is better to confine myself, as far as possible, to the motion before us.</P>
      <P>I believe it is perfectly obvious from what I said in the course of my opening remarks that even if there were never pressure on the economy at the present time the time is upon us when something has to be done with regard to the leap-frogging that has been taking place in the awards and claims for increases in the public sector generally.  I indicated fairly clearly how this has been brought about.  Even in the case of a recent award which was alleged to give parity to the recipients the people who received awards before that are now looking for the same relativity to obtain again.  If this continued it was obvious it would lead to a chaotic situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not denying in the slightest the justice of the awards made, either agreed at conciliation or after the arbitrator heard both sides and made his recommendation, but there are separate arbitrators.  Some of them are common to a number of conciliation and arbitration schemes but, generally speaking, there has been quite a number of arbitrators sitting and one cannot expect them to be infallible. Therefore, they have to rely on their own judgment and in some cases that judgment may have been slightly in <Col N="359" /> favour of one group or slightly against another group.  That probably has given rise to anomalies and to some of the claims now made.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing if we can move towards the uniform system of arbitration, to which I referred, arbitration under the umbrella of the Labour Court, not necessarily comprising the Labour Court, but an arbitration council which would consider or a member of which would consider the different claims before them.  Therefore, there would be this degree of relativity in their findings.</P>
    <P>I have been asked specifically whether this is an attempt to interfere with collective bargaining.  It is no such thing.  I denied that specifically in the Dáil.  Neither is it intended to be a standstill, as such.  Collective bargaining will have to go on and even at the present time there are some cases pending and there is no attempt to deny the rights of workers with regard to their claims or to deny the rights of employers to make offers and come to settlements if they can.  As far as the Government will be in a position to direct the representatives on the official side to participate in negotiations their advice is that there will be no offer made on the official side until such time as the tribunal reports and they have requested other employers in the public sector to do likewise.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise what another Senator has said already, that this, in the context of the present time, cannot be regarded as a standstill and cannot be regarded as imposing any great hardship on any sector.  It must be remembered we have had the eighth round.  We have had the status adjustments arising out of the eighth round, the 12 per cent increase on those rates that were so established, and the 12 per cent National Wage Agreement which is due to be reviewed in June of next year.  Having regard to all these adjustments and to the increases that have been given, I suggest that no hardship can be presumed to arise from this tribunal.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, in so far as it is suggested that some of these groups will find themselves faced with certain <Col N="360" /> norms as decided by this tribunal, it will be possible for an organisation, a tribunal such as this, to have a broad look at the relativity of all grades that will come before them as against a situation where an arbitrator was, by himself, hearing the claim of a particular group who tried to relate the increases they sought to the level of income of other groups.  The arbitrator in those cases never had the management of the groups referred to to give evidence before him.  Now, for the first time, if there is relativity claimed with other groups, it will be open to the arbitrators to seek evidence from these groups, if they are not already represented in the categories to be covered by this motion.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in the case of any group whose levels of salaries will be investigated by this tribunal, it will be open to them, in the best way possible, to establish the quality of the work and qualifications necessary to enter into that employment and to have comparisons made as between their employment and that of others.  Therefore, not only will hardship not be imposed but if there is a group now who, by reason of the change of levels of incomes of other groups, feel they are not being well treated, they will have an opportunity now to establish, at least for some time, the relativities they feel ought to exist.</P>
    <P>This tribunal will be reasonably representative. It will comprise possibly members from the Labour Court.  I said at first I thought it would be desirable to have two from either side of the Labour Court, two from the workers' side and two from the employers' side.  Now I have come to the view that, perhaps, one from either side would be sufficient because the Labour Court will have to function in the meantime, and it may not be possible for the Labour Court to function successfully, if both the employers' and workers' members were withdrawn from it for a period of about four months.  My mind is not made up completely as to what the membership of the tribunal will be but I want it to be reasonably representative and at the same time reasonably objective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> It will be difficult in the type of tribunal we envisage to have all interests represented.  Everybody knows that if it is too broadly representative, it will be too numerous as to personnel and will be a rather unwieldy body.  I did contemplate a tribunal of five or six with membership from the Labour Court and one or two other members from either side, an independent economist and an independent chairman. Again, I have not in any way made up my mind as to who will constitute the tribunal.  It would be premature of me, in any event, to invite any persons to act on the tribunal until such time as each House of the Oireachtas has had the opportunity of examining the proposal.</P>
    <P>I hope I have given reasonable assurance to Senator FitzGerald that there will be no interference whatever with collective bargaining, that the findings of the tribunal will be designed to act as a norm and to be a guide for future negotiators and future arbitrators in claims of this nature. While it will be a norm, it cannot be expected to last for all time.  They can only make their findings and their recommendations in their report as to the conditions they now find.  They cannot settle these relativities for all time.  If these relativities change, if the content of a job increases by comparison with that of another job, it will be open to the representatives of the workers in the first job to go again and try to establish a claim before a conciliation body, first, and an arbitrator, if necessary, in the long run.  It is our intention to have, and I think it is most desirable that we should have, this arbitration council, so to speak, who will have a more or less standard viewpoint and will be able to appraise the whole range of these employments when making their recommendations or coming to their findings.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington&mdash;I am sorry he is not here&mdash;said this was a piecemeal operation, that it was a poor attempt at doing something that should have been done on a larger scale.  He made some suggestion that the Government should come to terms with the trade unions, and I asked him to <Col N="362" /> elaborate on that.  He said he would, but he merely repeated the first statement he had made and left it at that. I have longer experience, perhaps, than most people in the rough and tumble of trade disputes and I have reasonably good knowledge, from dealing with trade unions, as to how such disputes ought to be avoided and how the trade union laws might be amended in order to establish, No. 1, a better relationship between trade union executives and their members, to give more authority to the executives, more authority to the Congress, and No. 2, a better relationship between workers and employers.  However, the trade unions were very positive in saying to me that if I tried to impose anything on them by way of legislation, it would come to a very sorry end, and, of course, I appreciated that.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of our industrial relations that legislation would be desirable to contend with but you cannot impose legislation, for instance, in regard to unofficial strikes.  The trade unions would be very happy if some means could be got whereby the incidence of unofficial strikes would be lessened.  People on the other side will say: &ldquo;Why not make them illegal?&rdquo; It would be easy for the Government to pass legislation that unofficial strikes are henceforth to be illegal, but in order to make unofficial strikes illegal, sanctions must be imposed and sanctions must come in one form or another, fines or imprisonment.  It is not easy for a Government in the case of unofficial strikes and such situations to imprison people.  This has no relation to certain imprisonments which have occurred recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Imprison people wholesale for unofficial strikes.  You cannot fine the unions whose members <Col N="363" /> are responsible for the unofficial strike because, if you do so, the tendency would be for the union to declare the unofficial strike official from the very start.  Therefore, it would probably facilitate the incidence and the occasioning of unofficial strikes.  They did say this, however, that one way they thought it might be controlled is <i>ab initio</i> by providing that the responsibility of the union for allowing conditions to develop to the point at which an unofficial strike took place could be examined and established at a particular time.  Action could then be taken against the unions themselves according to their degree of responsibility for bringing about this situation.</P>
      <P>That is very far from the type of thing that people suggest at the present time.  What I said, and what indeed the Irish Congress of Trade Unions pointed out to me on many occasions, is that trade union law, apart from industrial relations, is something that must evolve, something you cannot impose, although certain legislation might indeed help the acceptance of desirable changes in trade union law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the point made by Senator Murphy that an idea had gone abroad that I have had prior consultation with the trade union movement. It is true that I called representatives of the National Employer-Labour Conference together and told them that the Government had made this decision to present this motion to both Houses of the Oireachtas and that as far as they were concerned, I was going ahead with it.  I never attempted to suggest either inside or outside the Dáil that I had consultation with them to the point that I had their approval for going ahead with this motion.  The fact is, as I stated very clearly here and in the Dáil, that I asked them to come to see me before the announcement was made and invited comments from them, and indeed one comment made was to the effect I have already mentioned, that if two members from either side of the Labour Court were on the tribunal, that would tend inevitably to close <Col N="364" /> down the Labour Court as far as ordinary hearings would be concerned, and that if there was to be representation from the Labour Court, one from either side would be enough.  I acknowledged that suggestion right away, but it was only a suggestion as to <i>modus operandi</i> rather than as to the setting up of the tribunal in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley spoke about the surge of suspicion and distrust of the Government that exists.  He mentioned all kinds of dangerous tendencies that might come from the establishment of this tribunal, that the members of these organisations would tend to react violently and to visualise the end of law and order as far as negotiations by these bodies are concerned.  I should be very sorry to think that Senator Crowley represented the views of ordinary members of these organisations. I was one of them myself at one time, and I certainly would feel that if I were representing a group of which I was a member, I would be quite glad to have a tribunal of this nature to establish, if I could, that the quality of my work was better than that of somebody else and that I should be paid accordingly.</P>
    <P>This is not, as he suggests, a virtual standstill.  Before I pass from that, I want to say that no matter what kind of threats there are in this House or anywhere else the Government have a duty to the people generally to do what they consider best for the benefit of the economy and to bring reason into this kind of negotiation and this kind of award.  I am not going to yield to threats from any side.  I have got less timorous about strikes than I used to be seven or eight years ago.  A strike does not mean the end of the world, and it often tends to let off steam on the part of those involved in it.  No matter what we do, no matter what legislation we bring in or how conciliatory or how prepared to compromise we may be, strikes will occur anyway.</P>
    <P>Senator McQuillan spoke about this being part of a vendetta by Fianna Fáil against the workers.  I do not think it necessary to point out that Fianna Fáil represent a greater part of <Col N="365" /> the workers than any other Party in the Oireachtas.  I myself come from and largely live amongst that class.  I know what they think.  I know that they feel perturbed about this leap-frogging, about this erosion of whatever gains they might get from their wage claims, by reason of another group getting further ahead and therefore pushing up to some extent the cost of living on themselves.  I have been discussing it with them and I know that the workers want reasonable stability, and I certainly want to avoid this type of leap-frogging we have been witnessing over a number of years.</P>
    <P>He also spoke about there being no restriction on higher civil servants, and a political commentator in one of the papers said that, too, recently.  It is amazing that people who want to make a case like that can ignore positive statements by people responsible in this field.  I said in the Dáil that while the recruitment clerical grades were now being examined, there would be no question of other grades being allowed to outstrip them, and in any event by and large the levels established for the recruitment grades usually determine the differentials between the promotion grades and those in the recruitment grades and higher-up grades in the Civil Service.  There is going to be no drawing away by the higher civil servants from those grades now being considered.  I said that before, and I see no reason why the contrary should be repeated here again and again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question for debate, too, because many of our senior civil servants earn less than their counterparts in other countries or in industry, and many of them are being held back at present just because the intention is to try to establish, first of all, what the rate ought to be at this level and what the relativities ought to be between groups at this level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that many other points were made, but I want to repeat <Col N="366" /> what I started off with, that this is not intended to be any standstill, that no standstill could be interpreted out of it by reason of the fact that the grades we are now dealing with, which have already got the eighth round, status increases and the 12 per cent on top of that, that grades that still have claims pending before arbitration and are still under review will be permitted to go through arbitration and get whatever reward may be made to them.  They are a very small number, but in the meantime no new offer will be made by conciliation in respect of the grades under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <P>Molaim:</P>
      <P>Go dtugann Seanad Éireann an Páipéar Bán um Athbheochan na Gaeilge dá n-aire.</P>
      <P>Tá an tairiscint seo ar Pháipéar an tSeanaid le fada ach, bíodh is go raibh orm fanúint, tá mé buíoch den Seanad as uch am a thabhairt dúinn anocht í a phlé.  Gabhaim buíochas, freisin, leis an Aire Airgeadais faoi theacht anso, agus é chomh gnóthach agus atá sé chun a bheith páirteach sa dhíospóireacht.</P>
      <P>Tuigeann gach éinne ón bhfoclaíocht atá ar an dtairiscint seo nach ag iarraidh aon rud a áiteamh ar an Rialtas ná ar Aire Stáit atá mé ach díreach le caoi a thabhairt don Seanad tuairimí a nochtadh faoi cheist seo Athbheochan na Gaeilge atá ag déanamh imní dúinn go léir le fada an lá.  Is ceist í atá beo beathaitheach inár measc le breis is trí scór blian agus is léir ón aighneas agus ón gconspóid ag roinnt leis agus ón méid atá ráite agus scríofa ina thaobh le blianta beaga anuas gur ceist bheo fós é agus nach bhfuil aon laghdú tagtha ar spéis an phobail i gcoitinne ann.</P>
      <P>Tá cúis ar leith le go gcuirfí tairiscint mar seo ar chlár an tSeanaid san am a cuireadh, sé sin, i dtosach na bliana seo.  Bhí céim nua ar fad tar éis a thabhairt in iarracht na hAthbheochana trí eisiúint an Pháipéir Bháin. Chuir an Páipéar Bán crot nua ar fad ar iarracht na hAthbheochana nach raibh riamh air cheana.  Bhí glactha ag an Rialtas mar chúram air féin cuid mhór de mholtaí an Choimisiúin a chur i bhfeidhm.  Bhí siad tar éis cuspóir na hAthbheochana a ghlacadh chucu mar pholasaí náisiúnta, ar aon chéim, d'fhéadfaí a rá, lena bpolasaí faoi fhorbairt talmhaíochta nó tionsclaíochta. I bhfianaise na dtoscaí nua seo b'fhiú liom an tairiscint seo a thabhairt ós bhur gcomhair le go bhféadfadh Seanadóirí breith a thabhairt ar bheartas nua seo an Rialtais agus le treoir agus comhairle a thabhairt dóibh i bhfeidhmiú an bheartais sin.  Is é is trua liom nach raibh an deis seo againn sé mhí ó shin nuair a bhí an scéal úr-nua ach sin rud nach raibh neart agamsa air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Más linn léargas ceart d'fháil ar thábhacht an Pháipéir Bháin, ní mór dúinn dul siar píosa ar nua-stair na Gaeilge agus a mheabhrú dúinn féin an spleodar agus an díograis chun na teanga a cothaíodh i measc muintir na hÉireann i mblianta tosaigh an chéid <Col N="371" /> seo trí imeachtaí Chonradh na Gaeilge.  Níor mhiste dúinn a mheabhrú gur as an spleodar agus an díograis sin, don chuid is mó, a d'fhás an réabhlóid pholaiticiúil agus íobairt 1916; gur mhair an spleodar céanna i gcroíthe na ndaoine le linn cogadh na saoirse, rud is furasta a léiriú ón spiorad fíor-Ghaelach inar ionsaigh an Chéad Dáil a gcuid gnótha. Is mairg go deo nach é an spiorad céanna atá i nDáil an lae inniu, ach b'fhéidir nach bhfuil an lá caillte fós.</P>
    <P>Le teacht na saoirse, pé saoirse a tháinig, laghdaig ar an iarracht deonach. Níor ghá aon iarracht feasta, dar le daoine.  Bhí an síol curtha agus thiocfadh an barr i mbláth leis an aimsir dá acmhainn féin.  Ach ba é an cogadh cathartha a bhuail an buille marfach ar fad.  Ní hamháin gur mhúscail sé easaontas i measc Gaeilgeoirí fhéin ach bhain sé súile agus croí agus intinn an phobail Ghaelaigh den leath ba thábhachtaí den aidhm náisiúnta mar cé déarfadh gurbh fhearr Éire saor gan a bheith Gaelach ná í Gaelach gan a bheith saor! Ba mhó ag daoine san am Treaty versus Anti-Treaty ná Gaelachas versus Galldachas.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh níor ligeadh ceist na Gaeilge i ndearmad amach is amach. Ar an leibhéal oifigiúil rinneadh na forálacha cuí do réir an Bhunreachta chun a chinntiú go mbeadh an teanga á múineadh go forleathan sna scoileanna agus go mbeadh cumas éigin Gaeilge ag státseirbhísigh.  Ach tá faitíos orm nach raibh croí an phobail san iarracht agus ní dearnadh aon mhór-iarracht ar chroí an phobail a bhogadh chun na Gaeilge.  Bhí obair na scoileanna á diomailt trí patuaire agus nea-shuim an phobail.  Ba léir go raibh taoide na Gaeilge ag trá ainneoin dícheall na n-eagraíochtaí deonacha agus na ndaoine nár chaill an creideamh ariamh.  Sin mar a bhí an scéal nuair a bunaíodh an Coimisiún um Athbheochan na Gaeilge sa bhliain 1958 chun taighde a dhéanamh ar staid na Gaeilge agus moltaí a chur faoi bhráid an Rialtais faoin gcaoi ab éifeachtaí chun cuspóir na hAthbheochana a thabhairt i gcríoch.</P>
    <P>Is fiú dúinn ag an bpointe seo féachaint ar na téarmaí tagartha a</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> Ag féachaint don chéim atá sroichte faoi láthair leis an iarracht chun an Ghaeilge a athbheochan, breithniú a dhéanamh agus comhairle a thabhairt faoi na bearta ba cheart don phobal agus don Stát a dhéanamh anois d'fhonn go rachfar ar aghaidh níos tapúla chun na cuspóra sin.</P>
    <P>Tugtar faoi deara nach é a cuireadh ar a gcúram féachaint arbh fhiú nó arbh fhéidir cuspóir na hathbheochana a bhaint amach ach comhairle a thabhairt faoi na bearta ba cheart don phobal agus don Stát a dhéanamh anois chun an chuspóir a chur i gcríoch chomh tapaidh agus ab fhéidir.  Mar sin in aon phlé a bhéas againn ar an bPáipéar Bán, ina bhfuil breithiúnas an Rialtais ar mholtaí an Choimisiúin, níor cheart go mbeadh cead aon cheist a thógáil faoi cheart nó faoi éigeart prionsabal agus polasaí na hathbheochana.  Ní le ceart nó éigeart na hathbheochana a bhaineann Tuarascáil an Choimisiúin ná an Páipéar Bán ach le na bealaí agus na bearta trína ndéanfar an polasaí sin a chur i gcríoch go héifeachtúil.</P>
    <P>Tá na cúiseanna lér cheart dúinn cloí leis an nGaeilge agus bualadh ar aghaidh le hobair na hathbheochana mínithe go háiritheach agus go héifeachtach ní hamháin i dTuarascáil an Choimisiúin ach freisin sa Pháipéar Bán féin.  Ní gá domsa mar sin aon athaithris a dhéanamh orthu fiú amháin dá mbeadh sé in ordú sin a dhéanamh, rud a bhfuil mé in aimhreas air.  Breithnímis an Páipéar Bán mar cháipéis ina bhfuil tairiscintí an Rialtais leagtha amach chun polasaí, a bhfuil glactha leis ar leibhéal náisiúnta, polasaí an Rialtais a chomhlíonadh.  Scrúdaímis agus iniúchaimís é féachaint an leor é nó an lochtach é don chuspóir atá leis.  Tá gné amháin de ar a laghad nach féidir locht d'fháil air sa mhéid go soláthraíonn sé dúinn sain-mhíniú sásúil ar pholasaí an Stáit i leith na teanga agus cruthaíonn sé go bhfuil glactha ag an Rialtas air féin an polasaí sin a chur i gcríoch.  Tá talamh slán déanta de go bhfuil an Rialtas á cheangal féin le polasaí dearfa i leith na Gaeilge agus is mór an chéim ar aghaidh an méid sin féin. <Col N="373" /> tugadh don Choimisiún, mar atá:</P>
    <P>Tá tairiscintí an Rialtais leagtha amach faoi chinn-teidil éagsúla.  Baineann an chéad cheann le Córas Riaracháin Phoillí agus tá an roinn sin sásúil go maith ar pháipéar. Braitheann éifeacht na dtairiscintí sa roinn seo, agus i ngach roinn eile chomh maith, ar cé chomh dáiríre is atá na húdaráis faoi.  I gcás na státseirbhíse de, mura bhfuil an tAire féin agus a phríomh-oifigigh lán dáiríre faoi chur chun cinn na Gaeilge, ní féidir bheith ag súil le toradh fónta ó na fo-oifigigh.  Cén mhaith é ceann na státseirbhíse, an tAire Airgeadais atá anseo againn anocht, treoir nó ordú a chur chuig Roinn Stáit eile faoi seo nó siúd a dhéanamh ar mhaithe le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge sa Roinn sin agus b'fhéidir Aire na Roinne sin gan a bheith báúil le Gaeilge in aon chor. Tá a leithéid d'Airí ann, creidim.  Is é tá mé ag iarraidh a chur in iúl go bhféadfadh an Rialtas a rá go raibh gach aon rud dá raibh geallta acu sa Pháipéar Bán seo á ndéanamh acu agus gan toradh dá laghad a bheith air, mura gcuirtear córas cinnte ar bun chun, a chinntiú go mbeidh leanúnachas ag baint leis an iarracht, go mbeidh duine nó daoine i ngach Roinn a mbeidh sé mar shain-dualgas orthu féachaint chuige go gcuirfear gach treoir agus gach ordú i bhfeidhm agus go gcoinneofar i bhfeidhm é.  Sin é an laige is mó a fheicimse sa Pháipéar Bán.  Cé gur fianaise láidir é ar dheá-thoil an Rialtais, fágann sé bealach sleamhnaithe acu as an gcuid is mó de na geallúintí atá tugtha acu.  Tá an leabhar breac le habairtí mar: &ldquo;Spreagfar&rdquo; daoine chun é seo a dhéanamh; &ldquo;Molfar é seo&rdquo; do dhaoine áirithe; &ldquo;Déanfar é seo más féidir&rdquo;; &ldquo;Cuirfear an moladh seo i gcomhairle do&rdquo; dhaoine áirithe.  Tá an easpa chinnteachta seo intuigthe i gcásanna áirithe ach sa mhéid a bhaineann le Radio agus Telefís agus le comhlachtaí Stáit eile bheifí ag súil le gealltanas cinnte údarásach nach mbeadh aon dul siar air.  Mura dtugtar go dúthrachtach faoin gcóras riaracháin phoiblí a Ghaelú, beidh sé fánach bheith ag súil le toradh fónta ó eagrais nó ó chomhlachtaí atá a bheag nó a mhór neamhspleách den Rialtais.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> Tá de locht agam ar an roinn a bhaineas leis an gcóras oideachais go dtugann sé le fios nach gá aon mhórathrú a dhéanamh.  Shílfeá air go bhfuil an Rialtas sásta le staid na Gaeilge sna scoileanna.  Má tá, tá a lán eile nach bhfuil sásta ná leathshásta. D'fhéadfainn a lán laigí a lua. Cuir i gcás an córas atá ann chun múinteoirí a oiliúint.  Tá sé sin anlochtach ó thaobh na Gaeilge de.  Níl aon leor-iarracht á dhéanamh chun soiscéal na Gaeilge a chur abhaile ar na hábhair mhúinteoirí agus tá fhios ag an saol gur cuma cé chomh oilte is atá duine in ealaíon na múinteoireachta, mura bhfuil an creideamh go daingean ina chroí, nach dtabharfadh sé dá dhaltaí ach oumas scrúdú a phasáil.  Ní leor le duine ar bith againn é sin.</P>
    <P>I gcás na meán-scolaíochta, tá geallta dúinn go gcuirfear béal-triail ar bun don Mheán-Teistiméaracht i gceann cúpla bliain agus go gcoinneofar béim ar labhairt na teanga as seo amach. Céim mhór ar aghaidh é sin agus cuirimid fáilte roimhe.  Tá geallta dúinn freisin go gcuirfear neart téacsleabhar ar fáil i nGaeilge do na meánscoileanna agus go n-ullmhófar leabhair nó tráchtais oiriúnacha ar thábhacht agus ar stair na Gaeilge mar chuid den chlár léinn don mheán-scoil.  Is breá liom go bhfuil glactha ag an Rialtas le na moltaí sin ach ní léir dom go bhfuil aon fheabhas fós ar scéal na dtéacs-leabhar agus ní heol dom go bhfuil aon cheo déanta fós chun na leabhair eile a sholtáthar ach an oiread.  B'fhéidir go scaoilfidh an tAire lena theanga ar ball agus an t-eolas sin a thabhairt dúinn.</P>
    <P>Tá roinn eile den Pháipéar Bán ag plé le slánú na Gaeltachta agus aguisín leis an leabhar ag cur síos ar a bhfuil déanta cheana ag an Rialtas ar son na Gaeltachta.  Caithfidh sé gur soiléir don Rialtas nach leor a bhfuil déanta cheana agus go gcaithfear tabhairt faoi slánú na Gaeltachta ar bealaí eile seachas mar bhí á bhfeidhmiú cheana.  Tá tús maith déanta sa mhéid go bhfuiltear tar éis Gaeltarra Éireann a chumasú chun tionscail nua a bhunú agus chun dul i bpáirt le comhlachtaí eile taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht chun na críche céanna.  Níl ach ceithre mhí ann ó <Col N="375" /> chuireamar go léir anseo fáilte roimh an mBille sin.  Tá súil agam go rachfar ar aghaidh láithreach chun an cumas nua sin a úsáid mura bhfuil sin déanta cheana.  Is mór a rachadh sé chun sásaimh do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ba mhór an tógáil croí dóibh dá gcuirtí tionscal nó dhó ar bun láithreach.  Ba chruthú praicticiúil dóibh é go raibh cúram á dhéanamh dá gcás agus go raibh iarracht dearfa á dhéanamh chun obair a sholáthar dóibh ina dtír agus ina ndúiche féin. Mar adúirt mé anseo cheana, is mó de thubaiste liom aon chainteoir dúchais amháin a dhul ar imirce as an tír ná deichniúr as an nGalltacht.</P>
    <P>Níor cheart dom gan an Rialtas a mholadh freisin as an gComhlacht Comhairlaitheach a roghnaigh siad go gairid tar éis don Pháipéar Bán a theacht amach.  Is dream iad a bhfuil lán-iontaobh agam astu go gcuirfidh siad comhairle cheart chúntach ar an Aire Airgeadais.  Ach ní thuigim cén fáth ar cuireadh gobán orthu agus nár chuala éinne ó shin céard tá ar siúl acu.  Tá a lán daoine ann ar suim leo fhios a bheith acu céard iad na gnéithe den athbheochan a bhíonn á n-ionsaí acu ó am go céile.  B'fhéidir nár mhiste don Aire tuarascáil uatha a chur ar fáil go tráth-rialta mura mbeadh ann ach lena ngníomhaíocht a chionneáil os comhair an phobail, mar táspéis ag an bpobal ins na h-imeachtaí a bhíonn ar siúl acu.</P>
    <P>Ní fhéadfainn, agus a laghad am atá ar fáil againn, gach aon chuid den Pháipéar Bán seo a phlé.  Fágfaidh mé faoi Sheanadóirí eile plé níos mine a dhéanamh ar ghnéithe eile de.  Beidh suim ag Seanadóirí éagsúla i ngné amháin de thar gné eile.  Ach níl aon leisc orm a rá go bhfáiltím ó chroí roimhe mar gur plean é, rud nach raibh againn cheana.  Creidim freisin gur iarracht macánta é ag an Rialtas chun comhlíonadh polasaí na hathbheochana a chur ar bhonn rialta.  Ach feicim contúirt mhór amháin ann, rud a chuirtear i gcuimhne dom leis an athrú meoin a thárla sa bhliain 1922, go mbeidh daoine ag rá leo féin nach baol don Ghaeilge anois ó tharla an Rialtas a bheith ag déanamh lánchúraim di feasta agus nach gá aon iarracht ón ngnáth-phobal chun í a <Col N="376" /> chur ar láimh sábhála.  Ar ndóigh a mhalairt ar fad atá fíor.  Níl aon uair is mó a raibh iarracht ag teastáil ón ngnáthdhuine ná an t-am i láthair. Daoine a ghríosú agus a mhisniú chun na hiarrachta sin is mó atá a dhíth anois.  Agus is sa chuid sin den obair is fearr is féidir le Seanadóirí agus le daoine meastúla eile sa phobal cabhrú leis an iarracht trí dheá-thoil a léiriú agus deá-shompla a thaispeáint.</P>
    <P>I should not like to think that any Senator would feel inhibited or in any way precluded from expressing himself freely on this motion because of inability to do so in the Irish language. I would naturally prefer to see the position in which everyone could feel equally at home in both languages, which is the position to which we aspire.  But in the discussion which is to follow, I hope that Senators will bear in mind that the White Paper deals with the means whereby the Irish language is to be restored and not with the desirability or feasibility of attempting the work of restoration. The terms of reference of the Commission on whose report the White Paper is based precluded consideration of everything except the means by which the restoration might be expedited.  We must take it at this stage that the policy of restoration is an accepted one and that our function under this motion is to discuss the wisdom or otherwise of the proposals set out in the White Paper in the context of the objectives they are designed to achieve.  I have much pleasure in placing the motion before the House.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an rún seo.  Tá a bhfuil ann ag teacht leis an bPáipéar Bán a foilsíodh timpeall mí ó shoin.  Sé tá i gceist anso ná go mbreithneoidh an Rialtas moltaí Choimisiún um Aithbheochan na Gaeilge.  Do chuir an Rialtas an Coimisiún sin ar bun a chúig nó a sheacht de bhlianta ó shoin agus d'oibríodar ar feadh cúig mblian.  Dheineadar a gcuid oibre go cúramach agus tá a lán eolais sa tuarascáil a chuireadar amach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá seans againn anois í a phlé go cúramach i dteannta leis an bPáipéar Bán a chuir an Rialtas amach.  Sé tá uainn an beart is fearr a dhéanamh <Col N="377" /> chun aithbheochan na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn agus tá sé ar intinn ag an Rialtas fé mar atá leagtha amach sa Pháipéar Bán, í chur chun cinn lé gríosadh agus le spéis a mhúscailt in ionad bheith a dtaobh le smacht nó rud ar bith den tsaghas sin.</P>
    <P>Tá sé tráthúil freisin aithbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an gceist faoi láthair siúd is go bhfuil ceisteanna fíorthábhachtacha á bplé ag an Rialtas&mdash; ceisteanna a bhaineann leis an EEC agus leis an free trade area.  Dá bhrí sin, tá sé tráthúil go leor breithniú a dhéanamh ar an gceist chun an dlúbhaint atá idir na cúrsaí seo, idir aithbheochan na Gaeilge agus gach a mbaineann leí a mheas.</P>
    <P>To continue, the White Paper sets out the objectives and the methods proposed by the Government to implement the recommendations of the Commission on the Restoration of the Irish Language.  The general recommendations were accepted by the Government and some steps have already been taken to ensure their implementation.  We have already noted in Bills here the beginning of this work, including the Bill on the Gaeltacht which passed through the House in recent months.</P>
    <P>Looking at the part we can play in this work, first of all the necessity for creating a proper environment for the language development is recognised on all sides.  A fostering of love for the language, as shown in the White Paper, seems to rely on encouragement and inducement rather than compulsion. That is as it should be but much more is necessary to foster a proper environment for the language because to me it seems that the development of the Irish language is only part of the general development of Irish culture as a whole&mdash;that we cannot expect the language to develop unless our Irish culture develops step by step with it.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I believe there should be more emphasis on Irish music, Irish songs, Irish dancing and Irish games. It seems rather strange that we still have schools in this country where there is no provision for Irish games. It would be regarded as amazing in any other country.  Certain reasons <Col N="378" /> have been advanced for this but the reasons do not justify the position and the Government should see to it that Irish games are not downgraded in any of our schools.  If schools want to participate fully in grants and other schemes of Government help, they should at least put Irish games on an equal basis with other games.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there should be more emphasis on Irish songs and Irish music.  Those who are keen on these aspects of our culture will naturally be keen to use the Irish language and to spread it as part of our general culture. I particularly welcome the insistence in the Commission's Report on the teaching of the spoken rather than the written language in early school days. There has been too much preoccupation with grammar and the written word and this, I believe, has given a detestation for the language to young children whereas if early language training were along modern lines, using modern methods&mdash;stories, pictures and so on&mdash;young people would associate the language with pleasant days in school.</P>
    <P>Such teaching methods could, naturally, be developed with equally pleasant days in the Gaeltacht or on special excursions which have as their object the fostering and the encouragement of the language.  In time would come a command of the language and the ability to carry on the language, to develop naturally from the spoken to the written word.  I find it hard to learn from a perusal of the report of the Commission or of the White Paper what precisely is the attitude to teaching other subjects through Irish.  A great deal of our failure in the past has been associated with attempts to use the language to teach other subjects in schools where children have not got the proper command of the language.  It has resulted in the other subjects being poorly understood while at the same time it committed the cardinal crime of getting the children to dislike the language.</P>
    <P>I wonder if a realistic appraisal could be made of what has been gained by teaching other subjects through the medium of Irish.  It is doubtful if any <Col N="379" /> gains could be shown except in schools where the children had developed such fluency in Irish that they took the language naturally in their stride.  We should set ourselves realisable objectives and one of these realisable objectives should be to concentrate on the spoken language.  Then, when we are able to report very substantial progress there it might be possible to take other subjects such as history through the medium of Irish.  We must first of all be satisfied that the demand for it came from the children themselves, that they were anxious to develop the language by studying other subjects through it.  Bilingualism might mean a sharing of subjects, using Irish in the teaching of a subject and interspersing it with English where necessary, as the ability of the pupils indicated.  That would put our teaching of the language on a scientific basis. We must be prepared to pass on from any past prejudices and misconceptions and be prepared to have cold, scientific appraisal of our progress and of children's reactions at all stages.</P>
    <P>One thing that occurs to me quite a bit, especially since Telefís Éireann came in, is this question of dialect. Frankly, it seems to me that we are trying to attempt the impossible when we have three or four dialects receiving equal weight.  It seems that if we were to be ruthless and to decide on one dialect and to let that be the official dialect&mdash;the one that comes across Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann&mdash; we would make far greater progress and would get greater uniformity in the result.  I know, of course, that the spelling has been standardised so that the written word can substantially be the same in all directions: it just depends on the pronunciation.  But, thinking on that, it seems that the written word, after all, is used only for a very small amount of our communication: most of the communication is done orally and consequently I think that stresses the necessity for the standardising of one dialect.</P>
    <P>Again, perhaps it is due to upbringing on that but, having been brought up on the Irish script, I can <Col N="380" /> never get used to this Roman script with all those h's cluttering up the words and masking the beauty of the word itself.  It may be that the only reason that can be advanced for it is an economic one in relation to printing. Yet, to me, at any rate, Irish writing loses a great deal when it does not stand in its native setting, that is, in the Irish script with the síniú fada, the séimheadh and the urú.</P>
    <P>There are some parts of the commission's report which have only lightly been touched on as yet by the Government but which no doubt are under active consideration by them.  I think we might profitably look at some of those.  I should like in a short time &mdash;I do not wish to take up too much of the time of the House because I am sure many other Senators are anxious to speak&mdash;to touch on the recommendations on page 76 as they apply to the constituent colleges of the National University.  I take it that Senators have read those recommendations. Running through the recommendations there is a very strong insistence on a great number of courses and subjects through Irish in the university colleges.  Well, now, frankly, I think this is a mistaken policy.  I think the job of the university, especially in the professional schools and the scientific schools, is to turn out scientists and to turn out professional men who are equipped at the highest level at which we can equip them and imbued with patriotism and a determination to work in this country; in other words, practical patriotism.  That practical patriotism means that the highest service they can discharge to the country is to keep abreast of their profession and they keep abreast of their profession by studying the literature of that profession and the current periodicals and the current reports on it.  These, let us face the situation, are, first of all, in the English language coming from England and America.  After that, we go to the Continent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>And Russia, but you can at least get very good <Col N="381" /> translations in the English language. The point I am making is that I cannot see for one moment how a man is a better Irishman because he spends a good deal of his time in creating terminology in Irish, translating scientific work and scientific results into the Irish language.  Let him use Irish, by all means, in his ordinary contacts of business, speaking to students, speaking to colleagues, and so on; in other words, let him have a general practical approach to the developments of the country and be prepared to work long hours for it and be prepared to play his part as a citizen.  But, having reached that stage, if we have bilingualism, it is no slur to say that we quite accept that a course should be done in the most efficient manner in which it can be done, that is, using the text books available, training the students into thinking in the terminology in which they are going to read it in the text books, not having a question of double terminology and, generally, seeing no conflict whatsoever between this practical bilingualism and their duties as citizens of this State which the aim is to make bilingual in that sense.  You will see contradictions running through here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted that science can be done bilingually, a Degree course in Science given through Irish, but not courses in Engineering&mdash;in other words, in University College, Galway, the recommendation here is soft-pedalled. Why?  I do not see any difference between the difficulty in giving a course in engineering through Irish and in giving a course in physics, chemistry or botany.  Neither do I see any advantage in it.  I might say in relation to all the young scientists we have in this country, men who have come up since the war and gone abroad and studied in the best graduate schools in the world and come home with honours and the highest degrees, and so on, that, if you get their frank opinion on this&mdash;and some of them are the finest Irishmen in this country and, furthermore, I know this from some University College, Galway, graduates whom I know quite well&mdash; they feel they could do far more for Irish by playing a full part in Irish <Col N="382" /> Week and using Irish where the opportunity arises, in discussions with students, and all the rest.  They do a first-class professional job and such is their contribution.  It is ridiculous at the moment, when our university system is so under-staffed, to suggest that we have any spare resources that can be used.</P>
    <P>We are hard-pressed enough to give the courses that have to be given at the moment.  In fact, any realistic comparison of the facilities available here and the facilities available in universities generally in England or in Queen's will show that we have less than half the resources per 100 students for our teaching and general development they regard as necessary. Consequently, the first and obvious claim on the Government for the practical development of this country is the development of its resources and the further development of our teaching profession to try to bring our present resources up to something near what is accepted as the international standard.  Our resources, as I say, are less than 50 per cent and it is a tribute to the standing and the dedication of the men in our faculties today that the value of their degrees bears no relation to that 50 per cent, that our students can, on graduation here, take their place in the graduate school anywhere in the world and compete more than favourably with their confrères coming from more heavily endowed and much better class institutions.</P>
    <P>We have the scheme of Gaeltacht scholarships to encourage students to do their courses through the medium of Irish.  It is a pity that those we regard as the most idealistic of our students should be concentrated in one centre.  It would be far better if our dedication and idealism for the language were used to aid the work in all institutions; in other words, that they should go to the university of their choice and play their full part there in developing the Irish spirit, the Irish language and Irish speaking in that centre.  It is a mistake to channel all the idealism, as it were, into one region.</P>
    <P>I might mention perhaps, in this regard, the example of Finland, a <Col N="383" /> small country fighting for its national identity and bounded by Russia and Sweden.  Finland recognises that it is a small country and that it has not got the text books or the resources to enable to be available in Finnish science, engineering, medicine and so on, but excellent text books and other facilities in Swedish are available.  All the courses in the Finnish universities are, to my knowledge, given in Swedish, even though there is no love whatsoever lost between Finland and Sweden and the Finnish do not in any way regard this using of the excellent facilities and this access for their students to the scientific resources of Sweden as in any way taking from their position as an independent nation.  I could cite many other such examples.</P>
    <P>We have to look at the Irish language as a very essential part of the whole matter of our national development and the exploitation of our resources, and what we need at the moment, as we need at all times, are dedicated men in all walks of life working unselfishly for the good of the country.  I have no doubt, if they are doing that, they will be imbued with a proper attitude to the Irish language, to our culture in its finest and its best flower, and to everything that goes to make us a nation.  We have got to keep the larger objective, the building up of the nation, always in view and to fit everything into that mould and see the Irish language as a component part in that build-up.  We should also see the Irish language as one part of our culture.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe our Irish games, our Irish music and our Irish dances are at least as important in keeping the spirit of the country Gaelic and in giving us the national consciousness without which we cannot hope to achieve full economic development.</P>

      <P>Ní fheicim ó thalamh an domhain cad an thaobh gur gá an tairiscint seo a phlé.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, do h-iarradh ar na daoine go raibh tuairimí fiúntacha acu iad a chur go dtí an Coiste Comhairle.  Ar an dara dul síos tá gach Páirtí <Col N="384" /> polaitíochta ar aon fhocal gur ceart agus gur cóir an Ghaeilge a shlánú agus a chur á labhairt go foirleathan ar fud na tíre.  Tá a fhios againn go léir go bhfuil dream beag bídeach, seóiníní beaga anseo agus ansúd ach ní fiú aon áird a thabhairt ar na daoine sin.</P>
      <P>Tá sé ráite agus sean-ráite agam cheana go bhfuil an iomad cainte ar fad againn agus dá ndéanaimís níos lua cainte agus níos mó oibre go mbeadh níos mó Gaeilge ar fáil againn sa tír.  Do cuireadh de mhilleán ar an Rialtas cheana go raibh siad ag dul ró-thapaidh.  Anois tá de locht orthu go bhfuil siad ag dul ró-mhall.  Sin iad na tuairimí a chloisim ar aon chuma ar fud na tíre.</P>
      <P>Sa Pháipéar Bán tá 288 moltaí agus ins na moltaí sin tá na rudaí go léir gur ceart don Rialtas a dhéanamh agus cad is ceart don cléir a dhéanamh.  Is chuma sa tsaol cad í an teanga a labhrann an Taoiseach nó cad í an teanga a labhrann an teaspag nó an sagart paróiste is orainn féin atá an t-ualach, mar a déarfá.  Tá sé ar choinsias gach duine a chionn féin a dhéanamh agus gan a bheith ag fanacht leis an Taoiseach nó leis an easpag nó leis an sagart paróiste an rud a dhéanamh agus an dea-shompla a thabhairt de bhrí gur léir do gach duine nach ar leibhéal Dháil Éireann nó ar leibhéal Magh Nuadhat a shlánófar an teanga ach ar leibhéal an pharóiste.  Sin é an fáth nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag dul ar aghaidh chomh maith agus ab fhéidir, go bhfuilimid go léir ag brath ar na daoine thuas agus gan ár gcionn féin á dhéanamh thíos.  Dá mbeadh leath-dhosaen daoine againn i ngach contae nó, fiú amháin, i ngach cúige ar nós Pádraig Ó Cearbhaill agus An Gabha Gaolach as Áth Threasna, ni bheadh aon ghá le Páipéar Bán nó páipéar d'aon dath eile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl aon amhras ach gur ar mháithreacha na tíre atá aithbheochan na Gaeilge ag brath.  Is mithid é sin a admháil.  Is cois teallaigh a shlánófar í.  Is aiseach, mar sin, nach bhfuil níos mó ban le feiscint ins na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge mar Chonnradh na Gaeilge in a bhfuil daoine ag <Col N="385" /> gabháil leis an nGaeilge.  Is beag ban atá ionta.  Is ró-annamh a chítear bean ar an coistí a chuirtear ar bun, fiú amháin ar an gcoiste atá ar bun i láthair na huaire.  Sílim nach bhfuil ach bean amháin air.  Rinneadh taghairt don telefís agus is fíor nach bhfuil cothrom na Féinne á fháil ag an nGaeilge ar Telefís Éireann agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh an Rialtas rud éigin faoin dream sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na scoileanna, siad na bunscoileanna agus múinteoirí na bunscoileanna an dream is mó a dhein obair ar son na Gaeilge i gcónaí. Muna mbeadh iad sin is olc an bhail a bheadh ar an scéal.  Is taréis na bunscoileanna a fhágaint a chailltear an Ghaeilge.  Caithfear smaoineamh a dhéanamh ar conas is féidir an bhearna sin a líonadh.  Timpeall ceithre bliana ó shoin nuair a bhíos ag plé ceiste na Gaeilge le hUachtarán na hÉireann, dubhairt sé go raibh trí dreamanna sa tír seo: an dream a deireann nach fiú an teanga a shlánú; an dream a deireann nach féidir an teanga a shlánú; agus an dream a deireann gur fiú an teanga a shlánú agus gur féidir.  Ní gá mbacaint leis an chéad dream.  An dara dream a bhfuil sá de thuairim aca nach féidir an teanga a shlánú, níl ortha sin ach lag-mhisneach; ach an dream a cheapann gur féidir agus gur fiú dá ndéanfaidís sin níos mó oibre agus níos lú cainte, bheadh an lá linn fadó.  In a lán dena gluaiseachtaí Gaeilge, sin é an rud a bhíonn ar siúl aca, caint, caint agus síorchaint.</P>
    <P>Rud amháin atá ag déanamh buartha do dhaoine ná go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ro-cheangailte le h-éirim aigne is le h-airgead.  Agus sa chás sin sé an rud atá i gceist ná na scoláireachtaí agus ceist na gColáistí Gaeilge. Na daoine a gheibheann na scoláireachtaí sin, sin iad na daoine leis an éirim aigne, ach tá comhairle ag teastáil nios mó óna daoine laga, na daoine nach bhfuil chomh h-éirimiúil. Tá fhios agam go gcaithfimid an Ghaeltacht a shabháil.  Sí an Ghaeltacht Ollscoil na Gaeilge.  Mar sin féin, ba mhaith liom, mar thosnú, go gcuirfí cúrsa Gaeilge ar siúl i gach paróiste. Dá ndeanfaí é sin ní bheadh lag-mhisneach <Col N="386" /> ar na túismitheoiri nach bhfuil an t-airgead aca agus nach bhfuil éirim aigne aca nuair a chíonn siad na comharsin ag bailiú leo go dti na coláistí agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Aontáin leis an Seanadóir Ó Conalláin nuair a dubhairt sé gur cóir atmasféar ceart a bheith sa cheantar. Chuige sin bheadh sé oiriúnach ionad a chur ar bun in ngach paróiste, áit ina mbeadh ceol agus rincí agus eolas ar stair na h-Éireann, as Béarla ar dtús. Caithfimid an t-atmasféar atá lasmuigh a thabhairt isteach i dtosach.  Is é an Béarla an teanga atá ag an chuid is mó de mhuintir na h-Éireann.  Nuair a thagann siad isteach agus nuair a thuigeann siad cad tá ar siúl againn maidir leis an nGaeilge, beidh níos mó meas aca ar an dteanga.  Sin rud ba chóir do bhoird Stait cosúil le Bord Fáilte a dhéanamh nuair a bhíonn scéimeanna forbartha áu gcur ar bun aca.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé riachtanach dul isteach go mion sa Pháipéar Bán, mar fé mar a deirtear ann, aon duine go bhfuil smaointí fiúntacha aige is cóir dó iad a chur go dtí an Coiste Comhairle atá curtha ar bun chuige sin.</P>

      <P>Our debate tonight is about one of the great languages of Europe, and Irish has been one of the great languages for longer than all except one of the existing great languages of Europe. Our problem is that this languages has been declining now for the best part of 150 years.  One of our difficulties is the surprising fact that this great language has never produced a single writer of European stature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am drawing attention to one of the difficulties of establishing the Irish language not only in Ireland but throughout Europe. The sad fact to me, as I gather it is also to Senator Lenehan, is that there is no writer of European stature.  I am thinking, in comparison, of writers like Cervantes, Racine, Goethe and many others.  It is our misfortune; we do not rejoice in this.  During the early 19th century there was a short while when the attention of Europe was directed to an Irish writer, only one.  This, I would inform Senator Lenehan, is common knowledge to every civilised person in this country.  I shall say a little about this, the one occasion when our country was favoured rather indirectly with a European reputation on account of a writer in the Irish language.  It was when the poems of Ossian, as they were called, swept through Western Europe.  They even attracted the attention of a man like Napoleon who would quote Ossian as his favourite writer.  That unhappily is the only occasion when all Europe fixed its attention on an Irish writer.  Unfortunately, it was rather devious, because these so-called poems of Ossian were in a very third-class translation by a Scotsman whose knowledge of the original sources was very small. It is a remarkable fact, all the same, that even though this translation was so inadequate, and his knowledge so inadequate, for a moment an Irish tradition penetrated the whole Continent of Europe.  Unfortunately this did not occur since.  One of the ways in which we will restore the language brilliantly is by producing a writer of the stature of Cervantes or Racine who writes only in Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This great language has been in decline for over a century.  There have been, I think, four main reasons.  The first and obvious one is British policy through the centuries.  The second one, which is not so much emphasised but is just as powerful, is the influence of Daniel O'Connell, who in fact said: &ldquo;Cease to speak Irish, learn to speak <Col N="388" /> English.&rdquo;  He was a great man of European stature, and that was his considered verdict.  The third reason was lack of liturgical use.  Wales has always had services in Welsh in the churches to keep the language going.  Irish has never had that, and it has suffered much from it.  The fourth, and this is the one that really concerns us now, because we are not going to deal with past history in this debate, we want to deal with the present, is the presence to our east and to our west of two dynamic worldwide languages.  I mean English and American English.</P>
    <P>This last is the only opposing force that we have to reckon with now.  The others are part of the past, part of our past and unhappy history.  How can we preserve the language from this tremendously powerful pressure from the east and the west?  It seems to me that there are three main methods of doing this.  The first is by appeals to patriotic sentiment.  The second is by positive inducements.  The third is by negative inducements, which are the ones I do not like, and I will explain what they are and why I do not like them in a moment or two.</P>
    <P>Let us consider these methods, very briefly, because I believe that the future of the language turns on these things.  First of all, patriotic sentiment. By this I do not mean appeals to nationalism, and I will tell you why. Nationalism is a declining ideal in the world as it is today.  It has served its purpose and has done much for this country.  But we are now turning towards internationalism, to supranationalism. I and, I know, others in this House look towards a United States of Europe.  To link the language with a declining ideal like nationalism in the sense of separatism, keeping away from other nations and from other languages, is to link it to a declining ideal. I personally, deny, though this may provoke one or two in the House, that a nation cannot be truly a nation without a distinctive language of its own.  If I may venture to say four words in Irish, gan teanga, gan tír.  I am sorry that my pronunciation is not very good but that is the best I can do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I frankly do not believe that this matter is true if it means that a nation cannot be a true nation without a distinctive language of its own.  I point to Austria, to Switzerland, to all the Arab nations, to the great nations of North and South America.  I think it is a great mistake to try to persuade young, critical people that this is so when in fact it is obvious to them that it is not so.</P>
      <P>But this is not what I think we mean when we hope for appeals to patriotic sentiment.  What we need is appeals to genuine patriotic affection. I mean loving one's own country in the fullest sense.  Every one of us here, and I should think almost all of the people of this country, are in favour of that.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the two more materialistic methods of encouraging Irish.  Undoubtedly we need materialistic methods.  The British Government were obviously from the fourteenth century and even further back offering material inducements and material pressures to undermine Irish.  Let us look first at what I call positive inducements&mdash;prizes, scholarships, rewards and encouragements of various kinds.  I see several pleasing examples of them through the White Paper.  I do not think we are going to argue about that kind of thing in this House.  The only question is how much money we can afford for it.  These things can be expensive.  But most of us agree that up to considerably high limits it would be money well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now to come to what I call negative inducements.  These I wholeheartedly disagree with and deplore.  They are aimed at encouragement of the language mainly by imposing disabilities on those who do not learn Irish or who do not learn as much Irish as official policy dictates.  For example, there is the case of the Leaving Certificate which, as has just been said, imposes a disability.  You cannot get the certificate without some knowledge of the language.  Again, the entrance to one of our universities for residents of this State is, I understand, prevented without <Col N="390" /> a knowledge of the language.  I regret this kind of negative inducement. I even deplore it, because here the price we pay is not merely monetary.  We are paying in terms of inefficiency, of dislike, of cynicism and of emigration.</P>
    <P>Let me explain inefficiency.  I will quote an example that happened to me a few years ago.  I was honoured to be an extern examiner in our sister university.  I went to one of the constituent colleges to examine in Greek and met a very charming young candidate who conversed with me in English.  When the time came for the <i>viva voce</i> one of the lecturers was called in as an interpreter.  She sat in the middle, I sat on her right and the candidate sat on her left.  I asked a question in my native language, which happens to be English.  That is an accident of fate.  The interpreter turned it into Irish.  The candidate who had now heard the question twice, which of course is a help sometimes, replied in Irish and the interpreter, who was a lecturer in this college, translated it back into English. That is not efficient.  Is it desirable? Does it really help the language? I shall give another example.  As a professor I tend to think in terms of examinations these days.  They are very much in my mind at the moment. One of my colleagues was examining in medieval history.  A paper was submitted, quite legally, in Irish. She, again not having the language with any great fluency, applied for an interpreter, a very good Irish speaker. He said: &ldquo;This is not very good Irish; I do not know what a good deal of it means&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Lenehan Mr. Lenehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might not have been very good English either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about Irish.  That opens the door to inefficiency.  There are worse instances than that.  I love this country.  People of my name have been here for over 700 years.  I do not like to see it exposed to hypocrisy, as it sometimes is.  I am sad when I see ambitious young men and women, idealistic young men and women, who have got the belief that in some cases the worst qualified person is preferred to <Col N="391" /> a better qualified person because of language qualifications.  I cannot prove this.  But I know it is a prevalant view. I have heard the language described, perhaps wrongly, as a Trojan horse for mediocrity.  I asked the person who said that what he meant.  He meant that inside this noble language mediocre people, unsuitable candidates, were able to get jobs in the citadel of national efficiency which he identified with the city of Troy.</P>
      <P>This kind of negative enthusiasm for a language exposes the language to cynicism.  And it causes emigration. There are many young Irish men and women who want to teach science or mathematics in this country but cannot unless they qualify in Irish, or could not until recently when there may have been some relaxation.  We are losing good Irish people in that way.  That is sad.</P>
      <P>Now let me quote chapter and verse from the White Paper, illustrating what I have been saying.  I shall confine myself to the recommendations in the sections dealing with education, those which call for greater positive inducement.  I gladly support them, with a few reservations, provided the taxpayers are prepared to bear the cost of them and the cost may be considerable.  I welcome, for example, the recommendations on providing refresher courses for teachers and for encouraging linguistic research into the problems of reviving a declining language. I welcome the recommendation that Irish grammar should be taught less formally and that there should be less emphasis on writing in the early stages.  I agree with Senator Quinlan that the loss of the national alphabet is a considerable one.  There is a foolish view that children do not like different alphabets.  I know from my experience of Greek that they delight in learning a new alphabet.  The Greek alphabet has a fascination that the Latin alphabet does not have.  We have lost something exciting for children in discarding a beautiful alphabet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody will be pleased to see these efforts to make the language more attractive and more stimulating. I welcome the recommendation that <Col N="392" /> modern teaching aids should be used more widely and that set courses should show more variety.  I especially welcome the positive encouragement that is demanded of the universities. The only thing I regret is that there is a kind of segregation of Trinity College from its sister university in this White Paper.  I do not see the need for that.  With limited exceptions, we should like to stand side by side with the other national university. Perhaps Senator Lenehan, who has been making some inarticulate remarks, would be enlightened if I reminded him that the record of Trinity is not so bad in the last 150 years in regard to the Irish language.</P>

      <P>Davis was one of ours, Douglas Hyde was ours and the man who left a most considerable sum of money in early times for the encouragement of the Irish language, Flood from Grattan's Parliament, was one of ours.  We have produced perhaps 50 per cent of the great Irish scholars.  Perhaps what Senator Lenehan has in mind is that about 60 years ago deplorable remarks were made about the Irish language by people in Trinity.  One of my functions here is to try to live down those and other foolish remarks like them.  I shall not quote the things said by Sir John Pentland Mahaffy or Professor Atkinson.  They said stupid, hateful things about the language, and Trinity has been trying to live them down for 60 years but has not yet entirely succeeded.</P>
      <P>That is an unfortunate part of our historic heritage.  But I repeat that Trinity has done a lot for the Irish language in the past 150 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am all in favour of positive inducement but not negative ones.  One in particular I would pick out.  It is on page 136, recommendation 220 of the White Paper which says that Irish should be an essential subject for entrance into the University of Dublin. <Col N="393" /> In other words it is recommended that it should be compulsory for entrance. If this were done what would happen? I shall link this with similar recommendations in respect of technological and vocational colleges.  If Trinity and the technological and vocational colleges made Irish compulsory for admission what would happen? Hundreds of Irish children who either do not want to learn Irish or to learn any more Irish would be compelled against their will to do it.  Would they like the language more as a result? No.  Would they use it more as a result?  No. Some of them would emigrate to a university outside the State rather than do that.  Others would unwillingly conform and have a grudge against the language forever afterwards.</P>
    <P>Until fairly recently, Latin was compulsory for entrance to Trinity.  We abolished it some years ago because we found it was impossible to expect high or right standards from people compelled to take it, and that this compulsion was engendering a chronic hostility to Latin.  It was abolished, and Trinity is all the better as a result. How can you expect idealistic young students, eagar to do well in mathematics or science or philosophy or a dozen other subjects, to have to study a language that has not the slightest relevance to their vocations?</P>
    <P>Now I have probably said too much on this motion and there are other Senators who wish to contribute.  Of course the safest thing to do on a motion of this kind is to say nothing. However, I believe the right thing for a Senator from Trinity is to speak his mind on an occasion like this.  If I have said anything wrong I am open to correction and rebuke.  I insist that you will find 95 per cent of the people&mdash; including a fair proportion of the notorious five per cent&mdash;in favour of positive inducements but a great many who deplore negative inducements.</P>

      <P>I understand that at the time of the druids Irish was the spoken language of this country.  It continued to be the languagae of this country until it was invaded.  Of course the position still is that there <Col N="394" /> are places in the country where Irish is still the spoken language.  I still believe that any steps we can take to preserve that language must be taken. Now, an extraordinary state of affairs prevails.  We can use anybody we wish in our arguments.  It is strange that our children in secondary schools do not come back to us and say that the master will cause trouble about the learning of Latin, Greek, French, and so on.  The only time that anyone comes back to us and says anything is wrong is when somebody is asked to learn Irish.  How is it, in all fairness to everybody, that the only language that you are not supposed to learn is Irish? Is that not quite true?  You can use all the arguments you want to use, up, down, back and over, but is it not quite true that we are the only people in the world who throw what I am going to call droch-mheas on their own language?  Did anybody ever hear the French say they did not want to hear their own language, or the Dutch or the Belgians?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are the only people in the world who can, and who try, to cast, what I will call again, droch-mheas on their own language. Our language was an old language before Trinity College was ever heard of and it will exist after Trinity College has disappeared from this country, as well.  Let nobody in this House have any doubts about that: there is no question or doubt about it.  If we are to be that type of people who will sit idly by and not take the necessary steps to put our language back on the map again, then there is something wrong with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I want to give a few examples in regard to the language.  It is quite true that it is down in the West of Ireland and probably in parts of the South and North-West that we have the Irish language and it is also quite true that it is from these areas, mainly, that our people emigrate.  I want to point out that when they go over to Britain not only are they not asked what their language is but they are <Col N="395" /> not asked what their religion is, either, and that is a very entertaining point. When our people go over there, they are not asked what their language is and they are not asked what their religion is and, so long as they are able to work, and good workers they are, that is all that is required.  Then somebody gets up in this House and says that our language, just because it is the Irish language, is some kind of an impediment.  That is not true: it is completely and entirely wrong.  I am sure there are many Senators who will uphold what I am saying now. It is not true.  People in the West of Ireland, the best of workers, find, when they emigrate, that the British do not ask them what their language is.</P>
    <P>Let us go further afield.  Let us go to the United States where there are hundreds of thousands of Germans and all kinds of Europeans.  Does anybody here seriously suggest that they are asked what their native language is?  They are not, and, so long as they are able to go in and work, that is all that counts.  I do not give one highland hoot whether it upsets the professors of Trinity one way or another whether or not we have to maintain our language.  As a people, and as a people with a future, it would be completely unrealistic for us&mdash;we are a small people with a small population but with a great past and a great future&mdash; to subscribe to the dictates of Trinity College and I am one of the people who will not in any circumstances do that.</P>
    <P>We have fought for over 700 years for our language and our identity. Unfortunately, we have not got as far as we expected but we have gone ninetenths of the way and I believe that, with goodwill, the generations coming after us will support us and we shall get the rest of the way and take over the whole country.  It would be unrealistic if I did not say that when we do take over this country, while Irish may not be the language of every man in the country or every woman or child in the country, our aim must be that our children and those who come after us will know Irish&mdash;and I have no hope at all for the people who do not know Irish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> We send our children to secondary schools to learn Latin and other languages, and they learn them.  They do not come home and say: &ldquo;Daddy, I got beaten today for not doing this&rdquo;, but they come home and say: &ldquo;Daddy, I got beaten for not knowing Irish&rdquo;. Certainly, that is a fantastic situation. Is it not a lunatic situation?  Supposing we went to any other country in the world, would we find a similar situation? Supposing we went to Belgium or France.  Supposing a French gasúr came home to his father and said: &ldquo;Daddy, I got a beating today for not knowing French&rdquo;, would he not be a right fool?  But an Irish gasúr can come home and say: &ldquo;I was beaten today for not knowing Irish&rdquo;, and his father would be inclined to agree with him.  Have we any sense at all?  What kind of a country are we, at all?  That is the position and the people in Trinity College and any other place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he said: &ldquo;The teacher beat me today because I did not know English&rdquo;.  What is the answer to the young Irish fellow who comes home and says he was beaten by the teacher because he did not know Irish?  Is the Irish gasúr not as much entitled to know Irish as the young English gasúr is to know English? I have six children myself, one of whom is 20 years of age.  I never found that any of them had any difficulty, good, bad or indifferent, about learning Irish.  When I was at school, I had to learn Latin and Greek, and there was no quibbling about it.  If we did not learn it, we got a shoe on the backside.  There was no question of getting it taken off.  We might as well be realistic about this.  People come into this House and will not be fair about the Irish language.  We have our answer here.  The English gasúr comes home and says to his daddy he was beaten because he did not know English.</P>

So should anybody else who had respect for his country or for our language.  I do not for one moment hold with the kind of codology that goes on.  It is thrown at us that we cannot get proper scientific terms, that we do not know what this or that is.  I want to be quite straight about this.  How is it the Irish are the only people who do not know scientific terms in their own language? How do the Germans, the Czechs or the Russians go about it?</P>

      <P>Yes, how do the Chinese go about it?  Does anybody in this House seriously suggest that we are a crowd of nincompoops?  We are not.  The Belgians went into the Congo.  They took it over and decided to keep the Congolese entirely untutored. The British came in here some hundreds of years ago but they could not keep us untutored as we were tutored before they came.  We were better taught than they were.  That is a very important point.  We were, at that time, 1,000 years ahead of them. That was the only reason they could not bring the Irish down to earth: we were already a tutored people.  We knew a good deal more economically than they did.  I hope there are some people on the far side of the House who will uphold me in this.  The fact that we tried to keep the language is thrown at us as a reason for our failure to advance further.  I want to point <Col N="399" /> out quite clearly that our language has nothing at all to do with it.  Our language has taken us a step forward and put us ahead in the world.  No matter where an Irishman goes, he takes his language with him.  It is not because of the language but because we are a small country that we have not been so progressive.  I want to point out, and I think I am only fair in doing so, that when people come in here casting reflections on our language, it is important to understand that we can look back and see that before those who are trying to cast reflections on our language were ever heard of, we were an important people.</P>

      <P>After so many interruptions, it is not easy to continue.  I am sure that most of the Irish oriental Senators in this House will still agree that no matter what our attitude is, we should do our best to get our children to learn Irish.  I have six of them, as I say, and I never found they had any serious difficulty in learning Irish. Remember, it is much harder to get them to learn the catechism.  That is what a lot of people forget and there is not any word about that.  Nobody would come in here and say you do not know your religion but they will say you do not know Irish or, if you do, you should not know it or something of that type.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of balderdash talked about learning the Irish language. When I was a young fellow, Irish was not very popular, I can assure you.  I am 50 years of age, and when I was going to school 40 years ago, it was not very popular.  Some of the Senators on the far side will agree with me on this.  Everything was against it then, but the point is that we learned it and it was never any burden to us.  When we went into the secondary school, we went through our courses in Irish and it was no great burden to us.  It was much more difficult at that time, 40 years ago, than it is today.  For the past 40 years, the Irish language has been taught to everybody and if there is any youngster today who will say he does not know anything about the Irish language, I will not accept it as true. He has got his chance.</P>
