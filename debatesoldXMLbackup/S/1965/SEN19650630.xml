      <P>I move :</P>
      <P>That Senator James C. I. Dooge be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>Mar is eol díbh go léir, bhí an Seanadóir Dooge ina bhall den tSeanad ón mbliain 1961 agus le linn an ama sin bhí sé páirteach go minic sna díospóireachtaí a bhí ar siúl.  Sna díospóireachtaí sin ba léir gur Seanadóir stuama é go raibh a lán taithí aige ar chúrsaí poiblí agus ar chúrsaí polaitióchta.</P>
      <P>Cé go bhfuil sé ina bhall de Fhine Gael is dóigh liom gur thug sé cothrom na Féinne do chách le linn an tréimhse sin fiú amháin nuair a cháin sé an obair a bhí ar siúl ag na daoine sin.</P>
      <P>In a theannta sin, tá neart Gaeilge aige agus beidh sé lán ábalta obair an Tí a dhéanamh i nGaeilge más gá.</P>
      <P>The House is in a somewhat invidious position this afternoon in that it has to make a choice between two people, Senator Dooge whom I am proposing, and Senator McAuliffe whose name is also on the Order Paper.  The choice of the House is rendered invidious because of the high standing and personal qualifications of each of those two Senators.  However, I think I may be able to give some assistance to Members of the House who have no particular or special interest in either Party by having a look at the broader context in which this House functions, that is, in the context of the Oireachtas.  In that context, we must have regard to the realities of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oireachtas functions, in the main, through the existence of political Parties.  In that context then, one sees that in the Dáil the position of Ceann Comhairle is held by a Member of the Labour Party.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and the position which you, a Chathaoirleach, have the honour to hold in this House, is held by one who is a distinguished member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  No member of Fine Gael occupies any of these positions and I urge that as a consideration of equality and equity among those who, as I say, have no particular interest in <Col N="128" /> either of the candidates whose names appear on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge has, for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach, many qualifications. He was for a considerable time a member of Dublin County Council and was twice chairman of that body and of many subsidiary committees.  Of course, in that capacity, he acquired a knowledge of procedure which will be to his advantage if the House confers the honour of Leas-Chathaoirleach upon him.  In addition, he has, of course, broad training and experience as a member of the Faculty of Engineering at University College, Cork.  He is Professor of Civil Engineering at Cork University and he brings to bear upon that work, as he does, too, on his work in the Seanad, the qualities of patience, a great sense of fair play and a thoroughness which is the hallmark of the successful professor in his profession. He also is tolerant and patient. These are all qualities which are very necessary for the Chair, as I know from my own past experience.  He is incisive and decisive and these qualities admirably suit him for the position.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an rún.  I have great pleasure in supporting the nomination of Senator Dooge for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I do so as an independent member.  I am anxious to make my support public as a tribute to the vocational basis on which the Seanad is constituted according to our Constitution.  When we are choosing on that basis, I can think of no one more fitted and better suited to honour in a vocationally constituted body than Senator Dooge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need for me to tell you the pre-eminent position he occupies in his profession.  He is a leader of thinking in both the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland and Cumann na nInnealtóirí.  Indeed, we are very fortunate and proud to have him as a member of our staff in Cork.  We were happy the day we enticed him from Dublin to Cork.  I do not need <Col N="129" /> to stress his tremendous activity.  That is apparent to all.  At a time when the State is faced with a crisis, a crisis of work, when men are trying to get a greater slice of the cake and contribute less for it, the selection of Senator Dooge will be a very happy augury because he certainly is a man, as we say in Munster, who has never eaten idle bread.</P>
    <P>I doubt if his work was ever limited to 40 hours a week.  In addition to his work in the Seanad, he has a tremendously impressive research output. Perhaps, the Seanad might like to know that only recently he was offered the headship of the Engineering Department in probably what is the premier Engineering Institute in Great Britain.  That was a tribute to the country and to Senator Dooge.</P>
    <P>Again, we are happy to affirm the role of the part-time politician in the affairs of the country.  There has been far too much emphasis in recent times on the suggestion that we have made some kind of a wonderful transition to wholetime politicians.  The success of the country depends on the contribution of the part-time politicians.  The very prequisite for that is that the person concerned must be a success in his own field and must not at any time neglect that field for his contributions in Seanad Éireann or elsewhere.  Consequently, on all those grounds, I am very happy to support Senator Dooge's nomination.  I feel the Seanad will be very happy to have him as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Senator Timothy McAuliffe be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom an Seanadóir McAuliffe a ainmniú mar Leas-Chathaoirleach don tSeanad.  Táim sásta go bhfuil an Seanadóir McAuliffe fíor-oiriúnach don phost.  In putting forward the name of Senator McAuliffe, we believe that we are putting <Col N="130" /> forward the name of a Senator who is eminently suited to the post of Leas-Chathaoirleach.  He has long experience of public life.  He has been chairman of the Westmeath County Council for a number of years in which post he has done an excellent job.  I am afraid I must disagree with Senator O'Quigley when he points out that we have in the Seanad people who would not be interested, or might not be interested, in the two names that are being put forward. I think we are very fortunate that we have two excellent candidates in Senator Dooge and Senator McAuliffe. I feel it is the duty of every one of us in the Seanad not to be mildly interested but to be very interested in the choice we make.  I believe it is the duty of every Member of the Seanad to take part in this very important business of electing a Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that in Senator McAuliffe we in the Labour Party have put forward a man who is eminently fitted to fill this very important post.  Therefore, it gives me great pleasure to propose Senator McAuliffe as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very great pleasure in seconding the motion proposed by my colleague, Senator J. Fitzgerald.  I should like to make it clear that in doing so I have no desire, or wish, to try to detract from the many qualifications listed in support of the nomination of Senator Dooge.  The candidate standing for our Party is by profession a teacher and in that capacity I think he could bring to the post the qualities of his training and he would be a responsible representative of the House.  I may add that he is also fully qualified to conduct the business of this House entirely in our native language if necessary.  I do not think we can question the ability and the fitness of our candidate to conduct the business of the House responsibly and to the satisfaction of every member on all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my colleague has pointed out, our candidate has a very long and varied experience as a public representative. <Col N="131" /> His nomination has the support of our Party and I strongly recommend his candidature.  I hope no member of the House will shirk the responsibility that rests on him to cast his vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we would all agree that we are fortunate in having before us a choice of two excellent candidates for this post.  It puts us, of course, in a difficulty.  If there were another post to which we could elect the other candidate it would make it easier for us.  We have to make a choice and Senator O'Quigley referred to the distribution of these posts as between the various Parties in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the distribution as between the various vocational interests involved in the two Houses of Parliament.  In an age where science is so important it is only right that one of these posts should go to a scientist, and I see in Senator Dooge an eminent scientist who has given to this House great service.  He has all the qualities for Leas-Chathaoirleach. He has served science well in teaching, in research and in administration. Consequently, on that ground, I feel that, having to make a choice in this difficult circumstance, I would support the nomination of Senator Dooge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I say on your behalf, Sir, that I regret the implication that economics is not a science. What I really rise to say is that I deplore the Party approach to this election.  From a vocational point of view, we do our best work.  We do our worst work when we fall into party politics.  I hope after this lapse today into blatant party politics we will return to our good work of considering vocational matters and of considering things on their merit. Having said that, I have not the slightest doubt that Senator Dooge, who distinguished himself in the last Seanad, is the best man for the office of Leas-Chathaoirleach and I support his candidature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba maith liom <Col N="132" /> míniú pearsanta a dhéanamh ar an rún seo.  I was selected by the Teachers' Organisation to be a candidate for the Seanad election and I was supported by that organisation right through the campaign in 1961 and this year also.  I am entirely free to act as I please in this House, but in 1961 I asked my Executive for a direction on how to vote in the filling of the two posts which are held in this House for Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach, I was advised to observe the <i>status quo</i> since there was a custom that the post of Cathaoirleach went to a person nominated by the largest Party in the House and that of Leas-Chathaoirleach went to the next largest Party.  I duly observed the convention that had been established. Last Saturday this matter was raised at my executive meeting and I was most anxious for advice on the situation, especially in view of the fact that one of the candidates is a colleague of mine in the teaching profession and a member of the Organisation of which I am an official.  The Executive were disposed to be consistent in the matter, in other words, to observe the convention that has been established over the years.</P>
      <P>But, in view of the fact that one of the candidates was a member of the Teachers' Organisation and that a vote against him would be interpreted as a vote against a colleague, the Executive did find itself in a dilemma.  I find myself in something in the nature of a very personal embarrassing dilemma, especially in view of the fact that one of the candidates is a colleague of mine.  I can even describe him as an employer of mine because I am an official of the organisation.  Also, he is a very great personal friend of mine for a long number of years and to take a decision against him would be most painful indeed.  In the circumstances, therefore, I have been directed by my organisation to abstain from voting.  This is a painful decision but it is one in which I have no other alternative.</P>

      <P>The position of Leas-Chathaoirleach is traditionally filled by a Senator who is not a supporter <Col N="133" /> of the Government.  When there was only one candidate, he was elected unanimously.  This time, however, we have two candidates equally qualified for appoiniment, and I feel that the choice is one that should not be influenced by those who support the Government in this House.  We shall, therefore, abstain from voting.</P>

It is really what I would expect but why so many people abstained from voting on this issue is something I do not understand.  We are told that it is a great honour to be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach.  Yet there are people here who show no consideration whatsoever.

      <P>On section 3, subsection (1), the only reference to political offence is at the top of page 4 in the fourth and fifth lines.  This section deals with definitions but it does not tell us what a political offence is.  It tells us what a political offence is not, and I feel that it is an imperfect definition, in fact, not a definition at all.  I would have some difficulty, I admit, in defining a political offence, but I feel that this effort is insufficient.  I put this question on the Second Stage and the Minister then rightly said that he felt it was more a Committee question.  I put the question as to what is the definition of a political offence because, of course, I can remember occasions in this State when there have been differences of opinion as to what constituted a political offence and would warrant political treatment and so on. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I also made on the Second Stage refers to lines 14 and 15 of this section.  I do not want to talk now about revenue offences&mdash;we will come to that later&mdash;but I want to make the point that the phrase &ldquo;any country or place outside the State&rdquo;<Col N="136" /> must mean a place outside the Republic, but the Constitution, of course, defines the State in the English language as Ireland; therefore, I contend that this might be read as meaning outside Ireland.  I wonder, therefore, whether there might not be some conflict between this phrase in this part of the definition and the reference later on to Northern Ireland which apparently is not outside Ireland. Our Constitution refers to the State as being &ldquo;Éire or in the English language Ireland&rdquo;.  I should like to hear the Minister giving his views on that also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>First the definition of a political offence.  This, of course, will be a matter for interpretation by the courts when a claim is made by the person apprehended that the offence for which he is apprehended is palitical. The District Court is obliged to refer it to the Minister for Justice, who may make the decision or refer it to the High Court.  The High Court decides on the facts in the particular circumstances of the case whether those facts warrant the offence to be regarded as a palitical offence, so that there is no difficulty there.  For the guidance of the court there is one exclusion, which is the one referred to by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, that it does not include the taking or attempted taking of the life of a Head of State or a member of his family.  I have a certain sympathy&mdash;and I said this on the Second Stage&mdash;with what Senator Sheehy Skeffington says that it is arguable at any rate that it is anomalous to exclude the Head of State from this category, but other European countries with whom we negotiated the European Convention were insistent on this going in.  It is an accepted exclusion from political offences operating in most European countries so we decided to leave it there.  We were not entirely our own masters in agreeing on that draft of the European Treaty, and for that reason we decided to put in this exclusion from political offences although it could give rise to diffculties of interpretation as to who is or is <Col N="137" /> not a head of State in some revolutionary situation that might arise.  We decided in order to get agreement to adopt this definition.  I hope that it will not arise often in practical terms. I doubt if it will.</P>
      <P>With regard to revenue offences Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked why they are in the same respectable category with political or military offences. Again this is traditional.  It is accepted in Britain and in other European countries as being a traditional exclusion front extradition.  Again it is a matter for the courts as to what is or is not a revenue offence.</P>

      <P>I was coming on to that.  It was raised by the Senator on the Second Reading discussion and I thought this would be the appropriate time.  It is a matter for the court to interpret whether a particular happening is a revenue offence.  The likely interpretation would be to narrow it down to avoidance of tax or duty.  Many forms of smuggling would not be regarded as a revenue offence, such as avoidance of a prohibition or quota order, or the smuggling of narcotics, but this would be a matter for court interpretation.</P>

      <P>Might I draw the Minister's attention to the revenue offence section which says that a revenue offence does not include an offence involving the use or threat of force?  I think we are all agreed that the less qualifications we have in Bills of this nature the more effective they might be.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider that the offences which are here excluded from the protection of revenue offences, such as an offence involving the use or threat of force, or perjury or the forging of a document, are, in fact, substantive offences, and that there might not appear to be any necessity for excluding them.</P>
      <P>I cannot visualise many circumstances in which injustice might be done in relation to the element of perjury.  I think if it is ptnposed to exclude some revenue offences it might be better to leave incidental offences and let them stand or fall on their merits, I can envisage a situation in which the revenue authorities might require a statement on oath from an offender.  If that offender had not made such a statement on oath, he would not be amenable to extradition, but having made such a statement on oath, he might be liable to extradition and, in fact, the position appears to be that he would.  We should be very wary of anything in our own jurisdiction or elsewhere wbich would tend to encourage revenue authorities in that attitude.  I ask the Minister to consider this section again and possibly to amend it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I have more sympathy with the view of Senator Sheehy Skeffington that we should narrow down the definition of <Col N="139" />&ldquo;revenue offence&rdquo;.  If there was any further widening of revenue offences, quite a number of offences would come under the protection of this exemption.  If there is any other offence such as an offence involving the use or threat of force, or perjury, or the forging of a document tied in with a revenue offence, the miscreant can be extradited for an offence other than a revenue offence.  In my view the interpretation of &ldquo;revenue offence&rdquo; should be a narrow one concerned with the avoidance of duty or tax, because any broadening could include many offences for which the offender should properly be extradited.</P>

      <P>I am wondering what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;or an offence connected with a political offence&rdquo;.  For instance, if an extradition were requested in respect of the murder of a policeman who was arresting a person who was involved in a political offence, such as holding a protest meeting on some political matter, I am wondering if that kind of offence is excluded from the category of offences in respect of which an extradition order can be made.  It seems strange as it is.</P>

      <P>A rather similar point occurred to me because of the slightly varied attitude we have sometimes had in this country towards political offences.  I have a feeling that there was a time&mdash;I think it is gone now&mdash;when the notion was abroad in the Republic that shooting a policeman in the North was a political offence and in the South it was not.  I can remember an occasion when a young man was allowed to die on hunger strike in the Republic because his offence, which he claimed to be political, was not admitted to be political by the Government, if I remember correctly.  We should be <Col N="140" /> very clear in our minds what we mean by political offences.  I am relieved by the Minister's assurance that it will be decided by the courts.  I would prefer that to a Government decision on the matter, and I hope it is implicit in the Bill.</P>

      <P>This, of course, is ultimately a matter for the courts.  I cannot at this stage presume to offer an interpretation of what would or would not be a political offence in the particular circumstances obtaining in regard to a particular offence in the circumstances of the particular time. Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to a revolutionary situation which might arise.  At this stage I do not think it would be appropriate for me to say what would or would not constitute a political offence in any such situation. As far as I know, no country has ever succeeded in formulating a precise statutory definition of the circumstances making an offence a political one, a definition that would be valid in every conceivable case.</P>

      <P>When this legislation was contemplated, according to the Minister, they were up against certain difficulties with other countries.  Some of these difficulties were not of the making of the Irish Government but rather was at that other European countries had other views of what political offences might be, particularly with regard to including certain catsgories. When this Bill becomes law, I presume that we will have to wait for a certain build-up of case law.  I am speaking as a layman with regard to this.  We will have to await Proceedings as regards offences in the categories under discussion.  This is where I believe a second safeguard is highly desirable. We should have a certain amount of ministerial power to bring the position into line with that obtaining in some of these other countries.</P>
      <P>If in some of these other countries which are parties to this we have case law built up in which certain decisions are taken and Irish citizens might not agree with them, it is quite possible that we would sign something because the majority signed.  When it comes to an actual decision in a court claim in one of these other countries, will our courts be bound by that decision?  Is it not a fact that lawyers quote and they produce copies from such-and-such a case at such-and-such a time as far as the British law courts are concerned?  In this way we will be bound by a signed document and we will have to accept the verdicts of different European courts which may clash with the views of the Irish public.  Does the Minister believe there is a safeguard in the fact that he, or whoever is Minister, will have a certain amount of discretion to implement what might be desirable from the public point of view?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what is underlying what Senator McQuillan has said and I emphasised that on Second Reading when some Senators took the view that it was <Col N="142" /> undesirable that the Minister for Justice should have the general power which I have here in the Bill to order the release of any prisoner.  It says in section 35:</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever the Minister is of opinion, in relation to a person who is for the time being on remand or awaiting his surrender under this Part, that extradition is prohibited under any provision of this Part or of the relevant extradition provisions, the Minister may at any time refuse extradition.</P>
      <P>(2)  In any such case, or in case it appears to the Minister that the request or intended request for extradition is not being proceeded with, the Minister may order that the said person, if in custody, shall be released.</P>
      <P>The Minister has that general overriding power to release under section 35 and, I think, properly so.  Apart altogether from what the person apprehended may do, whether he applies to the court or to the Minister to decide the issue, where the offence is an excepted offence, I have this power under section 35 which overrides everything.  I think it is proper that the Minister for Justice of the time should have this power.  It is in ease for the person apprehended.</P>

      <P>I am happy enough with what the Minister has said but I think &ldquo;an offence connected with a political offence&rdquo; is a bit loose.  That same phrase occurs under Part III to which we shall come later.  I should like to look at subsection (2).  The same rule should apply and one wonders what the same rule is.  I take it it means that extradition shall not be granted if there are substantial grounds for believing that a request far extradition for an ordinary criminal offence has been made on grounds of race, religion, nationality, and so on.  I take it that is what is meant, that we shall not extradite foreigners here because they are really wanted for the purpose of being prosecuted for something connected with race, religion, or something like that.</P>

This is just to make provision for it in the event of some future occasion where we and some other jurisdiction decided on such a reciprocal arrangement.

      <P>The position is not quite as desirable as the Minister would have us believe.  I understand the Minister to say it should not be possible to have a citizen of Ireland extradited under an agreement without Oireachtas Éireann having first had the opportunity of dealing with the Agreement.  If one looks at section 8 one finds what seems to me to be somewhat strange.  An extradition agreement can be made between the Government of this country and another country; then it comes into force by an Order of this Government and is then in operation.  I have not a copy of the Constitution at the moment but I would have thought any international agreement had to be ratified by the Dáil, firstly, and passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Apparently, that may not be so.  This section may be an effort to get round what I believe to be the position under the Constitution, to give the Government power to make an agreement, then to make an Order bringing it into force.  Then the safeguard of laying it before each House is provided for in section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that in a particular <Col N="146" /> case it could happen.  It might very well be the reason why an extradition agreement would be made to get some citizen of this country extradited. Then, once the agreement is made and in force, it is in operation, and laying it on the table of each House is a very thin and shadowy protection for the citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>If the Order bringing the extradition agreement into operation did not operate until such time as it had first been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, there would be no objection to it because the Oireachtas would have clearly before it the Agreement and would have directed its mind to the fact that citizens of this country could be extradited to Russia, Italy, Spain or somewhere else.</P>
    <P>I do not feel we will get very far on this measure today unless the Minister is disposed to adopt a different attitude. I would urge upon the Minister that any agreement which will provide for the extradition of our citizens should first receive the approval of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  If the Minister will not adopt a different attitude, he might at least give this undertaking, which would be highlighted in his Department for all future Ministers, that if an Agreement provides for the extradition of our citizens then, at the time it is being laid before the Dáil, the special attention of Members of the Oireachtas would be drawn to the fact that an Extradition Agreement had been entered into under the Extradition Act of 1965 and that it provided for, amongst other things, the extradition of Irish citizens. If we did not think that was proper everybody would be aware of that and the provisions in section 4 would be brought into operation.  I am not too happy that merely laying the Order, not even the Agreement, before each House of the Oireachtas is any kind of real safeguard for the citizens of this country.  I would ask the Minister to consider amending that so as to provide that the Order should first be ratified or approved by each House of the Oireachtas before going into operation.</P>

Certainly, I would be disposed to agree that every publicity should be given to all such orders and, as a matter of political practice, Senators can be assured that this is not a provision which would be lightly made by any Government.  It is not a situation I would envisage happening in the immediate future but, as countries get together, there might be an occasion when this could arise from closer communications and so on.  It is certainly a matter which would not arise without the utmost publicity, at least as long as I am Minister for Justice.

We would then feel a good deal less foreboding about what might happen in the future.</P>

      <P>On section 19 the position is we will not extradite anybody to a country where the death penalty is in operation and where it would not be in operation for a similar offence in the State.  Section 19 goes on to say:</P>
      <P>or is not generally carried out unless the requesting country gives such assurance as the Minister considers sufficient that the death penalty will not be carried out.</P>
      <P>I presume that the death penalty will not be carried out in the requesting country.  The law in relation to the death penalty in this country has become a little obscure as a result of recent enactments of the Oireachtas. I am wondering what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;not generally carried out&rdquo;. I take it that it is this State to which that relates.</P>

      <P>Again, this is following the language of the European Convention.  I think it is reasonable enough because apart from offences punishable by death under the law of the requesting country it may be that apart from the actual existing law the requesting State may be able to assure us that it is not generally carried out.  We must be satisfied by the assurance from the country that capital punishment will not be carried out.  The Minister would not agree to extradition unless he was fully satisfied and had every assurance from the requesting country that in fact as well as in law the <Col N="149" /> capital punishment would not be effected.</P>

      <P>Section 19 says that extradition shall not be granted for an offence punishable by death under the law of the requesting country.  Does this not tie the Minister's hands?  The corresponding article 11 in the convention says</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the offence for which extradition is requested is punishable by death under the law of the requesting Party, and if in respect of such offence the death penalty is not provided for by the law of the requested Party or is not normally carried out, extradition may be refused unless the requesting Party gives such assurance as the requested Party considers sufficient that the death penalty will not be carried out.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be somewhat afraid that once an assurance has been given to the Minister that the death penalty will not be carried out in whatever other country the offender has escaped from the Minister, if he considers that assurance sufficient, has no option but to apply for extradition.  If, in fact, it has the contrary effect that a person amenable to capital punishment in his own country can safely come here in the knowledge that unless such an assurance is given he will not be extradited to his own country the danger might arise then that this is an invitation to those who might be amenable to capital punishment. I am fully in support of the more enlightened and humane attitude towards capital punishment, but we should afford ourselves protection that we are not inviting people who might be amenable to capital punishment here.  This section could have that effect unless the Minister gives himself some discretion in the wording, such <Col N="151" /> as that extradition may be refused.  At the moment it is that it shall not be granted.  It gives a guarantee which may be availed of by those who otherwise would be amenable to capital punishment.</P>

      <P>I should like to speak in opposition to what Senator O'Kennedy has just said.  This is an excellent section.  It seems to me to be quite clear and a very good provision.  We refuse to hand over people subject to capital punishment in other countries who would not be subject to capital punishment here.  It is a most humane section, and I feel that the wording which has been criticised is wording that we should have&mdash;that extradition shall not be granted unless all the safeguards are there.  The Minister has to assure himself that the assurances given are sufficient before we hand over somebody. Ireland in this is following in both a commonsense and a humane tradition.  The section as it stands is well worthy of our support.</P>

In fact, the section in the Convention says that extradition may be refused but we have bound ourselves that it shall be granted.  The fact that we have written into our statute that it shall not be granted gives a guarantee to some person who would otherwise be liable that if he comes to Ireland he is no longer amenable.  I see no reason why he should not come to Ireland in such circumstances.</P>

There may be a case in which I, personally, feel that extradition is prohibited At the same time, I may receive advice to the contrary.  In such a case I should be free to let the matter proceed and be decided ultimately by the High Court.  There is a greater degree of flexibility as it is, and I think that is desirable.</P>

      <P>This section is likely to give rise to considerable difficulty.  It is provided that where a citizen of this country commits a crime abroad which is also a crime in this country, first of all, he will not be extradited from this country and, secondly, with the consent of the Attorney General he can be tried for that offence as if it had been committed within the State and punished as if he had committed it within the State.  It seems to me that this will give rise to conflicts as between the laws establishing the law of evidence in the two States.  I rather think the Bill should provide quite specifically that if the trial of the offence is to take place within the State then all procedure and the law of evidence applicable in this State would be clearly applicable in the <Col N="161" /> trial of the person.  For instance, if a statement is taken by a policeman in France he may or may not be obliged to give the person the usual caution&mdash; that the person is not obliged to say anything unless he wishes to do so, and that anything he says will be taken down and used in evidence.  The French police, for all I know, may have their own methods of getting statements and judging by Maigret they have unusual methods in France. But, what is a district justice of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court to do when he finds himself confronted with a statement taken by a French policeman?</P>

It may be a perfectly valid and reasonable statement and perfectly admissible in evidence in France.

I should say that, in <Col N="162" /> practice, this is a section I would envisage being used little in the law. It is a section which the other European parties to the Convention thought should be there.  In practice, it would want to be an unusual offence that would drive our authorities to the extent of bringing personnel from France or Germany or any other country to give evidence in our courts where they would be subject to our full procedures, such as the insistence on oral evidence and so on.  That situation would obviously be an unusual one.  I cannot see this being exercised to any significant extent.  I would emphasise that in such an eventuality the rules of evidence applying would be those applying in Irish courts and would be in accordance with the law administered by Irish courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (a), line 29, before &ldquo;in&rdquo; where it first occurs to insert &ldquo;by a judicial authority being for the purpose of this Part either a court, judge, justice or magistrate exercising judicial power&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that the two amendments run together so well.  However, I shall take them together.  The Minister was kind enough to give me a copy of the measure that was, or is, in process of being passed through the British Parliament on the occasion when we were here last.  I regret to say the English version is a little bit more careful of the rights of English citizens than this measure here before us is of Irish citizens.  That is all the more strange in view of the fact that we have a written Constitution which circumscribes the power of this Legislature, whereas, as everybody knows, the British Parliament can enact anything it likes.  As I was reading section <Col N="163" /> 54 of the Bill, I came across this phrase in subsection (2):</P>
    <P>A certificate, appearing to be given by the authority or the clerk or other officer of the authority.</P>
    <P>I wondered what &ldquo;the authority&rdquo; was and I looked at the definition section in Part I and in Part III and no Part of the Bill says what is in mind or what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;the authority&rdquo; in the first line of subsection (2).</P>
    <P>In the British Act they at least go the distance of referring to it as a judicial authority.  I think we ought to make it quite clear, in order to remove the considerable doubt, what is meant by introducing in section 54 the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo; without having made any previous reference to it.  We ought to make it quite clear what &ldquo;authority&rdquo; we have in mind.</P>
    <P>In section 43, to which the first amendment relates, I would like it made quite clear that a warrant has been issued by a judicial authority. That is the only authority we should recognise as having any competence to issue a warrant to restrict or terminate the freedom of a citizen of this country.  Therefore, I feel we ought to insert the words &ldquo;judicial authority&rdquo; meaning, for the purpose of this section, a judge, court, or magistrate exercising judicial power.  Certainly lawyers never pretend to know the law of any country other than their own. While we do have the English Reports and have access to English textbooks and English statutes, I think, none of us would be quite prepared to say who is the judicial authority in England. There are magistrates and magistrates. As I understand it, in certain circumstances the Mayor of London Council becomes the magistrate empowered with authority to act as a judge.  As I understand the position, Justices of the Peace in England&mdash;and here I speak entirely subject to correction because I speak of the law of another country &mdash;are persons who may be retired majors, retired admirals or somebody else who like to participate in some useful and beneficial public work. Who the clerks of these authorities are <Col N="164" /> or what their qualifications may be I do not know.</P>
    <P>In section 54 we are asked to say to the courts in this country that once they get a certificate appearing to be issued by the authority, the clerk, or other officer of the authority, without defining what that authority is, that would bind every court in this country up to the Supreme Court.  That seems to me to be greatly attenuating the freedom of our citizens and would convert our courts into mere post boxes to receive the certificates of unnamed persons in Britain.  In addition, it might not be possible to find out, and it might not even be possible for our courts to find out, what the law is in relation to magistrates in England and Wales.  Scottish law varies quite considerably from English law and they have strange things in the Isle of Man.  I do not know what they have in the Outer Hebrides.  I do not know what they have in the Channel Islands to which, indeed, many of our citizens go on holiday and where they may commit crimes for which an extradition order may be sought.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to accept that a warrant issued in the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands or Scotland is to constitute the whole of the document and all the evidence upon which the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána will act.  I certainly think that this House should not lend itself to abrogating or attenuating the liberty of Irish citizens in the way we are being invited to do under this Bill.  I also hope that the House will not lend itself to treating our courts, with our independent judges, as being mere recipients of documents appearing to be signed by the authority, whatever that is supposed to be, or the clerk or other officer of the authority.</P>
    <P>One might find under the British Act that the clerk was to have certain qualifications but when you get into the realm of &ldquo;other officer of the authority&rdquo; it might be, without meaning any disrespect, the person who attended to the fires or some such person.  It might be a mere clerical officer&mdash;somebody with no judicial training whatsoever&mdash;who might be <Col N="165" /> empowered by the magistrate who might say: &ldquo;Will you sign that and send it out by the next post?  They want it over in Dublin.&rdquo;  That kind of thing must not be allowed to happen and this House should take s very firm stand in relation to this convenient method of getting Irish citizens ready for trial in England, Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands.  While I am speaking on these two amendments, it occurs to me that it might be convenient for the House, if it were to agree, that amendment No. 9 would also be taken in conjunction with them because amendment No. 9 relates to deleting subsection (2) of section 54.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to agree with Senator O'Quigley, if the person who can issue a warrant could be properly defined.  Apparently what Senator O'Quigley wants to achieve is that a warrant should not be acted upon unless it has been issued by somebody who is entitled to do so. Senator O'Quigley seems to have answered, or rather raised, in his speech the difficulties of doing this because he has used the terms &ldquo;a court judge, justice or magistrate exercising judicial power&rdquo;.  As a matter of fact, in relation to some of the places from where warrants may come such warrants may be issued by people who are perfectly entitled to issue them but who are not court judges, justices or magistrates.  They might call themselves by some other name and, consequently, I cannot see that the particular amendment suggested here would achieve the purpose Senator O'Quigley has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amendment provided that a warrant must be issued by a person entitled to issue it or whatever the particular words might be, I would see some sense in it but it does place a <Col N="166" /> very heavy onus on the authorities here to go into the matter of whether or not the person who issued the warrant was entitled to do So.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Eoin Ryan has raised the precise point against defining the judicial authority as suggested by Senator O'Quigley.  For instance, under the British Bill they regard a peace commissioner here as a judicial authority for the purpose of our warrants over there.  Our difficulty is that we are dealing with a number of different legal jurisdictions.  You have various officers under Scottish law, all of completely different descriptions, and there are other names in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands but it would be confusing and quite unnecessary to set them all out in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley suggests in amendment No. 8 to insert merely &ldquo;a judicial authority&rdquo;, and I would be disposed to agree with this and similarly where it occurs in section 43. That would meet what Senator O'Quigley and Senator E. Ryan have in mind without getting us involved in descriptions here of judicial authoroties under the various jutrisdictions referred to.</P>

      <P>We are dealing now with extradition between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and in this Particular context I am wondering whether the Minister is wise from the viewpoint of our political relations with the North of Ireland to take unto <Col N="167" /> himself the power to decide what is a political offence.  As matters stand, the Minister may decide it in some cases or he may refer the matter to the High Court to decide wltetlter a particular set of facts constitutes a political offence.  In some cases it may be that public opinion in Northern Ireland may be outraged by a particular offence and then the person may have escaped over the border and come down here.  The Minister and opinion here might be disposed to regard it as a political offence, in which event we would not be disposed to extradite the person to Northern Ireland, and then that would involve a direct clash of interests between the Government in Belfast and our Government, when our Minister for Justice has taken a ministerial decision that a certain offence is a political offence, and that might do nothing to improve relations between ourselves and Northern Ireland.  It would be far better if in all those cases the Minister referred the matter to the High Court.  If the High Court decides that a political offence is involved, then a different kind of situation exists from one where a political person, namely the Minister, decides that it is a political offence.  The Minister and the Government are then not responsible for the decision, as the courts are independent. That would be accepted by the Govemment of Northern Ireland.  If they looked for the extradition of a particular person and after going through the ordinary process that it had gone to the High Court, which had declared that it was a political offence, then the Minister could show the requesting authority in Northern Ireland the order of the High Court.  That would draw less odium upon the Government in Dublin than if the Minister decided that it was a political offence or decided to refer it to the High Court. It would be far better from the point of our relations with the North to leave the matter entirely to the High Court.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to say that this is an additional provision in ease of a person being apprehended over and above the provisions <Col N="168" /> of the English Bill, which contains no such provision safeguarding the person who might be apprehended. We have decided that this shall be included in section 44, whereas the British Home Secretary has no such power in relation to people apprehended there.  It is very important that we should ensure to the maximum degree possible that if we are to enter into extradition arrangements, nobody should be extradited from here unless it is proved fully through the ministerial or the judicial route that he should be extradited.  Apart from the procedure when the person is arrested, which is on all fours with the British provision, this is an additional pre-arrest provision. As an administrative procedure the Commissioner of the Garda can refer the matter to the Minister or the Minister may request him to refer it to him.  Through either route and before the execution of the warrant by the Commissioner, the Minister for Justice may decide that the offence is not one for which a warrant should issue or he may ask the High Court to decide the question of whether or not it is an exempted offence.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly about this section.  I think it is proper that there should be this additional provision to ensure that a warrant does not even go out for a person's arrest if the Minister thinks that it should not go out and if he is in any difficulty he can refer it even before the warrant goes out to the High Court for determination.  Senator McQuillan was on this point earlier and Senator Sheehy Skeffington also touched on it. It is important to ensure that apart from the courts a ministerial decision can be taken in ease of the person to be apprehended either before he is arrested or after arrest.  This enables the Minister to stop any arrest procedure taking place if he feels that it is wrong that a person should be arrested or if he is doubtful, to refer it to the High Court to decide.</P>

      <P>I do not doubt at all the desirability of having as many safeguards as possble, and that is my concern in this Bill, to provide as <Col N="169" /> many safeguards as possible for Irish citizens, but what I am concerned about now is the impact of this kind of procedure on what I hope will be our growing friendly relatians with Northern Ireland.  One can see the kind of situation when the Minister, if he adopted this procedure, would incur great displeasure on the part of the Northern Ireland authorities, especially if it were a political offence.</P>
      <P>What I was suggesting was that this pre-arrest procedure should not be invoked by the Minister but that it should go direct to the High Court.  In all likelihood what the Minister would consider a political offence where extradition would not lie would also be considered by the High Court to be a political offence and this irritation would not arise and the whole matter would end at that.  If the Minister wants to safeguard the citizen and if the High Court took the decision which was not to his liking and if he felt that in all the circumstances the person should not be extradited, he has all the power at that stage under section 50 which he could invoke.</P>
      <P>In the kind of case I speak about the Minister would not have to invoke the power very frequently because the High Court under section 44 would declare the offence to be a political offence so that the necessity for ministerial intervention would be very rare. It is purely a question of the wisdom of exacerbating unnecessarily feelings in Northern Ireland, especially when they decide that the matter is samething where they should gat extradition. It is purely upon that basis that I made the observation.  I agree with the Minister that every safeguard possible should be provided for our citizens in the Bill, but I think he is giving himself a troublesome power under section 44.</P>

      <P>I am moving this amendment because of an amendment I moved in the Dáil at the request of Deputy Dillon.  There was a similar provision in section 40 in respect of transit where we deemed custody by another police force within our jurisdiction as lawful custody.

      <P>Section 47 subsection (5) provides that after proceedings in the district court terminate there will not be any appeal to the circuit court from the district court.  The Minister may say there is always the right of <i>habeas corpus</i> and the right of appeal to the Minister, but I do not see any reason why we should exclude appeal to the circuit court, especially in view of the fact that these proceedings will normally be taken in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court.  The circuit court is continuously sitting in Dublin and most of these extradition cases will come before the Dublin Metropolitan District Court.  I do not see any reason why a person should not be entitled to appeal to the circuit court.  There is no restriction on this right of appeal in the British Act so far as I can gather, and I am wondering why it is introduced in this section.</P>

      <P>I am entirely against this amendment because the person already has an opportunity of going <Col N="171" /> to the High Court or making representations to the Minister.  It seems to me quite unnecessary that he should also be permitted to go to the circuit court.  With certain qualifications, the general rule of our courts is that here is one appeal: from the district court to the circuit court from the circuit court to the High Court, from the High Court to the Supreme Court.  Consequently, in accordance with this general principle of normally having one appeal, I see no reason whatever for bringing the circuit court into this.  Apart from anything else, it seems to me that it would raise difficulties.  If you are entitled to go to the circuit court and you are not satisfied in the circuit court, are you entitled to appeal to the High Court? I see no reason for including an appeal to the circuit court.</P>

This is adding an extra legal link in the chain which is already well established in regard to <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings, where you go straight to the High Court for a determinarion of the liberty of the individual.  I think there is an ample set of procedures open to the person apprehended and it is only putting on extra costs and wasting time to go through a rehearing procedure in the circuit court to be followed by an application to the High Court, and possibly a ministerial determination.  What went on in the circuit court would only be a rehearing of what went on in the district court.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> To delete subsection (2) and substitute :</P>
    <P>&ldquo;() Evidence with respect to the law of the place concerned that the offence to which a warrant issued by a judicial authority is an indictable offence and not also a summary offence, or that it as a summary offence, punishable by a specified maximum period of imprisonment may be given by affidavit or other written statement on oath and a certificate purporting to be issued by or on behalf of a judicial authority certifying the law at the place concerned may be accepted by the Commissioner as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the matters stated in such affidavit, written statement on oath or certificate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of this section cannot be read merely in relation to the activities of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  As it stands, perhaps it might be all right that the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána need only be satisfied that certain documents were valid for what they said. When section 55 is also read, you are advised in clause (c) of subsection (1) that what is to be regarded as certain evidence by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána in apprehending a person is in effect to bind the courts of this country.  That includes the High Court.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier this evening, the position is that no lawyer in this country can know with any degree of certainty what is the law in the various parts of the United Kingdom, to which Part III of this Bill applies.  Even the law of England and Wales, which is more closely akin to our own, is not always easily understood by Irish lawyers.  Subsection (2) of section 54 sets out that a certificate appearing to be given by the authority&mdash;I take it the Minister would agree that that should be by the judicial authority&mdash;or the clerk or other officer of the authority by which a warrant was issued, that the offence to which it relates is, by the law of the place concerned, an indictable offence.  That is to be accepted without further evidence.  The Commissioner of the <Col N="175" /> Garda Síochána may, on the evidence in that certificate, determine the liberty of the citizen to whom that evidence refers.  Section 55 (1) says:</P>
    <P>In any procecdings, unless the court sees good reason to the contrary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(c) a certificate appearing to be given in accordance with subsection (2) of section 54 may be admitted as evidence of the matters certified therein.</P>
    <P>We are asking the District Court, the High Court and any court, in cases where there are <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings, to accept that if a clerk of a judicial authority in England or the Isle of Man or other officer signs a certificate saying that a particular offence is an offence in that country, then it is an indictable offence or a summary offence of a particular character, it is binding.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this case has a compulsory meaning because there is no other evidence on which the Irish courts can judge.</P>
    <P>We are asking the courts to accept that a document signed by a clerk in the Mayor's Court in London, or the clerk or any other clerical person in any other judicial authority, is good evidence of the law of England, the Isle of Man or somewhere else for our courts.  The Minister, earlier this evening, spoke about revenue offences, political offences and so on and laid great stress on what was tradition.  It has been traditional in this country, and we might as well be quite clear what we are enacting here, that when it is sought to apprehend a person from the State of Massachusetts in America, someone from England, France, or the Isle of Man, it is always done by affidavit made by a barrister or lawyer practising in these countries, an affidavit properly sworn and authenticated before a notary and the consul of the country certifies that the person sioning it is capable of doing so.</P>
    <P>In this country, as far as swearing evidence in Great Britain is concerned, we always accept evidence sworn before an English notary.  Subsection (2) is in relation to criminal offences <Col N="176" /> and refers to the liberty of the person about which the Minister is very properly concerned and in relation to which he has gone to considerable lengths in the Bill otherwise than in this section.  Here we are asking our courts to act upon a certificate issued by some unknown functionary in the office of the courts in England the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands.  That information should not be accepted by our courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that in Section 55 the words are: &ldquo;In any proceedings, unless the courts see good reason to the contrary&rdquo;.  How can our courts find good reason to the contrary?  What opinion do they get? They get a certificate signed by some person who purports to be an officer of the judicial authority in the Isle of Man or somewhere else which says that this is an indictable offence.  Our courts have no other means of knowing and they have no choice but to accept what is signed in that document. The other provisions in this Bill with regard to safeguarding the rights of our citizens are satisfactory.  The phrase in subsection (2) of Section 54 is completely nugatory.  I would strongly urge the Minister to go some distance with me on this amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not require that there should be the full authentication by a notary public that you would have if you were dealing with the law in Massachusetts, Belgium or Holland.  We should have a statement by the judicial authority in England swearing accoring to his opinion that such is the law and such is an indictable offence.  I would urge the Minister not to destroy an otherwise excellent Bill which shows every concern for the wellbeing and the liberty of our citizens by a section which, in my opinion, is a crucial section in the Bill.  This is real evidence that will be placed before the district court.  I would strongly urge the Minister to have second thoughts about this matter and to have another look at subsection (2).  I am aware of certain implications in my own draft.  I think the words <i>&ldquo;prima facie&rdquo;</i> might be left out and that included in section 55.  Notwithstanding that, I do think the amendment which <Col N="177" /> I propose in amendment No. 9 is very much in accord with tradition and indeed is in accord with what has been established throughout the whole of this Bill, solicitude for the wellbeing and the liberty of our citizens, and I would urge on the Minister to have a second thought about it.</P>

      <P>I must ask the Seanad not to accept this amendment. There is a difference in the relationship between the Irish police and the British police and the Irish police and the police of Afghanistan.  There is more contact between the Liverpool and Dublin police than there is between the Liverpool and London police.  Now, as a result of the Quinn and Hammond cases, we must have a court procedure in every case.  This is an important matter I agree but, in fact, the British Bill in this regard is on all fours with our Bill.  When the British go to the extent of recognising the Irish peace commissioner I do not think it is unreasonable to recognise an officer of the British authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The peace commissioner is spelled out in the British Bill.  Then I feel we are not unreasonable in recognising a certificate from an officer of the British authority as <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  As it is, I shall meet the Senator to the extent of defining &ldquo;the authority&rdquo; as the &ldquo;judicial authority&rdquo;.  I shall have that considered between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, I must emphasise that in the section as it now stands the fullest protection is there.  The Commissioner's acceptance of this is discretionary. It is very important that the certificate itself when produced in court is <i>prima facie</i> evidence when signed by the proper authority.  The Commissioner may object if he wants to and he may raquire further evidence that it is a correct statement of the law.  When it comes into court it is <Col N="178" /> still only <i>prima facie</i> and the discrict justice may reject it.  Again, if the person is dissatisfied with the nature or validity of the certificate or of any other of the documents, he or she may go to the High Court on the basis of it heing invalid.  So there as nothing final in this as it stands.  The British agree to recognise our judicial officers, including peace commissioners, and we recognise theirs as well.  Where such a document may be accepted by the Commissioner it is being made <i>prima facie</i> evidence, but only <i>prima facie</i> evidence, so far as the courts are concerned.</P>
    <P>Again, in these procedures I feel there is ample protection for the person being apprehended.  I think Senator O'Quigley's fears are groundless.</P>

We all know what police can do happily and amicably between each other and that is very fine for the police and for the Department of Justice but it might not be fine and happy for the citizens of this country.</P>
      <P>Let there be no doubt at all about it that in this section we are asking the courts to accept as evidence on a matter that is affecting the liberty of our citizens, the kind of evidence that the courts did not accept in civil proceedings where liberty is not at stake.</P>

      <P>What choice is there?  What other evidence is there? That is the kind of evidence we are asking.  If we want to know, in the case of a will referring to a deposit of £250 in the Savings Bank owned by somebody in the State of Massachusetts, what the law relating to wills in Massachusetts is our courts require an affidavit made by a lawyer in America signed by a Notary Public and certified by the Supreme Court in Massachusetts. In turn it is certified by an Irish Consul who is entitled to certify the Notary Public's signature.  That is the kind of safeguard we have in relation to trifling matters such as £250 deposit in the Post Office Savings Bank.  Here <Col N="179" /> we are asking in relation to the liberty of Irish citizens that our Irish courts shall act upon the certificate by, as it says, the judicial authority or other person who may have no competence in regard to the law other than he has always been signing these things and he continues to sign them.  That is the kind of evidence we are asked in our courts to be bound by.  There is no choice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The person apprehended makes the case that the warrant or any of the other supporting documents are not valid or contain incorrect statements of the law.  If he does so in the District Court, that Court may determine the matter in his favour and if the district justice determines the matter against him he can go to the High Court by way of <i>habeas corpus</i> application.  The person apprehended can raise all the evidence in the world he wishes to destroy or invalidate the warrant on which he is to be extradited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is approaching the thing from the wrong angle and is not the traditional approach of our judges on matters criminal.  The Minister says the person apprehended can show that the warrant was wrongly signed, that the evidence was wrongly defined, but that is not the case in our courts.  Our courts say that it is for the State and for anybody who is interfering with the liberty of Irish citizens to establish beyond all reasonable doubt that the person has committed the offence.  The shoe is never on the other foot.  It is not for the person who is charged and brought before the court to establish his innocence or to establish that the State is wrong; it is for the State to prove that they are right in saying that the person charged is guilty of the offence.  These should also be <i>prima facie</i> evidence before encroaching <Col N="180" /> in any way on the laberties and rights of Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that this is a procedure which has worked happily between the Liverpool police and the Dublin police for a long time and that this question of proving laws never arose in the Quinn case.  One always admires the great assurance the Minister has about these matters but I happened to be in the Supreme Court listening to the proceedings at the particular time.  This question did not arise in the Philip Anthony Quinn case&mdash;at least in that part of the proceedings that the public know of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before business was suspended, I was dealing with some things which the Minister had said.  I do not think it is correct to say that the sufficiency or validity of the evidence in this kind of extradition cases was ever considered by either the Divisional Court or by the Supreme Court in the Philip Anthony Quinn case.  On the contrary, some of the judges of the Supreme Court did direct questions to counsel in the case as to the means by which to establish what was the law in England with regard to particular offences.  For that reason I think that whatever may have been the practice up to now in relation to the backing of warrants in this country and in Great Britain is not something we should take as having been critically examined by the courts in this country and having satisfied them as to the correctness of the procedures adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again stress the fact that the law applicable to offences in England and in the other parts of the United Kingdom to which Part III of this Bill applies is by no means as clear cut as onc would wish it to be for the <Col N="181" /> purpose of this Bill.  The Minister referred to the trust which the English Parliament is putting in our peace commissioners.  It merely emphasises what I was saying, that evidently the draftsman in England or whoever was advising him came to the conclusion from an examination of our law that Peace Commissioners were to be in some way equated to either a Justice of the Peace or to some similar authority in England.  The plain truth is that a certificate issued by a Peace Commissioner in this country in relation to what the law is would be as worthless as a certificate issued by the first man you would meet in the street in the ordinary course of events because a peace commissioner, as we know, has no particular legal competence and does not preiend to have it.  It was, therefore, a grave mistake, if I might say so, on the part of the people in England to assume that a Peace Commissioner was a judicial authority as far as the law on this side was concerned.</P>
    <P>I would again urge the Minister not to besmirch his own standing or to destroy this Bill by incorporating in it a provision such as in subsection (2) of section 54.  I would again urge that the statement as to what the law is in Britain or in any other place to which this Bill will apply should be made by affidavit.  The Minister will readily appreciate that that will create no undue difficulty for the authorities in England to have an affidavit sworn as to the state of the law and will be much more acceptable and much more in accord with established legal practice in this country.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the English Bill which correspond with subsection (2) of this section are somewhat better than is contained in subsection (2).  I have not with me at the moment a copy of the English measure, but my recollection of it is that it goes the distance of having a certificate from a judicial authority.  I do not mind if we have that, that if it is a judicial authority and it permits a certificate by a clerk of a judicial authority or of subordinate persons in this country including peace commissioners.  That is a mistake on the part of the British. <Col N="182" /> The terms of the British Act, I think. are a little more strict than what is contained in subsection (2).  I would most earnestly urge the Minister not to leave this section in its unamended form.  He will be deserving of nothing but praise and credit from the members of the legal profession if he makes the amendment which I suggest should be made.  He can make it in the certain knowledge that at is much more in accord with established practice than what is contained here.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say there is no such provision in the British Act.  If any difficulties arise, and I do not think they will, it should be pointed out to the British authorities that the British Parliament as not trammelled&mdash; for better or wocse as far as the British citizens are concerned&mdash;or inhibited in any way by a written Constitution.  We here have a written Constitution and I think that will be recognised by the British authorities as a good reason why we must be very circumspect in incorporating in a statute any provision which circumscribes and limits the liberty of Irish citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view the apprehension of Senator O'Quigley in connection with these sections is entirely misplaced.  He is concerned with the principle of our law that a citizen is innocent until he has been proved guilty by the State.  He is concerned with the principle of the onus of proof which must be discharged by the State. He seems to be overlooking the fact that that principle applies only where a person is accused of a crime, where a person is an accused person standing trial for a crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not dealing with that in these cases.  We are not dealing with persons accused of crime.  That is not the purpose of this Bill.  We are dealing merely with the machinery for extradition and, consequently, that principle does not apply.  Where a person seeks the protection, as it were, of the court&mdash;the person who is about to be extradited&mdash;the court marely finds whether it is proper for the request to be acted upon.  It does not find whether he is guilty of crime.  It <Col N="183" /> does not go into the merits of the crime at all.  There is no blemish on him at that stage if he is subsequently extradited.  He has not been found guilty of a crime.  He is not put in any position of being found guilty of anything. The cousts have merely found that the machinery of extradition should go into operation.</P>
    <P>He goes to another country to stand trial.  In fact, under this Bill he goes to a country where the principle of the onus of proof and the principle that a person is innocent until he has been found guilty operate.  He will then have the opportunity of standing his trial, and those principles will operate in his favour.  Consequently, no one who is a subject of the sections with which we are dealing will be found guilty of a crime without having the principles in question operate in his favour.</P>
    <P>In my view, therefore, Senator O'Quigley is concerned about the consequences and the points which he raised and the principle which he states which, of course, is a very good principle and a proper principle to defend, but they are irrelevant in these circumstances because we are not deaiing with a person accused of a crime being found guilty or not guilty by the court which is dealing with these sections.</P>

      <P>Of course, Senator Eoin Ryan is a senior counsel and one is rather abashed at disagreeing with him.  If we take it upon the basis of equality as Members of Seanad Éireann we need not be so abashed. I do not know whether the lawyer or the politician was operating when he spoke just now.  Of course, I know we are not dealing with whether a person is innocent or guilty.  I never said that. What I did say was that the Minister said that if these documents are not in order, or if the offence with which he is charged is not an indictable offence, then the person whose extradition is being sought can prove all these things are wrong.  I said that is quite out of harmony with our attitude towards persons we are depriving of their liberty.</P>

It is for the State. or whoever wants to deprive him of his liberty, to establish beyond yea or nay that he should be deprived of his liberty.  I was merely dealing with the Minister's argument when he said that the person could prove those things were wrong.  That is not the way it should be done.  It is for the British authorities to satisfy the Irish Minister and the Irish High Court that they are right in seeking the extradition of, remember, one of our citizens. That is what I am concerned about.  Senator Eoin Ryan took up the next point and said this is an Extradition Bill.  What are we doing?  We are forcibly taking Irish citizens&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I am going home tonight and a police officer comes up to me and says : &ldquo;We have a warrant out for you&rdquo;, I go down to the district court, and appeal to the Minister after 15 days in the Bridewell or Mountjoy <Col N="185" /> or some remand home.  That is quite a long time.  It is quite a long time for a labourer or anybody else.  During all that time he is deprived of his liberty. If that citizen comes back to this country, after being found to be innocent, there is nothing in the Bill to say that he gets even a halfpenny compensation for the time he has been in the Bridewell, in England or anywhere else.  The person who is extradited, while he is being proved innocent or guilty, may be lodged in some English gaol for God knows how long.  When we extradite a person we are depriving him of his liberty for a minimum of 15 days or much longer.  He has to remain there while he is establishing his innocence or the other party has a chance to establish his guilt.</P>
      <P>We are compelling the Irish courts from the district court to the High Court, and the Supreme Court if there is an appeal in a <i>habeas corpus</i> case to accept the written statement of some official belonging to the judicial authority anywhere in the United Kingdom as being the law of that part of the United Kingdom.  That requirement is quite insufficient to establish the law of any foreign country to the satisfaction of our courts.  If the House wants to accept that, it can do so, but I would again most earnestly urge the Minister not to yield to the dictates of convenience or expediency in this matter.</P>
      <P>I most earnestly urge the Minister to have regard for the liberty of our citizens and for the dignity of our courts.  We should not ask the courts to accept what is contained in the statement of some official anywhere in the British Isles who happens to be a clerk or a servant of the judicial authority.  This is the only evidence that the accused person can adduce.  It ought not to be for the accused person to adduce that evidence.  It should be for the State, which wants to deprive our citizens of their liberty, to produce sworn testimony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I most earnestly urge the Minister to consider this matter.  He will lose nothing in the convenience of time if he insists on that requirement being put into the Bill.  It is a complete <Col N="186" /> answer to the British authorities to say: &ldquo;We have a written Constitution. We have a lot of trouble with this kind of thing.  This is what we require.&rdquo;  I believe the British, who are always reasonable in matters of this sort, will accept this as a reasonable matter.  They require, in their own court, a sworn statement as to the law of this country or any other country in most criminal proceedings which are much less important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At all stages during the passage of this Bill in the Dáil and here I have been open to constructive suggestions.  I have tried to incorporate them in the Bill, but I see no merits whatever in these particular amendments.  I have examined them closely.  We have, as I said at an earlier stage, safeguards for the person apprehended, which go ahead of the British measure.  We have, in section 44, a safeguard where I can refuse to endorse a warrant for execution prior to the warrant being executed if, in my view, the person who is charged is not guilty of an extradictable offence.  This is over and above what the British have in their Act.  It has additional safeguards in that it empowers the Minister for Justice, before the actual arrest proceedings start, to order that the warrant shall not be executed and that no action be taken in respect of the alleged crime for which the person is being apprehended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is a very important section and is over and above what the British have.  In addition to that, in section 50 the Minister for Justice has power which the Home Secretary has not got in the British Act.  If the person apprehended refers to the Minister, the Minister may decide to release that person on the basis that the offence is not an extraditable one. The Minister has these powers in both sections 44 and 50.  One refers to pre-arrest procedure and the other to after-arrest procedure.  They come to the rescue of a person whom it is sought to extradite.  The Minister can order that person's release.  We have gone very far to ease the lot of the person who is apprehended.  We have gone <Col N="187" /> much further than the British have gone.</P>
    <P>We come now to the particular amendments to sections 54 and 55.  I want to emphasise that our provisions are on all fours with the British in their Bill.  We know that the system of law, as operated in Britain, is on all fours with our system in regard to the protection of people.  We know, in criminal matters, a person apprehended will get a fair trial in Britain and, as Senator Eoin Ryan says, such a person is innocent until he is proved guilty.</P>
    <P>We are concerned here with the machinery of the reciprocal arrangements for extradition between here and Britain.  All that is required is that a warrant should be issued by a judicial authority or an officer of the judicial authority.  Britain recognies our position in that regard and includes a certificate issued by or on behalf of a peace commissioner.  It would be invidious of us not to recognise the officer of the judicial authority in Britain as well.  We are doing what the British are doing.  As far as the Commissioner is concerned, he may take a document to be a warrant prepared in a proper form if there is an affidavit authenticating the signature on the warrant.</P>
    <P>He may accept that warrant as being a due warrant with a properly signed affidavit.  He may decide to reject it if it appears to him to be faulty in any way.  I want to emphasise that because of what Senator O'Quigley said in that respect on the Second Stage.  Furthermore, when a person to be apprehended comes before the district court, that warrant and the affidavit verifying the signature on the warrrant are both <i>prima facie</i> documents. The district justice may decide there is something faulty in the document and on the application of the apprehended person he may decide the warrant is not to be accepted by him. He may require supporting evidence because of doubt he has in his mind or because the person accused may make that application to him.  The accused person has that right under <Col N="188" /> section 50 of the Bill to go to the High Court or the Minister.  Therefore, you have here, in my view, built in at all stages ample protection for the individual who is apprehended.  It is quite clear that the opening preamble in section 55 governs the whole section. It states that in any proceedings, unless the court sees good reason to the contrary, the documentation is accepted. Naturally, the court will be conscious of any good reason to the contrary and will act accordingly and will reject the documentation if it thinks it is not in proper form.</P>
    <P>In my view, Senator O'Quigley is completely overstating the case.  I see no merit in these amendments.  I have been glad to accept previous amendments where there was merit and they will be dealt with on Report Stage.  I see no merit whatever in these amendments, either on practical or legal grounds.  I would ask the Seanad to accept the two sections.</P>

      <P>To delete subsections (1) (b) (i) (II), and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() was remunerated at the rate of remuneration (inclusive of the money value of emoluments (being any apartments, rations or other perquisites in kind), if any) of which he would have been in receipt if he had been in that office during the specified period of receipt of the payment referred to in subsection (1) (a) (ii)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of these amendments arises in relation to the view I expressed on the Second Stage that I did not think it right to put a ceiling on the income <Col N="190" /> of a pensioner, because I think this is what these various subsections do.  I do not like the principle of putting this ceiling on earnings of pensioners in any case, and I like still less what I consider to be an undesirable difference which this section makes between one kind of pensioner and another.  For example, take the pensioner who is employed as a consultant by an industry.  There is no reference in this Bill to any question of abating his pension in relation to his earnings in that regard, but if he is employed by a Government Department then this section operates to limit the amount he can earn.  This difficulty is recognised in part in subsection (3) and was referred to by Senator Ryan on the second stage.  I would much rather abolish all these abatements, leaving the pensioner free to make use of his talents and his experience as well as he can in his retirement, but if this cannot be done then I think we could arrive at a little less complicated way of defining the manner in which this abatement principle might operate.</P>
    <P>The amendments I have put down suggest that if we are going to limit the income of a pensioner, then the limit should be what the pensioner would be receiving if he had remained in his employment in the post in which he was employed when he retired.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose, for example, that he was at the top of the scale in that post and was earning £2,000 a year when he retired two or three years ago.  Since then there has been a general increase in salaries, the usual 12 per cent has been added, so that the salary for that post would now be £2,240 a year.  Then let that be his ceiling; let his pension be abated so that the income derived from the earnings in his retirement post plus what he gets as the pension reaches that figure.  That is put forward as a rather clearer alternative to what is stated in the subsection, which refers to the amount which he can receive as being &ldquo;varied&rdquo; to take account of so much of such changes as may be specified by the Minister for Finance.  It is varied, it does not say whether up or down by taking into account &ldquo;so much&rdquo;&mdash;it does not say how much&mdash;<Col N="191" /> of such changes as the Minister for Finance may specify.  We are left entirely in the dark.  I would suppose that the Minister for Fanance would proceed along the lines that I outlined here and take into account the fact that prices had risen, the value of money had gone down, and the pensioner should be allowed to have so much more of his pension.  In other words, the abatement would be less.  It is a rather complicated way of saying that.  I propose a simpler way of defining the abatement,</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I cannot agree to accept these amendments. I realise that they are the result of very close and careful scrutiny of the Bill by the two Senators concerned and aLso a great deal of work by them in drafting them.  I want to explain to the Seanad what subsection (1) is.  It will only affect a very limited number of people, that is people who are re-employed in the Civil Service on grounds of hardship.  The argument is that the fact that they are re-employed solely because of hardship would indicate that their pensions should be abated.  I do not think that Senator Jessop is arguing that particular point, but rather is he arguing the phraseology which gives effect to the abatement.  There is a weakness in his own particular phraseology, and it is this: the idea of the wording of the section as it stands is that a person who is re-employed in the Civil Service in another post because of his personal circumstances has his pension abated.  This Bill provides that it is the retiring salary as revised by the Minister from time to time to bring it into line with existing salaries that will count for abatement purposes. The effect of the amendment would be to bring about a situation where a person who has retired would have some sort of notional continuation of his increments for the period while he was re-employed, and this would of course give us a very unreal figure. The only valid way to proceed as to deal with for pension purposes the <Col N="192" /> salary as it was at the time of the retirement plus any revisions upwards which are made from time to time by the Minister for Finance to keep in line with general salary trends.</P>

      <P>I was aware of this difficulty when I read over the amendment again and I can of course see the Minister's point.  I might mention that I do not regard the fact that it only applies to a limited number of people as being a valid argument against considering the situation.  I do not see any reference in the Bill to the fact that it only applies to people who were re-employed because of personal hardship.  The only exoeptions to this section are people who are re-employed because they have a particular training and experience which the Department needs and cannot get anywhere else.  There is nothing in it about it applying to people re-employed because they themselves are in difficult circumstances.  If the Minister will assure us that this variation referred to in the third last line of this subsection is to bring it into line for purposes of abatement with existing salaries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I might say on this point that I did not mean increments to come into this at all.  That is why I took as an example a retiring officer at the top of the scale. I did not mean that he would go on having increments after his retirement, or that the abatement would be fixed in regard to any such increment.</P>

      <P>That is really to cover a separate point.  Sometimes a post is suppressed and the duties are allocated to another post, usually at a higher salary.  It is necessary to determine how much of the higher salary is applicable to the higher post and how much of it is to be retained with the older duties.  That is really the purpose of the particular wording, to have the salary revised upwards, as it were in relation to the old post which has been suppressed.</P>

      <P>One cannot but admire the courage and the fortitude which must have sustained Senator Jessop when he embarked upon the laborious job of trying to amend this section.  I really think he almost achieved what he set out to do.  I am sure we would all have been much happier if it were set down in the Bill in black and white.  The Minister seems to be so disposed on the basis of the amendment before us.  A very little redrafting of Senator Jessop's amendment would provide exactly what the Minister has conceded is intended to be done and what Senator Jessop wants to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> It is a formidable job to try to make any sense of the section.  No doubt the Minister for Finance will be consoled by the fact, if there is any doubt about the section and what it means, that he has a lot of authority in paragraph (d) of subsection (1) which says that every doubt shall be decided by the Minister for Finance whose decision thereon shall be final and conclusive.  That is a great piece of power to invest in the Minister for Finance.  As I said on the last occasion, in the matter of superannuation, the Minister for Finance, in my experience, is very human and generous. I would be quite agreeable if the Minister would give a clear undertaking that what is being sought in the amendment will, in fact, be the practice.  I think the Minister is in a position to give that undertaking.</P>

      <P>Subsection (4) relates to the question of certain people to whom pensions might be payable during the first six months of this year. I should like to ask the Minister why there is any necessity for this subsection. We are all agreed that what the Bill does is a good thing and there would scarceiy be any circumstances in which it would be in somebody's interest to opt out of the benefits of subsection (1).  If that were the case, I fail to see why the onus should be put on this group of people who have, by positive action, opted not to ask for the benefits of this particular section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Strange as it may seem, there are circumstances in which it might be less favourable for him to <Col N="195" /> opt.  For instance if a pensioner is re-employed for only six months of the year and does not wish to work for the other six months, he would not be abated under the existing legislation because his pension for a year, plus his ra-employed pay for six months, would not exceed his annual salary on retirement from his pensionable position. Such a pensioner would be abated under the provisions of this Bill which relates abatement to the period of re-employment and not the annual salary.</P>

      <P>There are two points in relation to subsection (4).  I wonder will the persons likely to be affected and especially those who are likely to be professionally affected be notified on the condition specified by the Minister.  One finds very frequently that there are a lot of benefits contained in statutory instruments about which people know nothing.  I have had example of that in my own case recently and it is a pity that that should be the position.  The other point I wish to raise on this is in relation to subsection (2).  It is to ascertain from the Minister if he has any figures as to the number of persons who have retired from the Civil Service and who are re-employed, first of all because they had specialised knowledge and skill which makes their re-employment valuable, secondly, the people who are re-employed on hardship grounds, and thirdly, this is the feature I am most interested in, people who are re-employed, if there are any because it is impossible to recruit suitable personnel through normal channels.</P>

That is something I undertake will be borne in mind.  I am afraid I do not have figures readily available of the persons who are re-employed in the various categories mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>Before section 8 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() Section 15 of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, is hereby amended 6y the substitution of `three thousand ponnds' for `one thousand pounds'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the enactment mentioned in the Bill there is a repeat of section 15 of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938.  This Act enables a gratuity to be paid to a retiring Attorney General who has had three years service.  The gratuity is specified at half of the salary attached to the office at the date of such cessation. The purpose of this is obviously to enable a retiring Attorney General to resume his practice, which we are all agreed would take some time to get going again.  That was in 1938 and since then there has been an increase in the private practice done by the Attorney General.  In fact, I doubt if, in 1938, there was any private practice done by the then Attorney General. The Act specified that the gratuity must be paid at half a year's salary unless the person concerned, under section 4, is appointed to any whole-time office, the remuneration of which exceeds £1,000 per annum.  The money was provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, if the Attorney General is promoted to the High Court or to the Supreme Court, then quite obviously there is no suggestion that <Col N="197" /> he is to resume his practice.  In fact, he has received the normal promotion that is accorded to an Attorney General who has discharged his duty satisfactorily&mdash;he has been promoted to the High Court or to the Supreme Court.  The present Bill very innocuously repeals these two provisions &mdash;subsection (4) and subsection (5) of section 15 of the 1938 Act and that is out of line with the spirit of this Bill. It is at a time when we are faced with a growing emeroency, where we have a 12 per cent increase, where we have status increases and super-status increases and this goes into the category of the super-super-status increase which is one the Government should not countenance at this juncture.</P>
    <P>What should be done is simply to bring the figure of £1,000 per annum, the ceiling laid down in 1938, to a realistic figure.  I suggest that the realistic figure be placed somewhere around £3,000, or more, if that is wished but certainly the spirit of the 1938 Act is obvious.  All will agree to the necessity for this to enable an Attorney General to resume his practice where he has to do that with a consequent loss, but no one agrees that a hand-out of half year's salary should be given to an Attorney General who receives promotion to the Supreme Court or to the High Court at a salary far in excess of that which he enjoys as Attorney General.  Consequently, I move that the figure of £3,000, or any figure acceptable to the Minister and the Government, be substituted for the £1,000 in the 1938 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from any other consideration, the amendment is defective on technical grounds because the Senator leaves untouched section 8 which repeals the provisions which he wishes to amend.  Apart from that, I can see no validity whatever in the Senator's argument.  Indeed, I wonder why the Senator, who in regard to this Bill, has been in favour of the very generous approach to abatement that is getting away from the old Victorian ideas, in this one particular instance, thinks this one particular person should be excluded.  The purpose of this amendment is to deprive the <Col N="198" /> Attorney General of this easement or abolition of abatement, a provision which is in complete harmony with the whole purpose and spirit of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed more or less to abolish abatement in cases of persons who, though they may be re-employed in the public service, are not employed in the same service.  I think I made that very clear on Second Reading. It is to do away with abatement except in the case of persons who are re-employed in the public service and in the same service.  Now the position still is if the Attorney General were to be reappointed to the Government or to the position of Attorney General, which is the same service, then the abatement would apply, but if he is appointed to any other appointment in the public service, there is to be no abatement.  The situation here simply is that the Attorney General who spent more than three years in office has earned this gratuity just the same as any other public official has earned his pension and is being treated in exactly the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree at all with the Minister that this is abatement in the sense we have been talking about, that is, abatement of pension earned.  There was no suggestion at any time that the provision in the 1938 Act referred to pension earned by the Attorney General.  In fact, I refer the Minister to the Dáil and Seanad debates when the 1938 Act was going through.  He will find there that the reasons given were simple and commonsense reasons&mdash;to enable the Attorney General to get his office going again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have departed considerably from those times and it is now recognised that the Attorney General can even appear for the defence and can operate a fully-fledged office.  There is no link between the abatement in this Bill and what the Minister tries to make out is abatement in the case of the Attorney General.  I suggest to the Minister that he should tell this to the trade unions next week when he is speaking to them and trying to bring in price control, and at the same time <Col N="199" /> tell them he is slipping an innocuous provision into the Bill to enable, as it is called in England, a golden handshake to be given to a retiring Attorney General at a time when he is kicked upstairs into the High Court or Supreme Court at £5,000 or £6,000 a year.  I do not think that when all are urged to tighten their belt and when price control is on the horizon, this is the time for handouts on the part of the Government.  If the Attorney General is entitled to this would he not be much more entitled to a gratuity to adjust himself back to being a Minister?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ministerial pension, as the Minister knows, is a small one.  For a Minister who serves three years, it is in the order of £300 a year at present.  The Minister says the amendment is technically unreasonable. I have not been in this House for eight years wiihout knowing the procedure here.  First of all, if an amendment is accepted on Committee Stage, it means that the Government indicate agreement with it and will come back on Report Stage with a properly drafted agreement.  We are not draftsmen on Committee Stage. Our intention is to debate the amendments and convince the Government of their validity and have the Government bring them back on Report Stage.  The Government always claim it derogatory to withdraw an amendment and they give a substitute which very often is the same on Report Stage.  It is not beyond the skill of parliamentary draftsmen to recognise that if they did bring in a Bill covering my suggestion, they obviously would have to delete from this schedule the provisions of subsection (4) and (5) in section 15 of the 1938 Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act.  That is just simple common sense. I appeal to the Minister and the Government to show some sense of reality and not hand out public money without any concern whatsoever at a <Col N="200" /> time when everybody else is being urged to protect our economy.  This is, I think, the worst incentive that could be given to people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the amendment was moved, I have been endeavouring to make an objective approach to what is proposed here.  In so far as Senator Quinlan has developed his argument in favour of the amendment, I find myself tending more and more to support the amendment.  The two points which impressed me most are, firstly, that I think the Minister could not have chosen a mere inopportune time to bring this proposal before the House, a time when everybody else in the country&mdash;and I suppose this would include the Attorney General&mdash;is being urged to exercise restraint, patience and so on.  We are, above all else, to avoid any further demands or pressures that would injure our economy. I think a very grave responsibility rests on the Government here to give practical evidence or a demonstration in clear terms of their sincerity in these exhortations.</P>
      <P>I shall probably be one of those who will have to meet the Minister tomorrow to be informed of the serious implications of the situation which the country is facing.  I, in turn, will have to go back fmm that meeting and impress on other people that we should restrain ourselves at the presenr time. I am in agreement with Senator Quinlan that we will find it very difficult so to impress people when measures of this kind are being pushed through this House.</P>
      <P>The second point which impressed me was the figure of £1,000 in the 1938 Act, which it is now proposed to alter. This is in fact a reasonable and sensible proposal.  The Act passed in 1938 which specified a figure of £1,000 is obviously completely out-of-date when looked at in the terms of plain pounds, shiliings and pence.  If £1,000 were considered reasonable in 1938, £3,000 could not be considered unreasonable in 1965.  I think the Minister should take these two simple facts into account and have a further look at the amendment.  I certainly am prepared to support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would really like to see the Opposition make up their minds about this particular discussion. I do not know whether Senator Crowley was present for the Second Reading, but the whole argument then put forward was that this easement was a good thing.  We were getting away from outmoded and Victorian ideas and, generally speaking, the principle in the Bill in so far as easement was concerned, was welcome. All the argument from that side of the House was that we were being fair in that.</P>
      <P>Now we have this sudden turn around where we have these principles in the Bill applied to this one particular office, a sudden attack is being made on it and people are now all against abatement in this particular case.  Senator Quinlan's argument will not stand up.  This is a gratuity which is earned by a public servant; it is of exactly the same nature as any other gratuity on retirement earned by other public servants.  Public servants, when they retire from public service, very often today get a combination of gratuity and pension.  That is the most common form of recompense when they retire.  Here we have an office which gets only a gratuity; namely, where a person is not re-employed in the same service&mdash;in the public service &mdash;there is to be no abatement and that is all that is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is completely confused in this because the gratuity is not earned in the sense that a pension is earned.  It is solely for the purpose of enabling the individual concerned to get his office going again.</P>

It was obvious to anybody what the purpose of the gratuity was and that repeal at this stage is totally out of line.  You cannot say any Attorney General suffers auy loss when he receives the normal promotion that is within the giving of the Government.  I do not think for one moment that the Minister can really see the argument when he says that this case is parallel with the case of an abatement of a normal pension.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see the Agricultural Credit Corporation being given this increase in capital but I would ask that as far as possible the farming community be given an opportunity of providing some of this capital, as was advocated in the Gilmore Report of 1959.  Every effort should be made to encourage the farmers to take part of the share capital of the Corporation.  In parts of the country it has not enjoyed a great reputation over the years, but there has been a change for the better in the relationship between the farmers in general and the Corporation, and a genuine all-out effort should now be made to encourage the farmers to take an added interest in its affairs by taking up some of its share capital.</P>

These complaints are pretty numerous. We are gratified at the proposed expansion of the Corporation and my remarks are not critical at all of any expansion on that line.

It is <Col N="205" /> the intention of the directors to provide adequate staff to ensure that applications are dealt with as expeditiously as possible.  No doubt some of this money will be used for administrative purposes, but on the whole the situation would be that the capital provided will be lent to applicants and the administration of the Corporation will be paid off out of the interest earned.  That would be the general idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>This section increases the amount available to the Corporation for its purposes to £20 million.  I hope that some of this money will be directed towards some of the poorer sections of the farming community.  We are told that 75 per cent of all the applications received by the Board are unsuccessful.  I believe that the Seanad now has an opportunity of impressing on the Minister and on the Agricultural Credit Corporation that persons who need help in every practical way are those unfortunate sections of our farming community.  Those people are the hardest hit, especially since the commercial banks have considerably slowed up their short-term lending transactions.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that £1 million should be earmarked for providing loans to this poorer section of the community who have found difficulty in getting loans in the past.  If one of every four of the farmers who apply for a loan are branded as insolvent, surely the time has come when the State, through this Bill, should take the opportunity of giving them some direct financial assistance.  It would not be unique.  Many industries and organisations have been enjoying grants-in-aid over the years.  If we are to continue facing world markets, we must bear in mind that the farmers in the Six, who are our competitors, enjoy interest rates as low as 1½ or two per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> I would ask the Minister to consider seriously doing something on these lines by putting aside at least £1 million for the poorer and more unsuccessful of our farmers.  The farming community have always had a reputation for being honest and making great endeavours to pay their way.  If they get an opportunity of borrowing for the improvement of their holdings it certainly would pay dividends.  The Gilmore Report of 1959 and the National Farm Survey of 1956-58 set off this new trend and brought the entire position of the agricultural community to the fore.  It is only since those reports came out that the Agricultural Credit Corporation really made advances.  I would advocate that they should take a second look at the Gilmore survey of 1959 and implement more of its recommendations.  I feel that is necessary, and I ask the Minister seriously to consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there might be some little confusion in the Senator's mind between the making available of credit to farmers and the making of grants to farmers.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation, of course, are solely concerned with making credit available, and in making that credit available they take all the circumstances of the man into account. There is no suggestion that loans should not be given to small farmers who need them, badly.  In fact, there is a special scheme whereby the type of farmer the Senator has in mind may borrow up to £500 without any security&mdash;the unsecured loaa scheme.  This scheme is particularly directed towards the type of farmer about whom the Senator has been speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we could contemplate giving to the Corporation the sort of directive the Senator has in mind.  We have to leave it to them to judge the applications coming before them on their merits, and to decide upon them.  Very often, of course, it is not a good thing to give a man too much credit.  On the other hand, it I frequently happens that a man does not look for enough credit, and by the very fact of borrowing too little he can store up trouble for himself. <Col N="207" /> Every case is different, and they all have to be gone into carefully and considered on their merits, having regard to the size of the holding, the pattern of farming, the character of the individual, and his willingness to accept the advice of the advisory services. All those factors are taken into account.</P>
    <P>Certainly, there is no suggestion that any section of the farmers are excluded from the ambit of the operations of the Corporation.  As I said, there is one scheme in particular which is aimed at the smaller and the poorer type farmer who would find it difficult to put up the normal sort of collateral which would be required.  In his case the £500 unsecured loan scheme is available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have misunderstood what I said.  I did not advocate grants as such.  What I have in mind is that the Minister might direct that at least £1 million of the money being made available to the Corporation now should be directed or channelled towards the poorer farmers who are branded as insolvent by the Corporation.  I should like to see these people whom the Corporation say are insolvent getting money at reduced interest rates.  After all, the farmers of Denmark and Holland, our main international competitors, enjoy interest rates of 1½ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any Senator would agree with a suggestion that we should give loans to insolvent farmers.  Let me make another point. I doubt very much if anything like the bulk of the persons rejected are necessarily smaller and poorer farmers.  I know from my own experience that a considerable number of rejections are in the case of badly run larger farms. I do not think anyone would contemplate lending money to someone who is insolvent.  We would all like to see the Agricultural Credit Corporation being helpful in the case of small farmers who with their small resources are trying to get ahead, and who find great difficulty in breaking <Col N="208" /> out of the financial straitjacket in which they find themselves.  That is certainly the type of deserving case which, I am sure, the Corporation treat sympathetically.  I do not think we could go much further than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">

      <P>There is a whale of a difference between an insolvent farmer and a farmer the Corporation say is insolvent.  I know farmers with recent valuations of £20,000 and £30,000 who were not considered solvent by the Corporation because they were in debt up to £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator knows that people who come to him and to me do not always tell the full story. When you get the full story from the Corporation you know what the situation is.  I myself had a case recently where I was approached by a farmer who had been rejected, and when I took the case up with the directors of the Corporation they indicated to me that the rejection was entirely in the interests of the farmer.  He was a perfectly good progressive young farmer, anxious to get ahead, but if he had been given the amount he was looking for he would have been doing nothing but storing up trouble for himself.  I mention that merely to indicate that applications to the Corporation have to be rejected for a variety of different reasons.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any validity in the argument that poor farmers on small holdings are rejected simply because of the fact that they are poor and on small holdings.  They get their opportunity just the same as anyone else.</P>

      <P>Contrary to that I have an instance of a very laudable effort which is new to this country, with international support, and with the hiehest technical experience and knowledge available, not only in this hemisphere, but in both hemispheres.  This project met with the approval of the Minister's Department and was allocated a substantial State grant to get established.  It was required on the part of a large number of farmers contracting to go into this project that they would provide a certain amount of capital in order to make their contribution to the scheme. They had to go outside this country to try to obtain the necessary credit, and when the credit squeeze came about in Britain they found themselves devoid of the credit which they had thought was forthcoming.  That industry is at the moment in suspension, shall I say.  If the Department of Agriculture endorsed this as a laudable scheme, worthy of financial support and every encouragement, is it not regrettable that the Aericultural Credit Corporation could not consider providing the money in <i>globo</i> for all those participating and so make it possible for those involved to proceed with the establishment of that industry, the entire produce of which is for export? No doubt the full particulars of this are well known to the Minister.  Is it not a pity that recourse cannot be had by all those participating to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for the necessary credit so that that particular industry can get off the ground?</P>

They may have sufficient money just to buy machinery and stock their land, but they cannot provide themselves with the land.  I should like the Minister to state whether the applicants for loans to buy farms would receive very sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>I should like to support what Senator McDonald said on the section.  He made a plea that out of the extra £20 million available now an effort should be made to loosen up the loan requirements by the Agricultural Credit Corporation because the number of applications turned down of one in four is too high.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation has to operate on a strictly business basis.  Therefore, it cannot afford to take chances.  I would suggest that the figure of one in four could be cut to one in eight.  If the Minister was prepared to make a small grant available to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, this might help in loosening up the credit requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The power to increase the capital available from the Agricultural <Col N="211" /> Credit Corporation is very velcome at this stage.  It is well known that there is a credit squeeze at the moment and that commercial banks are reducing overdrafts.  This is felt particularly among the farming community. The Agricultural Credit Corporation has proved to be a very useful body in relation to agricultural matters. It is obvious, with this credit squeeze coming into effect each day, that the farmers will be drifting towards the Agricultural Credit Corporation more and more.  It was only the other day we saw a statement from the banks in which they made it clear they had no intention of relenting and that they are going to pursue the present policy having regard to present conditions.  If they pursue the policy of credit restriction and credit squeeze it will be necessary for a body, such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation, to make finance available for prodnction purposes in relation to agriculture.</P>
      <P>I have found amongst farmers getting capital from the Agricultural Credit Corporation that the greater portion of it is in respect of machinery and modern equipment.  Unfortunately, agricultural machinery depreciates very rapidly.  The result is there is a lot of capital tied up in agricultural machinery which is only useful maybe for a limited number of weeks in the year, according to the type of crops this machinery is used to harvest or cultivate.  I would like, if possible, that something would be done regarding the type of project for which the credit will be made available by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the policy of the Agricultural Credit Corporation is directed towards increasing the stock on the land, particularly livestock, towards greater production of crops or towards a better marketing scheme, I feel the money would be well invested. According as the commercial banks find it necessary to increase the credit squeeze the Agricultural Credit Corporation should expand its investments in agriculture, having regard to the fact that it is our economic mainstay and that credit restrictions should not bring about a reduction in our <Col N="212" /> output.  There has been a reduction in agricultural output and the trend is still in that direction.  If the facilities in this Bill are operated in a practical and generous manner agricultural production will again be expanded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remonstrate with Senator Rooney when he suggests that there is a decline in agricultural output.  I do not think there is anything of the sort.  There has been, for some years, a steady expansion in gross agricultural output.  I agree with him about the situation in regard to machinery.  Today machinery is of such a varied nature, is used for such a variety of jobs and is so costly that inevitably there must be some unnecessary docking up of capital by farmers in machinery.</P>
      <P>The answer to this problem is co-operatives. If we could possibly have machinery co-operatives they would be very beneficial all round.  I know of one machinery co-operative which is in Ballinasloe and which has been quite successful.  I am sure members of that co-operative would be anxious to help other groups which would think of setting themselves up as machinery co-operatives.  They could give them the benefits of their experience and so on.  I also feel sure that the Agricultural Credit Corporation would sympathetically consider applications from machinery co-operatives if such were put to them by responsible or trustworthy groups.</P>

      <P>I understand it was intimated by the Agricultural Credit Corporation that they were not prepared to consider the group application of those involved, but were prepared to accept individual applications within the group.  That would not warrant the establishment of the company or the industry, unless at the outset there was a clear indication that all those involved would secure the necessary credit.  Accordingly, the Agricultural Credit Corporation had to be by-passed and then we ran into trouble on the other side of the Channel.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to a group of people who find themselves in great difficulty.  They are people who have got allotments of land from the Land Commission in order to bring their holdings up to economic units.  They may have bean working on seven or eight acres and may have been very industrious; but, when they got a large allotment, they had to look for money.  They had two alternatives, either let the farm or get money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  If they let the land, it would be taken from them altogether. When they looked for money, it is an extraordinary thing that these people were refused time and time again in recent months by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I believe that, in relation to the allotment of land by the Land Commission, the Land Commissioners should examine the applicants before giving them land, and if they are not worthy, then I do not think they should get the extra land. The Land Commission know those people have no bank account.  One of the first questions you are asked when you apply for a loan is where you have your bank account.  If you had a bank account, you might not be looking for a loan.</P>

We have heard Senator McDonald saying that if a man is £5,000 down, he will not be given credit by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  If you are 5/-down now, they will not look at you. I hold that people who get land from the Land Commission should be considered creditworthy and that the Agricultural Credit Corporation should not afterwards refuse them a loan.  I consider it an insult to be refused a loan by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 4 to 7, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete paragraphs (b) and (c).</P>
      <P>This is another of these sections which is a further example of the slow process of erosion of the ordinary requirements of the courts.  Again you find the State authority is the cause of this erosion of the ordinary procedures. Under the 1947 Agricultural Credit Act, there was provision that if somebody was not paying his loan, all the evidence reguired was a certificate by the Corporation to the effect that so much was outstanding, and that was <i>prima facie</i> evidence for the court, which, to a certain extent, was fair enough.  Now, it is proposed to extend that provision of a mere certificate by the Corporation to the case of hire purchase transactions.  Everybody knows that hire purchase transactions are an entirely different kettle of fish from a plain straightforward account as to how much is outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that agricultural machinery has not reached the stage of perfection and that when you buy a piece of machinery, it turns out to be unsatisfactory.  Many hire purchase transactions in this country fall through and find their way into the court, through the solicitor's office as a preliminary, simply because the machinery supplied on hire purchase is defective.  That applies to motor cars, washing machines and other goods.  When a farmer has to be sued <Col N="215" /> on a hire purchase agreement, it is quite wrong to say: &ldquo;Here is a certificate from the Agricultural Credit Corporation; that is the amount that is due.&rdquo;  The farmer may have to come back and say: &ldquo;That may be so but the machinery I got is quite worthless.&rdquo; I do not see in these circumstances why we are to have this certification by a semi-State body, which is to be <i>prima facie</i> evidence for the court.</P>
    <P>Anybody who is familiar with the increasing number of hire purchase transactions before the courts knows that in the vast majority of cases, apart from the ordinary trifling transactions in the district courts relating to sewing machines, television sets and so on, which never amount to more than £30 or £40, the great preponderance of people pay their hire purchase instalments as they become due.  It is in the cases where there is a defect and where the farmer has a good and well-founded grievance against the hire purchase company that the instalments stop.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not at all like the idea that this almost conclusive procedure against the farmer is to be adopted in the case of hire purchase transactions.  I think they are a particularly complex kind of legal proceeding and this calls for the closest possible examination.  I do not see, apart from anything else that this will be of great value to the Agricultural Credit Corporation because ultimately there are certain things, even for the Agricultural Credit Corporation, that have to be proved by affidavit.  I do not know why this procedure is being extended to this very controversial and complex transaction that appears in the courts.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree that it is a simple matter in relation to the amount owing under an ordinary loan.  You get a loan for £3,000 or £1,700 and it is quite an easy matter for an accountant to certify £x outstanding.  It is entirely different when you have all the controversy that always arises on hire purchase agreements.  I propose that the existing law be allowed to stand and that this short-circuiting by way <Col N="216" /> of certification ought not be allowed in the case of these transactions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Senator O'Quigley on this amendment. It happens, and is the cause of great concern in many instances, that people avail of hire purchase facilities through the Corporation for the purpose of getting machinery, where the machinery was damaged before delivery or subsequently went wrong, even during the period of guarantee. The farmer was obliged to keep up the payments and often found difficulty in having the machine repaired to his satisfaction.  Possibly this is because the distributor or merchant who has guaranteed the machine is wrong but whether or not this as so, it is something that should be ironed out.  The farmers are getting quite a raw deal and I strongly support Senator O'Quigley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Senator McDonald is completely misinformed. There is no single instance on record in the Agricultural Credit Corporation of the type of application to which he has referred, not a single one.  But let me deal with the main argument put forward by Senator O'Quigley.  I think he is worried unnecessarily.  As he knows himself, this certificate in hire purchase cases will only be <i>prima facie</i> evidence; in other words, it would not be sufficient if there was any defence or appearance entered and the Agricultural Credit Corporation representative would have to go through the normal legal procedures.  We already have the principle there and the Senator does agree that, in the case of moneys advanced by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, this comparatively simple mechanism should be available to them.  Their certificates should be <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  I want to emphasise that it is only <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation are now extending their activities and it is very laudable on their part.  The type of hire purchase facility which the Agricultural Credit Corporation are offering is completely different from the ordinary hire purchase facilities offered by a normal <Col N="217" /> commercial concern.  They are very favourable as to interest rates.  I mention that just to indicate that I think it is very much in the interests of our farmers that these hire purchase facilities should be made available to them on an extended scale.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation feel, when they have this facility in regard to normal lending transactions, that it should be extended now to hire purchase transactions as well.  I really cannat see why there should be any objection to it. As I have said, it is only evidence of the amount owed, only <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the amount owed, and does not take away in any way from the rights of a defendant in a hire purchase transaction.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a further point, that is, that if this facility were not available to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, they would have to proceed in the normal way by means of affidavit and so on.  As we all know, in the vast majority of cases, the Agricultural Credit Corporation get judgment for the amount they are seeking. This would simply mean that extra costs would be piled on the defendant.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that the certificate is only <i>prima facie</i> evidence and, therefore, does not matter very much.  I do not know whether or not the draftsman of this section knows what goes on when you want to recover a debt but you must make an affidavit of debt in default of appearance so, when you are going that distance, I cannot see what advantage there is in merely prescribing certificates as to the amount due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not even see the advantage there but I do see some justification as to a clear note of the amount outstanding being issued.  There might be X pounds outstanding and one could take a chance and say: &ldquo;All right, give a certificate to that effect&rdquo;.  At some stage there must be <Col N="218" /> somebody in the Agricultural Credit Corporation who makes the affidavit exhibiting the hire purchase agreement. That is the absolute <i>sine qua non</i>; they must require that all the hire purchase agreements have been complied with.  For the life of me, I cannot see where the certificate comes in.</P>
      <P>What I do strenuously object to and what I do hope to resist is the semi-State bodies, State authorities, constantly diminishing the value of the courts and constantly endangering the ordinary rights of the citizens.  I do not see any reason why the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be in any different position from the ordinary mercantile companies.  I do not see how the mere issue of a certificate will save them the hearing.  I think it would be just as easy for the amount of the debt to be proved on affidavit. I the Corporation want it the other way, I do not think it would be worth anything to them but I regret this constant erosion.</P>

      <P>On the section itself I should like to say something more important.  In regard to agricultural machinery one reads regrettably, from time to time of the unnecessary types of accidents which occur.  I remember seeing a film on BBC television in relation to the kind of accidents that occur in the use of tractors and machinery of that kind on farms.  I do not know of any kind of campaign for safety&mdash;not on ihe roads&mdash;but in the fields in the use of this heavier type of machinery of which too many people have too little experience.  In so far as the Agricultural Credit Corporation is concerned, I think the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government, might request them, when issuing these hire purchase schemes, to enclose some kind of literature calling attention to the more serious forms of danger involved in the use of this heavier type of farm machinery.  It appears to me that our country cousins and brothers think that because a <Col N="219" /> tractor can go up the side of a fence that is the correct thing to do.  How often has a tractor capsized pinning somebody underneath.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation could help towards the avoidance of that type of accident if, when they send a copy of the hire purchase agreement to the person hiring the machinery, they also enclosed some form of literature which would call attention to the more obvious type of accident that can occur in the use of farm machinery.</P>

      <P>This is a very important subject&mdash;safety on the farm. The Department&mdash;and when I speak of the Department I mean the appropriate Department which is not the Department for which I am responsible&mdash;hope to do more about it. It is, of course, mainly a matter for the Minister for Local Government.  I have no doubt at all that the Agricultural Credit Corporation, in common with all other bodies involved in this sphere, would be happy to co-operate with the Minister for Local Government in any campaign he might introduce in this direction.  I certainly will suggest to the directors of the Agricultural Credit Corporation that they might co-operate with any other agency involved in this matter and if they could do something off their own bat they might do it.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage, I said that I did not think it was perhaps appropriate on this Bill to make a frontal attack on the principle enshrined in this section, which was one of general application.  I do not understand why the mere nomination of somebody as a candidate for election to one ar other House of the Oireachtas should be considered such a grievous offence that it merits instant dismissal from his position as a director of the Corporation.  I can see same reasons, though I am not entirely convinced by them, for saying that if he were elected, he should not be continued as a member.</P>
      <P>One can envisage cases where a director of the Corporation might at the same time be the president of some institution which is a nominating body far Seanad Éireann, an institution which, in accordance with practice, in some instances might wish to nominate him for election to the Seanad without any expectation of has being elected or participating in party politics which we have heard described earlier today.  In these circumstances, the mere allowing of his name to go forward for nomination far probable non-election to a semi-vocational chamber would result in his immediate dismissal as a director of the Corporation.  It seems to me that this is an absurd position and I am wondering whether the Minister would not agree on the Report Stage to amend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, in subsection 2 (b), we have provision that any officer or servant in the employment of the Corporation who becomes a member of either House shall not be competent or entitled to receive any salary or wages in respect of the period for which he is a member.  This is a development of the principle which originally arose in connection with the administrative civil servants, a small body of people concerned with Government policy, who, it was felt, should not be actively engaged in politics.  It was then extended as the Civil Service extended into new areas.  Now it has been extended to State bodies and I suppose it covers something like <Col N="221" /> 100,000 people.  I think it needs to be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see it worded in a quite different way, that where an officer of the Corporation, or of any other such body, or of a private company, in private employment, is elected to one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, there would be imposed on the body concerned an obligation to pay the difference between his former salary and his remuneration as a member of the House of the Oireachtas.  We should try to encourage people to enter the Houses of the Oireachtas and not put obstacles in their way, so that the field from which they are recruited is extended, not contracted.  Now we exclude virtually everybody in employment in the country, in effect, representing about half the total population.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if he will consider, certainly under subsection (1), this business of a person having to disappear from the board as soon as he is nominated, and if he will further consider, even if he wants to leave it here, this whole question of prescribing that no State body like this may remunerate in any way somebody who is seconded to the Dáil, which means, in effect, that any senior employee of a State body in receipt of a salary of more than £1,000 or £1,500 a year is automatically put into the position that he cannot hope to stand for election to either House because of the loss of income involved.  The Minister might consider taking another look at this at least in further general consideration.</P>

Whatever about the validity of the principle in general, in this particular piece of legislation, we are only applying to this body provisions which are already in operation in regard to most other State concerns.

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot be fobbed off any longer by suggestions that the Minister is going to report the fact to his colleagues.  We heard all that before and all we got was the next Bill drawn much tighter and this provision applied to categories that are becoming wider in scope every day.  I think that at the start of a new session of Seanad Éireann, it is time for us to take a long, hard look at this section and see what it is doing to deprive Seanad Éireann of the opportunity of being thoroughly representative of all <Col N="223" /> sections of Irish life and Irish endeavour. So much of our Irish life is tied up with Government boards, corporations and so on and we are denied having the experience and the wisdom of people on those bodies placed at the disposal of the nation through service in Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>Even to contemplate being nominated entails immediate dismissal.  That is an affront to Seanad Éireann.  Is it any wonder that we find continual disparagement of Seanad Éireann and its efforts and press complaint even on the last day of the lowest pickings the Seanad got in a day when Seanad Éireann disposed in very workmanlike fashion of six Bills and had most constructive and interesting debates?  What can we expect from any person in any position of authority who is automatically excluded from even being a candidate for Seanad Éireann?  What happens then?  The person knows he is excluded and gives way to cynicism and disparagement of the institution concerned and so the vicious circle goes on.  The provisions are drawn still tighter.</P>
      <P>You cannot even be nominated, and it is suggested here that if a person who as an officer is nominated, he shall not be paid or be entitled to receive anything from the Corporation by way of salary or wages.  Does anybody suggest that the work involved in Seanad Éireann is a wholetime occupation?  It could be properly carried on by many who are excluded by these provisions.</P>
      <P>Again we have the effect of subsection (4) of section 10 under which a person who is entitled to a seat in the Seanad is disqualified from being or becoming a director or an officer or servant of the Corporation.  In other words, even if he does become seconded as an officer, he is, under this section, denied an opportunity of promotion within the Corporation while he stands seconded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we raised this issue the last day a unanimous voice came from all sides of the House, and we had Senator Browne making a very fine speech from the Government benches, and Senator <Col N="224" /> Garret FitzGerald on these benches who is new to the House, and when I repeated something I have been fighting&mdash;but fighting to no avail&mdash;for eight years, when we had that unanimous chorus of opinion, I thought the Minister would have come some distance to meet that point of view, and that we would have had a Government amendment to this section.  I purposely refrained from putting down an amendment because I hoped the Government would show some sign of progressive thinking in this regard.  Alas, that has not come and, consequently, there is nothing we can do but face the issue on Report Stage and put down an amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish to assure Senator Quinlan that there was not a unanimous voice here the other night. I personally agree with the section.  I think it is a very important section. I feel that if it were deleted, abuses could arise in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the House to consider the position of a Seanad candidate who is a member of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  He calls to a county councillor who knows of his membership of the Corporation, and who tells him he is an applicant for a loan from <Col N="225" /> the Corporation.  If he is dishonest he can assure the voter that he will see do it that the loan will be granted, or he need not be dishonest.  All he has to do is give him a knowing look, shake hands with him, and be on his way.  He can rest assured that he will get the vote of that councillor.  He can also rest assured that he will be expected to take the necessary steps to have that loan granted after the Seanad election.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the position of the Dáil Deputy who is a member of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  An applicant for a loan in his constituency would naturally visit that Deputy, and would naturally expect that Deputy to do everything in his power to see that the loan is granted. Any applicant who fails to get his loan will in the future blame that Deputy and remember it on polling day. Therefore, I feel it is very important that when a member of this Corporation, at any rate, becomes a candidate for either the Dáil or the Seanad, in order to prevent abuses in the future. he should cease to be a member of the Corporation.  I, for one, agree entirely with this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case.  Senator McGlinchey made an interesting case which seemed to be a case against the method of election to the Seanad rather than anything else. My second point is that I certainly did not suggest that anyone should simultaneously be an official of that body and a member of the Seanad.  The <Col N="226" /> point I raised was that he should be paid the difference between his former salary and his remuneration in the Seanad.  I can see that if he were to continue as an officer of that body after his election to the Seanad that could give rise, perhaps, to abuses.</P>
      <P>On the Minister's point about the motion I was going to ask him if the Government would give time for such a motion, and would we have an opportunity for a general discussion, because if that is the case, it would be a step forward.</P>

It is vital that we face this issue now. Let us forget Senator McGlinchey's electioneering address and face the issue.</P>

I merely put forward the view that this is a much broader issue than a simple regulation of the affairs of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and it seemed to me that the sort of debate the Senator has in mind could more adequately take place on a general motion.  I have no authority in this matter.  I think it is a matter for the Seanad itself to decide whether time would be allocated for such a motion.</P>
