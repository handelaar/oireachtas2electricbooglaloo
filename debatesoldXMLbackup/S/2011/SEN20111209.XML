      <P>I have received notice from Senator David Cullinane that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to discuss his employment action plan for the south east which he launched on 5 December; the proposals contained in it; the actions he and his Department intend to take in furtherance of this plan, and the resources he intends to dedicate to supporting it.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, I mentioned the European Union is going through the most significant negotiations it has faced in the midst of a crisis of which all our citizens are acutely aware.  The word from Europe is that the new arrangements being made will require us to have a new treaty and to amend our Constitution.  It is clear from what has been agreed initially that the European Union will seek each member state to put in its constitution set rules and parameters that would not be breached with regard to budget deficits.  It is giving <Col N="272" />very clear fiscal oversight directly to the European Union and the European Commission.  The negotiations are ongoing; those involved rose at 6 a.m. and will return to them.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom&rsquo;s decision not to proceed with the agreed treaty changes will have serious ramifications.  Yesterday, I mentioned the exemption it was seeking for the City of London and the damage this would do to our financial services sector.  Prime Minister Cameron has seen fit to throw his toys out of the pram on this one.  He did not get the exemption he required for the City of London and this is good, but having said this, the United Kingdom being outside the first tier of European nations will have further knock-on effects.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Leader mentioned he was doing his best to arrange a debate on this next week and I appreciate this.  It would probably be the most important work we do next week.  I understand why the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste hoped a referendum would not be required but it is clear that there will be a new treaty and that Europe is breaking new legal and constitutional ground.  It needs to be teased out and this Chamber is somewhere that can do it effectively given the breadth of knowledge and experience that is here.  I understand that Ministers are busy and it would be better if the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, was available next week but I will not make the debate conditional on her being available.  The House needs to have a very serious debate on Europe and on what these changes will mean.  It will become clearer over the weekend.  If the Leader is trying to arrange a debate and cannot get the Minister of State to come to the House, let us do it anyway.  This side of the House will not disagree on that.</P>
      <P>The Minister of Justice and Law Reform will come to the House today to deal with legislation.  I call for a separate debate next week or early in the new year on Garda resources, crime, Garda stations and coverage throughout the country.  It is not appropriate for me to raise issues with regard to Garda stations and Garda resources during today&rsquo;s debates as these matters are outside the scope of the Bills before the House.  We need to arrange a separate debate.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We note that yesterday AIB stated it will not pass on the ECB interest rate reduction and in fairness it has the lowest variable rate.  However, Bank of Ireland stated it would pass on 0.15% of the cut.  It did not pass on the last 0.25%.  I am pleased that the T&aacute;naiste was very direct yesterday.  He needs to get the bankers back in again.  I put it to the Leader that this needs legislation.  There will be another rate cut early in the new year and this situation will arise again and again.  What is the Government&rsquo;s intention to ensure the 0.25% rate reduction is passed on to mortgage holders?  Has any progress been made on this issue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik">
      <NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all very conscious of the ongoing negotiations at European level.  As Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien stated, they are very important for us, the EU and the international economic situation.  Whatever agreement is reached will have serious implications for our prospects of economic recovery.</P>
      <P>I also agree with Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s sentiments about Prime Minister Cameron.  It is most unfortunate to see him behave in such an obstructive manner at European level.  It is too soon to state what will be the outcome of today.  I agree we should try to have a debate if it all possible next week when it is hoped matters will be clearer.  I hope that at that stage we will know what will be the role of the European Central Bank.  The role of the ECB and whether it will become a lender of last resort is a critical issue in the negotiations.  It is the key issue to be discussed.</P>
      <P>I echo calls made yesterday for a debate on the future of the Seanad, although I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe that it may be more appropriate to hold it outside of Seanad formal business.  No doubt it will be an ongoing debate throughout the country in the new year.  Reference was made on the Order of Business yesterday to a debate on Wednesday night in Trinity College <Col N="273" />in which I was a participant and in which the former Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, and Deputy Charlie Flanagan were the other speakers.  I found myself in the odd position of being in the middle between the radical abolitionist position of Deputy Flanagan and the radical retentionist position of the former Minister, Mr. McDowell.  I argued for fundamental reform of the Seanad and it is probably something on which we could all agree.</P>
      <P>There was cross-party agreement on Mary O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s report in 2004 on how the Seanad could be reformed.  It would be very useful for us to have this debate among ourselves but perhaps in a different forum in a public setting.  The debate in Trinity College was the start of something.  It was very instructive and interesting to hear the comments made, particularly by the former Minister, Mr. McDowell, who has very strong views on the future of the Seanad.  I am happy to circulate his paper to colleagues if it would be of assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout">
      <NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
      <P>Our thoughts are on the events happening in Europe because the consequences for all of us could be quite severe.  I listened overnight to the reports on the early hour deals and the fact that potentially we could have a two-speed Europe concerns me.  While it might not change the speed of cars crossing the border it would have a severe effect on cross-border harmonisation and could slow the pace of the work we are doing as a nation.  I echo and fully support calls for a debate, and Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s request is reasonable.  We talk about reform of the Seanad and for me reform means having a debate such as this on Europe and that we show we can have a timely debate and use our voices.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Without breaking any privileges I draw attention to a point I raised yesterday about an appointment and to a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> today from members of the Justice for Magdalenes group who are shocked by it and feel it is an international validation for the person involved and a slap in the face to the women who suffered in Ireland&rsquo;s Magdalene laundries while they await a State apology.  I await answers from the Minister for Justice and Law Reform to the questions I raised yesterday on the Order of Business.  I will not drop this issue as I believe these questions must be answered.  I will leave it at that for today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett">
      <NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from our debate on the health service yesterday and the interview by the Minister for Health on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Reilly, to debate the Milliman report at an early date.  Yesterday, Senators Sheahan, Burke and Gilroy, to name but three on the Government side, pointed to many abuses they had encountered in the health service in their daily lives.  Many of those are documented in the Milliman report and if the Minister, as part of his reform agenda, were to attend the Seanad, the Senators could assist him in bringing their own experiences to the problems they have encountered in the health service.  Reform of the health service is a major priority in public life in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmBurke">
      <NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the call of my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Brien, for a debate on the developments taking place at a European level.  It is important that we have such a debate before the end of this session and I agree with him that even if the Minister is not available we should have the debate anyway.  In that debate we should examine our own role from a European point of view.  Senators Daly and O&rsquo;Keeffe raised this issue yesterday and I agree fully with them.  I have also raised that matter and I believe we should set aside a set period of time every month to deal with European affairs.  For instance, the European Commission has 129 proposals to deal with in 2012.  Those are matters we could discuss also as well as flagging our concerns about any issue it will deal with in the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>There is a report in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> on the incidence of cancer throughout the country.  A clear analysis has been made of the different types of cancer identified across the country <Col N="274" />and there is a high incidence of particular types of cancer in different areas of the country.  It is a matter that should be debated in this House and on which there should be further research.  It is a health issue on which both the Department and the entire health service can play a proactive part but we must find the causes of the problem.  In Cork city, bowel and pancreatic cancers are at a far higher rate than in any other part of the country and therefore there must be issues in that regard that need to be dealt with.  We can make a constructive contribution to that by having an open debate on the issues with a view to determining the policy changes that must be made.  I ask for such a debate.  I accept we will not have it before Christmas but it should be held early in the new year to deal with that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach well in his endeavours in Europe at this critical stage.  We are entering uncharted waters.  That this country might need a referendum is worrying but the current scenario that is emerging in Europe and the world is also the most serious decision that will impact on this country since we entered Europe in 1973.  It is a frightening scenario and I wish the Taoiseach and his officials the very best.  I hope he will be wearing the dark green jersey during the negotiations and show his mettle, which I believe he can do, and that he ensures we get the best out of this deal because if we do not there will not be any renegotiation if the matter is put to bed in the coming days, which we all hope will happen.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on farming and fishing in the new year because I accept it will not be possible to have one before Christmas.  In that regard, many Members may not be aware that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, will travel to Europe next for the annual negotiation &mdash; it should be biannual &mdash; on the total allowable catch, TAC, under which Irish fishermen will have to operate for the next 12 months.  As we approach Christmas we should consider our fishermen who are out in difficult weather providing fish for us and for export, and we should wish the Minister well in the negotiations.  Every year it is a question of give a little, take a little but each year it seems to get more difficult.  I spoke to the Minister yesterday, and wished him well in his negotiations because we must consider our fishermen who make up a small sector of our community, and also our farmers.  The Leader might arrange for a debate on this matter in the new year.</P>
      <P>A debate should be arranged on the subject of child abuse some time in the next session.  We had a number of debates on abuse by members of the church but many people forget, and society is forgetting, that less than 20% of abuse happened within the church; 80% of abuse happened within homes.  That is a serious issue.  Society needs to grasp the nettle in that regard.  Members of the Seanad have an obligation, morally and legally, to do something about that and to take a stance on it.  I hope we will have a specific debate on that some time in the next term to see how we can in some way curtail the type of appalling case that happened recently in Mayo and in other areas, including the Kilkenny incest case and so on.  We are brushing the issue under the carpet and we should not do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Brien and the other speakers on the summit which is ongoing in Brussels but we should not be totally despondent.  We know already that they agreed at 4 a.m. to a number of strengthening mechanisms regarding the IMF and therefore improvements have been made.  We are all involved in this process.  This country has to defend the euro as much as the other states.  From what we have heard I agree with what they have done about budget rules.  Fiscal discipline is necessary if we are to survive.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Where would we be without the euro?  We do not want to go back to the punt or do a deal with Britain and be allied to sterling.  I respect that Britain was good to us in our hour of difficulty with the billions of pounds it advanced.  It is unfortunate that they are in a dilemma <Col N="275" />because of the City of London and sterling but what can we do about it?  We should welcome what has happened so far.  There is a great deal to be played for today and we should await the outcome of the final communiqu&eacute; today.  I do not believe our IFSC will be damaged as a result of Britain being left out and as a previous speaker said, the most important debate we could have will be a debate arising out of the final communiqu&eacute;.  We should hold off in that respect and I hope the Leader can arrange a debate next week with the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, or some other Minister.</P>

      <P Just="Left">Ar n&oacute;ta n&iacute;os &eacute;adroime, ba mhaith liom tr&eacute;asl&uacute; leis an Aire Eala&iacute;ona, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta, an Teachta Jimmy Deenihan, as an mhaoini&uacute; at&aacute;&aacute; chur ar f&aacute;il do dhr&aacute;ma&iacute;ocht na Gaeilge.

T&aacute; s&eacute; thar barr.</P>
      <P>Anybody who wants to improve their Irish should consider popping along to see the play S&eacute;tanta, an outstanding production by a group called F&iacute;b&iacute;n, in the Peacock Theatre, which is being funded through the Minister&rsquo;s offices.  It is the first Irish language production in that theatre for some years and it is very welcome.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>On a more serious note, I call for a debate on the future of rural schools.  A number of changes are being introduced in the budget which are more than just budgetary changes.  They will potentially change the fabric of education in our rural communities if they go ahead.  The changes proposed to two, three and four teacher schools will mean a radical overhaul of the way education is delivered in our rural communities.  I know from the telephone calls I am getting from Connemara and Galway east and west that it is causing a great deal of concern.  Many people want to meet me over the weekend to discuss the issues because they believe it will change the way the schools operate and has the potential to result in certain schools being amalgamated.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Beidh tionchar m&oacute;r aige chomh maith ar na scoileanna Gaeltachta &oacute; thaobh sol&aacute;thar tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge ins na scoileanna sin.  T&aacute; caint air sna scoileanna i gConamara go m&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go gcaillfear suas le 20 post m&uacute;inteoireachta sna scoileanna i gConamara agus go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; suas le ceithre scoil a chur isteach in &eacute;ineacht lena ch&eacute;ile.  It is important that we would arrange for the Minister to attend the House as soon as possible to discuss the implications of the budgetary changes affecting rural schools.</P>
      <P>It is not just a change in the pupil-teacher ratios and in the funding mechanism, but it is a complete overhaul of the implementation of education in our rural communities that is having a very worrying effect on the teachers, parents and pupils.  We should certainly debate how that will affect our rural communities in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins">
      <NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I join Senator O&rsquo;Donovan in calling for a debate on how robust our systems are to prevent the kind of abuse, torture and rape that was reported in today&rsquo;s newspapers following the court hearing in Castlebar yesterday where a man pleaded guilty to 277 charges of abuse of his daughters over an 18-year period.  It seems unbelievable that something like this could go on over such a protracted period.  We need to analyse how robust our systems and structures are to prevent anything like this ever happening again.  We also want to know that services and supports are available to help the victims of this type of abuse within families through the awful crisis they are no doubt experiencing in their lives at this time.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On a positive note I welcome the appointment last night of a new CEO for the Galway group of hospitals and I wish Mr. Bill Maher well in his new and challenging role.  Many <Col N="276" />Members in the House will be aware of many difficulties in UCHG in recent years.  It has lengthy waiting lists, and difficulties in its accident and emergency department and in the system generally.  I hope the new appointment will be of benefit to all the hospitals in Galway and Roscommon.  I very much welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement that this appointment will help secure the futures of the small hospitals.  I hope the resources and investment required in my local hospital, Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe will now benefit from the restructuring within the group of hospitals.  I hope the people of Counties Galway and Roscommon will end up with a better, safer and more efficient hospital system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I also look forward to the debate on the negotiations that are taking place in Europe.  It looks like we will be faced with a new EU treaty in the new year and a referendum.  When I heard the interview with the Minister of State this morning, I was surprised that corporation tax was not on the agenda.  A number of questions were raised in both Houses as to whether Ireland had set out a position.  We had not even tabled for discussion the issue of corporation tax.  President Sarkozy quite clearly has it in his sights and he wants to take away whatever competitive advantage Ireland has in trying to grow its way out of the current financial difficulties.  I am concerned that we did not challenge him in the open forum available to us.  I am equally concerned that this appears to be a <i>fait accompli</i>.  We know the Germans and the French are running the show and everybody else is doing the rubberstamping.  If instead of talking about handing over fiscal control and fiscal consolidation to Brussels and instead we were to say we were now handing over fiscal control and consolidation of checks and balances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that my esteemed colleague, Senator Bacik?  I will not remind her of the speech she gave two days ago about barracking in the Chamber.</P>
      <P>We know the constraints of the IMF-EU bailout, the idea of which is that we would be able to work our way out.  However, what is being proposed under the new EU treaty is that there would be permanent oversight of all governments&rsquo; spending.  EU officials will see details of our budget before Deputies and Senators see them.  If instead of that being done by Brussels and the EU, we were to say that would be done by Whitehall and Westminster, and that Britain was going to have oversight of our budgetary controls, what kind of reaction would people have then?  Essentially once fiscal control and fiscal oversight is handed over, a large swathe of political control is handed over.</P>
      <P>We had a debate on the issue that in the past two years 140,000 people have stopped paying for private health insurance, including 43,000 people in the year up to September.  I have received representations from people in Sneem and throughout Kerry about this issue, which will have a major long-term effect on us, because public waiting lists will go through the roof.  I know the Minister is looking at the matter but he needs to address it because people will not be able to afford it.  I had an interesting discussion with a garda in Kenmare recently in which he pointed out that road deaths are now being replaced by suicide.  We have put people into their homes and they are drinking without any measure or control.</P>

      <P Just="Left">When I spoke yesterday about the possible upcoming strike with the legal aid solicitors and barristers, I did not believe it would proceed, but it did and they walked out of the courts.  We now find that more than 100 cases had to be adjourned in the courts because of the strike.  That sets a very bad example for people who were trained in advocacy and are some of the best paid people in the country.  I know the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, spoke about the matter in the D&aacute;il yesterday and said that he was astonished and astounded bearing in mind that the Criminal Law Practitioner Organisation members comprise some of the highest earners in the criminal legal aid scheme.  As legislation to reorganise the system is going through, I ask the Minister to come to the House immediately and put a call out to the well paid people serving on this board.  These are not their only earnings.  Yesterday one section of the media published what they earn and some people are rightly talking about a cap of &euro;200,000.  It is not acceptable for people earning this type of money to go on strike thereby putting cases out of kilter in the courts.  As the courts system is overstretched, this is unacceptable and should be treated as an emergency.  I believe 120 cases were adjourned yesterday and it affects the District Court also.  Something needs to be done immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Keane in expressing my concern over what happened.  As a solicitor, I am disappointed that my colleagues felt the need to strike.  As far as I know &mdash; Senator Colm Burke might confirm this &mdash; strikes such as this have not previously occurred in the profession.  I do not see the necessity for it.  This could be handled in an entirely different manner.  Perhaps they have now vented their frustrations.  It is disappointing as a member of the legal profession to see that frustrations with regard to this service have been exhibited in such a manner.  The Minister should probably engage with them on some level to avoid such instances occurring in the future.  It is downright irresponsible for this to occur.  In fairness to the members of the legal profession, they made provisions for those in custody and for custody-type hearings.  However, it is still not good enough.  Senator Keane spoke about the system being clogged up, which is a reality in all courts, especially in the District Court where such criminal cases are held.  I call on the Minister to do something about this.  Perhaps this is the end of it &mdash; let us hope it is.  This cannot happen in the future and I would welcome a debate on the matter in the new year.</P>

      <P Just="Left">Senators O&rsquo;Brien, Bacik, van Turnhout, Burke, Coghlan and others raised the issue of the EU crisis.  This is the most important item that will occupy the minds of many throughout Europe in the next number of days.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, in her statement this morning mentioned that neither corporation tax nor the treaty changes were discussed yesterday but they will probably be discussed.  The protection of the currency is of paramount importance to us.  I am endeavouring to have the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, in the House next week.  If we cannot get a Minister, I am open to the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition that we debate the issue without having a Minister present.  It is important that Seanad Members discuss this crisis, and we will have a debate on the issue.  It is only a question of timing.</P>

      <P Just="Left">The schedule for next week has been issued but let me put Members on notice that we will have additional business to discuss on Friday, with Bills coming back from the D&aacute;il.  We will also schedule more business for next week, in addition to what is on the schedule.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Brien called for a debate on law and order, crime and Garda stations.  We had a comprehensive debate yesterday on the Criminal Law (Defence and the Dwelling) Bill 2010 in which a number of those items were discussed.  I agree with the Senator that we should have a debate on that issue early in the new year.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Brien also raised the issue of the Bank of Ireland passing on the ECB interest rate reductions.  We will wait and see what the banks will do.  The Government&rsquo;s position is very clear and, if necessary, I am sure the banks will be called in again to ensure that reductions in the ECB interest rate will be passed on to mortgage holders.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Most of the Members of the Seanad were unable to be present for the debate in Trinity College the other night.  It must have been a very exciting debate on reform of the Seanad and would think that Senator Bacik was in the middle of it.  I am sure she did an excellent job when discussing the issue.  Again, there is a difference of opinion as to how we should progress that debate.  The issue should be debated, whether in this forum or elsewhere.  There are rumours of the possibility that we will have a referendum on the future of the Seanad in the first quarter of next year.  Nothing is cast in stone, but I am hearing it through the grapevine.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator van Turnhout raised the issue of Justice for Magdalenes.  She made a very strong point on the issue yesterday and again today.  I understand that the issue may be discussed at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Barrett that the Minister for Health should attend the Seanad to discuss the problems in the health service.  The Seanad could offer some assistance to the Minister in progressing some of the ideas that would help to solve the problems in the health service.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Colm Burke highlighted the issue of cancer care and the clustering of cancer cases, and whether eating habits and lifestyle could be possible causes of cancer.  The Seanad Public Consultation Committee is very interested in dealing with this issue and I can assure the Senator we will address it early in the new year.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Donovan requested a debate on farming and fishing.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, has indicated that he would be willing to attend the House early in the new year.  It is a very important time for fishermen as the negotiations of quotas for the following year take place.  I am sure we all join Senator O&rsquo;Donovan in hoping that the Minister will negotiate a good deal for fishermen for the coming year.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and Mullins raised the issue of child abuse, pointing out that the majority of child abuse cases happened in the home and the abuser was a family member.  We have read about the appalling case in County Mayo.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has indicated that she is willing to attend the Seanad in the new year to discuss the issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of the arts, the Irish language play in the Peacock theatre and also the future of small schools and how rural communities would be affected by the provisions in the budget on the future of small schools.  It is an exaggeration to say that there is a possibility that 20 teachers could go in the Connemara area but I agree that the issue is worthy of debate in the House.  Perhaps the Minister for Education and Skills could attend and let us know the overall situation in that regard.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Mullins mentioned the Galway group of hospitals and we hope the appointment will benefit all the hospitals and, most importantly, all the patients in the region.</P>
      <Col N="279" />
      <P>Senator Daly raised the issue of handing over political control to the European Union.  We have already handed over our economic sovereignty and I hope we will get it back in early course as a result of the Government negotiations over the weekend.  The Senator also called for a debate on suicide.  We will have such a debate during the first week we are back in January.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Keane has asked about what happened in the courts yesterday.  It was despicable for a group who are very well paid and should know better to disrupt the Courts Service.  Senator Noone called the action irresponsible and I fully agree with her.  This has clogged up the courts system and I wonder why that is the situation.  They should try to put their own house in order because people&rsquo;s patience will not last.  It is irresponsible of barristers and solicitors to take this action when everybody else is suffering from pay cuts.</P>

      <P Just="Left">I thank Senators for making the necessary time available to introduce this Bill in the House, the objective of which is to implement the convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters signed at Lugano on 30 October 2007.  This convention is commonly referred to as the 2007 Lugano Convention.</P>
      <Col N="280" />
      <P>The 2007 convention supersedes an earlier convention of the same name which was concluded in 1988 and which has been in force in this jurisdiction since 1993.  It involves the member states of the EU and the European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, countries of Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.  The 2007 convention was concluded by the European Community in May 2009 as the Community has exclusive competence for its conclusion.  It has since been ratified by all of the relevant EFTA countries.  As special arrangements pertain to Denmark in the area of judicial co-operation in civil matters, the convention has also been ratified by that country in its own right.  A similar ratification requirement does not arise in relation to the other member states, including Ireland.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The primary purpose of the new convention is to ensure that the same regime will apply for the recognition and enforcement of judgments moving between these EFTA countries and the EU as prevails within the EU for judgments coming from the member states.  The governing instrument within the EU is Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, which is commonly known as the Brussels I Regulation.  The 2007 convention replicates that instrument in all essential elements and will ensure coherence of arrangements among the states bound by the convention in so far as jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments are concerned.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am pleased to say Ireland has a solid and deepening trade relationship with the EFTA states, and particularly with Switzerland.  Switzerland is a key market for Irish merchandise exports.  Such exports reached over &euro;3.5 billion last year and mostly consisted of medical, pharmaceutical and chemical products.  Our merchandise imports from that country are approximately &euro;850 million annually.  Services exports to Switzerland are also very significant, having reached an annual total of &euro;1.8 billion in 2010.  Services imports totalled &euro;1.6 billion last year.  Switzerland is also a significant source of foreign direct investment to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Norway is a very significant supplier of oil to the Irish market, to the value of approximately &euro;1 billion in the last year.  It is notable that overall trade with that country is very definitely two-way, with total Irish exports to Norway also having reached &euro;1.2 billion last year.  In relation to Iceland, as one would expect, the levels of trade with that country are more modest.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The enforcement of judgments has an ever increasing relevance to the lives of people in the State.  Inevitably, from time to time, people will find the need to bring legal proceedings outside the State or, if they bring them in our own courts, they may need to seek to enforce judgments granted by those courts in other states.  That relevance will continue to grow and develop as there is greater mobility of people and greater commercial interaction between the State and other states which are bound by the convention.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The origins of the 2007 convention can be traced to the seminal instrument in this area which is the 1968 convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in civil and commercial matters which has now been replaced by the Brussels I Regulation.  That 1968 convention was of far-reaching importance, providing and setting up procedures for the recognition and enforcement of civil and commercial judgments of the various member states of what was then the European Community.  A key objective of the 2007 convention, and the instruments which relate to it, is the provision of speedy and informal procedures for enabling judgments given in one participating state to be recognised and enforced in each of the other participating states.  Linking with this objective is the establishment of jurisdictional rules which determine the courts which are competent to rule on an action.  I should like to emphasise that at the heart of the 2007 convention, of the Brussels I Regulation and of the earlier conventions <Col N="281" />lies a very simple concept, that is the provision of speedy and informal procedures to allow judgments in one participating state to be enforced in another participating state.</P>
      <P>A significant development in economic terms in recent years is the globalisation of products and markets.  Increased international competition and the growth in telecommunications and other technologies mean that measures providing for jurisdiction and enforcement across national boundaries have become more necessary in recent years.  There is an ever-growing requirement that international contracts can be adjudicated upon easily before the courts of another country and that judgments given on foot of such adjudication can be enforced readily in other jurisdictions.  In this context a system which guarantees the virtually automatic enforcement of foreign judgments is an important and practical tool for anyone doing business across national boundaries.  The progressive elimination of barriers to trade means that now, more than ever, predictability and certainty are vital in the area of business and commercial relationships within Europe and beyond.  Both individuals and corporate entities need to be sure they can readily enforce contracts and secure enforcement of judgments for what can, in some cases, be large sums of money.  Such measures have the twin effects of protecting existing trade and encouraging new trade.</P>
      <P>In a related field, I understand the Hague Conference on Private International Law has adopted a Convention on Choice of Court Agreements.  That convention aims to ensure that such agreements, where they involve the parties to commercial transactions, can be upheld on a global basis.  The likelihood is that this convention will be concluded by the EU sometime in the future.  There is also the possibility that a more ambitious project will be undertaken within the framework of the Hague Conference on Private International Law which will involve the development of a worldwide convention providing for the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial areas.  This emphasises the significant potential for expansion and development in the sphere of judicial co-operation in Europe and beyond.</P>
      <P>Turning to the specific provisions of the 2007 convention, the general rule of jurisdiction in the convention is the same as it was in the 1988 Lugano Convention.  In essence, it requires that a defendant is to be sued in the country where he or she is domiciled.  For the purposes of the convention&rsquo;s operation in Ireland, domicile in this context equates with ordinary residence in so far as a natural person is concerned.  This rule applies regardless of whether a person is, or is not, a citizen of the relevant state.</P>
      <P>However, in certain cases under the convention, a person can take proceedings in the courts of his or her own country even though the defendant in that action may be domiciled in another state bound by the convention.  In particular, there are certain protective rules in this respect covering consumers, insurance and employment contracts.  Thus, in the case of consumer contract provisions, for example, if an Irish person purchases goods in a state bound by the convention and those goods subsequently turn out to be faulty, or are not delivered, the 2007 convention enables those consumers to bring the action before the Irish courts, should they so wish.</P>
      <P>Alongside, and as an alternative to the general rule of domicile, the 2007 convention keeps unchanged the existing structure that provides for special jurisdictions in several areas such as in matters relating to contract, maintenance and tort.  These jurisdictions are set out in Articles 5 to 7 of the convention.  These special rules recognise a link between the dispute itself and the court which may be called upon to hear it.  They come into play only where there is a sufficient connection in terms of the proceedings between the dispute and the court before which the matter is to be brought, from the point of view of the gathering of evidence or the conduct of the proceedings, or in order to secure better protection of the interests of the parties against which the proceedings are directed.</P>
      <Col N="282" />
      <P>The simplification of the procedures for the recognition and enforcement of judgments that fall within its scope is a fundamental aspect of the Lugano Convention.  In this regard, all decisions given by a court or tribunal, whatever they may be called, are &ldquo;judgments&rdquo;, and the term also includes orders on costs or expenses made by an officer of the court, as happens in some European systems.  Provisional and protective measures also fall within the definition of &ldquo;judgments&rdquo; if they are ordered by a court, provided that in the state which gave the judgment, both parties were first given the opportunity to be heard.  The judgments of the Court of Justice or of other European Community law courts also come within the scope of the 2007 Lugano Convention, as the term &ldquo;state bound by this Convention&rdquo; may also mean the European Community.</P>
      <P>The changes made in the 2007 convention to the rules on the recognition and enforcement of decisions are based on the view that the intervention of the authorities of the state of enforcement can be scaled down and that the declaration of enforceability of a judgment can be reduced to little more than a formality.  This position is supported by an examination of the national case law on the earlier conventions, which shows that appeals filed against declarations of enforceability under the Brussels and Lugano conventions are so small in number as to be almost negligible.</P>
      <P>There is no change to the convention&rsquo;s basic provisions on legal aid.  Thus, an applicant who, in the state of origin of the judgment, has benefited from complete or partial legal aid, or exemption from costs or expenses, is entitled to the most favourable legal aid or the most extensive exemption from costs or expenses provided for by the law of the state addressed.  However, the application of this provision has a wider scope than previously, as it covers the entire enforcement procedure, including any appeal proceedings.  In this context, the grounds for legal aid or exemption from costs or expenses are irrelevant.  They are determined by the law of the state of origin of the judgment and are not subject to review.  In this regard, a certificate issued by the authority that gave the judgment for which recognition and enforcement is sought must indicate whether or not the applicant has benefited from legal aid.  This is sufficient to allow the applicant to qualify in the state addressed.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Turning to the Bill itself, it is wholly technical in nature, largely replicating the content of the statutory instrument used to give full effect to the Brussels I Regulation, which has been in operation since March 2002.  Section 1 provides that the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Act 1998, which deals with the Brussels I Convention and the original Lugano Convention, is amended in two ways.  First, a new Part IIIA dealing exclusively with the 2007 Lugano Convention is inserted.  Second, the 2007 Lugano Convention is inserted as a Schedule to the 1998 Act.</P>
      <P>The new Part IIIA contains a number of sections which I shall briefly outline in order to provide some additional background for Senators as to the content of the Bill.  Section 20A contains standard interpretation provisions, while section 20Bstates that the convention has the force of law in the State.  Section 20C provides that judicial notice shall be taken of the convention and of the explanatory report on it prepared by Professor Fausto Pocar.  The effect of this section is that the courts are taken to know of the provisions of these texts without the requirement to have them proven in evidence.  Judicial notice is also to be taken of relevant court decisions which, in this context, include decisions relating to the old Lugano Convention and to the Brussels I Regulation.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Section 20D authorises the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to make certain orders in regard to convention matters, most notably that a specified state is a state bound by the <Col N="283" />convention, or that particular declarations or communications have been made.  While such orders are in force, they are of evidential value.</P>
      <P>Section 20E provides that an application under the convention for the recognition and enforcement in the State of a judgment shall be made to the Master of the High Court for determination under the convention.  This means that the recognition and enforcement machinery in the convention automatically comes into play whenever a convention application is made.  As a general principle, convention judgments are entitled to recognition without any special procedure being required.  In regard to enforcement, once the prescribed formalities have been completed, the judgment is declared enforceable immediately without any review under Articles 34 and 35 of the convention, which set out the grounds for non-recognition.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The main grounds for denying recognition, which will only come into play if the initial decision by the master is appealed to the High Court, relate to public policy and to an absence of fair procedures.  The latter arises mainly in default cases where the defendant was not served with the document instituting the proceedings, or with an equivalent document, in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him or her to arrange for a defence, unless he or she failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for him or her to do so.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Section 20F is concerned with the enforcement of convention judgments.  In broad terms it provides that a judgment, other than a maintenance order, in respect of which an enforcement order has been made, shall be of the same force and effect as a judgment of the High Court, and that proceedings for its enforcement may be taken accordingly.  In regard to maintenance orders, provision is made in section 20G for the enforcement of such orders by the District Court.  An exception is made for cases where substantial arrears are involved as, in such a case, the enforcement machinery of the High Court might be more appropriate.  I will be proposing an amendment to section 20G on Committee Stage to take account of the change to section 8 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940, as introduced by the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, which we discussed in this House last July.</P>
      <P>Section 20H deals with provisions in enforcement orders for the payment of interest on judgments and for the payment of costs.  While the convention is silent on the question of interest, the spirit of the convention clearly requires that foreign judgments should carry interest as provided for by the law of the state in which the judgments were made.  When a foreign court makes a judgment it will either make specific provision for the payment of interest in the judgment itself or it will have made the judgment on the basis that its national provisions on interest will apply.  This section also contains provisions dealing with the payment of costs in regard to applications for enforcement orders and the payment of interest in respect of those costs.</P>
      <P>Section 20I provides for the fixing of the currency and rate of exchange that should apply in the case of enforceable maintenance orders.  Sums required to be paid in respect of such orders are to be paid in the currency of the State.  If the amount stated in the maintenance order is other than in the currency of the State, it will be converted into the currency of the State on the basis of the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the making of the enforcement order.  A certificate signed by an officer of an &ldquo;authorised institution&rdquo;, as defined in subsection (4), stating the prevailing exchange rate on a specified date, will be evidence of the facts contained in that certificate.</P>
      <P>Section 20J deals with the proof and admissibility of documents which must be produced when applying for the recognition or enforcement of a judgment given in another state bound by the convention.  This is a technical provision to avoid the need to take up court time in formally proving validity of the documents concerned.</P>
      <Col N="284" />
      <P>Section 20K deals with the granting by the High Court of provisional, including protective, measures.  Most commonly, such measures would be in the form of an injunction to restrain a defendant from transferring assets out of the jurisdiction in order to ensure that they would be available to satisfy any resulting judgment of the court seised of the substantive proceedings.  Subsection (1) of this section provides that the High Court will have the power to grant the provisional measures normally available to it, even if the substantive matter of the case falls to be heard by the courts of another State bound by the convention.  Under Article 31 of the convention, application may be made to the courts of a state bound by the convention for any provisional, including protective, measures as may be available in its law, even where jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter lies with the courts of another state bound by the convention.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the article is to allow, for example, a foreign plaintiff who is proceeding against a defendant in Switzerland under the terms of the convention, to freeze any assets which that defendant may have in another state bound by the convention.  Thus, when judgment is given that plaintiff can succeed in enforcing the judgment in that other state in circumstances where the defendant has no assets, or has insufficient assets in Switzerland to meet the claim.</P>
      <P>The provisional measure most likely to be availed of is the Mareva injunction, which is used to restrain the disposal by the defendant of his or her goods or their removal from Irish jurisdiction so as to defeat any future judgment that may be given against him or her by the court seised of the substantive proceedings.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) gives the High Court discretion to refuse to grant provisional measures pursuant to subsection (1), if it thinks that the grant of such measures would be inexpedient.  The purpose of the subsection is to make it clear that the High Court is not compelled by subsection (1) to grant provisional measures.  Subsection (3) provides that an application to the Master of the High Court to grant an enforcement order may include an application for any protective measures which the High Court has power to grant in proceedings that, apart from this Act, are within its jurisdiction.  This subsection is subject to Article 47(3) of the convention which safeguards the rights of the defendant pending the elapse of the time during which an appeal can be made.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (4), when an enforcement order is made, the Master of the High Court does not have discretion to refuse an application for protective measures, provided the measures sought are measures which the High Court would have power to grant in other proceedings which fall within its jurisdiction.  This follows on from Article 47 of the convention which specifies that a person is automatically entitled to obtain protective measures on the granting of an enforcement order.</P>
      <P>The distinction between provisional and protective measures can be summarised as follows.  Provisional measures can be applied for at any time and, under Irish law, one can apply for an injunction provided one has issued, or is about to issue, an originating summons.  On the other hand, the protective measures referred to in Article 47 can only be sought and obtained in the context of the granting of an enforcement order, the judgment itself having already been given in the state of origin.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Section 20L deals with domicile for the purposes of the convention.  As mentioned, domicile is the connecting factor used in the convention to link a person with a state for the purposes of grounding jurisdiction.  The convention does not define &ldquo;domicile&rdquo;, but provides in Article 59 that it is to be determined in accordance with the law of each state bound by the convention.  In Ireland, domicile would normally be understood in the common law sense which, in broad terms, means that an individual is considered to be domiciled in the country in which he or she <Col N="285" />intends to reside permanently or for the indefinite future.  However, for the purposes of this convention and of equivalent instruments, domicile is assigned a particular meaning which assimilates it more closely with ordinary residence.  The convention itself contains autonomous rules in relation to the domicile of companies or other legal persons.</P>
      <P>Section 20M sets out the venue at which certain convention proceedings may be brought insofar as the Circuit and District Courts are concerned.  This is necessary because certain articles of the convention give a general jurisdiction to the courts of the state where the defendant is domiciled.  However, they do not establish venue for the lower courts and that matter falls to be determined by national law.</P>
      <P>Section 20N specifies that Part III of the 1998 Act, which relates to the 1998 Lugano Convention, shall, except as provided in Article 65, cease to apply between the state and a state bound by the convention.  Article 65 provides that the convention shall supersede conventions on the same subject matter concluded between states bound by the convention, but it is subject to some transitional provisions set out in Article 63(2), and to Articles 66 and 67 which cover the relationship between the convention and other international agreements as well as Community instruments such as the Brussels One regulation.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for various textual amendments to the Maintenance Act 1994 which are required in consequence of the implementation of the 2007 Lugano Convention.  Section 3 sets out the Short Title of the Bill and the relevant collective citation for the purposes of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This Bill is very technical in nature.  However, despite its technical character, it bears witness to the ever increasing international ties which bind us to other countries, particularly in the commercial sphere.  I look forward to the comments of Senators and commend the Bill to the House.  I thank Senators for their agreement to deal with the Bill this morning.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  My party will be supporting the concept of this Bill.  As the Minister has outlined, the Bill gives effect to the Lugano Convention.  It also makes consequent amendments to the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Act 1998 and the Maintenance Act 1994.  It also provides rules on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters between Ireland and other countries.  I practised law and I know it was not uncommon to encounter situations where a Belgian, Dutch or Italian driver was involved in an accident in west Cork or Kerry.  Foreign visitors driving hired cars were frequently involved in traffic accidents and this resulted in court cases and overseas insurance companies.  I thank the Minister for what he said yesterday about the closure of Garda stations.  Without wishing to be parochial I might ask for his view on the Goleen Garda station.  I was being disingenuous the other night when I told a Fine Gael Deputy from west Cork that if the ever ebullient and affable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is indirectly connected.  If PJ Sheehan was still a Member of the Oireachtas, he would not have allowed it.  I know this is not to do with the Bill but the anniversary of the death of Sophie Toscan du Plantier is approaching.  Her death occurred in my area, the Mizen peninsula.  It is now 13 or 14 years since that happened and the case remains unsolved.  The Minister may not wish to comment as it is <i>sub judice</i> but it is a matter of great concern.  I still meet people who wonder what happened and who killed her.</P>
      <P>The issue of civil legal aid was raised on the Order of Business.  I ask the Minister to reflect on how the criminal legal aid system works.  It is inequitable and unfair.  I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views.  I suggest at a later date we could have a debate on the issue.  It <Col N="286" />appears that 1% of lawyers, of solicitors and barristers, collect more than 85% of the fees from criminal legal aid.  The system is completely skewed.  At the minimum it requires serious review.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Jim Walsh often raises the question of the significant fees earned by solicitors and barristers.  We should also spare a thought for the 2,500 law graduates and recently qualified solicitors and barristers who are jobless and have no hope of securing employment and the many others in the lower echelons of both professions who are struggling to make a decent living.  Some of those who are critical of legal fees charged by barristers and solicitors do not realise that the vast majority of solicitors and barristers make an ordinary living.</P>
      <P>To return to the Bill, while there are no doubt very good reasons, I am not sure why the convention does not apply to matters such as revenue, customs and administrative matters.  Is the reason that it may transgress into certain criminal areas or would extending the convention to these matters require the Minister to be too specific?  Similarly, it does not extend to the status or legal capacity of natural persons, rights in property and so forth.  Bankruptcy is also excluded from its scope at a time when people from this jurisdiction are travelling to Great Britain to avail of that country&rsquo;s different rules on bankruptcy.  Given our current economic plight and the ongoing delicate negotiations taking place in Brussels, perhaps there should be an international bankruptcy law.  Social security and arbitration are also excluded.  I restate my support for the Bill.  I am not trying to put weasel questions to the Minister but I ask him to comment on the reasons these areas have been specifically excluded from the scope of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party will support the Bill.  I apologise if I digressed slightly but as we approach the festive season, I thought the Minister would be a little indulgent and give me some leeway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmBurke">
      <NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise on behalf of my colleague, Senator Bradford, who would normally deal with legislation of this nature but is otherwise engaged.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill which is highly technical and addresses an important area.  In recent years, the amount of commercial work being done across jurisdictions has increased.  As recently as a month ago, I was involved in a case where Irish investors who were doing some work in France secured a loan in Germany but decided to apply Luxembourg law.  This gives us an indication of what is taking place in the commercial field.</P>
      <P>There is little I can add to the comprehensive overview provided by the Minister.  We need to have a facility to deal with cases in which people are trying to enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions.  We must also ensure that assets are not removed from the jurisdiction.  The legislation addresses these issues.  Another important and controversial issue addressed in the Bill is maintenance and cases of people moving to other jurisdictions to avoid paying it.  It is important that procedures are in place to address this practice.</P>
      <P>It can be difficult at times to identify where people are living.  It is important, therefore, that clear definitions and provided and procedures are in place.  The Bill does this and should be enacted at an early date.  The Minister set out in detail the volume of commercial work being done, not only between Ireland and other members of the European Community, but also with the three non-EU countries which are party to the convention.  I thank him again for providing a thorough briefing on the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik">
      <NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither of the two previous speakers used up their speaking time and I will not speak for ten minutes.  I appreciate that this is a technical Bill which enjoys support across the House and for that reason there is no point in speaking at length on it for the sake of it.  On the day that is in it, however, with negotiations taking place at European level, I should point out that while reading through the Bill I was struck by the references in the annexes to the various courts in the European Union member states and the many different languages which will be relevant to the cases confirming the application of the legislation in Ireland and across the EU.  This brought home to me how intrinsically bound up we are in European Union legal procedures and yet how fragile things are at present at another level.</P>
      <P>I will make a few points on the Bill.  I was struck during the Minister&rsquo;s speech by the extent of our trade with Switzerland in particular.  I was not aware that the value of our exports to Switzerland, at &euro;5.3 billion, is almost double the value of our imports from that country which stands at &euro;2.64 billion.  This brings home the importance of having legislation and international agreements in place that will enable small and medium enterprises and businesses involved in export to enforce judgments across borders with countries that are not directly in the European Union but, as in the case of Switzerland, are members of the European Free Trade Association.  This is a matter of interest.</P>
      <P>I am also interested in the concept of a worldwide convention building on the Hague Convention principles and seeking to ensure enforceability of judgments across borders outside the European Union.  What strikes me is the difficulty of guaranteeing the integrity of court procedures in countries that are not bound up in the EU or EFTA structures.  This will be a difficulty if we try to expand the principles further.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke referred to the issue of maintenance and Senator O&rsquo;Donovan referred to the scope of the convention.  I note that all family law matters appear to be exempt.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether that is the case.  The type of maintenance referred to in the legislation is not maintenance in the family law context.  Article 1 reads:</P>
      <P LI="1">1. This Convention shall apply in civil and commercial matters whatever the nature of the court or tribunal. It shall not extend, in particular, to revenue, customs or administrative matters.</P>
      <P LI="1">2. The Convention shall not apply to:</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the status or legal capacity of natural persons, rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship, wills and succession...</P>
      <P FLI="0">As this is an area of law on which I am not particularly well informed, I am not sure if the convention has an application to family law matters.  I presume the reference to maintenance relates to another setting.</P>
      <P>I note the convention applies to employment contracts, which will be of interest to many people employed here, and consumer contracts, which is also of interest because we assume when we are speaking about these types of conventions that the main impact will be on businesses seeking to enforce judgments.  The convention also applies to consumer contracts &mdash; Article 15 &mdash; which will have some import for people.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the freezing of assets in other jurisdictions and provisional and protective measures.  This is of vital importance, not only in terms of judgments but also other measures such as the use of the Mareva injunction.  It struck me that the Minister referred to the freezing of assets where somebody had a case initiated in Switzerland.  The assumption we all have is that it is extremely difficult to get at any assets held in that country.  The idea of <Col N="288" />freezing Swiss bank accounts is almost a clich&eacute; at this stage but it appears it will be possible under the terms of the convention.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>These are just some of the points that occurred to me looking at the text of the legislation before us.  I want to refer briefly to the criminal legal aid issue.  This morning, prior to the Minister coming to the House, others referred in very strongly critical terms to the withdrawal of services yesterday.  I know there is no sympathy for barristers and solicitors who are seen as being high earners, and a small number of people do very well from the criminal legal aid scheme.  However, as somebody who has worked in the area in the past I know a great number of people at the lower end earn very little, particularly starting out.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan mentioned this.  The level of fees in criminal cases is much lower than the level in civil and commercial cases which, ironically, we are discussing today.  There have been quite significant cuts in criminal legal aid payments in recent years.  I do not state this to express support for the action taken yesterday but to set a context.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response yesterday on the cuts in funding to the National Women&rsquo;s Council.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, I do not wish to be parochial or to raise matters outside the ambit of the legislation but I am grateful to the Minister for giving such a full answer to me.  I am still concerned at the extent of the cut and at the idea that groups working on advocacy are not given the same priority as groups working on frontline services.  I entirely accept cuts are necessary &mdash; everyone does &mdash; but advocacy can be very important, certainly on issues such as rape and domestic violence.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and express my support for it as others have done.  We are happy to facilitate the early passage of the Bill.  I know the Minister is anxious to ensure its early passage so we can comply fully with EU obligations in respect of these judgments from the EFTA states and I expect we will be able to deal with Committee Stage very early in the new year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Interesting issues have been raised and I will deal with the issues that specifically apply to the Bill and I will then be happy to respond to a couple of marginally related issues which Senators raised.  In dealing with the Bill, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan correctly referred to Article 1(2) of the convention which deals with the areas to which the convention does not apply.  In the context of the convention being a continuity, going all the way back to the 1968 provision that was mentioned, the matters traditionally excluded from this area of European Union law, some of which have been mentioned, continue to be excluded under <Col N="289" />Title I Article 1(2) of the convention.  It is worth referring specifically to this because it brings me back to an issue raised by Senator Bacik.  The provision in the convention reads:</P>
      
      <P LI="1">The Convention shall not apply to:</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the status or legal capacity of natural persons, rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship, wills and succession;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) bankruptcy, proceedings relating to the winding-up of insolvent companies or other legal persons, judicial arrangements, compositions and analogous proceedings;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) social security;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) arbitration.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I will deal with paragraph (<i>b</i>) first.  European Union arrangements are in place to deal with some aspects of bankruptcy and insolvency in the context of the differing domestic laws within the different European Union countries.  From an Irish perspective this does not prevent in any shape what I would describe as &ldquo;forum shopping&rdquo; whereby a small number of formerly very wealthy individuals who are now in significant financial difficulty have sought within the Union to have their bankruptcy matters dealt with in either England or Northern Ireland, because the bankruptcy period in those jurisdictions is for only one year.  Some have gone outside the European Union, where none of the European Union measures is of direct relevance, to the United States and sought to invoke bankruptcy matters there.  One very well publicised case is taking place and has been before the courts in the United States for a considerable time.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I do not want to make reference to it beyond pointing to the fact that it involves an individual seeking to utilise a bankruptcy law in another jurisdiction who had open to him the taking of bankruptcy proceedings in Ireland.</P>
      <P>With regard to bankruptcy and Ireland, this House dealt with some amendments made in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act to our bankruptcy laws.  Major changes are now being made to bankruptcy and insolvency law, as I advised the House back in July.  Not to digress unduly, but it is important that we bring our laws up to date and that we make less attractive forum shopping in the context of bankruptcy and that persons in this State who are owed money do not find themselves having to deal with a bankruptcy proceeding in a foreign jurisdiction as opposed to the Irish courts.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I expect before the end of the year to publish a framework for the new insolvency legislation dealing with personal insolvency issues across the board.  I expect to publish the heads of a Bill which I hope will be agreed very shortly by the Cabinet.  As the heads of the Bill will be forwarded to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality as promised, Members of both Houses will have an opportunity to comment on them and report back.  At the same time, the Office of the Attorney General will be developing the heads into a substantive Bill which I hope will be published in full form before Easter.  Any observations we receive from the committee will be fed into this process.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Other areas referred to are traditionally excluded from this convention, therefore, social security and arbitration have not been part of this.  Social security issues give rise to matters very different from those addressed in this Bill and arbitration has its own unique place and would not properly feature in legislation relating to the enforcement of civil and commercial judgments.</P>
      <P>To Senator Bacik I state the provisions I would describe as strictly family law provisions are designed to exclude from this convention matters dealing with the status of persons.  In other words, the convention has no direct relevance to divorce proceedings.  It does not deal with the enforcement of a divorce order in so far as one can be enforced or the recognition of a divorce <Col N="290" />order.  There is a separate regulation in place throughout the European Union, known as Brussels II, which deals with the recognition of divorce orders granted and jurisdictional issues with regard to divorce.</P>
      
      <P Just="Left">There is also a European Union regulation which deals with the enforcement of orders with regard to matrimonial property where such orders are made in divorce proceedings.  In both cases, whether under Brussels II or a matrimonial property matter, it applies to separation proceedings.  Ireland is not a party to the provisions in place with regard to matrimonial property because they would have created certain constitutional difficulties in the context of our present constitutional provisions with regard to divorce as contained in the family provisions of Constitution in Article 41.</P>
      <P>The good news for Senator Ivana Bacik is that the convention, in its original 1968 form, expressly makes provision for the enforcement of maintenance orders.  The Bill provides for continuity in this regard.  Section 2, Article 5, subparagraph 2 of the convention makes reference to the issue of maintenance.  Specific provisions in the Act are applicable.  For example, section 20G deals generally with the enforcement provisions that will apply to maintenance orders.  Section 2 relates to the Maintenance Act 1994 and the necessary amendments to be made to it.  In the context of the states to which the convention applies, it establishes an updated list of new provisions for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of maintenance orders that arise when a marriage enters into difficulties.  It is important that these vital provisions be contained in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of civil legal aid, an issue which has some relevance to the Bill, given the provisions that extend civil legal aid to those seeking to enforce in one state judgments in another state in circumstances in which the enforcing state is obliged to provide the same level of legal aid as obtains in the state in which the original order was made.  The Bill has no relevance to the recent dispute, but Senators Denis O&rsquo;Donovan and Ivana Bacik chose to mention it.  I was interested in the former&rsquo;s concerns.  A small number of solicitors&rsquo; firms earn substantial fees under the criminal legal aid system.  In terms of their and their lawyers being on the panels for criminal legal aid in the context of the work they properly undertake on behalf of alleged offenders in the criminal courts, they are entitled to the fees payable under the criminal legal aid system and I would not in any way criticise an individual lawyer or firm for undertaking work under the criminal legal aid system and being appropriately paid for it.  However, it is curious that those who appeared to be in the leadership role in the attempted strike that took place yesterday were among the very highest earners under the criminal legal aid scheme.  Having briefly looked at the figures, one solicitor, through work he has done in his firm, earned in excess of &euro;2 million in fees from criminal legal aid work in four years.  Another earned &euro;1.8 million.  At another firm in the same period fees were assigned to an individual in the region of &euro;4 million.  As a solicitor in practice, I understand these are not simply fees paid to the solicitor in that the solicitor has to meet the cost of running a firm of employees and assistant solicitors.  However, in the current financial climate when that level of fees is being earned, it is extraordinary that individuals should withdraw services.  It was outrageous that cases were unnecessarily adjourned in the courts yesterday.</P>
      <P>Lawyers, as officers of the court, have a duty to it to ensure cases are disposed of in the interests of the court system and defendants as efficiently and early as possible without unnecessary expense being incurred.  It is important that judges who are under pressure because of the large amount of work before the courts in criminal and civil matters do not have a day or a part thereof wasted.  It was unfair to alleged offenders who appear before the courts.  We operate with a presumption of innocence and those who are innocent of charges taken against them are entitled to have their cases processed as early as possible.  As Senator Denis <Col N="291" />O&rsquo;Donovan mentioned, a substantial number of young solicitors and barristers are not only unemployed, but are also not as prominent as those earning large fees.  They are struggling to make ends meet and would readily be available to undertake work competently in circumstances in which others declined that work.</P>
      
      <P>The dispute arose in an extraordinary way.  I received a letter, dated 23 September, from the newly formed organisation of solicitors and barristers doing criminal legal aid work.  The source of their complaint was the decision made by me within my Department to reduce the fees payable under the criminal legal aid system by 10%.  Their primary complaint concerned the loss of parity with fees payable to prosecuting counsel.  Approximately four days after I had received that letter, the Director of Public Prosecutions applied a similar 10% fee reduction.  Any suggestion prosecuting lawyers are better paid than defendants&rsquo; lawyers is, therefore, no longer accurate.  The prosecution and the defence remained in the same position fee-wise as the new legal term was entered into in October.  That was the urgent issue they wished to discuss with me.</P>
      <P>In December 2010 the previous Government made available to the then Minister for Justice and Law Reform &euro;47 million for the criminal legal aid scheme in 2011.  It became very clear as we headed into the summer months that this would not be an adequate sum to meet the needs of a demand-led scheme.  The &euro;47 million made available to the Department has been exceeded by more than &euro;10 million.  To meet this expense, other areas funded by the Department have lost out as money had to be found to meet the expenses incurred.  The sum I have allocated for the scheme in 2012 is &euro;47 million and we must stay within budget.</P>
      <P>In the last week of November the group again asked to meet me.  We replied and advised that I was happy to meet it after the budgetary process was completed and when the 2012 Estimate for the Department was known.  I indicated that, if possible, I would do my best to meet it before 21 December, but that I could not guarantee such a meeting because, first, I had legislative commitments that were keeping me in this House all day and would see me dealing with other matters next week, and, second, I had a meeting of European Justice Ministers next week in Brussels that would take up some time.  The group was told that, towards the end of this week, my office would make contact with it.  Last Friday it announced that its members were going on strike and they took action yesterday.  As I understand it, their action had no impact on the higher courts but had some impact at District Court level.  On occasion, lawyers stood up to say they were withdrawing, but they remained and continued to deal with cases.  It is also my understanding from communications I have received that a significant number of solicitors and barristers on the criminal legal aid panel were resolutely opposed to what occurred yesterday.  The action taken was a disgrace.</P>
      <P>In my response in November I invited the group to submit its ideas to me.  They had suggested they had ideas on how money could be saved under the criminal legal aid scheme.  I told them I would very much appreciate their writing to me detailing where savings could be effected in a manner which would continue to ensure that the rights of alleged offenders were protected.  I made that request &mdash; I do not have the exact date before me because I did not expect to have to deal with this issue this morning &mdash; approximately two and a half weeks ago.  I am still waiting to hear what they have to say on that issue.</P>

      <P>Those on the criminal legal aid panels have certain duties.  They failed in their duties yesterday.  Fees are paid to criminal legal aid lawyers for adjourning cases.  I will make absolutely certain that cases unnecessarily adjourned yesterday because of this protest do not result in those who obtained the adjournments being paid fees in that regard, which is contrary to the public interest.  </P>
      <P Just="Left">I call on the Law Society of Ireland and Bar Council of Ireland to consider whether it is appropriate conduct for any lawyer in receipt of a legal aid certificate to represent an individual to decline in court to allow a case to go ahead, even if it is simply to bring about a 24 hour adjournment.  I want a public pronouncement from the Law Society of Ireland and Bar Council of Ireland on that issue.  I want to ensure we have no repetition of this.  I believe it was inappropriate and wrong.  In circumstances in which &euro;10 million more of public money was spent on criminal legal aid in 2011, it is extraordinary that a group of lawyers entered into a campaign yesterday for what appears to be increased fees when what we need to do is make the system more efficient, protect the rights of alleged offenders and bring under reasonable control the costs of the criminal legal aid scheme.  I am again calling on the group, if they have ideas in regard to how to bring costs under control while protecting the rights of alleged offenders, to submit them to me in writing.  I am also happy to meet them in the new year but I will not meet people under threat of withdrawal.  The message that came to my office last week was that if I refused to meet them within seven days, they would go on strike.  I believe that was an extraordinary way for a newly formed group to deal with an issue of this nature, in particular when the leaders of that group, unlike the people &mdash; the large number of well qualified lawyers who could otherwise undertake this work and do it as efficiently as others &mdash; about whom Senator O&rsquo;Donovan is rightly concerned, are earning enormous fees.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to report to the Seanad on the amendments by the D&aacute;il to the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009.  I propose to follow the structure of the Bill for the purposes of reporting on the D&aacute;il amendments.  I should at the outset say that several of the important changes which were made to the Bill during its passage through the D&aacute;il were in response to issues first raised during early discussions in this House.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The first group of amendments fall into three categories, namely, amendments clarifying the scope of the Bill, technical amendments necessitated by legislative changes in the period since the Bill left this House and amendments of a purely drafting nature.  The principal changes in this group are amendments Nos. 7 and 14.  Amendment No. 7 inserts a definition of &ldquo;land&rdquo; into section 2.  The Bill did not originally include a specific definition of &ldquo;land&rdquo; because the definition in the Interpretation Act 2005 is a generally applicable definition.  However, it appears that the lack of a definition has resulted in some confusion in relation to residential property.  The definition which has been inserted to remove any uncertainty states that &ldquo;land&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009.  This definition is more detailed than the definition in the Interpretation Act 2005 in so far as it explicitly includes &ldquo;buildings or structures of any kind on land and any part of them, whether the division is made horizontally, vertically or in any other way&rdquo;.  Therefore, it clearly includes apartments as well as other types of dwellings.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 14 amends the definition of &ldquo;property service&rdquo; to make it clear that the Bill&rsquo;s provisions apply to property services provided for consideration.  The legislation is not intended to prevent a person from selling their own home or, for example, prevent a parent from letting the house of an absent adult child.  The following amendments take account of developments since the Bill was passed by this House.  Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 8, 11 and 12 take account of reforms which were given effect in the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights of Cohabitants Act 2010 and the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011.  Amendments Nos. 9 and 19 reflect the changes in the titles of Government Ministers.  They replace references to &ldquo;Minister for Justice and Law Reform with &ldquo;Minister for Justice and Equality&rdquo; and &ldquo;Minister for Finance&rdquo; with &ldquo;Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.&rdquo;</P>

I am sure that at the time the new Government was formed, the Taoiseach did not envisage how many amendments of title would be required to this piece of legislation.

      <P>With the exception of amendment No. 107, the main amendments in this group of amendments relate to Part 2 of the Bill, which provides for the establishment and operation of the property services regulatory authority.  The main amendments in this group are amendments Nos. 22, 28, 30 and 107.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 22 deals with an important matter first raised during earlier discussions in this House.  It specifies that not fewer than three members of the authority shall be persons who have knowledge of, or experience in, consumer affairs.  Amendments Nos. 28, 30 and 107 address overlaps between the &ldquo;disclosure of interest&rdquo; provisions in the Bill as passed by this House and broadly similar provisions in the Ethics in Public Office Acts.  Amendment No. 28 deletes section 15, whereas amendment No. 30 replaces subsection (3) of section 16 with a revised wording which provides protection for the disclosure of information as required under the Ethics in Public Office Acts.  Amendment No. 30 goes on to insert a new subsection (4) in section 16 that will facilitate the provision of information to the authority and the Minister and also, where the information may relate to the commission of an indictable offence, to other public authorities such as the Garda, the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Central Bank and the Revenue Commissioners.  Amendment No. 107 deletes paragraph 11 of Schedule 5, which applies section 15 to the appeal board.  It is no longer required following the deletion of section 15.</P>
      <P>I should also explain that amendment No. 29 is a technical amendment that replaces the reference in section 16(2) to a &ldquo;fine not exceeding &euro;5,000&rdquo; with &ldquo;a class A fine&rdquo;.  This is necessitated by the coming into force of the Fines Act 2010 on 4 January last.  Under Part 2 of that Act, summary fines must in future be specified not in monetary terms but by reference to five new classes of fines, that is, classes A to E.  For this reason, all references to fines up to &euro;5,000 have been replaced with a reference to a &ldquo;Class A&rdquo; fine.  These changes have been made by amendments 42, 50, 51, 55 to 57, inclusive, 60, 65, 67, 69, 70 and 84.</P>

      <P>This group of amendments, with the exception of amendment No. 111, relate to Part 3 of the Bill, which establishes the future licensing system for property services providers, that is, auctioneers, letting agents and property management agents.  Amendment No. 43 ensures that the public will have online access to the register of licensees which will be established and maintained by the authority.  That is important.  Amendments Nos. 44 and 48 are technical changes made following consultations with Chartered Accountants Ireland.  Amendment No. 49 clarifies that a licensee having a place of business must display a copy of the licence at that place of business.  Amendment No. 111, which amends the Social Welfare <Col N="295" />Consolidation Act 2005, permits the authority to request individuals applying for licences to supply their PPS numbers on the licence application forms.  This will help to ensure that a rejected applicant will not be successful in applying for a licence under another name on another occasion.</P>

      <P>This group of amendments relates to Part 5, which provides for the regulation of client accounts and related matters, and the principal changes are in amendments Nos. 52 and 54.  Amendment No. 52 takes account of the fact that not all accountants are auditors by inserting a specific reference to &ldquo;a duly qualified accountant&rdquo;.  Section 48 of the Bill made it an offence for a licensee to lodge moneys to an account other than a client account.  However, property management agents routinely collect service charges and sinking fund contributions on behalf of owners&rsquo; management companies and deposit the funds into the companies&rsquo; accounts.  Amendment No. 54 makes provision for this practice.  Amendment No. 53 is a consequential amendment.</P>

      <P>The fifth group deals with Part 6, amendments Nos. 6 and 58, 59 and 61 to 63, inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This group of amendments, with the exception of amendment No. 6, relates to Part 6 which contains general provisions to the sale and letting of land.  There are five substantive amendments in this group, amendments Nos. 6, 59 and 61 to 63, inclusive.  Amendment No. 61 is the most notable change.  It inserts a new section 60 that addresses the potentially serious conflict of interests which can arise where an auctioneer promotes an apparently attractive loan package to intending purchasers without revealing that the financial institution providing the loan has already funded the development or is prepared to do so in cases where the property is being sold from the plans.  This conflict of interest can arise in particular in the case of multi-unit developments where a particular financial institution has links with the developer and it seeks to reduce its exposure to risk by assembling what appears to be an attractive loan package for intending purchasers.  Purchasers who avail of the package may then end up paying over the odds for the property.</P>
      <P>If such an arrangement had been in place during the property boom, it may have provided real protection for many of those who currently find themselves in negative equity.  Essentially, it would have required a declaration of interests to be made, which may have warned individuals to be more careful than they necessarily were in the borrowing of funds, particularly those offered at 100% of the price of a property, before entering into transactions.  There are tens of thousands of people who unknowingly obtained loans through financial institutions without knowing that those institutions were the bodies funding the original development.  That certainly applied to many multi-unit developments and apartments, and it applied in many instances to newer housing estates.  No real due diligence was ever undertaken by the financial institution as to whether the loan sought for a particular property was based on the property genuinely providing proper security, having regard to the price at which the property was sold and the loan sought.  The new section will ensure transparency in such cases in future and thereby improve consumer protection.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of the new section 60 prohibits a licensee from providing information, advice or assistance concerning a lending institution&rsquo;s willingness to provide a mortgage to a purchaser of residential property unless the vendor &mdash; in other words, the builder or developer &mdash; has advised the licensee whether that lending institution has provided, or intends to provide, a loan <Col N="296" />for the development or construction of the property.  The licensee must then inform the purchaser whether the lending institution has been involved in funding the development.  This provision will apply to persons who develop or build residential properties on a commercial basis and not to private persons selling their own homes.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 extends the definition of &ldquo;improper conduct&rdquo; in section 2 to include a contravention of the new disclosure requirement by a licensee.  It means that a contravention may result in imposition by the authority of an appropriate sanction on the licensee.  Section 59 of the Bill provides that where land is offered for sale by auction, the vendor cannot bid at the auction or have someone else bid on his or her behalf.  Amendment No. 59 provides that this prohibition will not apply where land is being sold by auction on foot of a court order under the Family Law Act 1995 or the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.  This prohibition will not apply where land is being sold by auction on foot of a court order under the Family Law Act 1995 or the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.  This will continue to allow a joint owner estranged spouse to bid for the property being sold under a court order following judicial separation or divorce, but the new provisions will make it unlawful for an auctioneer or estate agent to arrange for somebody to bid for a property, who has no real interest in acquiring it, for no reason other than to inflate the price that might be obtained for that property.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 58 is a consequential amendment.  Amendment No. 62 extends the authority&rsquo;s regulation making powers to permit it to make regulations relating to booking deposits for the letting of land.  Section 62(1)(<i>b</i>) already gave the authority this power with regard to sales of land.  Amendment 63 makes specific provision for indictable offences in the case of breaches of regulations made under section 62; section 62(4) originally made provision only for summary offences.</P>

These changes are intended to protect the compensation fund against dishonest claims.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Schedule 6 provides that the authority may borrow for the compensation fund.  Amendment No. 108 makes this borrowing power subject to the approval, in the first instance, of the Minister for Justice and Equality and then of the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance.  This is a standard provision in respect of the borrowing powers of public bodies.Amendment No. 109 imposes an obligation on the authority to keep proper accounts in respect of the compensation fund and provides that the accounts shall be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very significant group of amendments which gives the Property Services Regulatory Authority additional statutory responsibilities for publishing residential property sales prices and maintaining a new commercial leases database.  Arising from data protection concerns, the sale prices of residential property have not been published for some time.  To address this lacuna, amendment No. 24 gives the new authority the statutory function of publishing residential property sales prices while amendment No. 79 inserts a new section 86 which contains more detailed provisions.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of the new section provides for the maintenance and publication of particulars of residential property sales prices, including the address of the property, the price paid and the date of the sale, by the authority.  The published data will not contain the vendor&rsquo;s name.  Subsection (2) provides that the sales data may relate to sales which have taken place prior to enactment of this legislation.  Subsection (3) requires the authority to make the data available to the public free of charge on its web site.  The data relating to sales prices will be provided to the authority by the Revenue Commissioners who are already in receipt of this information for stamp duty purposes.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 110 amends the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to enable the Revenue Commissioners to provide the data to the authority.  Amendment No. 17 inserts a definition of &ldquo;residential property&rdquo; into section 2.  Amendments Nos. 80 and 81, which insert new sections 87 and 88 into the Bill, give effect to a recommendation which was contained in the August 2010 report of the working group on transparency in commercial rent reviews.  It recommended the establishment of a public database which would include relevant details of commercial letting agreements and rent reviews.  Related changes are provided for in amendments Nos. 1, 16 and 24.</P>
      <P Just="Left">From a policy perspective, the primary purpose of the database is to ensure that accurate information will be available to assist in ensuring that rent review assessments are based upon true comparisons of rent levels. The availability of such information should impact favourably on the conduct of rent reviews and also on the operation of the letting market itself.  The establishment and maintenance of the database is prescribed as a function of the authority in amendment No. 24.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 80 inserts section 87, subsection (1) of which mandates the authority to establish and maintain the commercial leases database as soon as practicable after the commencement of the section.  Subsection (2) provides that the database shall be in such form as the authority sees fit, and sets out the information which it is to contain.  Certain basic details such as the date of the lease and the term of years of the lease will be provided by the Revenue Commissioners.  Additional information will be provided by the tenant within a specific period of time.  That information is set out in subsection (1) of section 88.</P>
      <P>While, in general, the database will only contain information about leases entered into on or after the commencement of section 87, subsections (3) and (4) provide that it may contain basic information about leases which are entered into no more than five years prior to such commencement.  Subsection (5) specifies that the database is to be made available for inspection on payment of the appropriate fee, as defined in section 2.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 81 inserts section 88.  Subsection (1) obliges the tenant, or their authorised representative, to provide certain information to the authority within the relevant period immediately following the day on which a stamp certificate is received from the Revenue <Col N="298" />Commissioners.  That period may be prescribed by regulations.  In the absence of any regulations it will amount to 30 days, as provided for in subsection (6).  The information is to be provided in a form to be specified by the authority.  Subsection (2) concerns the additional information which may need to be forwarded when the rent is reviewed.  It relates to matters such as the availability of rent-free periods, any fitting out time allowed, any fit out allowances that might be granted and any capital contributions that may be made in respect of the property.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Provision is also made to ensure that relevant information is provided for the authority when the rent has been reviewed.  It will be open to the authority to prescribe further particulars by regulations in addition to those set out in the section and this will be a useful tool in enabling the authority to respond in a flexible way in the event that it becomes desirable to expand the range of data to be made available to interested parties.  Subsection (3) provides a mechanism to ensure that the authority will be informed when a tenant ceases to have an interest in a property which is the subject of a commercial lease.</P>
      <P>A particular problem which arises in the context of rent reviews relates to the impact which confidentiality clauses have in relation to the free flow of information.  It would seem to be the case that such clauses are being relied upon to conceal information about the true market rent for the transaction.  This relates to the fact that the true value of the rent agreed, when all relevant factors and concessions are taken into account, may differ significantly from the rent level appearing on the face of the lease.  It would be completely counter-productive if confidentiality clauses were allowed to influence the range of information provided to the authority.  Accordingly, provision has been made in subsection (4) which ensures that the tenant&rsquo;s obligation to provide additional information will apply irrespective of any confidentiality clause that might be contained within the lease.  Subsection (5) provides that a person who contravenes subsections (1), (2) or (3) is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a class A fine.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As I indicated, amendment 110 amends the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to enable the Revenue Commissioners to provide data to the new authority.  Amendment No. 110 also introduces a new section 137C into the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to provide for the furnishing by the Revenue Commissioners to the Valuation Office of such information as may be required by that office in the performance of its statutory functions.  The core business of the Valuation Office is the provision of accurate, up-to-date valuations of commercial and industrial properties for ratepayers and rating authorities and it is engaged in an important programme for revaluation of commercial and industrial properties throughout the country.  The Valuation Office also provides a valuation consultancy service for other Departments, local authorities, health boards and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P Just="Left">To carry out its functions effectively, it is essential that it has as much information as possible on market values and rents in property transactions, all the more so given recent price movement, volatility and difficult trading conditions in the property sector.  Much of the required information is available as it is included in returns made to the Revenue Commissioners under their e-stamping system.  Copies of what is called their &ldquo;Particulars Delivered&rdquo; forms were up to recent years made available to the Valuation Office by the Revenue Commissioners but this practice was discontinued because of concerns relating to data protection legislation and specific statutory provision is required to allow the practice to resume.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The transparency now provided with regard to the purchase price of residential property, that is also now provided for the rental payments under commercial leases, is delivering on promises made in the programme for Government.  These substantial reforms are in the public interest to provide much needed transparency in dealing with property transactions.  In the <Col N="299" />context of current difficulties with regard to commercial leases, it provides much needed transparency in order that individual tenants seeking to have rental reviews undertaken and those entering new leases for commercial premises have full and comprehensive access to information about rents payable for comparable properties operating on the street or area in which an individual hopes to establish, or has, a business and comparators from other parts of the country that are of direct relevance to any new commercial rental undertaken.</P>

      <P Just="Left">This is important legislation.  I thank the Minister for introducing it.  It is good to see that the D&aacute;il made so many amendments, many of which originated in this House.  I was particularly pleased with section 60.  During the boom, it is clear that banks were bankrolling the large developers and also providing funds for those buying houses and apartments.  There was a clear conflict of interest, which this section eliminates.  It is something I hope will never again happen.  The banks were bankrolling people who are now bankrupt and also providing money to buyers and there was a conflict of interest.  The interest of the banks was mainly to make sure the big guy got bigger while Joe Soap was a pawn in the game.  We had a comprehensive debate in this House already and I studied the amendments made in the D&aacute;il.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmBurke">
      <NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The availability of information is very relevant.  Some months ago, an agent was giving evidence on behalf of the landlord in a case concerning the entitlement to a new lease on Grafton Street, where the rent under the former lease was &euro;468,000 a year.  When the question was put to the agent on when he last let property on Grafton Street in the previous 30 years, he did not give an answer.  When the question was put to him again, he said that he had never let property in Grafton Street.  As a result, the High Court disregarded his evidence and reduced the rent to &euro;215,000.  This is a question of relevant information in assisting people in coming to a decision.  This was a case where the lease had expired and entitlement to a new lease was at issue.  This highlights the importance of having information available.</P>
      <P>Although it is not referred to in this legislation, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan referred to packages being available to purchasers by developers.  There was also a procedure where certain solicitors were listed to act for purchasers, which caused conflict.  I also have an issue with Chinese walls within legal practices and I think it should be examined.  The ordinary consumer is competing with the commercial builder and it must be examined in the long term.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s point about advertising packages.  I welcome this important change in the legislation, which is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their assistance and co-operation.  I appreciate that the amendments are of a technical nature, not only in the context of their impact on this Bill but also how they translate to other items of legislation that required amendment.  Many of the amendments were designed to introduce much-needed transparency and confidence in order to revive the residential and commercial property markets.  The lack of transparency in the absence of proper consumer protection standards contributed in a substantial way to the problems in recent years.  It is regrettable that the type of consumer protection measures we <Col N="300" />are now enacting were not in place.  There was a substantial conflict of interest, as Senator O&rsquo;Donovan put it, not just in the conduct of financial institutions but also of some auctioneers and estate agents, particularly those who specialised in apartment sales and who were recruited by developers in to sell properties in some of the large new estates.  This was perfectly legitimate but, together with the developer and the financial institutions, they sought to get the financial institution that was funding the developer to put seemingly attractive financial packages in place to facilitate purchasers who gave very little real thought as to whether the price of residential property was a realistic or reasonable price.  They were generally of the belief that, once they were able to get a mortgage, some objective and reasonable assessment had been undertaken by the mortgage provider of the price on offer and the appropriateness of providing the funding.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>We had a property Ponzi scheme with financial institutions, developers and some auctioneers sitting on top of the scheme circulating money and selling property at inflated prices to unsuspecting and inexperienced young people who felt that if they did not get on the property ladder they would never have their own home.  The most disgraceful aspect of this was when individuals were in cahoots, with announcements that 30 apartments or houses would be put on the market at a particular price one morning and people queued overnight to buy property at exorbitant prices.  When the 30 units were sold, they would announce the glad tidings that another 100 would be made available that afternoon at increased prices.  From Friday morning to Friday afternoon, properties on the market had increased in price by &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000.  I hope we never see that time again and the measures in this legislation will provide some protection for that.  It is also important that the new statutory requirement for auctioneers requires them to publish realistic advised market values of properties for sale rather than using the discredited guide price mechanism.  Together with the recent budget measures, this will reassure consumers and boost consumer confidence.  The new requirement on auctioneers is very important in seeking to restore overall confidence in the property market.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Earlier this week I published advertisements inviting expressions of interest from suitably qualified members of the public who wish to be considered for appointment to the new authority in the context of the approach taken by Government.  The advertisements are on my Department&rsquo;s website as well as on the website of the Public Appointments Service and the closing date for submission of expressions of interest is 21 December.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As regards the new licensing arrangements, a number of regulations specifying the required education and training standards and levels of professional indemnity insurance will have to be made by the authority.  The existing licences of auctioneers and letting agents remain valid until 30 June next.  However, property management agents are not subject to any licensing arrangement and I would expect that the authority will give immediate priority to the introduction of much needed standards in this segment of the property services sector.  New licensing arrangements for such agents will complement the provisions of the Multi-Unit Developments Act, which entered into force earlier this year and enhanced protection levels for apartment owners.</P>

      <P LI="4">(iii) was necessary to prevent the commission of a crime or to effect, or assist in effecting, a lawful arrest.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment was tabled by my party on both Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il, as I am sure the Minister is aware, and I mentioned this in my contribution on Second Stage yesterday.  The amendment, in deciding if it is justified to use force, sets a two prong test comprising subjective and objective elements.  The Bill states the use of force against the trespasser will be lawful when the occupier honestly believes the trespasser is on the property to commit a crime and force is necessary to protect the occupier, another person or the property.  Going back to my earlier point, it may not matter if the force can be justified or not if the person honestly believed it was reasonable in the circumstances.  To satisfy the objective tests on whether an individual honestly believed the force used was reasonable, a jury will be asked to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds after taking into account all relevant circumstances.  I said on Second Stage that it is my view that the lack of reference in the Bill to proportionality, necessity and imminence risks the objective test as set out in the Bill potentially not being robust enough.  I hope the Minister appreciates the point being made.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the objective test as set out does not comply with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  I would like to quote some of the Minister&rsquo;s contributions on the Bill.  On this amendment, he said:</P>
      <P LI="1">In addition, the approach in the Bill reflects the well known judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in DPP <i>v</i>. Barnes.  The test of reasonableness in fact incorporates elements such as imminence, necessity and proportionality, which are referred to in the amendment.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="5">I appreciate the purpose of the amendment might be to tighten up the circumstances in which force can be used [but] it is unlikely that an amendment would have the effect of imposing additional tests to those already prescribed in the Bill.</P>
      <Col N="302" />
      <P FLI="0">The Minister finished by saying:</P>
      <P LI="1">The Bill is based on the approach of reasonableness [that] already incorporates elements such as necessity, imminence and proportionality.  If, for example, an action is taken that is not disproportionate, it is highly likely [when] taking all factors into account, that it would be considered reasonable.</P>
      <P FLI="0">When we reflect on what was said in the D&aacute;il, it seems this was the Minister&rsquo;s objection to the amendment but there seems to be contradiction in what he is saying.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated, as I have quoted, that the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment which adds the elements of imminence, necessity and proportionality would have the effect of prescribing additional tests to that of reasonableness.  He then went on to say that the test of reasonableness already incorporates the elements of imminence, necessity and proportionality.  If that is the case, and they are already incorporated, then what is the problem with the amendment we have tabled?  We are trying to bring certainty to this because we are concerned about the implications of the non-acceptance of this amendment.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister made the point that acceptance of this amendment could impose additional tests.  We questioned this in the D&aacute;il, but received no response.  What additional tests is the Minister referring to?  What inference did he draw from acceptance of our amendment?  I look forward to his response.</P>

What I thoroughly enjoyed in the Minister&rsquo;s speech yesterday was learning about the &ldquo;castle doctrine&rdquo; when he quoted from the body of law, dating from 1604, the American case in 1825  and the York summer assizes in 1828 &ldquo;for a man&rsquo;s house is his castle&rdquo;.  From time immemorial this concept has beenincorporated in the body of law and with the passage of time the law could have become much stronger in defence of the home.

      <P Just="Left">I thank Senator Cullinane for tabling an amendment because it gives us an opportunity to review again the issues that were discussed in the D&aacute;il.  They were discussed by the Law Reform Commission as to whether the imminence test should be explicitly stated.  I am satisfied that it is enough when one reads the totality of section 2, in particular subsection (4), as set out.  Using the formulation that the courts and juries are familiar with, in the practice of using another context, they are looking at the subjective belief of the person as <Col N="303" />set out in subsection (1), the belief that the other person has entered the dwelling as a trespasser, etc., and the belief that the force used is reasonable in the circumstances.  Subsection (4) gives the additional provisos that the court or jury in considering whether the person honestly held the belief must have regard to the presence or absence of reasonable grounds and all other relevant circumstances.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Those other relevant circumstances must encompass the other issues of imminence and of necessity that were set out by the Law Reform Commission.  I know that the language is somewhat different from that in the Law Reform Commission report.  The latter report is a report on defences and the Bill which it produced, which I thought was a very sensible Bill, seeks to set out and codify common law defences generally, not just the very specific defence of self-defence in the home, as this Bill does.  It is an opportunity to make the more general point, that we have made before, and to which the Minister referred yesterday, which is the need for codification of criminal law generally, that we have so many vital principles of criminal law, including the Dwyer halfway house, to which I referred yesterday, which are not set out in statute.  The 1997 Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act set out for the first time a statutory formulation of the legitimate defence principles and the principles of self-defence.  However, as Mr. Justice Hardiman noted in  DPP <i>v.</i> Barnes, there was always a difference of interpretation as to whether that applied to unlawful killing because the Act is about non-fatal offences.  There was always that slight doubt and Mr. Justice Hardiman in that judgment clarifies to a great extent the law on self defence, where it applies in cases of unlawful killing and where it applies in the home.  I am satisfied that those elements are contained in the current formulation, particularly in section 2(4).  I know that Senator Cullinane is seeking to amend section 2(1) but if we look at the totality of section 2, we can see that the test for the court, or in the case of a jury, the test in subsection (4) is more nuanced.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the test, as set out in the legislation, will be adequate and robust enough.  Senator Bacik referred to the Law Reform Commission paper of 2006, which criticised the existing standard.  We argue, that by extension, that would apply to the new Bill.  The Law Reform Commission argued for a four part test.  If I may repeat what I said during the Second Stage debate, it called for the following: a focusing on threshold, whether the threat was sufficient to warrant a response; imminence, whether the threat was close and impending; necessity, whether force was necessary to protect persons or property; and proportionality, whether the force used was proportionate to the threat.  What the Law Reform Commission called for is different from the tests set out in the Bill.  I am curious as to why the Law Reform Commission standard has not been accepted by the Minister.</P>

      <Col N="304" />
      <P Just="Left">I wish to refer to an article in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> on the Bill because I am anxious to ensure that no member of the public is in any way misled as to the objective or purpose of the Bill and how it will apply.  The story in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>was a very fair account of yesterday&rsquo;s proceedings in the Seanad.  I welcome the fact that what was discussed yesterday in the Seanad was reported.  What was written was a very accurate account of the proceedings but unfortunately the headline to the story read &ldquo;Bill to give homeowners right to kill intruders&rdquo;, which did not reflect the substance of what was in the story, which was accurate.  It gives the wrong impression entirely about the purpose and effect of the Bill.  It gives rise to an impression which certainly is not the intent of the Bill, namely, that a homeowner who discovers an intruder can simply kill him or her.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is very important that a message goes out from the Government and from this House that this is not what the Bill permits, and that in no circumstances would the current Government or the previous Government or any Government enact legislation in the State which contained such a provision.  It is unfair to the reporter, who wrote a very good and succinct piece about the content of the Bill, that his article was given that headline.  My officials have written to the editor of the <i>Irish Examiner </i>to clarify that the Bill does not confer on homeowners a right to kill intruders.  The letter notes that the Bill is in no way an encouragement or licence for unwarranted violence as it is subject to the requirement that any force used is reasonable and for defensive purposes in the context of a person in a dwelling.    The very particular point is that any force that is used should be used &ldquo;for defensive purposes&rdquo; and based on the individual home occupier&rsquo;s perception of the circumstances.  The response of the home occupier to the intruder must be objectively reasonable.  That incorporates Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s concerns about &ldquo;imminent&rdquo; necessity, etc.  The proportionality of the response, based on the home occupier&rsquo;s perception of the circumstances, is part of the reasonableness test.  The letter also clarifies that the Bill acknowledges that reasonable force used in defence of the home may result in a death, unfortunately.  As I recollect it, that was referred to by Mr. Justice Hardiman in the Barnes case.  No one should believe that this Bill confers a right on anybody to end the life of another person.  To put it simply, the Bill recognises the rights of householders who set out to defend, rather than those who set out to kill.  It is important to clarify that.  The report in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> accurately reflected the substance of the debate.  I hope it will use the opportunity presented to it by what I have said to correct its headline tomorrow, in order that people are not misled into believing this Bill provides some sort of licence to kill.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment specifically on the amendment that has been moved by Senator Cullinane.  As he rightly noted, the amendment was also tabled on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  It appears its aim is to ensure the concepts of imminence and proportionality are added to the test of reasonableness that is already provided for in the Bill.  The concept of reasonable force is well known in our law and its interpretation by the courts.  As I have already mentioned, it encompasses the concepts of necessity, imminence and proportionality.  That is evident from the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s analysis in its discussion paper and in the report the Senator has mentioned.  It is also clear from the 1994 judgment in the case of DPP <i>v.</i> Clarke, which was reported on page 298 of Vol. 3 of <i>Irish Reports</i> of that year.  In addition, the approach in the Bill reflects the test set out in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in DPP <i>v.</i> Barnes, which is the case to which we keep referring, and in the judgment of the European Court on Human Rights in the Giuliani case.  The main difficulty with the amendment is not that it would alter the reasonableness test.  If one changes the words, one changes their meaning.  If this Bill were amended as the Senator proposes, it would not embody the reasonableness <Col N="305" />test that is embodied in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 under common law.  As I have said, the test incorporates the concepts of necessity, imminence and proportionality, while allowing a broader, rounded and objective consideration of the circumstances of each case.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Senator is right to say that during the Second Stage debate on this Bill in the D&aacute;il, as Opposition spokesperson on justice I raised the question of whether the provisions contained in the Bill were consistent with judgments delivered in the European Court on Human Rights.  I did not do so because I believed the previous Government was trying to violate human rights, or the previous Minister was trying to do so.  I did so because I was anxious to ensure we did not fall foul, by accident, of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  When Fine Gael was in opposition, it spent many years seeking the introduction of the measures contained in this Bill.  This matter was the subject of two Private Members&rsquo; Bills.  I did not want to see a Government Bill, which covered similar ground to our Private Members&rsquo; Bills, to fall foul of a judgment in the European Court on Human Rights.  For that reason, I had the issue examined by the Office of the Attorney General after I became Minister for Justice and Equality.  Consideration was given to it.  We have received clear advice to the effect that the Bill, as framed, fulfils our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and is consistent with judgments delivered by the European Court on Human Rights in Strasbourg.  It is important to highlight this.</P>
      <P>I appreciate this amendment was tabled with good intention.  A problem arises when one moves from the concept of reasonableness, which has been applied by our courts, is understood and has been addressed in significant written judgments.  The Senator wondered why I phrased things as I did in the quote he read.  Even though reasonableness incorporates these concepts, the problem is that if one changes the test in the manner suggested by the Senator, it ispossible that the courts will move into another area of interpretation.  There is a need for consistency in the reasonableness test.  The concept of reasonableness was covered in the earlier non-fatal assaults legislation that has been mentioned.  There needs to be consistencybetween this legislation and the other legislation.  The Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 embodies the reasonableness test.  It is important that the 1997 Act and this Bill are clearly consistent.  There does not appear to be a difference between the tests that are applied in both instances.  As I have said, I am reasonably satisfied, on the basis of the advice that is available and the case law that has been mentioned, that the three concepts for which the Senator wants to make express provision are covered in the reasonableness test as itstands.</P>

The law, as set out in the Barnes case, clearly does not give a householder any right to kill a burglar simply for being a burglar.  However, it sets out the principles under which a householder is entitled to <Col N="306" />defend his or her home and provides that the householder is under no obligation to retreat.  All of us are in agreement that the headline in question is misleading.  The true import of the Bill is as set out on the record of this House yesterday.</P>

    <P Just="Left">Question, &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand,&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane">
      <NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, lines 10 and 11, to delete subsection (7) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(7) Notwithstanding the provisions set out in Section 2, the use of force shall exclude the use of force causing death except in circumstances where it is absolutely necessary.</P>
      <P LI="2">(8) Notwithstanding the provisions set out in Section 2, the defence of private property shall not be a legitimate reason for the use of fatal force.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I will focus on the proposal in this amendment to introduce two new subsections.  Section 2(11) provides that &ldquo;for the avoidance of doubt, a reference in this section to property includes, unless the context otherwise requires, a reference to a dwelling&rdquo;.  Clearly, a &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; is an individual&rsquo;s property.  In our view, the Bill as it stands allows for the lethal use of force in defence of private property.  That is my understanding.  I await clarification from the Minister.  Senator Bacik may have unintentionally spoken about a different aspect of this matter in her reply.  She referred to the defence of one&rsquo;s home but I understand this is a question of the defence of one&rsquo;s life, or the lives of others in one&rsquo;s dwelling or property.  I hope it is not a question of the defence of the property itself.  That distinction is at the heart of this amendment.  We need absolute clarity and certainty in this regard.  The purpose of the Bill is to recognise the special position of the dwelling in law, as recognised by common law; as explained in some detail by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the Barnes case, which has been alluded to on a number of occasions and, not least, as embedded in the Constitution, Article 40.5 of which guarantees that &ldquo;the dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While Sinn F&eacute;in does not dispute the constitutional inviolability of the dwelling, we dispute the ability of a person to be able to take the life of another person in defence of his or her dwelling.  The Bill clearly permits the use of lethal force in cases in which there is a threat to private property.  It is not correct to place the same value on life as on bricks and mortar.  The amendment would not prevent someone from taking reasonable and necessary action to defend himself or herself or other persons.  Its purpose is to prevent a person from using lethal force where the risk is simply to bricks and mortar.  I do not claim &mdash; nor is it the intention of the amendment to preclude all such scenarios &mdash; that a person cannot use lethal force in certain circumstances.  However, when such force is used, there must be a threat to the life of a person, a person&rsquo;s family or an individual who resides or is present in a private property and not only a threat to the private property.  I await the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik">

      <P>Senator Cullinane indicated I used the term &ldquo;defence of the dwelling&rdquo;.  If I did so, I apologise as I meant to use the words &ldquo;defence in the dwelling&rdquo;.  The Bill relates to the justifiable use of force, the defence that is commonly referred to as &ldquo;self-defence&rdquo;, within the dwelling.</P>
      <Col N="307" />
      <P>A person&rsquo;s dwelling is at all times the setting in which acts to which the Bill refers take place.  While he or she may not own the property, he or she will be the lawful occupant, whether a tenant or householder.  The point is that he or she is in his or her dwelling when he or she uses the force that is justified through the operation of the defence provided for in the legislation.  This is what distinguishes the action from the protection of property in a vacuum.  We are not talking about someone who is acting simply to protect a warehouse that he or she owns or a premises in which he or she has some form of commercial interest.</P>
      <P>The key point is that the property is the dwelling and the Bill makes specific rules based on the common law and the law as set out in the Barnes case and dating back to the expression of the castle doctrine, about which Senator Paul Coghlan spoke, in the context of the use of force within a dwelling by a person who is seeking to protect himself or herself or another person, as set out in section 2.  That is the setting provided for in the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">The same amendment was proposed and rejected on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  I must oppose the amendment once again as it fails to take proper account of the wider provisions of the Bill.  As I said in the Report Stage debate in the D&aacute;il, subsection (7) does not stand in isolation.  Section 2(1)(<i>b</i>) is very clear when it states &ldquo;the force used is only such as is reasonable&rdquo;.  That is the objective test to which I referred.  A jury or court will ultimately determine whether the force used is reasonable.  Strong force would only be reasonable to use in the circumstances where the threat warranted it.  Clearly, no one would deem it reasonable to fire a shotgun at a young boy where it was clear that his only object was to rob an apple from a tree in a garden.  The aspect of the amendment which would introduce a new subsection (8) would defeat the entire purpose of the Bill, which is to recognise the special status of the dwelling.  The amendment also overlooks subsection (11), which states: &ldquo;For the avoidance of doubt, a reference in this section to property includes, unless the context otherwise requires, a reference to a dwelling.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill, as it stands, does not allow for the use of lethal force in defence of private property <i>per se.</i>  Its purpose is to recognise the special position of the dwelling in law, as recognised by the common law, confirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the Barnes case and, not least, embodied in the Constitution, which guarantees in Article 40.5 that the dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.</P>
      <P>There are some issues arising from the Barnes case of which it is worth reminding the House.  First, the court in question made it clear that a person cannot lose his or her life simply because he or she trespassed in another dwelling house with intent to steal.  Second, it made it clear that the offence of burglary committed in a dwelling house is always an act of aggression and an attack on the personal rights of the citizen.  Third, the court made it clear that although the dwelling house is property, it is wrong to equate it with other forms of property as it has a higher level of legality and constitutionality.  Senators must also keep in mind that the reasonable force permitted to be used by the Bill is that used in the context of the dwelling.  Section 2(1) clearly refers to a person who is in his or her dwelling or a person who is a lawful occupant in a dwelling.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment as proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane">
      <NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I return to what is stated in the text as I do not agree with the Minister&rsquo;s analysis.  In reference to the justifiable use of force, section 2(1)(<i>b</i>)(ii) states a person may use such force &ldquo;to protect his or her property or the property of another person from appropriation, destruction or damage caused by a criminal act&rdquo;, while section 2(7) states: &ldquo;The use of force shall not exclude the use of force causing death.&rdquo;  It is clear from my reading of the text that the legislation permits the use of lethal force in the defence of property without <Col N="308" />an accompanying threat to the life of a person.  That is my understanding and for this reason I will press the amendment if the Minister is not in a position to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik">
      <NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer Senator Cullinane to the consultation paper of the Law Reform Commission published in 2006, which was before the decision in the Barnes case.  Setting out the law then, the commission makes a clear distinction between what force a person is allowed to use in the defence of personal property, on which it stated that for the most part it has been accepted that lethal defensive force may not be used to defend personal property, and what force may be used within one&rsquo;s dwelling house.  The report does not recommend any upper limit to be placed on the force that may be used to defend one&rsquo;s dwelling house.  It refers to the common law and castle doctrine to make the point that the dwelling house is a different setting from other forms of private property and, as such, different tests apply.  As we heard, Mr. Justice Hardiman set out clearly the special status of the dwelling house in his judgment in Barnes in which he distinguished between defence of the dwelling house and other property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter">
      <NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">To come back to the section, the point I made was that one cannot take a subsection in isolation and apply a substantive meaning to it that is out of sync with the rest of the legislation.  I draw again to the Senator&rsquo;s attention subsection (7) which states: &ldquo;The use of force shall not exclude the use of force causing death.&rdquo;  The subsection makes clear that there may be a circumstance in which the force used may cause death but if force is used which causes death, it must be reasonable in the circumstances.  This then begs the question as to what are the circumstances.  In the context of dealing with the matter section 2(1)(<i>b</i>) sets out the circumstances as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;the force used is only such as is reasonable in the circumstances as he or she believes them to be&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="2">(i) to protect himself or herself or another person present in the dwelling from injury, assault, detention or death caused by a criminal act,</P>
      <P LI="2">(ii) to protect his or her property or the property of another person from appropriation, destruction or damage caused by a criminal act, or</P>
      <P LI="2">(iii) to prevent the commission of a crime or to effect, or assist in effecting, a lawful arrest.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0">The force used must be such as is reasonable in the circumstances.  If one takes it that the force may include force causing death, it is not suggested, for example, that in all circumstances it would be reasonable to use lethal force to prevent the commission of a crime or effect a lawful arrest.  No one is suggesting that it would be reasonable for a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in circumstances in which a person starts running away when the garda attempts to make an arrest, to simply reach for a gun and kill the person.  That would clearly not be reasonable.  Equally no one is suggesting, based on this, that if someone enters a home, takes a bucketful of a coal and is walking down the garden with the coal bucket, it would be reasonable for the homeowner to shoot that person or kill him or her by other means.  While there may be a circumstance in which it is reasonable that someone loses his or her life, such circumstances will be of extremity where the reasonable test would address the issues to which the Senator referred, namely, imminence, necessity and proportionality.</P>
      <P>Imminence, necessity and proportionality would not apply, for example, to kill people because they are walking out the door with some piece of antique jewellery.  One may want to <Col N="309" />chase them down the garden to retrieve one&rsquo;s jewellery but certainly one could not take out the gun and kill them as that would be a disproportionate response.</P>
      
      <P Just="Left">
        The reality is that this issue is adequately addressed.  What the Senator has said in regard to his amendment would only have any real application if subsection (7) was in place on its own without the reasonable test and if it was seen as an invitation to people to do what we all agree the legislation does not do &mdash; it does not give a right to anybody to use lethal force.  It simply allows people to take action in defence and the action must be reasonable.  The reasonableness test incorporates concepts of imminence, proportionality and necessity and has regard to the overall circumstances being the subjective understanding of the circumstances by the individual whose home has been invaded.  Ultimately, their reaction is judged by the objective criteria.</P>
