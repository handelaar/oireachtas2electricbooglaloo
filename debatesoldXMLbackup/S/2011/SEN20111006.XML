	<P>I have received notice from Senator Thomas Byrne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Finance to discuss the need to amend NAMA legislation to ensure borrowers will be forced to pay NAMA what they previously owed to their banks.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator David Cullinane of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to discuss the decision not to locate the administrative centre of the new amalgamated VEC of south east Waterford in the gateway city of the region and the process by which this decision was reached.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ivana Bacik of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to provide a specific date when the unacceptable detention of children in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution will be ended; and if there is to be a further delay in achieving this, that at the very least children detained there will be given access to the complaints mechanism of the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday An Bord Plean&aacute;la gave final approval for metro north, a crucially important piece of infrastructure that has been at the planning stage for a number of years.  Land has been purchased and &euro;80 million has been spent on the project.  It would create 6,000 construction jobs and has the potential to create 37,000 permanent jobs post construction.  Given An Bord Plean&aacute;la has sanctioned final approval, will the Government reaffirm the commitment of the Fine Gael deputy leader who said the project would deliver 37,000 jobs <Col N="618"/>in the economic corridor along the proposed metro north route?  The Minister for Social Protection referred to the project as a &ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo;.  I agree with them but all the decisions on capital projects have been kicked into a review.  The Government gave firm commitments on this project, which is crucial infrastructure not only for Dublin city, but also for the north east.  Since approval has been given, can the Deputy Leader confirm that metro north will be given the go ahead in line with the commitments given to the electorate prior to the general election?  Will the Government see that through?</P>
        <P>Every day the EU-IMF deal is mentioned and I raised this with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources yesterday when discussing the Government&rsquo;s proposed sale of State assets.  Can the Deputy Leader confirm that in the memorandum of understanding with the previous Government, no commitment was given to sell State assets?  The revised memorandum published in July states, &ldquo;The Government will consider options for an ambitious programme of asset disposal&rdquo;, and yesterday in the D&aacute;il the Minister for Finance confirmed to my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, that no figure was included in the original MOU for the sale of State assets and that the Government parties included a figure of &euro;2 billion in the programme for Government.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to be sure my colleagues across the House are aware of this in order that they can get it clear in their heads and can ask the Minister about this.  We will not listen every day to statements that the Government&rsquo;s hands are tied in regard to the sale of State assets; they are not.  My party is opposed to the sale of strategic State assets such as the ESB, which we discussed yesterday.  I will ask the Minister for Finance about this later.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Does the Senator have a question for the Deputy Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked the Deputy Leader to confirm that it is correct that no commitment or figure was given in the original deal with the troika by the previous Government to dispose of State assets and that this is a new departure and new policy by the Government to sell off the family silver.</P>
        <P>With regard to the pension levy and the raid on private pensions, the Government has raised &euro;461 million from the savings of normal men and women and we have witnessed the effect that has had on pension schemes such as the airline and Tara Mines pension schemes where annuitants have had their pensions reduced by 10%.  Will the Deputy Leader confirm that the cost of the measures in the jobs initiative was &euro;255 million and that the pension levy was a tax raising measure with an additional &euro;200 million raised for the coffers of central Government?  We were told this would not be an additional cost to the Exchequer but it has been a raid on people who have done what successive Governments asked them to do, which was to prepare for their retirement.  The Government has trousered &euro;200 million on top of the measures it brought in the jobs initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is a big day for Ireland.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is presenting a report on our performance and delivery of human rights to the United <Col N="619"/>Nations Council on Human Rights this morning.  A live stream from the council is being broadcast in Buswells Hotel.  Each UN member will question and raise issues with the Minister about Ireland&rsquo;s performance in various areas.  I spent time at the hotel earlier and many of the recurring questions related to our performance on places of detention for juveniles, prisons &mdash; an issue which has been raised repeatedly in the House, the predominance of denominational education, health, equality and, especially, the need for us to urgently ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  This is Ireland&rsquo;s first audit.</P>
        <P>We can all recall the great presentation to the House last week by Dr. Maurice Manning.  It is important that on the return of the Minister for Justice and Equality  we have a debate on how we are performing on human rights issues.  We scrutinise legislation but it is time we scrutinised our rights.  One never knows when one&rsquo;s rights will be tested, when one will need them or when they do not exist until something happens to one or one&rsquo;s family or friends but then it is often too late.  We need to take a macro, responsible view on this.  I commend the various stakeholders in civic society that compiled the report, Your Rights. Right Now.  I also strongly commend Senator Katherine Zappone who is attending the UN council meeting on her own merits as an observer.  This would also be an important debate to have on her return.  I would like support from all sides on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the metro north question raised by my friend, Senator O&rsquo;Brien, there have always been serious difficulties with the lack of economic appraisal of that project.  I did a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme with Miriam O&rsquo;Callaghan and the former Minister, Eamon Ryan, and we found most of the documents in the economic appraisal were Tippexed out.  It is regrettable that the engineers went ahead with the project before it was properly appraised.</P>
        <P>I refer to the announcement of the ranking of universities worldwide earlier, which shows that Irish universities are falling.  This does not refer to either a decline in the quality of graduates or in the quality of research papers produced.  The measure chosen to indicate a decline in quality was the reduction in the number of staff.  That is called productivity in most other sectors.  I do not know why it should be a problem for <i>The Times </i>Higher Education World University Rankings Supplement 2011-12.  The reduction in staff had to be undertaken because of the difficulties with the national finances.</P>
        <P>I am worried because three analyses have been conducted on third level funding and staffing by the Comptroller and Auditor General, an bord snip nua and Dr. Colin Hunt and his group.  The Hunt report was spectacular because of the absence of people on the group who had been in a lecture hall or had done any teaching in recent years.  It is favoured, therefore, by the bureaucrats within the Department.  The other reports show that the share of the education budget spent on paying lecturers has reduced to 40%.  An army of bureaucrats has been created.  They come to the House and they appeared before the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education recently.  According to the <i>The Irish Times</i> rich list of November last, more than 100 officials earn &euro;112,610 per annum.  One cannot that earn that as a lecturer.  Within the current constraints, we need to divert money back into the classroom and lecture halls and away from this growing army of bureaucrats.  That includes, if necessary, the abolition of the Higher Education Authority and the higher education section of the Department.  There are only seven universities and, therefore, it should not take that long for somebody to write seven cheques and put the money into education.  The ranking of universities will then improve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LorraineHiggins"><NameTxt>Senator Lorraine Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Minister for Health to come to the House to provide answers regarding a case that has arisen in Galway.  Newborns are leaving hospitals in the city without proper immunisation and, in particular, the BCG vaccination.  Babies born in hospitals elsewhere in the country are immunised prior to leaving hospital but in Galway they have to <Col N="620"/>wait up to eight months for the vaccination.  This poses an unacceptable risk to babies and I would like this matter to be rectified as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Higgins.  It would be welcome if the Minister were to attend the House on a date earlier than 27 October.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>He was here last night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>We were all here to see him on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>Recently, we had a good debate on the arts, their contribution to employment and how we can expand on that.  The debate had been sought by Senator Mac Conghail and I seek a similar debate on sports tourism.  I am mindful of the great contribution of our rugby stars in New Zealand.  It is reminiscent of the Euro 1988 and 1990 campaigns and is great for the national psyche but in terms of events we have hosted here in the past such as the World Rally Championship in the north west and others, there is a great deal not only of revenue to be earned as a result of hosting such events but also in terms of the marketing tool it gives to the nation.  Many millions of people are watching the coverage of the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand and one can see the benefit of that for tourism in that country.  It is worth noting that more than 50 million people watched the live final stage of Rally Ireland at Mullaghmore in County Sligo.  That is more than the number that watch the Rugby World Cup final or the Wimbledon finals annually.</P>
        <P>In these difficult days when the Government does not have the resources it would wish for the marketing of this country we must box clever and examine other opportunities available to us to market our country and bring in a revenue stream.  It would be beneficial if the Minister for sport could come into the House for a debate, similar to the arts debate, with a focus on the contribution of sport and how we can use it as an economic tool in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleague, Senator Higgins, in her call in respect of the immunisation of young children at University College Hospital, Galway.  It is a serious issue and it must be taken up by the Minister.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to organise at the earliest possible stage a debate on the high levels of suicide.  I do that against a background of something I saw this morning where another young person was pulled out of a river, and there was evidence that there was a wheelchair on the bank of the river.  The issue of suicide is such a serious matter we need a debate in this House, as well as debating the treatment of patients with mental health problems.</P>
        <P>I raise that because concern was expressed by our colleague in the other House, Deputy Dan Neville, who is president of the Irish Suicidology Association, that psychiatrists often exclude families when they are treating patients with mental illness.  Patient confidentiality is frequently quoted as the reason but professionals must recognise that family involvement is key to the recovery process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is often a reluctance to discuss the aftercare needs of patients once they are discharged from hospital.  The practice of excluding the family in the recovery programme must change.  Those are issues we must tease out in this House with the Minister.  Given the numbers of people losing their lives through suicide, which is probably three times as many as the numbers killed on the roads, it is an issue of national importance and this House should discuss it at the earliest opportunity.  I hope the Leader will facilitate such a debate to which I know almost every Member in this House will want to contribute.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="621"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join Senator Healy Eames in calling for a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the issue of human rights.  She rightly highlighted the worthwhile discussion we had in the House recently with Dr. Maurice Manning.  The same individual and the Irish Human Rights Commission have spoken prior to the Minister addressing the United Nations on Ireland&rsquo;s performance in respect of human rights: the way women are treated in this State; immigrants &mdash; the way we treat people in direct provision centres is appalling and should be examined by the Government and anyone who supports human rights; vulnerable groups, whether it is Travellers or victims of the economic situation from working class backgrounds who cannot get their rights vindicated in terms of health and education; and people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>It strikes me that it is easy for us to have a nice, polite conversation with Dr. Manning and to stand up in this House and say we need to do something about human rights but when it comes down to it we have to do something ourselves.  We must pass legislation.  For example, we had an opportunity yesterday to extend voting rights to citizens abroad and to people in the North.  That was rejected by the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was in the Visitors Gallery some years ago when a Bill on a measure to help people with disabilities was introduced by the previous Government.  The people who had disabilities and all the campaigning groups were opposed to the Bill because it was not rights-based.  If we are serious about all these issues we should legislate, bring in those Bills and vindicate the rights of people with disabilities, children, women, immigrants and all those who are being denied their rights.  That is the most important action we can take.</P>
        <P>I would welcome the opportunity to have a discussion with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I hope he will be able to come into this Chamber and that we can have that discussion.  However, when Bills, motions and opportunities present themselves to this House that would allow us do something about all of these issues, very often the people who are calling for people&rsquo;s human rights to be vindicated vote against the motions and legislation that could do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Cullinane.  It is opportune for the Minister for Justice and Equality to come into the House for a debate on the various aspects of human rights that affect many different migrant communities and minority groups in this country.  The periodic review is taking place as we speak.  It is probably the first time we have put ourselves up for scrutiny internationally.  That is welcome, irrespective of the outcome of the review, because there is always room for improvement.</P>
        <P>In terms of UN conventions, the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is not that far off.  Once we introduce and pass the mental capacity legislation in this House we will have ticked all the boxes required for ratification of the convention.  In terms of our European colleagues, we will be one of the first to ratify that convention when that legislation passes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to indicate the scheduled timeframe for that legislation.  When can we expect the mental capacity legislation to be brought to Cabinet, published, debated, passed and signed into law by the next President?  That is an important issue.  It will happen and the sooner it happens, the better.  We can beat ourselves up constantly about human rights but we are a nation which, as I stated during the debate with Dr. Maurice Manning, fundamentally respects human rights internationally.  For generations our people have gone to the Third World and helped enable people to fight for their human rights.  The people support human rights but we must ensure that our legislation is up to standard.</P><Col N="622"/>
        <P>I am delighted that human rights is the issue on which this term of the Seanad is reflecting.  I hope that by the end of the term of the programme for Government and this Government&rsquo;s period in office we will see the necessary legislation to ensure we are legislatively proofed when it comes to that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Deputy Leader if she will invite the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Willie Penrose, to the House to give us an update on progress to date regarding the so-called ghost estates.  The Minister of State came into the House in the previous term and, to his credit, within 48 hours he acted on some of the suggestions made from both sides of the House.  I congratulate and compliment him on that.  It is important, however, that we get an update from the Minister of State because as we approach the long winter months we must remember that people and families are living in these ghost estates which have no outside lighting or footpaths.  The conditions are disgraceful.  Will the Deputy Leader invite the Minister of State back to the House to give us an update on progress to date on ghost estates?</P>
        <P>I also renew my call for the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government into the House so we can get an update on the reform of local government, particularly his intention to reduce the number of county councillors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in their remarks on women.  We must start at the top, we must treat women in this building better.  I do not mean that in a personal way but we could start with the Seanad.  Was the Seanad a complete afterthought?  There are no facilities near the Seanad, we must go half a mile to use them.  I am sorry to talk about something so base on the Order of Business but it should be pointed out and I wish someone would start thinking about these things.  I am on a floor where there are eight or ten women but there is only one facility and we must go up and down the stairs to use it.  We must think more about what women want in this country.  That kind of thing does not make sense to me and I am going to do something to change it because I am no longer going to accept it.</P>
        <P>The other topic is voting rights.  For once I slightly disagree with Senator Cullinane.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>I generally agree with him and he is careful about how he says things.  It was Senator Cullinane who made the point about women but, on voting rights, the people who live in the country are the people who control the country and therefore should be the people who vote.  I do not understand why, unless people only leave temporarily, people who live abroad should have a vote here.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday&rsquo;s debate on voting rights specifically related to the presidency, not to D&aacute;il elections or local elections.  A distinction should be made there because the President travels outside the country and is seen as ambassadorial and is, therefore, connected to the Diaspora.  I agree that we should have a debate because I do not think yesterday should be the end of the issue; it should continue and we should have a further debate.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I hoped the opportunity might arise where we could discuss Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the European Union.  I am not talking about the bigger issues of funding or lending.  It has struck me forcefully how, throughout its duration and up until very recently, the recession has impacted on our debates in the Seanad.  We used to see it on the Order of Business every day but in the last few weeks other issues are now coming to the fore, particularly human rights.  That is good and it is important that we salute the people of Ireland for the manner in which they have responded to the recession.  When we look at the anti-social behaviour that happened in other countries, there is no doubt that it hindered progress.  I can see progress here and I see a sense of confidence coming back.  We should salute everyone &mdash; the trade unions, the media and everyone who has participated in this exercise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I seek a debate on the relationship between Ireland and the European Union to look at smaller issues.  There is an excess of bureaucracy.  I see this at local level, where small indigenous industries want to be active.  Someone might want to make cakes and apple tarts at home but they require a stainless steel kitchen and those who want to raise a few hens to lay eggs must register the hens.  It has got out of hand.  Has it got out of hand because we are over-interpreting these rules while other countries ignore them or should we revisit these issues in Europe?  I do not see Cashel getting any big industry in the near future but I see the effort being made by people locally to create jobs.  It is important we do not obstruct them in that task.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On behalf of my mother, I must plead guilty to having four unregistered hens.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; mentioned this as stemming from the excessive bureaucracy of Brussels but perhaps we should look closer to home.  Much of what we deem to be Brussels bureaucracy stems from Departments interpreting EU directives.  That is where the debate should start.  The European Affairs committee is very proactive in this area but the EU regulations must be more widely debated in the Oireachtas, particularly here in the Seanad, which is the ideal vehicle for examining them.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was in the House some weeks ago for a general debate on agriculture, it would be opportune that in the immediate future the Minister would attend for a debate on the future of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Matters are now progressing swiftly in Brussels and in the next few months there will be a degree of finality on the future funding of European agriculture and the impact that will have on Ireland.  That will deeply affect every rural family and the Irish economy for better or for worse.  There is a question of securing the maximum degree of funding and how that money should be spent.  Again the Seanad should play a lead role and not just have the Minister attend for a broad presentation on agricultural policy.  He must specifically discuss current thinking on the future of the CAP.  I am sure Members, particularly those from rural areas, would be interested in contributing to that debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to return to the issue of Northern Ireland.  We had an interesting debate here yesterday but as I believe in using the time of the Seanad effectively, I want to ask the Minister to ensure that when we have another debate on voting rights for Northern Ireland &mdash; I agree it should be kept at the top of the agenda &mdash; it be timed in order that it comes after the terms of reference of the constitutional review group have been issued.  We do not want regurgitation of the same debate.  The Private Members&rsquo; motion was well outlined in six points but there was very poor attendance for that debate.  To use our time effectively, we should ensure the debate takes place after the constitutional review group has been given its terms of reference.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If we seek a debate, we should ensure we should get something out of it.  The Minister replied yesterday and we will not get any new information.  We should discuss this again but it should only be done after the terms of reference are issued but before any report in order that we can have an input into the constitutional review group.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on his call for a discussion on Europe and the integration of European legislation into this House.  Senator Comiskey mentioned to me the legislation whereby someone with more than four hens must have a licence.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Things like that mean a great deal to people.  Senator Bradford mentioned an issue touched on previously in this House.  It was agreed by all sides of this House that we should be scrutinising European legislation more.  I am sure the Deputy Leader fully endorses that.  I believe this matter that should be pursued with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  We have seen in the past European directives that have not been suited this country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Yes.  That is now the position because of the altered structure of the joint committees.  It would be useful, as a precursor, if the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade were to come to the House to discuss this issue.  It would be good to hear his views.  I look forward to hearing the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s response.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will first respond to some of the overall themes raised.  A number of Senators have requested that the Minister for Health come into the House.  Senator Higgins raised the issue concerning University College Hospital Galway.  It is a concern if newborns are not getting their vaccinations in a timely fashion.  As previously stated by the Leader, the <Col N="625"/>Minister for Health will be in the House on 27 October.  The Minister was in the House last night responding to a matter on the Adjournment.  I suggest that specific issues such as the one pertaining to University College Hospital Galway might more appropriately be dealt with by way of matters on the Adjournment to the Minister for Health.  The debate on 27 October will be a useful and wide-ranging discussion on health.  The Minister can deal on the Adjournment with specific health issues which arise before then.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Senators Healy-Eames, Cullinane and Conway for raising the issue of human rights and the UN periodic review which concluded this morning.  I attended the ICCL live screening from Geneva in Buswells Hotel this morning, as, I am aware, did many other colleagues.  It was useful to hear the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, respond to the questions raised in regard to human rights protections in Ireland.  I agree with all the colleagues who raised the issue that it would be good to have the Minister  come back into this House to tell us what happened at the UN periodic review and how the Government proposes to deal with the critiques on human rights protection that have arisen.  I am sure we will also hear on the matter from Senator Zappone who, as we heard, is attending in Geneva as an observer.  I will take up that matter with the Leader and the Minister. </P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien raised the issue of metro north, which is a thorny issue.  Senator Barrett also raised that issue and spoke about the flaws or problems with the economic appraisal which took place in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes.  This is an issue on which people have taken up polarised positions and language is clearly important.  I will check the current position for Senator O&rsquo;Brien.  My understanding is that no final decision has yet been taken.  It might be useful to have a debate on the project with the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  I will take up that issue with the Leader.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Brien also raised the issue of the sale of State assets and the position as set out in the original memorandum of understanding.  The Senator's party will be well aware of that given it negotiated it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding is that it was always envisaged there would be a sale of State assets.  The issue of how much has not yet been decided although the figure of &euro;2 billion has been given.  The Senator should take up the matter with the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;who will be in the House directly after the Order of Business this morning.  Also, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, when in the House yesterday gave a clear response to Senator O&rsquo;Brien and others, including Senators from the Labour Party, on how the proposed sale of a minority stake in the ESB is to be dealt with.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Brien also raised the issue of the pension levy which was, as the Senator will be aware, introduced to fund the jobs initiative.  I disagree with the Senator&rsquo;s description of it as a raid on pensions.  The reality is that it was the most effective way to fund and resource the critical task of trying to generate jobs.  There has already been success in this regard.  I disagree with the Senator&rsquo;s remarks.</P><Col N="626"/>
        <P Just="Left">I have already responded to Senator Healy Eames in regard to having the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, come to the House.  I agree we should have him come into this House.</P><P>I am grateful to Senator Barrett for raising the concerning figures this morning in regard to the falling of our universities in the international rankings.  It is worrying to see Trinity College and UCD fall out of the top 100 universities and to see other universities fall below their previous rankings.  As far as I am aware NUI Maynooth is the only university that bucked the trend.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, has pointed out that these international ranking scales are not perhaps the only factor in terms of bringing in international students and funding for research, which is clearly true.  However, I agree with Senator Barrett on the need to divert money back into education and classrooms in order that the rankings can improve.  The Senator and I know from Trinity College that the staff-student ratio is a huge issue.  Student numbers are increasing and there has been a freeze on recruiting new staff.  It would be useful to invite the Minister to the House to debate this issue.  The Minister will be in the House during the next couple of weeks and we may try to have a debate then on higher education funding.  The Senator can raise the point about the abolition of the HEA, which is perhaps a radical proposal.  We need to look at all of these issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have already dealt with Senator Higgins&rsquo; questions.  Senator MacSharry asked that the Minister for Health be asked to come to the House.  I have already dealt with that issue.  He also sought a debate on sports and tourism.  We had a wide-ranging debate on sport on Tuesday with the Minister of State, Deputy Ring.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan made a great speech specifically about sports tourism on that occasion.  I agree with Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s remarks in regard to the enormous value sports tourism brings to this country.  However, it might be a little premature to have another debate on the topic so soon.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullins called for a debate on suicide.  I agree it would be useful to have a debate on that issue.  Other Senators have also sought such a debate.  There was a debate on suicide near the end of the final session of the previous Seanad and as such we would need to consider when such a debate should be timed.  Senator Mary White and others have raised that issue before.  It would be good to have a further debate on the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have already responded to Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s call for a debate on human rights issues.  The Senator also spoke about the motion yesterday on voting rights for Irish citizens abroad.  We had a full debate on that issue yesterday.  As the Cathaoirleach said, the full two hours allocated was utilised.  Senators Noone, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Keane also raised the issue of a further debate on voting rights.  Senator Keane sensibly proposed it might take place when the constitutional convention terms have been outlined.  It is hoped that process will be under way early next year.  Irish citizens abroad do have limited voting rights.  Irish citizens living anywhere in the world, who are graduates of Trinity College or the NUI, have a right to vote in the elections for the six university Senators.  That is currently the only provision in that regard.  We might look at the issue in a broader context early in the New Year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Conway raised the issue of human rights, to which issue I have already responded.  The Senator specifically asked about a timeframe for mental capacity legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, appeared before the committee on justice a few days ago and told members that her officials were working on that legislation.  It is proposed to be introduced early in 2012.  If it is possible to do it sooner, it will be done.  That is a pressing matter, with which the Minister of State is dealing directly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Wilson called on the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, to come to the House to discuss ghost estates.  I gave a commitment previously that I would do so.  I have already asked the Leader to follow up on that matter.  The Senator also asked that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, come into the House.  The <Col N="627"/>Minister was in this House yesterday for two hours and again it might be some time before he can come back to speak about local government reform.  However, I have no doubt he will do so.  I am sure many Members are interested in such a debate.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; also raised the issues of voting rights and Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the European Union.  He clearly introduced a strand, as Senators Bradford and Paul Coghlan agreed with him.  A debate on whether EU regulations are overly restrictive in some areas would be good.  It is a question we can tease out.  Senator Bradford&rsquo;s mother and her four unregistered hens were mentioned in this context.  We could seek to invite the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, to the House.  I am unsure whether she has appeared in the Chamber yet.  It could be useful.</P>

I hope to have that debate in due course, but the EU matter might be better dealt with by the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bradford asked for a debate on the future of the CAP with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coveney.  While it would be a good discussion, we recently had a wide-ranging debate on agriculture; therefore, the Senator&rsquo;s request might take some time to arrange.</P>
        <P>Senator Keane asked for a debate on voting rights.  We might arrange for one once the constitutional convention is under way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Paul Coghlan asked for a debate on EU legislation and the attendance of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I have the latter matter in hand, but we will invite the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, also.</P><Col N="628"/>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Acting Chairman.  I am pleased to be in the Seanad to discuss the latest economic and financial developments.  I wish to highlight that, notwithstanding the more negative view of the euro area and global economies which has emerged recently, both market and international sentiment towards Ireland has improved since the summer.  I believe that this reflects a number of developments.  The economy is expanding once again; the public finances are on track; tangible progress is being made in resolving the banking situation, at a lower than assumed cost to the taxpayer; and the cost of external financial assistance to the State has been reduced significantly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This highlights the importance of continuing to do what we can to put our own house in order.  In my opening remarks, I will elaborate on each of these key developments, outlining in each case the main policies the Government is putting in place to nourish the emerging economic recovery.  First, as regards the macro-economic situation, the latest published figures provide at least some grounds for encouragement.  Gross domestic product increased by 1.6% in the second quarter of this year, following on from a relatively robust expansion in the first quarter.  This was the first time there have been two successive quarters of increasing activity since 2006.  As has been well documented, the external sector is leading the way.  Exports of goods and services are now well in excess of pre-crisis levels, confirming that the improvement in competitiveness is standing to us.  Last year, the balance of payments moved into surplus for the first time in over a decade.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would also highlight that recent inward investment announcements provide further grounds for optimism, clearly demonstrating that Ireland remains an attractive location for the production and export of high technology goods and services.  I see this as a clear demonstration that the Government&rsquo;s strategy regarding the 12.5% corporation tax rate is an appropriate one and I believe most Members of this House would endorse this position.  The broadening of the Irish export performance to include large parts of the indigenous exporting sectors is also a welcome development.  For instance, the agrifood sector is making a significant contribution as is the tourism sector, in part due to the measures implemented as part of the Government&rsquo;s recent jobs initiative.</P>
        <P>While the exporting sector has certainly been the shining light in recent times, I am very conscious of the ongoing difficulties elsewhere in our economy and, indeed, in our society.  For instance, large parts of the household sector have ramped up their precautionary savings in response to the major deterioration in the labour market.  Unemployment has risen to over 14%, an unacceptably high figure and addressing this statistic is undoubtedly the greatest challenge facing the Government.  I assure Members that virtually all the main macro-economic <Col N="629"/>policies being implemented by the Government, from recapitalising the banking system to fiscal consolidation, are designed with the objective of boosting employment in a sustainable manner so that unemployment can be put on a downward path once again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the euro area, the sovereign debt crisis has entered a new phase, with negative spill-over effects to parts of the European banking system.  While the euro area is not unique among advanced economies in terms of sovereign debt problems, unfortunately it has been the focus of markets.  There is considerable uncertainty and nervousness and this is weighing on growth prospects in many of our main export markets.  At this stage, the most likely scenario appears to be for a slowdown in our main trading partners as opposed to a slip back into recession.  Even this, however, will have less favourable consequences for Irish growth prospects.  On balance, it would appear that notwithstanding the relatively good performance in the first half of the year, a slowdown appears likely in the second half, mainly on foot of external developments.  A full assessment is being undertaken by my Department and will be published in the pre-budget outlook later this month.  In this context, I note that the Central Bank earlierthis week scaled back its growth forecasts for next year, a not unreasonable decision at this stage.</P>
        <P>Moving onto the public finances, my Department published figures for the first nine months of this year last Tuesday.  The position at the end of September is one in which the Exchequer deficit, excluding banking-related payments, is over &euro;3 billion lower than it was in the same period last year.  There is clear evidence that real progress is being made in terms of putting our public finances on a more sustainable path.  However, there can be no room for complacency; our deficit remains far too large, and it is crucial that we continue to bridge the gap between revenue and expenditure in the coming years.</P>
        <P>The agreed target for next year is a deficit of no more than 8.6% of GDP and the Government is committed to implementing the necessary level of consolidation to ensure that target is achieved. In this regard, the results of the comprehensive review of expenditure will inform the future path and composition of public spending.  The final CRE reports have now been submitted by all Departments to my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
        <P>It is important that we provide as much clarity as possible regarding future consolidation in order to generate certainty and thereby enable households and firms to plan their spending and investment decisions.  In this regard, the forthcoming pre-budget outlook will set out a medium-term fiscal consolidation path covering the period 2012 to 2015, with the overall composition of revenue and expenditure adjustments for each year being outlined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the banking sector, it is fair to say that signs of progress are becoming increasingly visible.  As Senators will be aware, the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy is to create a leaner, more resilient banking system centred around two pillar banks whose primary focus is supporting economic recovery in Ireland.  In terms of resilience, a &euro;24 billion recapitalisation of the banking sector took place in July of this year, in line with the PCAR analysis.  The State&rsquo;s net direct investment was &euro;16.4 billion, considerably lower than initially envisaged.  The remaining capital was sourced from liability management exercises with subordinated bondholders in the various banks, anticipated asset sales and the injection of private capital into one major bank.  I see the private capital injection as a vote of confidence in the banking system and in the future of the economy.  With this additional capital, Irish banks are now very well capitalised and capable of withstanding very distressed scenarios.</P>
        <P>Progress with regard to restructuring has been significant in recent months.  The legal merger of AIB and EBS was completed on 1 July 2011, as was the merger of Anglo and INBS.  Restructuring is also continuing at Irish Life &amp; Permanent.  Considerable progress has also been made <Col N="630"/>on the renewal of the boards of banks, while management structures have been strengthened with clearer roles and lines of responsibility.  The banks have also had success in securing term wholesale funding from international banks with some &euro;4.5 billion funded to date and further transactions being negotiated.  This is ahead of the second quarter 2013 schedule envisaged in March 2011.  At the same time, the programme of asset deleveraging is under way, with significant progress expected to be made this year in spite of the difficult environment in international financial markets.  It should be noted that more than 80% of the assets to be disposed of by the end of 2013 are located outside Ireland.  All of these measures are helping to rebuild international investor confidence in the Irish banking sector.  We have confidence in and are committed to the bank restructuring plans.</P>
        <P>Within the European context, we actively participate in and contribute to the discussions.  However, we maintain a steady and considered dialogue with all of the European authorities regarding the current challenges while continuing to ensure that the primary focus is on needs of the Irish people and our economy.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The cost of external financial assistance is also moving in the right direction.  Last July, the Heads of State and Government in the euro area agreed to address design flaws in the financial support mechanisms available to member states.  In particular, it was agreed that the cost of the EFSF facility to beneficiary countries should be close to funding costs.  Combined with other technical changes, this will imply a reduction in EFSF lending rates of around 2.6% when approved by all euro area member states.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom has also agreed to reduce the margin charged on the bilateral loan, although the precise figure has yet to be finalised.  In September, the European Commission proposed to eliminate the margin on the EFSM facility.  This was considered at this week's ECOFIN meeting, and while no objections were raised, national parliamentary procedures must be completed before a final decision is made.</P>
        
        <P>Given these changes, figures provided by the NTMA show that the total savings on the original facility, with an average life of 7.5 years, are approximately &euro;9 billion, or approximately 5.7% of GDP.  In addition, the cost of our IMF loans will decline as a result of recent and forthcoming increases in our IMF quota.  Again the saving is significant.  In the case of the IMF loans, the estimated savings take account of a quota increase which will not come into effect before autumn 2012 at the earliest.  These expected savings may change either upwards or downwards in the light of future quota revisions.</P>
        <P>At the same time, changes are being implemented to both the EFSF and EFSM to allow for longer loan maturities.  While there are costs associated with this &mdash; borrowing over a longer time horizon is typically more expensive &mdash; the lengthening of maturities is beneficial from a cash flow perspective as well as ensuring that the profile of redemptions is more orderly.  In other words, the benefits exceed the costs, so this is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>As has been well documented, yields on ten-year Irish Government paper have fallen by over 600 basis points since their peak in July.  The message from this is unambiguous &mdash; clear, comprehensive, timely and credible polices that are consistently implemented help to reassure markets.  With greater reassurance comes lower borrowing costs.</P>
        <P>There is, of course, much more to be done.  Our deficit remains unsustainably high and further consolidation is necessary.  The external outlook is much less benign than it was six months ago and notwithstanding the decline in market interest rates, borrowing costs remain excessive and are not yet consistent with a return to market-based funding.  There are substantial challenges ahead, but we are on the right path, and that is where we intend to remain.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing the comments of Senators.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="631"/>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement and would like to go over some areas of it.  The Minister referred to the jobs initiative and the improvement in the agrifood and tourism sectors, saying this was in part due to measures implemented as part of the Government&rsquo;s recent jobs initiative.  We see in the figures announced this week that approximately &euro;461 million was raided from private pension schemes across the country to pay for the jobs initiative.  We discussed this at length and opposed it in the Finance (No. 2) Bill on the basis of the effect it would have on people and existing annuitants in defined benefit, defined contribution and all pension schemes and pointed out that 80% of them are under funded.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Finance received advice on the pension levy, but decided not to publish that advice until a freedom of information request was submitted.  We have seen the documents that were submitted on the pension levy.  Many people, including the Minister&rsquo;s colleague in Cabinet, Deputy Joan Burton, argued vociferously against the pension levy on the basis of the effect it would have on pension schemes.  That has been well documented.  We have seen the effect with a scheme I raised in this House, the airline staff scheme at Dublin Airport which has 15,000 members.  I am sure the Minister has received correspondence on this matter from the Tara Mines pensioners, who have seen a 10% reduction in their annuities and their average pension is now reduced from &euro;10,000 to &euro;9,000.  We will see the same losses happening across the board in the next few months.  I have no doubt the Minister has been inundated with correspondence from scheme trustees.</P>
        <P>The Government decided on a jobs budget and is going ahead with it.  I welcomed certain measures in that, among them the VAT reductions.  How is the Department tracking whether the VAT reductions are being or have been passed on to consumers?  What is the target for jobs?  We have seen no target for the number of jobs to be created, yet the Minister is raising just short of &euro;1.8 billion, effectively from people&rsquo;s savings, to pay for an initiative that has no set targets.  The Minister believes that the jobs initiative has had an impact, particularly in the agrifood and tourism sectors.  What positive impact has it had?  Has the impact been quantified and have any new jobs been created in these sectors?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has committed to there being no income tax increases and no social welfare cuts in the budget.  The Minister seems to be at odds with the Taoiseach in that regard.  Deputy Noonan has been more upfront on that by not ruling out any income tax increases or social welfare cuts.  The parameters of the budget have been set and a minimum of  &euro;1.5 billion is to be raised through taxation.  I do not see how that can be done without increases in income tax nor can I see how there can be savings of &euro;2.1 billion without cuts to social welfare.  Is the Government still committed to the announcement made by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste at the much touted 100-days press conference?  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view now and has the Government changed its view?  Will we see tax increases?  There have been social welfare cuts already, to the household benefits package and to the fuel allowances which kicked in this month.  I ask the Minister to address these issues in his response.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the comprehensive spending review, but when does he intend to publish that?  Will he wait until after the budget to publish it or will he publish it beforehand so that we have an opportunity to debate the budget in both Houses?  With the comprehensive review available to all Members, we can have a proper analysis of the budget.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the initiatives being taken by the Government.  I agree that creating jobs is what it is all about.  The Government has established NewERA under the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd.  Why has it established this without permission from the troika to use the moneys from the sale of State assets for job creation rather than for lowering the national debt?  How are discussions in that regard going?  Will the Minister confirm to the House that <Col N="632"/>in the original EU-IMF deal with Ireland, there was no commitment to the sale of State assets, nor was there any figure given?  Will he confirm that it was in the revised memorandum of understanding, negotiated by the Minister and the Taoiseach on behalf of the people, that the figure of &euro;2 billion was first mentioned and that the Minister clearly said that he specifically recommended that an accelerated sale process should be considered?  What had been mentioned previously was &ldquo;possible privatisation&rdquo;.  However, now it is in the Government agenda to sell State assets.  Will the Minister confirm that was not part of the original deal?</P>
        <P>We are all concerned by the ongoing crisis within Europe and the Minister mentioned this in his statement.  He was at a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday and I was disappointed that the EU finance Ministers left that meeting without any decisions being taken again.  I do not lay the blame at Deputy Noonan&rsquo;s door; I am sure he is doing his level best.  Most people will agree that Europe is just struggling on week by week, without dealing with the banking crisis in the European sector.  Two years ago, when we had our banking issues, many of us pointed out there was a European banking crisis.  This is borne out now by what is happening in Dexia and the effect that will have in Belgium and France.  What is the European view on recapitalisation?  Chancellor Merkel has effectively said that she would be for the recapitalisation of European banks.  A figure of &euro;200 billion has been set out, but that is probably well short of what is required.  What concerns does the Department of Finance have about this contagion spreading or any knock-on effects?  The Minister has rightly said that our banks are well capitalised and I am sure he will agree that much of that work was done by the previous Administration.  I welcome the fact the Minister has continued that work and our banks should be robust.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I disagree with the two-pillar bank approach taken by the Government.  One of the issues in our banking crisis was that the banks were allowed become too big and they became larger than the economy.  We missed a major opportunity by not selling the EBS to the US consortium, which would have provided a third banking force in this country.  What we will have now will be a massive AIB and Bank of Ireland and it is thanks to the UK Government that Ulster Bank will still have a presence here.  Businesses will have only three banks.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on the EBS?  While it has been merged, will he leave it as a separate retail bank under the auspices of AIB?  What has happened in that regard?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Fine Gael election manifesto promised homeowners that mortgage interest relief would be increased to 30% for properties purchased within a four year period.  The Government said that it would be implemented but it has not been.  Senator Marc MacSharry introduced a Bill in this House that would have brought real protection to principal private residences.  It was defeated by the Government.  The Government said it would increase mortgage interest relief and the average increase of that measure would have been &euro;166 net per month.  This would be significant for the electorate when it was deciding how it would place votes and place trust in the Fine Gael Party to do something about distressed mortgages and people in arrears.  When will the Government do something for people with distressed mortgages and those who are in arrears?  Will it see through the commitment it gave prior to the election to increase mortgage interest relief to 30%?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a number of questions to ask.  When we look back and wonder how we got to this place, it is clear that it is from the calamitous decisions made by the previous Government.  I am sorry, Senator O&rsquo;Brien, but there are no two ways about it.  We see that the Sinn F&eacute;in policies are more akin to voodoo economics than any version of real economics.  The Minister&rsquo;s time at the Department of Finance has been steady and sound, which is what the nation needed.  We are in a European cycle that is difficult, although the level of debt is not as bad as it was two weeks ago in the debate on the Bill dealing with the European financial stability fund.  European debt is &euro;6.5 trillion and US debt is over &euro;10 trillion and in both cases there is a ratio of 2:1 of publicly traded funds to privately traded Government funds and ECB and Government bonds.  The question Europe is failing to answer is whether we are prepared to do what is required to take us out of this.  It is not that difficult and other countries that are sound and that have a triple-A rating are capable of paying more.  The question is whether they will.  To date it has not been answered.</P>
        <P>One crucial point is that we have friends in Europe again.  For too long, we lost all our contacts and, following years of good diplomacy by various Governments and diplomats, we backed ourselves into a corner and were left exposed and isolated.  We had no friends there and that was seen in the deal brought back by the previous Government.  Fine Gael said it would renegotiate the deal and it has done so.  We will continue to improve the circumstances, terms and conditions as we see fit from time to time.</P>
        <P>I will not try to cover the ground covered by the Minister.  I come across a number of issues at the coalface when dealing with constituents who are clients of banks.  Banks are trying to force people, who are capable of paying interest only, from interest only payments.  I realise that the interest only deal was put in place for a certain period but banks are now trying to force people into repaying interest and principal.  If the banks force people into that payment regime, they will stop getting any money and people will default.  People are not capable of paying the interest and principal, which amounts to a doubling of the interest payment.  It is a mistake because, if people are capable of keeping their heads above water by making interest payments, the banks should be told that is the appropriate payment at this time.  As market conditions improve and as the economy progresses, they can move towards interest and principal.  However, making this mistake now will force people into default on payments.</P>
        <P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien touched on mortgage protection, which I spoke about before.  I am dealing with a number of repossessions, which is not fun.  I am dealing with the State-backed banks and the banks that are not backed by the State.  The latter are prepared to negotiate a position with people who realise they have no further outlet other than handing back the keys of the property or allow the property to be repossessed through the courts.  This category of banks is more reasonable to negotiate with.  It is fair that, if a property is handed back, the remaining debt on the property should be written down.  I have heard the Minister speak about this before and, according to the Blackrock stress tests, a figure was assigned for further recapitalisation of Irish pillar banks so that these amounts could be written down.</P><Col N="634"/>
         <P Just="Left">Anecdotal evidence is supported by the evidence of the witness from AIB who appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform who told us that in 2011, AIB had written off &euro;600,000.  The anecdotal evidence is that banks not backed by the State are writing off sums of money and treating it is as a non-recourse loan but the Irish pillar banks have taken the recapitalisation funds and they are not writing off amounts from mortgages.  They are still trying to force people to retain the debt even though the House has been returned to the bank.  It is unfair and unreasonable and I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts on this point.  We must look at where we are going and we must be more clever in how we do things.  The budget arithmetic is coming up in the next few weeks and it is a welcome improvement to reduce spending by some &euro;3 billion.  It is not a choice because it has been agreed with the troika and that must continue.</P>
        <P>The black market is booming, particularly in construction.  Perhaps we should reduce VAT on labour to 0% and increase VAT on products so that, if someone buys a product, VAT must be paid.  It is crucial that we do not raise income taxes.  Middle Ireland is paying significant taxes and should not pay more income tax.  Those who earn &euro;37,500 pay tax at, in effect, 59% on every euro above that amount when income tax, levies, PRSI and other factors are calculated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a great deal of talk about commercial rates.  The commercial sector is being hit hard.  Local authorities receive &euro;1 billion in rates and, within one of the Finance Acts, there is the option to reduce rates by up to 10%.  That would cost &euro;100 million and I do not know exactly where the money should come from but the measure should be considered.  Local authorities have shown that when the block grant is reduced, they are able to cut costs.  However, if the block grant is not reduced but rates are reduced, the effect will be the same.  The difference is that the commercial ratepayer receives the amount of the reduction.</P>
        <P>The Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht appeared in the Chamber.  Arts and sport are two vehicles by which we can get positive coverage for the country.  We saw the benefit of President Obama&rsquo;s private visit and of the Queen&rsquo;s state visit.  We can also see the benefit of a sports event happening in the country.</P>
        <P>According to figures I saw, when Wembley hosted the Champions&rsquo; League final, the city of London benefited by approximately &pound;50 million.  Croke Park in Dublin would be a wonderful facility in which to hold a Champions&rsquo; League final at some stage in the future.  The next available final is 2014.  This would be of major benefit to the city and also to the State because of the increase in tax revenues.  The GAA would benefit from the rent, and we would have a great opportunity to showcase ourselves in a similar way to the visits of President Obama and the Queen of England.</P>
      </Speaker>
     <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take three minutes, with four minutes for Senator O&rsquo;Donnell and one minute for Senator Mac Conghail.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister, Deputy Noonan, a good afternoon.  The new Government is doing a lot to assist charities in fund-raising by addressing issues with regard to taxation on charitable donations.  I understand the Department of Finance has a working group which is collaborating with the sector to simplify taxation regulation and ensure the benefits go to the charities.  It is also considering a reduction in the threshold of qualification for tax relief, which is advisable in the current economic climate.  Reducing the threshold would also benefit a great number of charities.</P>
        <P>There is, however, a continuing impediment to the work of charities in that the sector cannot reclaim its VAT in the same way as businesses can.  As someone associated with both business <Col N="635"/>and the charities sector, I am very aware of this issue.  The sector pays VAT on essential expenditure and on initiatives and events to raise funds independently.  This includes everything from information leaflets to equipment and facilities in buildings.  This severely restricts the level of work that can be undertaken by charities and also has an impact on independent fund-raising.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, for example, which I understand raises more than 80% of its funds independently and therefore does not rely on the State for the bulk of its work, pays approximately &euro;4 million to the State that it cannot reclaim.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am aware there are complications in EU law on this issue but the European Commission has stated that a VAT compensation scheme offers a solution.  As far back as December 2006, the then Minister for Finance stated in reply to a D&aacute;il question: &ldquo;[T]here is nothing to prevent national Governments paying charities a subsidy to compensate them for the irrecoverable VAT&rdquo;.  The Government of Denmark, a country similar in its size and charity sector structure to Ireland, has introduced such a compensation scheme.  I am proposing that the Minister set up a working group to examine VAT issues affecting charities, similar to the current working group which I understand is dealing effectively and positively with the general tax issue.  The process in Denmark was resolved over a two-year period of discussion.  I hope that in the lifetime of the current Government the issue of VAT for charities will be resolved to the satisfaction of both the sector and the Department of Finance through a process of discussion and agreement, as I have outlined.</P>
        <P>We know what we spend on overseas aid, but what about domestic charities across the spectrum of arts, sports, education and health?  What is the total spend by the Government on domestic Irish charities?  Would the Minister be kind enough to let us know how many registered charities in Ireland receive over 50% of their annual budgets in State funding?</P>

I congratulate the Minister on his actions so far.  He has been catching up and cleaning up, which is difficult, and he has done an extraordinary job.  I am not an expert on finance at all, but I am somewhat of an expert on debt.  We have all become experts on debt as victims of the greed of banking power and the power of banking greed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">NAMA has taken over &euro;71 billion of loans from the top 180 borrowers.  That is &euro;71 thousand million.  It is better to verbalise it because one could not get enough paper to write down the noughts.  However, NAMA paid only &euro;30 billion for these, leaving a shortfall of &euro;40 thousand million, for which we as taxpayers in Ireland must pay. NAMA then went to the ECB, borrowed &euro;31 billion on our account and came back to Treasury Buildings, which is owned by a builder who is himself in NAMA.  NAMA terms of reference were outlined by lawyers and accountants for whom we are also paying, and the fees are currently estimated to be around &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion.  I would like to know if this will be added to the &euro;40 billion that taxpayers are already being asked to pay.</P>
        <P>How constrained is the Minister by the laws that NAMA has made up for itself?  Has it become a runaway train?  What control is being exercised by the Minister on the people within NAMA, and can he as Minister find out what is happening there?  Is it time he broke the NAMA code, since the people of Ireland have no say, not even a whisper, in what NAMA is doing with the &euro;31 billion borrowed on our account?  It is time for somebody to knock on the door.  Can we as citizens have such a write-down on our debt?</P><Col N="636"/>
        <P>My second question is to do with the builders and speculators who we know are broke because they are in NAMA and we are paying for their debts, as well as &euro;31 billion borrowed from the ECB on our account and a &euro;40 billion shortfall that we are also paying for.  Can the Minister explain to me how the same builders and developers, and indeed their wives, are building hotels and houses in other countries?  Where are they getting the money, when they owe millions to our banks that we are paying for?  We see in the papers that they are building houses, knocking down houses, re-erecting houses and spending great amounts of money to buy houses without mortgages.  It is like a magic show in Las Vegas.  I want to know why they are not on the dole and where they are getting the money.  Is there any mechanism for finding out why we are paying for their debts in Ireland while they are living the high life in other countries?</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a taxpayer, with other taxpayers, I put &euro;3.5 billion into Bank of Ireland; I had no choice.  Canadian investors put &euro;1.1 billion into Mr. Boucher&rsquo;s folly.  The sums were done and they were outstanding, because the Canadian investors now own one third of the bank for &euro;1.1 billion, while I own 12% for my &euro;3.5 billion.  How did that happen?  It is fantastic.  As taxpayers who paid &euro;3.5 thousand million, can we get involved with these Canadian investors, who have obviously, again, been at some kind of magic show?  The most interesting thing is that Mr. Boucher is getting slapped on the back for this.  It is extremely questionable.  The sad thing about the whole situation is that NAMA seems to be hiding behind phrases such as &ldquo;the right thing to do&rdquo; and &ldquo;the only thing to do&rdquo;, along with the smart suits and sharp pens and the people who look extremely acceptable and very knowing.  Yet, what it is really doing is undermining democracy, fair play, justice and our citizens&rsquo; belief in transparency and honesty.  It is continuing to desecrate faith in law, regulation and finance.  NAMA seems to be made up by, through and for wide boys.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for attending the Seanad.  I have two questions which, if answered, will inform me on how to approach my Seanad decision making with regard to public finances.  I know the Seanad has no real power, but I want to be able to explain the macro-factors of the public finances to my communities.  I thank the Minister for giving us an overview of the public finances.</P>
        <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Brien also mentioned, can the Minister co-ordinate the publication of the comprehensive review of expenditure with the pre-budget outlook?  The Minister is known for being frank and succinct and we are beginning to trust what he says, whether we agree or disagree with his actions.  I ask him to co-operate with his fellow Minister, Deputy Howlin, to publish the review of expenditure and the pre-budget outlook at the same time.</P>
        <P>Since we are considering a pre-budget outlook for 2012 to 2015, what is the opinion of the Minister and his officials on multi-annual funding, particularly for State agencies?  I am considering this based on my own experience in, for example, the Arts Council.  We know that cuts are expected and that there will be a decrease in funding.  Introducing a system of multi-annual funding for civil society groups would facilitate more prudent and efficient expenditure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  It is good to see that we are at last beginning to turn the corner, as indicated by the good news outlined in the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  I propose to focus on an issue which is somewhat under the radar but nevertheless important.  Before doing so, I take the opportunity to register my bemusement at Senator O&rsquo;Brien claiming credit for recapitalising the banks.</P><Col N="637"/>
        <P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on the future of social investment and whether it can play a significant part in extricating ourselves from current difficulties?  There is a strong desire among people to help themselves at this difficult time.  Social investment offers a mechanism to tap into and release that potential.  Financial investment intended to achieve social objectives means we score on the double, simultaneously making our communities better places to live and producing financial returns for investors.  In recent years the voluntary and community sector has not been taken seriously by the economic players who ruled and ruined this country.  In the social partnership process, for example, mere lip-service was paid to the sector.  I have seen the same dynamic at play in local government where, in the strategic policy committees, for example, the voluntary and community pillars were virtually ignored or, perhaps worse, patronised.  Now that we have seen that the economic emperors have no clothes, it is time to move the social and voluntary sector to centre stage where it can and will play a role in our economic recovery.</P>
        <P>It is important not to confuse the social and voluntary sector with the social economy.  While many of the actors in the social economy are involved in the community and voluntary sector, the two are distinct entities.  Our social economy remains relatively underdeveloped when compared with that of other countries and there is significant room for growth.  In Europe as a whole, for instance, the sector accounts for more than 5% of GDP, whereas in Ireland it represents a mere 3%.  A report launched last July by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, indicated that it is possible to create up to 5,000 jobs annually in the sector, which would equate to a potential social welfare saving of up to &euro;100 million.  Significant investment is already happening in the area, with the Irish League of Credit Unions estimating that some 10% of its loan book is dedicated to various types of social finance provision.</P>
        <P>When discussing social finance it is important to remind ourselves that we are not talking about ill-defined community projects with poor delivery outcomes.  Rather, it is a system of finance based on a robust business model where there is direct investment and repayable loan finance.  Normal loan criteria in regard to ability to pay and security apply, but because of the social nature of the loan, a special low rate of interest is applicable, perhaps in conjunction with a longer repayment period.  In 2006 the Government established the Social Finance Foundation to act as a wholesale supplier of funding for social finance, with &euro;25 million provided by the banking industry as seed capital.  By February 2010 loans to the value of more than &euro;20 million had been approved.</P>
        <P>With a potential saving of up to &euro;100 million in social welfare alone, not to mention potential tax receipts, this area provides genuine opportunities.  Given the difficult conditions now prevailing, it is time to take a closer look at this model and to consider expanding the role of social finance into our economy.  For instance, micro-finance social lending organisations facilitate those with viable business propositions and support micro-businesses which require working capital or experience temporary cashflow shortages.  Agencies such as Clann Credo and First Step are doing valuable work in this area, but we must find a way to expand this activity.  The initiative in this regard could be taken by any Department, but it is important that the Department of Finance should take the lead.  We must find ways to encourage people to invest in these funds, perhaps by way a tax relief on investment, encouragement of philanthropic donations or the establishment of a State guarantee social bond.  We must examine ways of encouraging people to invest funds where money raised locally is spent locally.  The social bond system is operating with considerable success in the United Kingdom and is included in the programme for Government.</P><Col N="638"/>
        <P>The obstacles we face in mobilising social economic activity include the fear or risk surrounding a failure to recover debt, fear of excessive demand, lack of promotion of social finance facilities and excessive bureaucracy.  We must incentivise people on two fronts.  First, we must encourage investment in social investment funds and, second, we must facilitate social entrepreneurs to utilise these funds to maximum effect.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s views on this issue.</P>
        <P>On an unrelated matter, I am aware that some organisations in receipt of public funds are slow to pay their bills and are escaping the provisions which oblige State agencies to make repayment within a specific timeframe.  Is there any mechanism for extending this facility?  Any organisation that is in receipt of public funding should pay its bills in a timely fashion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and assure him of my support in the vital task he is undertaking.  It is essential that we restore the country&rsquo;s finances to order.  Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe referred to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and his colleagues, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, as the Celtic troika.  We wish them every success as they engage with the Ministers of the spending Departments.  I am pleased it is a troika as the contest was unequal in the past with one Minister for Finance being hounded by 12 spending Ministers at the Cabinet table.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred in his contribution to four themes.  The last of these is non-controversial and I commend him on his achievement in reducing the cost of borrowing.  There are signs the economy is expanding, but they are extremely tentative.  The EU report on Ireland&rsquo;s economic adjustment predicts that it will be 2015 before we get back to the nominal GDP value we attained in 2008.  Despite all our efforts in the area, the numbers working in industry have declined by 53,000 since before the recession.  The McCarthy report on the disposal of State assets indicated that our real GDP should be 42% higher in 2013 than it is likely to be.  The Minister is attempting an incredible degree of adjustment.</P>
        <P>I am particularly interested in measures to prevent a recurrence of the disasters which began with the wholesale guarantee of financial institutions three years ago last Friday and culminated in our rescue by the EU and IMF on 1 December last year.  I accept what Senator O&rsquo;Donnell said about all of that.  In terms of enhanced governance, I hope this House will play a substantial role in ensuring greater scrutiny of Government decision-making.  It is strange to reflect that on the night of the guarantee one Minister was in Sandymount and another, a constituency colleague of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was in Limerick, when they received a knock on the door asking them to sign off on the Cabinet decision.  It is not clear how many Ministers attended the Cabinet meeting.  We in the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform have found it difficult even to obtain the records of what happened that night.  The decision that was made was subsequently criticised by Christine Lagarde and Alistair Darling as excessive.  Moreover, it is my understanding that a memorandum of understanding from 1 June 2008 indicates that at that time, the various Central Banks and Finance Ministers in Europe were agreed that this was a European problem.  I hope the Minister will reactivate that memorandum of 1 June 2008 in the Department&rsquo;s archive.  The bottom line is that we mistakenly nationalised what was a Europe-wide problem.</P>
        <P>Moral hazard is an important issue in all of this.  If the bankers, builders, lawyers, auctioneers and senior public servants who caused this problem are all exempted from the consequences and they are borne by ordinary taxpayers, have we any guarantee they will not do it again? <Col N="639"/> NAMA is appalling, as it has brought in the same developers and employed the same legal firms and auctioneers.  That sends all the wrong signals.  I would like the two zombie banks to be sold immediately and NAMA shut down.  We must build a new economy and the people who caused all the problems cannot be allowed to get away and they cannot be rewarded for their inefficiency.</P>
        <P>I am a member of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and representatives of the banks have appeared before us.  They do not get it; they do not realise the damage they have done to this country.  AIB is looking for a salary of &euro;690,000 for its new chief executive officer and I will support the Minister right down the line regarding his position on that.  This is outrageous.  We want so-called Captain Mainwaring banks or utility banks and not casino banks and I do not see why anyone running one of them would need to earn more than the Taoiseach or Ministers.  I acknowledge what the Minister has done in this regard.</P>
        <P>I am still waiting, as is the Minister, for the chartered accountants regulatory body to report.  Accountants prepared accounts for these zombie banks.  There have been cases of people acquiring companies that had dud accounts who successfully sued the accountants.  That should not be ruled out on behalf of the taxpayer.  The fact that the accountants still cannot tell us three years later through the regulatory body whether there was impropriety in the preparation of those accounts is appalling.  Most independent analysis says there was.</P>
        <P>I note the IMF reference to the comprehensive review of expenditure.  There are concerns that the spending Departments have slowed it down and that it might not be published.  We need it to be published and if the Minister is under pressure not to publish, I ask him to resist those requests because we must have a full discussion as to how a country had to borrow 32% of GDP last year  because of its banks.  I acknowledge that was exceptional but we cannot keep borrowing at this level.  Expenditure must be analysed and subject to scrutiny.</P>
        <P>According to the an bord snip nua report, the number of senior civil servants increased by 82% between 1997 and 2009 and number of civil servants overall by 27%.  The growth of senior bureaucracy at the expense of front-line services in the education and health systems has been notorious.  This part of the report should be investigated.  The Wright report highlighted the lack of economic competence in the Civil Service.  It found only 7% of civil servants in the Department of Finance had such competence as opposed to 60% in the corresponding department in Canada.  We badly need to upgrade in this regard given the size of the task faced by the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform referred to people being captured by lobbying.  The banks had inordinate influence over economic policy on that dreadful night three years ago.  The construction industry had such influence prior to that and the Galway tent was the embodiment of that.  Tax lawyers and accountants also have influence.  It is estimated that they have successfully chiselled &euro;12.8 billion out of recent budgets in tax expenditures.  This was done secretly and the proposals were not debated openly.  When members of the tax commission raised this, the representatives of tax lawyers and accountants on the commission said these loopholes could not be abolished because they made their living out of them.  It is unproductive for them to be this powerful as they are depriving the Exchequer of money it needs.  Will the Minister examine this?</P>
        <P>Yesterday the metro north project was given final approval but it has been hopelessly analysed in economic terms.  The pressure being put on the Minister is based on the belief that because so much money has been spent, we cannot stop now.  We need a central project evaluation office.  Such projects should not be analysed by the promoters or by the Departments seeking to secure them, as happens now; this should be done independently.  The analysis <Col N="640"/>should be available for a year and everyone could examine it to ascertain whether it represents value for money.  The current way of deciding on large projects, including compensating the partners in roads schemes because the volumes of traffic were incorrectly predicted, should fall under the Minister&rsquo;s scrutiny.  Public private partnerships combine the worst of both worlds with dud projects getting through.  They are similar to hire purchases where the projects eventually cost much more than they would have if the State had undertaken them with proper project appraisal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must address why we were rescued by the IMF across a wide range of fronts, for which I commend the Minister.  A great deal of work remains to be done on the public finances and he has to be hard &mdash; public opinion wishes him to be harder &mdash; on banks, accountants, property developers and their lawyers.  Yesterday the issue of the jailing of the lady from Tullamore, County Offaly, was raised, yet the people who brought the country to its knees are still walking around.  The Minister would have support if he adopted a much tougher regime for the people concerned.  That is part of what everyone wants &mdash; measures to prevent a recurrence.  What happened between September 2008 and December 2010 must never be allowed to happen again.  We need new institutions to cope with such eventualities.  I wish the Minister every success and I will support him in that regard.</P>

	<P>I thank all Senators for their contributions and I hope to answer the questions of other Senators once I have made my initial response.  There are many questions but some Members went over the same ground.  I will give a quick run through and if I leave anything out, they can remind me and I will come back to it.</P>
        <P>The jobs initiative was funded by and large, as Senator O&rsquo;Brien said, by a levy of 0.6% on pensions.  Nobody likes tax but the initiative had to be paid for.  There is no money under the mattress anymore and there are no untapped sources of income around.  If we decide that unemployment is the greatest problem we have and we want it addressed, initiatives such as this have to be paid for.  If we will the ends, we have to will the means.  We decided to pay for the jobs initiative in this way rather than taxing work.  Anything directed towards income tax and so on would be a straight tax on work.  This is a minor provision.  There is a great deal of money in pension funds but 41% of funds are built up because of tax relief given at the marginal rate to people who subscribe to pensions.  Of every &euro;1,000 in a pension fund, &euro;410 is supplied by the taxpayer and we are taking &euro;6 back a year for four years.  That is reasonable, especially when the money is being dedicated to the creation of jobs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are always lobbies and the industry is lobbying hard but the industry is taking far more in charges than 0.6% and if the industry wanted to absorb some of this it had the discretion to do so.  The problem with a lot of politics in this country is that as soon as a lobby group gears up and starts e-mailing Senators and Deputies, the Senators and Deputies run around to the front of the lobby group and lead the charge without realising the facts.</P>

	<P>Did the Minister see the Tara Mines statement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator asked other questions about the effectiveness of the jobs initiative.  Anybody who got even a week&rsquo;s holidays this summer will be aware that it had a big impact on the hospitality industry.  There were more people in coffee shops, bars and restaurants this summer.  People were going out again and they were spending.  It was a confidence builder but it also reduced the prices.  We began to get the tourism industry moving again.  It declined about 30% since 2007.  We do not have final figures yet but it appears there was a return of at least 10% or 12%, if not more, varying from region to region.  It was very successful.</P>
        <P>As to whether the VAT reductions are being passed on, by and large in the food business, the hospitality business and the hotel bedroom business it appears it is being passed on but we are not going to put 1,000 inspectors on the road to check who is and is not passing on the reduction.  Some people did not pass it on but they stayed in business because it gave them the extra margin.  They would have been closing down with a loss of jobs.  That is a valid way of doing business as well.  Things are so strained in the hospitality and tourism industries I do not believe anyone is profiting out of it.  The vast bulk of people passed it on in full.  Some people partially passed it on.  Others employed extra people and did not pass it on.  Others stayed afloat.  There is no exact science in this but overall it seems to be working.</P><Col N="643"/>
        <P Just="Left">We had other initiatives about shovel ready projects in schools, insulation of houses and so on.  The only objective evidence we have is the round of unemployment figures published yesterday which indicated a reduction of 33,000 in the live register, the biggest reduction since figures were first calculated.</P>
        <P>All we can say about unemployment is that it is too high at 14% but it is stabilising, and the jobs initiative was a contributor to that but it is an inexact science.  I will put it this way to the Senator.  If we keep doing the same things we always did we will never get out of this crisis.  We will have no chance, and therefore we have to try new initiatives.  It was a brave initiative to cut the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9%, and it had to be paid for, but it was worth doing rather than saying we will do what we always did, pray and hope it will go away.  It will not go away.  We must think outside the box in this crisis.  We have to do different things in different ways.  A compliment paid to me when the jobs initiative was announced was from one of the Senator&rsquo;s former fellow Senators who stated: &ldquo;Why did we not do all those things when we were in government?&rdquo;  We must think differently, and we will do other things as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Who was that?  Tell me.  I will have a word with him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Order, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will tell the Senator privately.</P>
        <P>NewERA is another example of new thinking, and I hope it works.  The concept is simple.  There is money in the pension fund.  There is money that we hope we will be allowed use from the sale of State assets.  We do not have a bob to put into any kind of stimulus package in the economy to develop new infrastructure, and we are trying to fund it in a different way.  We are using the resources of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and of the pension fund, which is skilled in measuring investment to determine if we can develop new initiatives, and it will be geared towards modern infrastructure.  It is the beginning of an initiative and I hope it runs fairly well.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators asked about strategic investment, and the Senator asked about micro-finance.  The people now in NewERA tell me they will have proposals for a strategic investment fund very shortly which they will forward to the Department.  I hope that involves elements of micro-financing as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Brien also referred to the position in Europe and alleged that no decisions were taken in Luxembourg.  Many decisions were taken in Luxembourg and the Senator will see the decisions emerging as the weeks go by.  It is clear already that there is now a commitment to recapitalise the European banks which are impaired.  That is an important decision.  To my mind the wrong question has been asked.  The big question in recent weeks is what Europe will do about Greece.  That is the wrong question.  The question is what Europe should do about the eurozone and if that question is answered, Greece falls into context.  In terms of what Europe should do about the eurozone, it should recapitalise the impaired banks, build a financial firewall against contagion because we saw what happened when the contagion spread from Greece to Italy and Spain, and then in parallel it should sort out the Greek situation.  It should then move on to the governance issues, as Senator Barrett stated, in order that there is a system in Europe to ensure all of this does not happen again and that we do not have a recurring tragedy every four or five years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>A Greek tragedy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not want a Greek tragedy every four or five years.  We must make sure it does not happen again, and that is the governance issues.  The six pack of measures <Col N="644"/>for Governments was adopted at the Luxembourg ECOFIN.  It will come through the Houses of the Oireachtas because we will have to legislate to put it in place but that is a very strong element of governance and it will have to continue.</P>
        <P>The fifth item, and I put these on the agenda in Europe, is that we cannot live by austerity alone.  There must be a European plan to make economies grow and the responsibility will have to be taken by the big, strong economies to make it grow.  Greece will fall into place when all that is done.</P>
        <P>There seems to be a change of mindset in Europe now.  They seem to be addressing the recapitalisation and from remarks passed by the European director of the International Monetary Fund it appears they are looking at building the wall against contagion as well in some form.  I hope a lot will happen in the coming weeks because if it does not, we are facing an unmitigated disaster.  I certainly hope that does not happen.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator spoke about the two pillar banks being too dominant and so on.  In restructuring the banks all we can feasibly manage is two pillar banks but some competition will be provided by the overseas banks still operating in Ireland, and I hope that side would build up.  There are issues of competition that can be validly raised and what used to be called the third banking force is very important but the combination of the foreign banks still trading here would fill that gap in the market.  I hope the foreign banks do not withdraw from Ireland.  I want to encourage overseas banks that have branches here to continue trading.  They are very important.  Senator D&rsquo;Arcy said they have a different way of dealing with impaired mortgages than the pillar banks, which I was glad to hear.</P>
        <P>The Senator spoke about the commitment in the programme for Government to additional tax relief for persons who took out mortgages between 2004 and 2008.  Income tax would not be changed in mid-year.  These are budgetary matters and they will be examined in the context of the budget.</P>
        <P>The issue of what to do with people in difficulty with their mortgages has been the subject of a report within the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>We have that report and it will go to Government on Tuesday.  I hope to publish it soon after that and have a full debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  No party has property rights over the difficulties of mortgage holders.  A set of ideas will come from the expert group but I will take on board any ideas Senator or TDs might bring forward because this is a pressing issue that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>The figure of 55,000 mortgages in arrears is quoted by the Central Bank.  This represents 45,000 people or families because some people have two mortgages.  The figure of 55,000 is not quite accurate because there is a doubling up of mortgages.  While 45,000 is a big number, it is manageable if we take the right initiatives and the proposals will be fully debated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator D&rsquo;Arcy had some good ideas and comments about Europe.  I talked about the mortgage situation and I take his point on the black market.  There are two parts to the black economy: those who are working and not paying tax and those who are working, not paying tax and drawing welfare.  The second category is the more damaging.  It is also true, however, and I am not trying to excuse people, that when we start to come out of a recession, initial activity is often in the black economy because people get three or four days work and do not sign off.  After a while, when they get continuous work, especially in the building trade, they move out of the black economy and become legitimate taxpayers.  The Revenue Commissioners are aware of this; I have had discussions with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners on this and they are watching it.  It might be necessary to change the welfare rules as well in order <Col N="645"/>that it is easier to move in and out of welfare payments if a person is getting intermittent casual work.  I also agree with Senator D&rsquo;Arcy on the importance of sport and culture.  It is great for the image of Ireland and there is a strong economic aspect to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien talked about charities and she is right.  A group of officials from the Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the charities are examining these issues and we can ask the group to look at this VAT issue.  A second group is dealing with philanthropy.  We might be able to do something about this when the budget is being introduced.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donnell talked about NAMA.  We could talk about NAMA and the various theories thereon all night.  I am not sure NAMA was the correct solution but it was set up under law and the Bill went through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is a great legal substructure holding it up now and part of that relates to confidentiality of their dealings and the fact the agency cannot be lobbied.  The former Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Frank Daly, is the Chairman of NAMA and he is an open, decent man and a good public servant.  He agreed when I discussed it with him to provide information to Senators and TDs and there is a specific email address and telephone number for public representatives and they are entitled to information.  They are forbidden under law from lobbying but they are entitled to information, which is a way around much of the confidentiality restriction.  If someone feels he has been wronged, he can get a read-out by getting a public representative to make a telephone call.  He is legally protected because this has been officially agreed.</P>
        <P>The business plan for dealing with developers, where they are given a sum of money to run their impaired business on behalf of NAMA, is controversial but the alternative is to place them into receivership and the fee for receivers is &euro;180 per hour.  When we start adding up all the hours that receivers would work, we can see the sense in having the developer who knows his own assets working for &euro;100,000.  Most of them are getting between &euro;75,000 and &euro;100,000, with two getting more than &euro;100,000, one of whom is on &euro;200,000 because he is looking after a huge portfolio of assets.  A lot of things happened earlier where assets were transferred to spouses and money was sent abroad.  Part of the deal in the negotiations was that an awful lot of this stuff has come back into the control of NAMA.  It is a work in progress.</P>
        <P>Also, NAMA is now starting to get stuff on to the market.  The deal in London was a good one.  Even though it had a loan book of &euro;75 billion, it paid about &euro;30 billion for it.  When it sells, it tries to sell assets at a profit and will take as much as it can get.  It is not trying to recover &euro;30 billion; it is trying to recover everything.  NAMA does not own property, it owns the loan books underpinning it.  I would prefer if there was a more systematic way to get the Irish property market moving again.  NAMA is such a big player that until it is in a position to get actively involved, there will not be much movement in the property market.</P>
        <P>Upward only rent reviews make it hard for purchasers to price anything in Ireland.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will be making an announcement on that shortly; legislation is in preparation in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office but once there is an announcement we will have some clarity.  If someone comes from America to buy a shopping centre, if the law is changed to allow rent to go down as well as up, the value of the entire enterprise goes down.  That would inhibit sales and must be clarified.</P>
        <P>A senior international banker has spent the last ten days examining NAMA for me.  I am to meet him tomorrow evening and he will advise me.  He is over in the castle for other purposes with the diaspora but he has a great deal of experience with this so I will get a better read-out of it.  I do not propose to change the legislation yet.  In the last three months NAMA has moved more efficiently than was previously the case.  The people who work for it are above reproach, they are good public servants who are working very hard.  It is a colossal task.</P><Col N="646"/>
        <P>Senator Mac Conghail asked about the pre-budget outlook and the expenditure review.  That is all the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s area.  Currently we are looking at how we get this material into the Houses to be discussed.  It is a work in progress but the idea is to make the data available and to have debates on them.  We are not quite sure of a timeframe for that but we do not intend to hold it like a bad hand of cards until budget day; the information will be released as we go along.  We must make decisions on the capital side, then the current side and the taxation side.  As we project forward from 2012 to 2015, there will be a lot of material.  In the middle of that, the troika will be here for ten days and we must run ideas past them.  We will move out commitments in the programme that we inherited and do not want.</P>
        <P>For example, the &euro;250 million per annum for income tax increases.  While, as the Taoiseach has stated, the Government does not want to introduce income tax increases in the next budget, we will have to get the permission of the troika to have that provision removed.  While I do not believe we will have any difficulty in that regard we will, as it is provided for in the programme, have to include tax measures of equal value in order to have it removed, which is what the troika will be interested in.  The troika will not insist on income tax increases but will insist that the replacement adds up.  We have gone through this before with the troika and do not believe we will have any particular difficulty in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Members may be aware a new fiscal council has been established.  The fiscal council will produce its first report some time in October.  With the troika and fiscal council, we must get our ducks in a row before we can make available material which will allow for a real contribution from elected Members.  I can assure Members that we will not hand it all down in one parcel on budget day.  There will be information available prior to that but nothing has yet been arranged.</P>
        <P>Senators also asked about multi-annual funding.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, is interested in moving towards multi-annual budgeting.  That will be the next step after the expenditure review which is examining all programmes.  This will ensure we do not have the annual bone fight of Departments with the Department of Finance about the small modules of expenditure which are either add-ons or cutbacks.  It will be much better if we could budget for three years.  The programme which we will be producing for 2012-2015 will contain elements of this.</P>
        <P>Senator Gilroy made an interesting contribution on social investment.  My officials have taken note of the points he made, which are important.  We will take a look at it to see what scope is there.  I thank Senator Barrett for his support.  I have already dealt with the Government&rsquo;s problems.  Moral hazard is one of the big issues.  We must ensure we do not have a recurrence of what happened in the past.  The Senator is correct that, by and large, it is the ordinary taxpayer who made no contribution to the decisions that got us into this difficulty that is paying the heaviest price.  Many of those involved walked away free.  Many other people have also paid prices, including people who had bank shares.  They were completely wiped out.  Many elderly people who were encouraged by their bank managers to buy shares because there was a bigger coupon on the dividend than if they left their money in a deposit account had their life savings wiped out.  Anglo Irish Bank shares were completely wiped out, Allied Irish Banks shares are now only worth pennies and Bank of Ireland shares are down to 10 cent.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donnell referred to the good bargain that foreign investors got in Bank of Ireland.  It was on the market for a long time and no one wanted to invest so I do not believe it was a great bargain.  They paid ten cents for shares.  At what they are being quoted today one could still make a profit, if the Senator is interested in a punt.  The &euro;3 billion plus put into Bank of Ireland by the previous Government is not all lost; some of it remains in the bank by way of preference shares.  In the deal, we have maintained the preference share position.  I believe approximately 10% off that is being paid to the Exchequer.</P><Col N="647"/>
        <P Just="Left">At some point, we will realise that investment and get the money back.  In normal circumstances, as Bank of Ireland begins to trade profitably again, investor advice will be for it to buy the preference shares from the State because they are costing the bank too much in terms of the interest rate, which is higher than the market rate.  An incentive is built in to encourage the new owners to rid themselves of the preference shares.  I am hopeful we will get a good tranche of money back in the future.  We will not recover it all.  The money put in as straight capital is gone; it has been wiped out.  However, the money put in as preference shares is recoverable.  It is hoped as we move forward that we will get a return on the 15% we are holding as capital values increase.  That was a policy decision.  We could have sold the lot and left the State with nothing but we thought because of the money already invested that we should hold 15% of the bank so that as capital values increase we would begin to recover our money.  We will see how that goes.  Bank of Ireland is trading well and is attracting money on the wholesale market.  It is doing well.  We need to keep chasing Allied Irish Banks to ensure it keeps pace and provides an effective pillar bank.</P>
        <P>While I have not answered all questions, that is all I wish to say that this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his comprehensive overview of the banking sector.  My questions are on the credit union sector and the imminent credit institutions Bill.</P>
        <P>There has been much talk of the credit unions being in a great deal of bother owing to investments they made.  Credit unions are run by volunteers.  There are not too many chartered accountants, barristers or qualified experts involved in credit unions.  The credit unions paid Davy&rsquo;s a high price for advice and lost the vast majority of their money in a product known as the Central Treasury Management Fund, which was approved by the Financial Regulator in March 2006.  Can the Minister guarantee, by way of the proposed credit institutions Bill, that Joe and Josephine, just as they have done for the past 20 or 30 years, will be able to go to their credit union this Christmas for a loan of, say, &euro;1,000?  Will he remove the regulation that forbids credit unions from renegotiating terms and conditions on loans?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister stated that changes are being implemented by the EFSF and EFSM to allow for longer loan maturities.  While there are costs associated with this, borrowing over a longer term horizon is typically more expensive.  The lengthening of maturities is beneficial from a cashflow perspective, as well as ensuring that the profile of redemptions is more orderly.  In other words, the benefits exceed the costs.  A report published last week states that there is approximately &euro;1 billion of arrears on loans in credit unions.  People are in arrears because credit unions are forbidden to extend terms and conditions on loans.  Can the Minister guarantee that Joe and Josephine will be able to get their credit union loan of &euro;1,000 this Christmas and will he remove the regulation that forbids credit unions from extending the terms and conditions of loans?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  While there is much I would like to speak about, I will, because there are many Members wishing to ask questions, confine myself to questions to the Minister.  With the recapitalisation of European banks likely at this stage, can the Minister guarantee that the template used for Irish banks, if adjusted by the troika, will be retrospectively visited if a sweeter deal is done for the stakeholders in the European banks?  I fear that while stakeholders here were clubbed by the troika in the template designed for Ireland an easier deal may be put in place to deal with the European banks.  Can the Minister guarantee that if that is the case it can be retrospectively adjusted in favour of the stakeholders here?  The Minister referred earlier to the various shareholdings wiped out here.</P><Col N="648"/>
        <P Just="Left">The expert group&rsquo;s report will go to the Cabinet next week, after which it will be discussed in the House.  Can we have tangible, visible action from banks to deal with people in mortgage difficulties?  It has been stated that those engaged in mortgage arrears resolution processes with banks are being given alternatives, but they are not.  It is a superficial engagement in which the bank determines to move on because someone is a financial basket case and cannot operate.  Can the same level of openness be applied when dealing with people with distressed mortgages as was applied to Ireland when the repayment period for the national debt was extended with a consequential interest rate reduction?</P>
        <P>As the German Government did previously, will our Government consider applying a maximum chargeable interest rate on all lending?  The Minister is aware that 187% is legally chargeable for short-term lending.  As can be borne out by research, this promotes the black economy, in particular illegal moneylending.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his comprehensive response to the questions and statements of spokespersons.  They covered a wide range of topics.  I also thank the Minister for clarifying that information on the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, will be made available to Members.  I do not know whether all colleagues were aware that there would be a hotline, as it were, to NAMA.</P>
        <P>The report of the new fiscal council is due in October.  Will it be available for Senators to debate in the House?  The Minister might have stated it would be, but I am seeking clarification.  It is important that information be made available before budget day so that people are not taken by surprise.</P>
        <P>I have spoken with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, about a Tobin tax on international financial transactions.  What is the State&rsquo;s view on such a tax?  It has always appeared to be a commendable idea, but it is difficult in practice, particularly where there is a large financial services industry.  There have been moves at EU level to progress the concept of an international tax.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s opinion and what view will Ireland take if this matter arises at EU level?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Sheahan asked about the credit union movement.  The restructuring of the banks has been mentioned.  The last element of the financial retail industry that must be restructured is the credit unions.  It is an open secret that while the credit unions have done wonderful work down the years and one could not be complimentary enough about the volunteers who give of their time to provide credit lines to their neighbours when the latter could not get them by any traditional way through the banking system, a difficulty has arisen in some of them.  If the movement was one large bank with individual branches, it would have no problems because the good ones would balance the bad ones, but individual credit unions have problems that are coming down the road quickly.</P>
        <P>From a policy point of view, there have been a number of occurrences.  In June, a commission was set up to examine the credit unions.  On it sit representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, the Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, and the other large credit union body.  The commission has made an interim report, which will be put before the Government on Tuesday and, hopefully, will be published and fully debated.  It sets out the commission&rsquo;s first cut at what it perceives as the set of problems and what needs to be done in a regulatory way.  Subsequently, the commitment is to have credit union legislation before Christmas.  The commission will continue its work until approximately April, at which point it will make a final report on the overall credit union policy parameters.</P><Col N="649"/>
        <P>Matters have been overtaken by events.  The Central Bank has requested that we use the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill 2011, Report Stage of which will be debated on Wednesday, to give it additional powers to deal with credit unions that are on the brink and that it foresees entering into difficulty before the main legislation can be passed ahead of Christmas.  The Central Bank must span that gap.  I moved amendments on Committee Stage last week to address this issue.  They were broad stroke amendments.  Now that we have had more time and consulted with the credit union movement, we will narrow the focus of the amendments on Report Stage and remove some of the elements to which the movement objects.  On reflection, bits of the amendments are unnecessary to meet what we must in the coming weeks.  We will be taking other measures in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Minister is not the regulator of the credit unions.  The Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the Registrar of Credit Unions form the regulator.  I cannot guarantee the Senator that the regulator of the credit unions will provide &euro;1,000 for the family at Christmas that has always relied on that money to carry it through Christmas.  Yesterday, I answered questions in the Lower House.  The regulator has issued directions to more than 50% of credit unions instructing them to limit the amount they can advance to particular customers.  Some of the seriously impaired credit unions have been limited to &euro;1,000, but that is low.  I will ask my officials to speak informally with the people who issued these directives to increase the amount to a more reasonable ceiling and to allow negotiations within those parameters.</P>
        <P>It is not a one size fits all situation.  Some credit unions have no problems and others are on the brink of falling down a hole, to put it in its bluntest terms.  They must be treated differently.  I will inquire into the matter of negotiating the terms of loans.  I do not know whether it is down to advice based on best practice or the imposition by banks of a statutory regulation, but I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s request.  I am not the regulator.  All I can do is ask people to deal with an issue I have encountered.  I cannot direct in any way, as doing so would be interference with the credit unions.</P>
        <P>I am pro-credit unions and I intend to sort them out.  Some of them will need to be dealt with immediately, but we will not do it in one big bang.  My advice is that this will cost between &euro;500 million and &euro;1 billion.  The major element of sorting them out will be their recapitalisation.  The amount is small in contrast with the banks, but it is still a big hunk of money.  Since we recapitalised the banks for less than expected, we have a bit in hand for the credit unions and will not need to revert to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>The dialogue has been good.  We all have contacts in the credit union movement.  Often, one needs information to filter through to Dublin.  Even though there are large credit unions in Dublin, one gets more information from the credit union in the small town or community that knows exactly what is happening.</P>
        <P>The intention is to secure the future of the credit unions along the lines I have suggested.  We will proceed with amendments on Report Stage to meet the needs of the many people who have called and spoken with me.  When we publish the interim report, it will give Senators a great deal of information that they can solidly debate.  We will legislate before Christmas.  In parallel, the regulator and the Central Bank will take action.  We will recapitalise the credit unions over a period and put them on a firm footing again.  This will probably involve consolidation, in that small credit unions may need to merge and we may need a hub-and-spoke system.  These decisions have not been taken, but they are around.  A large credit union would be the regional leader with IT and risk management centralised to it.  However, smaller credit unions would draw from that central resource but would still operate independently in their own communities.  A number of ideas have been put forward, and we will wait for the com<Col N="650"/>mission&rsquo;s report to see how we will do it.  It is a very important topic and I am glad the Senator asked the question.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry asked three questions, the first being on whether we can get back in the game retrospectively and ensure we did not settle hard while others settle soft if a better deal is done in Europe on the recapitalisation of the banks.  We have no guarantee on this and we have had no discussions on it.  However, the Senator will notice I have been positioning a renegotiation of the promissory note on Anglo Irish Bank and I think this will be the door through which we might be able to go because it amounts to &euro;30 billion.  If we had a different arrangement on this we could lessen the debt burden.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether Europe would retrospectively take shares in AIB.  This and the previous Government recapitalised AIB to the tune of approximately &euro;20 billion.  It has been very expensive and I suppose its market value is much less than &euro;1 billion at present.  I have been trying to anticipate the possibility of what Senator MacSharry has stated.  I am trying to develop alternatives that we might arrive at the same solution, but there is no sign yet that there will be a softer deal anywhere else with the exception of Greece whose banking system is in much difficulty.</P>
        <P>This morning&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i> mentioned a twin track approach whereby banks in smaller countries would be given the facility from the EFSF which we received to recapitalise banks, while recapitalisation funds for banks in larger countries would be a matter for their national governments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of other Senators have questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator already asked three questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that but I want to make a very important point.  The troika prescribed the level of capital that would be required for recapitalisation far in advance so the markets cleaned the shareholder.  This will probably not be the process used this time, to the advantage of the European banks and their shareholders and the people in Europe.  On this point we should look for something and I am sure the Minister will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know what the Senator is saying.  There is no easy way through this and no button we can press to avail of it but I am conscious of what the Senator has said.  Issues arise from it.</P>
        <P>The report of the interdepartmental group on impaired mortgages will be published next week and we will debate it in both Houses.  We will see what comes of it.  The idea is that it is not a report to be put on the shelf.  As soon as we debate it in the Houses we will try to put a timeline on implementation and move from an interdepartmental group to an implementation group so we are not merely entertaining ourselves by debating it.  A real need exists and we must get on with it, particularly with regard to new solvency and new bankruptcy legislation because this is the key starting position.  It must be a priority.</P>
        <P>I will examine what the Senator stated about extraordinarily high legal interest rates of 187% and see whether anything can be done about this.  Normally, an interest rate is a measure of risk so a super high interest rate would suggest a super high risk.  There is a connection and I do not know what is valid and whether one can limit it.  If the amount of interest charged is limited one might eliminate risk and encourage people to borrow wildly without being aware of the risk.</P><Col N="651"/>
        <P>To answer Senator Bacik, the fiscal council is independent.  I understand how it will proceed, as it will arrive at its conclusions and publish a report.  It is within the competence of the Seanad to decide to debate the published report.  It does not have to be tracked through the Department of Finance because it is independent.  The Seanad will be free to deal with it as it sees fit.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Tobin tax, last week the Commission published its proposals on a financial transaction tax and I assume information on this is available on its website.  Our attitude is that if there was a move towards a financial transaction tax it would be better if it was organised by a group such as the G20 and applied worldwide.  If it was to be a European tax, it would be very important to Ireland&rsquo;s interests that it applied to the 27 member states and not the 17 eurozone states.  I would be very nervous of a transaction tax existing in Dublin but not in London.  It is the type of industry that can move with the click of a finger from computer to computer.  It can be switched overnight to a new office in London handling what was previously handled in Dublin.  This displacement effect must be considered.</P>
        <P>There is no agreement in Europe on this.  It is the usual story of various countries having differing views.  The UK is very much against a transaction tax while France is very much in favour of it and other countries such as Ireland are watching their interests to ensure if it is introduced it will be under the best possible circumstances.  Recommendations have also been made on the proceeds.  The Commission has recommended it would be a Europe-wide tax for funding the European budget.  We have always maintained the position that the European budget should be built up by contributions from the sovereign countries in proportion to their rating.  We would not like to move to it being funded by Europe-wide taxation because that is only a couple of steps from tax harmonisation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and welcome him to the House.  I like the way he tells it the way it is but I do not always like what he tells us.  He is in the midst of budget preparations and I would like to take this opportunity to remind him of child benefit payment.  Child benefit is based on the principle of horizontal equity and is about income distribution from those without children to those with children, because many of us will benefit through our pensions from those children when they grow up.  It cannot be looked at simplistically.  Often it is proposed to tax or means test child benefit but as the Children&rsquo;s Right Alliance has proved, this would be a very costly administrative exercise and the previous Government eventually came around to this position.  I can provide the Minister with much research on this from the UK and other countries.  Will the Minister confirm that child benefit payment should remain universal and paid equally to all children?  As the Supreme Court stated, child benefit is children&rsquo;s money and it should be paid equally to all children and not taxed.</P>

	<P>Child poverty increased to 9% in 2009 from 6% in 2008 and is expected to increase again.  Will the Minister pay particular attention to not reducing vital budgets such as child income supports and services for vulnerable children?  Perhaps I will be able to speak more to the Minister about this on another opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the Central Bank keeping an eye on its money, and we are all aware of its abysmal record in not preventing the economic meltdown, recently it advertised online &mdash; where very few people would see it &mdash; for consultants to upgrade its offices.  Does the Minister know about this?  How much will it cost?  Is it necessary given all the offices which are vacant?  We know that if one watches the pennies, the pounds will look after themselves.  We know how the Central Bank did not keep an eye on our money, and it looks as <Col N="652"/>though it has not learned a lesson.  When it was asked how much this work, which will take a few years, will cost, the Central Bank answered that it did not know the scale or value of the framework.  It did not know the scale or value of the economic meltdown.  If it does not know the scale or value of what it proposes to spend itself, how can we trust it to handle our finances?  The Minister may not know the answer to this today but I ask him to please inquire and inform the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to credit unions, a small handful of credit unions will be affected by the measure being introduced.  When the regulator goes about the job, I do not want to see Deputies and Senators complaining about the regulator and arguing that a particular credit union had been doing a great job.  We need to support and uphold the independent regulator and wish it well in its work.  Too often we are tied down by local interests.</P>
        <P>I refer to the jobs initiative and the moneys from the pension levy.  The total cost of the measures in the jobs initiative is &euro;379 million.  Fianna F&aacute;il had promised to allocate a total of &euro;124 million out of the &euro;379 million.  Like the summer works scheme for schools, Fianna F&aacute;il had already promised this work but the Government dressed it up as a jobs budget.  The cost of the additional measures is &euro;255 million.</P>

	<P>I remind Senator Bacik that this is a very important point because it is a rip-off of workers and of pensioners.  Instead of creating jobs, the pension levy is being used to improve the Exchequer figures by approximately &euro;200 million in 2011.  This is an unfair imposition on pensioners.  The Tara mines pensioners in my own constituency have received a 10% cut in their pensions as a result.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to preface my questions to the Minister by offering him a very personal and very belated thanks for the attention he gave to cancer services when he was Minister for Health.  On his first day as Minister he made a speech which has been forgotten <Col N="653"/>but should not be in which he was the first person from the public side of governance to acknowledge the disaster which was our cancer treatment service.  He set out his stall with regard to attempting to fix it and I wish to offer him my thanks for his courage and foresight.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to ask two financial questions.  The first relates to privately held pension funds.  I have been doing some research and at a time of a significant shortage of liquidity or money or solvency, whatever one wishes to call it, it is estimated that &euro;100 billion is held in pension funds by Irish private pension investors.  This money has been legally collected with the assistance of various tax incentives over the years and this investment is regarded as part of a prudent provision for people&rsquo;s old age.  A total of 95% of that money is held outside the State and mostly held in foreign investments.  Many of the people who made these prudent personal investments took the advice from people who in previous generations were to be trusted, such as bank managers, mortgage advisers, real estate agents, that they should buy real estate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;using different rules.  Will the Minister consider amending current pension law to allow people in negative equity and who are in danger of losing their home many years before they can access their pension funds, to be given premature access to that fund?  This would give the Minister tax revenue and it would improve liquidity in the banks and reduce personal debt.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister consider ending the practice of mandatory retirement in the public service which is age-based?  I belatedly congratulate the Minister on his 68th birthday last May.  I note he is a vigorous, fit, very active man but if he were a consultant neurologist or psychiatrist he would have been caring for his roses for the past three years, which would have been a terrible waste for this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for the lucidity he brings to a very complex area.  The Institute of Taxation has indicated this week that the Minister will have very little wriggle room for getting more taxation from the system.  It suggests he should look at the VAT rates as being the only area in which he will have some wriggle room, despite the EU.  I refer to his comments relating to the beneficial impact of the reduction in the service VAT rate to 9% which has created jobs.  The restaurant association states that 500 new jobs have been created.  Has the Minister any comment to make on the quarterly report of the Central Bank regarding the debate on whether the amount will be &euro;3.6 billion or &euro;4 billion?  Based on his earlier comments, will he be less austere in his approach?  Austerity measures do not stimulate growth.  The figures in the Central Bank report show that the worst tax returns were last year and there is growth in the economy this year.  This can be contrasted with the severe austerity measures in 2008 and 2009 which resulted in a flatlining of the economy.  I accept that these are budgetary issues but I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts.  Ultimately it is all about job creation and protection of the economy.  Has the Minister any views on the capital expenditure programme?  Does he think there should be a more Keynesian approach taken although this seems to be out of favour in Europe?</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on the fine job in restoring the image of our country both at home and abroad.  There is anecdotal evidence that significant sums of money are being lost through various tax avoidance schemes and operations such as diesel fuel laundering, cigarette smuggling, cross-Border activity and VAT scams.  Will the Minister say what sums are involved and what is the loss to the Exchequer?  Are resources being put in place to tackle these criminals who are depriving the country of badly needed revenues at a time when services have to be cut because of falling revenues?</P>
        <P>I support the Minister&rsquo;s comments about credit unions.  I hope we will continue to have a strong and robust credit union movement which has served this country well over the years.  The credit unions are the banks for the small person but they also provide employment in all parts of the country and they must be maintained.</P>

	<P>I thank all the Senators who asked questions.  Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s questions are matters that might be the subject of discussion under the expenditure review and in the first instance, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, is interchanged with the Department of Social Protection.  I do not know of any intention he has to move adversely into that area.  It is a matter I cannot deal with until budget day.  I take the points she raised and I will communicate her views to the Minister and ensure he knows them.</P>
        <P>Regarding Senator Keane&rsquo;s query about the Central Bank, I will ask my officials to supply that information to the Senator.  The Central Bank has a new Governor and a new regulator has been appointed.  They are operating very effectively and are doing good work.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Byrne for his support with regard to the credit unions.  It is very important that the regulatory authorities be supported as they move to recapitalise the credit unions.  Every Senator and Deputy will be lobbied.  It is not so long ago, this time last year, since we were being assured by all the banks that the Irish banking industry was <Col N="655"/>completely different, that there were no impaired loans in Ireland, that Lehman&rsquo;s was an American event and sub-prime lending was an American practice, that we had the best banks in the world and our situation was completely different.  I remember that a fortnight before Anglo Irish Bank went bust, the senior people there briefed the current Taoiseach and my colleague Richard Bruton and gave them absolute assurances that there was no problem and that it was only vicious rumours by trade competitors that were causing the problem.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether they got that advice, but that was the situation.  Many of the credit unions are fine, but several were seriously impaired.  Therefore, one should check the facts before running with what one is told.  There is some mismanagement and, naturally, people who mismanage will give their side of the story.  The issue must be approached systematically.  I appreciate what the Senator said.</P>
        <P>I made it very clear when I announced the jobs initiative that it was costed over a four-year period.  It is a four-year programme rather than a six-month programme.  The Senator is right that there is more revenue available in the six months to the end of this year than is necessary to fund the jobs initiative, but that balances out over the four years.  It has been costed to be fiscally neutral over the four years, but not in the first six months.  Obviously, the jobs initiative came in from 1 July and the levy on the pension fund is a full year levy.  There is nothing new about that and I explained it in detail when we were discussing the jobs initiative and when we had a short finance Bill to implement it.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Crown for his complimentary remarks.  I am glad the original cancer initiative was continued, despite the gap in the middle.  We now seem to have a pretty good cancer treatment service.  I thank the Senator for putting my esteemed age on the record.  I suppose all I can do is return the compliment and say that if it had not been for the Senator&rsquo;s profession, I would probably not be standing here today.</P>

	<P>Senator Mooney asked about the taxation.  There is little enough scope and we have ruled out income tax increases.  Therefore, we will have to look at other tax heads.  The figure of &euro;3.6 billion is the correction in the breakdown, but it is not the target.  The target is a deficit of &euro;8.6 billion.  The &euro;3.6 is a variable and the variation will be upward rather than downward.</P>

	<P>We could go further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a different debate as to whether we would voluntarily go further.  The point I am making is that if we make an adjustment of &euro;3.6 billion, we may not reach a deficit of &euro;8.6 billion.  With that, we have to go further just to arrive at &euro;8.6 billion.  Whether, as a policy measure, it would be desirable to go further is another issue.  We are pitching for the deficit of &euro;8.6 billion.  That is our target and in the breakdown in the programme it is an adjustment of &euro;2.1 billion in expenditure and &euro;1.5 billion in tax measures.  That is how it is made up and we are trying to figure out how to achieve that.  We have not got enough information yet to know precisely what the correction will be, but we are working on the targets in the programme.  It is a secondary issue whether we will go further or not.  There is mixed advice on that.  The IMF says &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  It says going further would take too much demand out of the economy and if we just meet the target, that will be sufficient.  The European authorities, the Commission in particular, are pushing us to go harder.  There are mixed views within the troika and we must make the best judgment ourselves.</P><Col N="656"/>

Therefore, we do not get the ongoing bang that they got in the new deal in America in the 1930s in a closed economy, because any benefits leak out almost straightaway.</P>

	<P>I asked two questions that were not answered.  I asked about the possibility of considering allowing people earlier access to retirement funds if they are in negative equity.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has brought forward a new pension Bill.  While it does not move mandatory retirement, it moves the age upwards and by the mid-2020s the retirement age will be 68 rather than the current age.  Therefore, there is movement in the direction required, but by a different means.  Please remind me of the second question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I asked about allowing citizens who have substantial savings in private pension funds which they cannot access until they are 65, by which time they may have lost their homes, to get early access to those funds.  They could pay the tax, plus a penalty premium for early encashment, thereby giving the Minister tax money, providing liquidity for the banks and reducing personal debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There has been mixed advice on that issue, but I am looking at it.  A proposal in the Fine Gael programme for Government suggested that people would be allowed draw down 2.5% of their fund for each of four consecutive years, a total of 10%.  However, that proposal was not carried forward into the programme for Government.  We are looking at the possibilities.  There is a case for and against.  We do not want to impair pension payments for the future either as that would be a problem.</P>
        <P>Senator D&rsquo;Arcy asked about a constitutional break.  Anything that requires a referendum will be difficult now, especially if it has been suggested by Europe.  However, we will have a fiscal stability Bill before Christmas and we may be able to include the break in legislation rather than putting it by way of referendum into the Constitution.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullins asked about diesel and cigarette smuggling etc.  The Revenue Commissioners are examining that issue and taking action on it.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">People must make up their own minds on that issue.  The big run of retirements from the public service are people who can retire up to February of 2012 and have their pension based on public service pay before the reductions were introduced.  That is the big incentive and quite a lot of people are contemplating that.  I cannot be more accurate than that.</P>
        <P>I will have to get the figure with regard to the number of developers in NAMA, but it is not very big.  I think some 25 developers have 40% of the loan books in NAMA.  It is a small number of people, with a huge quantum of loans and some of those are gone into receivership.  I can get the fuller figures for Senator Coghlan, but I do not have them to hand.

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for permitting me to raise this matter.  I thank him also for allowing me to raise the issue I raised yesterday.  I understand he had to apply some pressure to get the appropriate Minister here.  We do not have any problem with Deputy Noonan, as he has always made himself available to the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister will not take what I say as an attack on the Government, but I have a serious concern with regard to NAMA.  On the record of the Oireachtas committee on finance and on television programmes involving certain developers, the impression has been put abroad &mdash; and I think confirmed &mdash; that the principle of developers paying back all they owe is not being adhered to by NAMA.  What the former Minister, Brian Lenihan, envisaged for NAMA and what he spoke about in legislation was that developers would pay back all of what they owe or that we would do as much as we could to get them to pay back all they owed.  That is the basis on which I would have supported NAMA at the time.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>At least one developer has publically stated that all he has to pay back is what NAMA paid for his loans.  That is concerning on a number of levels because the principle should be that the developer owes what he or she borrowed at the start and that NAMA should be able to make a profit.  There is some evidence that NAMA bought loans at a very low value and it has made profits.  It is of serious concern if NAMA is only enforcing the lower values of developers&rsquo; loans.  It is not the basis upon which I supported NAMA.  The public rightly are annoyed about this because they do not see their mortgages reduced yet developers are on chat shows saying that they only have to pay back what NAMA paid for the loan.  They have received a major write-off.</P>
        <P>I can see the point of NAMA working with developers but they should do this to achieve the best possible financial return to the State.  This is one of the purposes of NAMA in section <Col N="658"/>10 and section 11 of the Act, which I have mislaid and do not have in front of me.  The overriding purpose of NAMA was to achieve the highest possible return to the taxpayer.  It is within the power of the Minister to issue guidelines and directions to NAMA and I wonder whether it is appropriate to assuage the public mood and show sympathy to those with mortgages who are not receiving a reduction.  It will also be the right thing to ask NAMA to go after these guys.  That is what the Legislature intended when it passed the NAMA legislation.  It is certainly what the Minister would have asked for although he opposed the legislation at the time.  It is absolutely what the Fianna F&aacute;il Party asked for, namely, that these developers be pursued &ldquo;to the ends of the earth&rdquo; in the words of the then Minister, Brian Lenihan.  We now see developers on television in a relaxed frame of mind, owing a fortune and saying that they will not have to pay back the full amount.  In some cases they receive a bonus if they pay back more than what NAMA paid.  It is of serious concern.  Under the NAMA legislation, the Minister has it in his power to do something about this.  If an amendment to the legislation is required, the Minister should consider it and he will receive the full support of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party because this is causing considerable disquiet among my colleagues.  It is not what we envisaged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Byrne for raising this issue.  Section 10(2) of the National Asset Management Agency Act provides that NAMA shall obtain the best achievable financial return for the State with regard to its operations.  NAMA assures me that it is fully focused on doing just that.  The chairman of NAMA recently informed the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that it remains the policy of NAMA to pursue developers for the full amount they owe.  A misconception seems to have arisen because the agency&rsquo;s minimum target is to recover what it has paid for the loans, as well as any other moneys advanced as working capital or for development, plus interest on these moneys.  This does not mean, however, that NAMA will stop at that threshold.  NAMA remains as focused as ever on pursuing each developer for the full amount owed.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, this goal must be rooted in reality and the reality is that a large proportion of the nominal value of the loans purchased will not be recovered.  If one looks back at the NAMA business plan published on 30 June 2010, it is clear that full recovery of the nominal value of the total loan book was not envisaged.  That is why the loans were purchased at a discount.</P>
        <P>Within that reality, NAMA assures me that it is determined to recover everything that can be recovered, in order to generate the best achievable financial return for the State.  Where a debtor cannot demonstrate viability or is not co-operating with NAMA, the agency takes enforcement action against the debtor concerned.  By end-August 2011, NAMA had approved the appointment of receivers in 84 cases.</P>
        <P>The alternative to enforcement is to work with the developer, which may seem unpalatable in many cases.  Indeed, the chairman of NAMA recently said that he would love to be able to tell us that the agency could throw out all 850 developers and get someone else to run the businesses.  However, he had to point out that while that could be a very popular decision, it would not make commercial sense because, regardless of what they have done, they are the people who know the business.  Unfortunately, when NAMA decides to work with developers, developers have to be given some incentive to work with NAMA.  Otherwise, they could decide to let NAMA foreclose, with the result of a diminished return for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>The following is an example of how NAMA incentivises a debtor to repay more than the minimum target.  Where NAMA has paid &euro;50 million for a debtor&rsquo;s loans which aggregate to &euro;100 million nominal value, NAMA might set a minimum repayment target of &euro;55 million for the debtor.  If, by year seven, the debtor reaches that minimum repayment target, an incentive arrangement will apply whereby thereafter, the debtor will be allowed to retain 10% of any excess sum realised.  If a total of &euro;60 million is realised, therefore, this is an excess of &euro;5 million <Col N="659"/>over the minimum target and the debtor retains &euro;500,000.  In such a case NAMA&rsquo;s profit will be &euro;9.5 million over the amount paid for the debtor&rsquo;s loans.  This is an example and different repayment targets will apply to different borrowers depending on the particular circumstances of each case.  The key factor in determining what NAMA pays for any debtor&rsquo;s aggregate debt is the current market value of the underlying property securing that debt.  Therefore, if NAMA pays &euro;50 million for the loans, as in the example, it is likely that the value of the underlying property is of the same order.</P>
        <P>Some may see the incentive scheme as being a cash reward for paying back loans.  Unfortunately, if a debtor is not incentivised to exceed a minimum target set by NAMA, the agency believes it will get very little over and above that target.  The objective of the incentive is to get the debtor working not so much for himself or herself but for the taxpayer and NAMA.  NAMA&rsquo;s overarching objective is to maximise the return to the Irish taxpayer.  It assures me that it is determined to achieve that objective as provided for in the NAMA legislation.  Introducing amending legislation to deal with this issue would not generate any additional benefit because legislation cannot force payment from a debtor who cannot pay.  I conclude by reminding the Senator that if all NAMA debtors were capable of repaying the full amount of their loans, there would be no need for NAMA in the first place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">An international banker is examining NAMA and I urge the Minister to get him or her to consider this issue.  Not only are these builders and developers in negative equity, they will be in positive equity if they exceed a certain point.  The negative and positive is a mathematical impossibility but the taxpayer will pay for it.  The Minister is proposing that a developer will get a bonus of &euro;500,000 after providing a very small amount more than what NAMA sets as the minimum target.  I urge the Minister to look at this and change it if possible.  I hope that NAMA has set out the rationale and evidence for this.  NAMA has said that it is the best way to get money back for the taxpayer but it seems reprehensible to me and it is unsatisfactory to the ordinary taxpayer.  Where is the evidence and analysis that shows this?  I hope the Minister has such evidence because, otherwise, this has happened on the Minister&rsquo;s watch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>NAMA is independent under the legislation that established it.  Senator Byrne tabled a question on the Adjournment and NAMA provided me with the information on the point raised by Senator Byrne.  It is not correct to say that NAMA does not try to realise the full amount owed by any debtor.  The intention is to get 100% but we know that that is unrealistic in many cases.</P>

	<P>NAMA must do its best.  It is using market forces to recover as much as it can.  The alternative is to appoint receivers, which costs &euro;180 an hour, and there is no incentive other than to run down the business, sell the assets and give whatever is left to the creditors.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I raise this matter to discuss with the Minister of State the decision to place the headquarters of the new amalgamated Waterford and Wexford VEC in Wexford and not in Waterford city as many people would have hoped for and anticipated.  This issue has been in the public domain for some time and Government representatives from Fine Gael and the Labour Party were quite vociferous that proper sustainable planning and proper spatial strategy should be adhered to.  As a gateway city, Waterford should have been respected as the best and most appropriate place for the headquarters and administrative centre to be placed.</P>
        <P>The decision to place the headquarters in Wexford and not in Waterford was a political decision because a Minister is based in Wexford, and I make no apologies for stating this.  It is quite interesting that representatives from Fine Gael who were in Waterford yesterday and today attacked the Labour Party Minister.  Is this what we in Waterford and the south-east region will have to put up with for the next number of years?  If a health issue arises will Labour Party representatives attack Fine Gael and if an education problem arises will Fine Gael representatives attack the Labour Party?  There is collective responsibility for what happened and for Government decisions but we have this hand washing and Pontius Pilate-like attempt by Fine Gael to remove itself from what was a political decision.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, a spokesperson from the Department of Education and Skills stated the criteria &mdash; these famous criteria about which we are now being told &mdash; had to take into account issues such as: the distance employees had to travel; the availability of accommodation; the number of schools and education facilities in the area; and the budgets of the VECs.  I do not know who evaluated the criteria but I wonder whether these individuals had any idea of the geography of the south-east region.  If anybody believes placing the administrative centre in Wexford was the best decision geographically and in terms of people having to travel, they failed to look at the map and realise people who must travel from west Waterford and Waterford city will have to travel the longest distance.  Anyone who has to travel must travel the longest distance.  It would have made perfect sense for the centre to be located in Waterford.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent weeks, many Ministers came to Waterford on the back of job losses and spoke about the pain which Waterford is experiencing at present.  They sympathised and empathised and spoke about enterprise agencies and other Departments and agencies which were failing Waterford and the south east.  However, the Government made a political decision which is a clear slap in the face to the people of Waterford and Waterford city and goes against the national development plan and the national spatial strategy.  Why on earth is Waterford a gateway city if it will not be given the tools?  Why does the Government continue with the policy of the previous Government of making political decisions?  All I can say is that it learned well from the previous Government.  We had it with the previous Government and herewe go again.  Political decisions are being made which are not based on sound principles,sustainable planning or regional development but on where a Minister of the day resides.  This is wrong.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also wrong for the Government to cry crocodile tears for Waterford and speak about our problems and empathise, when it has proven itself to be part of the problem and not part of the solution.  It is not only me who states this.  Members of Fine Gael in Waterford, the local <Col N="661"/>Fine Gael councillors and the two Fine Gael Deputies from the constituency have been very vocal on this matter.  The Government representatives and the Fine Gael representatives cannot wash their hands of this and simply point the finger at the Labour Party, no more than the Labour Party can point the finger at the Fine Gael representatives in respect of hospital closures or ward closures.  There is collective responsibility and it is about time the Government did what it said it would do and depart from the old way of making political decisions based on parish pump parochial politics and start making the right decisions for the people of the country.  With this decision the Government has let down the people of Waterford and the south-east region.  This is about sustainable and balanced regional development.</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.</P>
        <P>I welcome this opportunity to outline to the House the rationale for the decision taken by the Minister earlier this week to locate the headquarters of the newly-amalgamated county and city of Waterford and Wexford VECs in Wexford with sub-offices in Waterford and Dungarvan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In January this year the Department invited submissions from all of the existing VECs on possible headquarters locations when the mergers took place.  In responses received, no existing VEC was prepared to suggest a headquarters location other than in its own locality.  Some did suggest there should be a headquarters in one location and a sub-office in the other.  However, any VEC making such a proposal did not suggest the sub-office might be in its locality.  All VECs which made further submissions subsequent to the decision on the revised configuration decided by the Government in June continued in similar vein.</P>
        <P>In January, to facilitate submissions the Department gave the following guidance to VECs on the selection of the headquarters locations:</P>
        <P LI="1">While a number of considerations may come into play a fundamental requirement will be the need to ensure that the location of a VEC headquarters will, to the greatest extent possible, facilitate the distance requirements under which staff to be redeployed to that location can be redeployed under a redeployment scheme, allied to the need to operate at lowest cost having regard to the accommodation available in existing locations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These key criteria on redeployment and cost-effective accommodation solutions continued to be dominant in considering the locations that were finally determined by the Minister this week.  However, as the commercial property market is likely to remain weak for the foreseeable future the likelihood of achieving savings that might defray any costs incurred in consolidating into one single headquarters have become less significant for the short to medium term.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In terms of redeployment, the distance between Waterford city and Wexford exceeds the45 km distance agreed under the Croke Park agreement on mandatory redeployment.  This will preclude redeployment of staff currently employed in Wexford to either Waterford orDungarvan.  Consequently at least one sub-office would be required.</P>
        <P>In determining Wexford as a headquarters location the Minister therefore took into account the following additional factors.  The 2011 budget for County Wexford VEC is &euro;34.3 million, which will increase given the opening of the first post-primary school in Gorey on 1 September.  In contrast, the combined budgets of Waterford city and county VECs for 2011 is &euro;32.61 million.  County Wexford has eight VEC post-primary schools, while the two Waterford areas combined have four post-primary schools as well as the college of further education in Waterford city.  An assessment of the enrolment of these schools and college indicates approximately 2,860 students are within the County Wexford VEC operations, in comparison to approximately 2,640 within the operations of Waterford city and county VECs.  County <Col N="662"/>Wexford VEC is also a joint trustee of two additional schools which cater for more than 2,050 additional students.</P>
        <P>According to the 2011 census data, 145,273 people are resident in County Wexford, compared with 113,707 people resident in County Waterford, comprising 46,747 in Waterford city and 66,960 in Waterford county.  In addition to this, Wexford saw a population increase of 10.3% between 2006 and 2011, while Waterford saw an increase of 5.3%.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has decided to maintain sub-offices in both Waterford city and Dungarvan.  I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to respond to the House on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State spoke about potential redeployment from Wexford to Waterford and the criteria with regard to 45 km, but what about redeploying people from Waterford to Wexford?  As the same criteria could apply, this is a red herring.  The spokesperson for the Department stated the final choice was between Dungarvan and Wexford town.  Waterford city was not even considered despite the fact that it is a gateway city and the administrative commercial capital of the south-east region.  When will the Government learn that if we do not build up Waterford city as the capital of the south-east region, the south-east region will continue to underperform.  If Waterford city performs well the region performs well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The redeployment issue has been covered with the decision to retain two sub-offices in Waterford and Dungarvan.  It is important to note that during the process whereby the VEC headquarters were decided, a number of decisions nationwide came down to a knife&rsquo;s edge and little separated a number of locations as to which would be the eventual headquarters.  In this instance, the decision was taken to locate the office in County Wexford.  Those factors to which I alluded played into the process.  It is important that we acknowledge that this was the best decision for the region and that we move on and allow the amalgamation to occur, as that amalgamation will better serve those who avail of VEC services across the nation.</P>
        <P>There is no reason to revisit any of these decisions.  They have been taken and we will move on.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, for attending.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is detained in Geneva dealing with the UN periodic review.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has been criticised for our continued practice of detaining children in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, a medium security prison dating back to 1850 on the Mountjoy Prison complex.  It has long been officially designated as unfit for the accommodation of children.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment is to close the prison to 16-17 year olds and end the practice of detaining children there with immediate effect.  However, events in Geneva today show that Ireland continues to be criticised for detaining children in the institution.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, for forwarding me figures.  On 10 December 2010, 38 boys aged 16 and 17 years were in the institution.  In 2009, a total of 227 boys aged 16 and 17 years were committed to the institution.  It is an institution where male offenders between the ages of 16 and 21 years are detained.  Boys and girls under 16 years of age are detained in the children detention schools, but boys over the age of 16 years continue to be detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  The Ombudsman for Children, the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance and the IPRT have consistently called for an immediate end to the detention of children in the institution.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the European Com<Col N="663"/>mittee for the Prevention of Torture and, recently, Thomas Hammerberg, the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Commissioner for Human Rights have all called for an end to this practice.</P>
        <P>In answer to previous questions and in light of the commitment in the programme for Government, the Minister has stated that he intends to move boys aged 16 to 17 years to a new building at the Oberstown detention school in Lusk.  My concern and that of Deputies who raised this matter in the D&aacute;il is that the Minister has given no timeframe for the closure of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution to children and for the removal of the children to Lusk.</P>
        <P>In light of the commitment to move children to Lusk and the lack of a timeframe, Commissioner Hammerberg recommends in his report that the authorities should start phasing out St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution immediately for children by moving a pilot group to Lusk and by integrating that experience into the planning process for the enhancement of the detention schools.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State cite a specific date by which the unacceptable detention of children in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution will end?  If there is to be a further delay, will he outline a timeframe?  In the short term, will the children who continue to be detained in the institution be given access to the complaints mechanism of the Ombudsman for Children?  Paragraph 9 of the Commissioner&rsquo;s report was highly critical of the fact that children detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, unlike the children in detention schools, do not have access to the Ombudsman for Children, which means they cannot raise complaints about specific aspects of their detention.</P>
        <P>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution is regarded as being wholly inappropriate for children because of its regime and the facts that children spend much of the day locked up and have family visits screened.  There are uniformed officers and Victorian prison architecture.  A large proportion of these children are held in protection due to fears for their safety.  The widespread availability of drugs within the establishment and the high levels of bullying and inter-prisoner violence have been cited as reasons for not detaining children in the institution.</P>
        <P>In the course of my criminal justice work, I have met children who were detained in the institution.  They recounted appalling stories about the treatment they endured there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who is unable to be present due to other business.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the development and provision of safe and secure accommodation for all children ordered to be detained by the courts rests with the Irish Youth Justice Service, IYJS.  This service will shortly transfer from the Minister for Justice and Equality to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The Children Act 2001, as amended, requires that children being detained in respect of criminal matters be detained in a children detention school as described in Part 10 of the Act.  The commencement of the detention provisions of the Act in March 2007 brought a transition provision, section 156A, into effect allowing for the temporary use of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution to accommodate 16 and 17 year old males.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that this practice will end when accommodation is available in the children detention schools in Oberstown, County Dublin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Design work for the project to develop the additional capacity required to transfer the 16 and 17 year old age group currently housed in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution from the Irish Prison Service to Oberstown is well under way and planning approval is in place.  It is intended that the project be delivered in phases to ensure the continued operation of the existing detention schools until such time as the new facilities are available.  The steering committee has signed off on concept and sketch designs and the OPW design team is finalising the preparation of detailed specifications and tender documentation for the project.  However, Government approval is required before tendering for the construction stage of the project.  This decision will be made in the context of the review of capital projects under way across all Departments.</P><Col N="664"/>
        <P>The Minister is of the view that all children in detention have right of access to an independent complaints mechanism.  The Ombudsman for Children may receive individual complaints from children in each of the three children detention schools in Oberstown.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution accommodates young persons up to 21 years of age.  The Ombudsman for Children does not have a statutory function relating to the inspection or investigation of complaints in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  The statutory powers of inspecting prison institutions and hearing prisoners&rsquo; complaints are vested in the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention and the prison visiting committees.  The inspector makes announced and unannounced visits to all prisons, including St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, throughout the year.  He has shown a particular interest in juvenile prison systems and has published inspection standards for juvenile offenders in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution as a supplement to his general inspection standards.</P>
        <P>A commitment in the programme for Government &ldquo;to end the practice of sending children to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution&rdquo; will be achieved by carrying out the necessary redevelopment of the Oberstown detention school campus, subject to the necessary financial approval from the Government.  By its nature, this project will take a number of years to complete.  When this has been achieved, all children in detention will be in custody in Oberstown and will come under the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister points out that there are ongoing contacts between the Irish Prison Service and the IYJS on the exchange of best practices for addressing the needs of the 16 and 17 year olds currently detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  Senior managers of the institution have visited the Oberstown campus several times, most recently in September, and further information exchange visits are planned between the two institutions.  As far as is practicable, the 16 and 17 year olds are kept in a separate wing of the institution with single-room accommodation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is fully aware of the importance of this issue.  He notes that it is not possible to make any announcement on the Oberstown project at this time, as to do so would prejudge the outcome of the current Government review of capital expenditure.  The commitment in the programme for Government will be met at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

	<P>I am disappointed but not surprised by the response.  The Minister of State does not have responsibility for this matter, but will he confirm whether the projected completion date for the new facility is mid-2013, as stated by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in December 2009?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The only commitment that I can give on behalf of the Minister is that the one contained in the programme for Government will be honoured in the context of the financial projections being worked on by the Government.  To make any commitment on a timeline would prejudge the outcome of the capital expenditure review.  I undertake to pass the Senator&rsquo;s serious concerns directly on to the Minister.</P>
