    <Title>Election of Members to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann</Title>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to announce that the following Members have been elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and have, accordingly, vacated their seats in Seanad &Eacute;ireann: Jerry Buttimer, Ciaran Cannon, Paudie Coffey, Paschal Donohoe, Frances Fitzgerald, Dominic Hannigan, Michael McCarthy, Nicky McFadden, Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, John Paul Phelan, Shane Ross, Brendan Ryan, Liam Twomey and Alex White. On my behalf and on behalf of the House, I congratulate them on their election and wish them well in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I also announce to the Seanad that, following the election to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of Ciaran Cannon, the Taoiseach nominated Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, with his consent, to fill the casual vacancy thus created in the number of nominated Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann. On my behalf and on behalf of the House, I welcome him to the Seanad and congratulate him on his appointment.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is tributes to our former Seanad colleague, the late Willie Farrell; and No. 1, Construction Contracts Bill 2010.  It is proposed to take Committee and Remaining Stages of the Bill at the conclusion of the tributes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and congratulate him on his appointment to the Seanad.  I join the Cathaoirleach in congratulating all the Members who were successful in the general election and commiserate with those who have not been successful at this point.</P>
        <P>Since our last meeting the people have spoken and have voted for change.  What we have seen is a revolutionary election which heralded a sea change in Irish politics.  The people have given their verdict on the outgoing Government, holding it to account in no uncertain way for the part it believes the Government played in the economic crisis in which the country finds itself now.  There is no doubting the enormity of the challenge.  Tomorrow we will certainly have a broad-based and unified Government which will have an agenda of reform and change. <Col N="568"/> I am sure everybody in the House would wish the incoming Government every success for the future.  We will certainly need it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the points offered in congratulating our colleagues elected to the other House.  People often speak about Senators being elected to the D&aacute;il.  The vast majority of the people elected to the D&aacute;il from this House are people who would have worked diligently as Senators in here and in their constituency.  I do not have a problem with Senators being elected to the D&aacute;il but when in the Seanad, they should make a contribution.  I believe those who were elected to the D&aacute;il did so.  I welcome my near neighbour, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, to the House, although I will have some unkind things to say about his party leader.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to consider arranging an Adjournment debate on an issue the House needs to discuss.  Not only is Ireland experiencing a financial recession but it is also in the midst of a recession in democracy.  I want someone to offer a viewpoint on this matter.  Local government has been completely emasculated since 1977 and no longer enjoys public trust or confidence.  In addition, the Seanad, which was intended in the Constitution to be the voice of the people, is about to be rubbed off the face of the earth.  Has the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party experienced an irony bypass in this respect?  Only two weeks ago he spoke about abolishing the Seanad, yet this week he has spoken of the importance of getting good people into this House.  It is difficult to accept this type of thinking.  While there is nothing wrong with wishing to have good people in the Seanad, it is impossible to reconcile this view with Deputy Martin&rsquo;s statement that the House should be abolished.  As the Cathaoirleach will soon no longer be involved in the House, he will be able to take an independent view on some of the matters I raise.</P>
        <P>I, too, wish the new Government well.  I have referred to local government and the Seanad.  While reducing the number of D&aacute;il Deputies by 40 may sound like a great idea, it would, if implemented, result in fewer people maintaining contact with the political system.  The idea of keeping Deputies in Dublin for five days each week to ensure they do not get near their constituents is absolutely daft.  It will never affect me.</P>
        <P>Someone should offer a view on the proposals we have heard and carry out quality audits on them.  The proposal to remove Ministers from the D&aacute;il and make them answerable to some other power is equally bad.  Let us examine what is taking place in politics because we have a democracy in recession.  We are cutting back on many important things without first debating them.  Media commentators are getting away with murder.</P>
        <P>I want someone to do a quality audit on all the daft proposals seeking to row back on hard fought constitutional matters which have served members of the public.  One hears that we should reduce the size of the D&aacute;il because we do not like it but no one tells us how the House would work better.  It is also proposed that people who are not part of the D&aacute;il should run the country because we do not like how Cabinet works.  These are regressive proposals.  The same arguments were made when the Health Service Executive was established and how long will it last?</P>
        <P>We need political answerability at all levels, whether in local government, the Seanad or the D&aacute;il.  Members should examine the proposals that have been made and should not be afraid to speak up and ask that they be reconsidered.  I appeal to the incoming Government to make haste slowly on political reform.  People should be afraid if we give a free run to all sorts of daft, untried, untested and unaudited proposals on the political structure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate all those who were elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, especially Senators from the Labour Party benches which, as Senators will note, are virtually <Col N="569"/>empty.  I welcome Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien who will, I am sure, make a valuable contribution to the House.</P>
        <P>I concur with the views expressed on the new Government which will have to work hard.  Politicians who sought election on a platform of opposition will have to provide answers regarding Ireland&rsquo;s future, especially in Europe.</P>
        <P>This is International Women&rsquo;s Day and in welcoming that 23% of Labour Party Deputies are women, I also note that Ireland still falls far short in terms of women&rsquo;s representation in Parliament.  Wonderful women throughout the world are marking International Women&rsquo;s Day in many different ways.  Earlier today, I was in contact with people in Australia and the United States where a variety of initiatives have been taken to celebrate the occasion.  This is a positive day on which many women throughout the world are doing a great job.  They should be congratulated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien to the House.  I hope he is successful in contesting the forthcoming Seanad election and will return to serve in the House.</P>
     
        <P>I wish all the Members of this House who have been elected to the D&aacute;il well.  It has been a marvellous success for them.  Please God, those Senators on this side who were not successful in the general election will be back here again and contest a future general election.</P>
        <P>As regards the Private Members&rsquo; Bill to be brought before us today, the Registration of Wills Bill, No. 18 of 2005, was passed by this House on 13 December 2006.  Unfortunately, however, all of my efforts to have it passed by the Lower House were unsuccessful.  I will not go into that matter today, but I will explain the reasons sometime.</P>

	<P>I am ruling the Senator out of order.  We are not canvassing for the Seanad election.  We are taking questions to the Leader on the Order of Business.  If the Senator is not prepared to do so, he should resume his seat.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="570"/>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not canvassing.  I just wish to say that if I am re-elected, I intend to bring the Bill back to this House.</P>

	<P>That is fine.</P>

	<P>I also wish to be associated with the warm words of welcome to Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.  I hope he will enjoy a full term here following the Seanad election.  I join Members in congratulating all our colleagues who have been elected to the other House.  I wish them well.  I also wish those Senators who will be fighting the forthcoming election or who are to retire from political life well.  Important words have been said by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, the voice of experience.</P>

	<P>Questions to the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The kingdom salutes him.  He made many pertinent points, although this is not the day to go through all of them.  However, the words &ldquo;<i>festina lente</i>&rdquo;, hasten slowly, come to mind.  That was the advice he gave.  I, therefore, urge the incoming Government to hasten slowly.  It is important that all of the points made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole should be borne in mind and I have no doubt that they will be.  </P>
        <P>The Government is facing great difficulties which we have inherited.  We will not get involved in any arguments, but we are where we are.  I have no doubt that everything will be tackled fairly, honestly and openly.  Please God, there will be a lot more transparency.  We must communicate with the people on where we are, what is happening and what is proposed.  I wish the Government well, as I am sure we all do.  I also wish my colleagues well in whatever path they have chosen to take.  The best of luck to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I offer my congratulations and those of my party to the 16 Members of this House who have been elected to the D&aacute;il.  As debates occur in both Houses of the Oireachtas in the next year &mdash; there may also possibly be a referendum &mdash; the experience and performance of those 16 Members in the other House will be one of the main reasons people should pause to reflect on the need for the Seanad, given the skills of the parliamentarians concerned.  I wish them well in their endeavours.  I also extend a welcome to our new Member, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.</P>
        <P>As I said before the general election, we should make the most of the time that remains in the 23rd Seanad and meet on several occasions.  However, that will depend on the co-operation of the incoming Government.  There are matters we could debate, including, for instance, the programme for Government, a useful document which follows through on the fiscal policy of the previous Government because our options are limited.  The 23rd Seanad could contribute to the discussion on certain items before the programme for Government is implemented.  Outstanding legislation, in particular Private Members&rsquo; Bills, could also be finally debated in this House before the incoming Government decides on its legislative programme.  For example, the Private Members&rsquo; Mental Health (Involuntary Procedures) (Amendment) Bill 2008 has gone through Second and Committee Stages.  A Report Stage debate would be useful in our remaining time.</P><Col N="571"/>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole regarding the essence of political reform.  It must be founded on the reform of local government, the devolution of power from the central to the local and on ascertaining the best structures of local government, be it the town district model or the regional county council model.  These are the choices we should make.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I fear that we will engage in a cosmetic exercise on the number of Houses we have and the number of Members we have instead of an analysis of the decisions at each level of government and where they can most appropriately be made.  This is the debate we need.  While we have had a general election where opinion swung wildly and the electorate reacted to the situation in which we find ourselves, we have yet to have a real debate on the nature of the country we should become.  I wish the new Government every success and hope it can have that debate to ensure our future is founded on that type of principle.</P>
        <P>To be somewhat facetious about my party and its participation in government, we have had a baptism of fire, a communion of fire and a confirmation of fire, but we have not had an extreme unction of fire.  I look forward to the time when my party will be represented in the Lower House again.  We have experiences of other European countries.  It is ironic that, as the 23rd Seanad comes to a close, my party now has a larger representation than the Labour Party and one less than Fine Gael.  Maybe that is a portent for the future.  I wish the new Government every success in its legislative programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>We have two more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not take part in the kind of &ldquo;ho-ho&rdquo; stuff going on here.  I would welcome, endorse and wish the new Government a fair wind if it was a brave Government, be it a minority Government or one governing on a knife&rsquo;s edge.  However, a Government with a majority that large is asymmetrical and holds in itself the seeds of its own dissolution.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas has one task in hand, namely, the economy.  Central to that task is that we cannot do anything about the banks.  We are fairly locked into the realities of the ECB, as Mr. John Bruton said.  That is a straitjacket.  The only area over which we have control is the domestic economy and the public finances.  There is a deficit of &euro;19 billion, the bulk of which comes from public sector pay and pensions and social welfare.  Far from this Government tackling that task, the programme for Government is a collusion not to deal with it.  The Government will never have the full confidence of the people until it behaves like a national Government.  It calls itself such, but a national Government by definition is one that takes hard choices, does hard things and administers hard medicine.  This is a division of spoils between two parties.</P>
        <P>I voted for Fine Gael, wished it well and hoped it would have the bottle to reach out to Fianna F&aacute;il, to count up the Independents and, if necessary, to govern as a minority party and administer the strong medicine to the public finances that was necessary.  I regret that Fine Gael has decided not to do this.  I hope everything works out for it, but I cannot see how it will.  After a few months, never mind years, the Labour Party &mdash; the party of soft options &mdash; will look more and more like the national Dublin modernist progressive party and Fine Gael will regret that it did not decide to live dangerously.  There are no free lunches in this life.  There is no way a Government of this size will have a soft passage.</P>
        <P>There is no Opposition in the country right now.  As Yeats stated, &ldquo;The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.&rdquo;  I do not say the Opposition parties are the worst, some of them are.  I wish that Fine Gael had the courage of its convictions.  I also wish the Labour Party had the courage of its convictions and went into opposition to give us a decent division in the country.  &ldquo;The best lack all conviction&rdquo;, Yeats says and it is true.  It is true that Fine Gael and the Labour Party lack the conviction to do what is necessary.  This is <Col N="572"/>a big, heavy, lumbering Government, which contains in itself the seeds of its own destruction.  Right now, the only real Opposition in this country is the media, and I am glad to say my newspaper will take part in that Opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator O&rsquo;Brien on his appointment and congratulate those who have been elected to the D&aacute;il.  I used the same route to the D&aacute;il and I am using the same route out of the House.</P>
        <P>Before we leave this House, we need to put a few things on the record.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole signalled that we must make haste slowly when it comes to abolishing the Seanad or other forums available to the public.  I will add to that my thoughts on the current idea of amalgamating county councils, which has been suggested in some areas.  This will be to the detriment of local communities and county identity.</P>
        <P>I agree with much of what Senator Harris said.  The incoming Government has decided that the outgoing Government was on the right track and that it will stay on that track for the next two years.  That signifies one thing: the new Government realises that what was done by the outgoing Government, despite the resulting loss of popularity, will have to be continued.  We must ensure that people are given hope that they can get out of this mess and that &ldquo;Mother Ireland&rdquo; can escape from the problems it has.  If we do not see an improvement in the next 12 to 18 months, I dread to think where this country and its population will end up.  We all see it at the moment, as so many of our young people are forced to emigrate.</P>
        <P>One group has escaped in all of this, and it is not the politicians.  The regulatory authorities, both in Europe and at home, are what has landed Government after Government in the mess we are in today, yet their members walk away with fine, handsome pensions.  The same will be said of us, but we walk out of here knowing that the people who should have kept us advised let us down, and that is the reason we find ourselves in this mess &mdash; although I am not saying Governments were not also responsible for some of the things that happened.  The new regulators should not make the same mistakes as their predecessors, which have landed this country in a mess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien on his appointment to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and wish him well in the forthcoming Seanad election, in which he will presumably be a candidate.  I also congratulate all of my previous Seanad colleagues who have been elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and commiserate with those who were unsuccessful in their quest.  Among the unsuccessful is Senator Prendergast, who I believe will go on to represent Munster as a Member of the European Parliament.  I sincerely wish her well in that position of major importance and significance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope she will enjoy that political experience and work well for Munster in the next three years.  Sometimes in politics, winners become losers and losers become winners.  I think this loser from south Tipperary will be a winner in a few weeks and I wish her good luck.</P>
        <P>The general election of ten days ago is being described as a watershed.  It can be said, if we remove the party political aspect of it, that it probably marked the end of the old style of politics and government.  Regardless of the composition of the new Government and the new structures of Parliament, it will be incumbent on every elected Member of D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann to approach the task of rebuilding this nation in a much more unified and transparent fashion.</P><Col N="573"/>
        <P>The record will show that there is a history of Governments with large majorities having a short life span.  Senator Harris is worried about the size of the majority that the next Government will have.  I hope we have not just a national coalition Government but a D&aacute;il of 166 Members united in a common purpose, because this country is as close to the precipice today as it was a month ago.  Nothing has changed.  There are new Deputies, and there will be new Ministers and a new Taoiseach, but the fact remains that Ireland is virtually bankrupt, and nothing but the strongest, most strident policy decisions will save the country.</P>
     
        <P>That is a responsibility for every single Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, from incoming Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, down to the newest Deputy.  The whole attitude and approach to politics will have to change and there will have to be a common unity among all Members in the next five crucial years.  We do not know whether this House is on its last term, but it has a very important role to play.  I hope the next Seanad will be as constructive as the current one was, but a different type of leadership is required.  It needs to be a Chamber of much more reflective debate, and Senators will genuinely have to change the way they do business in this House.</P>
        <P>I have expressed my disappointment and criticism to the current Leader on a number of occasions to the effect that we did not use the Seanad to have the type of debate, dialogue and constructive approach that modern politics requires.  I hope for the sake of those who aspire to be in the next Seanad that a new direction will be taken.  We have to respect how the people voted last Friday week.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Last autumn, I recall, there were marches on the street outside Leinster House.  Angry people were marching, starting with hundreds and growing into thousands.  The election was a release valve for many of those people.  As far as democracy is concerned we are literally in the last chance saloon.  People have rejected one Government and replaced it with another.  It is crucial that the incoming Government and all those elected to Parliament respond to the national crisis.  Within six to 12 months, if the public decides that the current Government has not succeeded, I am afraid that democracy in this country will find itself in a very dangerous place, because all the democratic alternatives will have been found wanting.  An enormous challenge faces the incoming Government, but we have to play our role as well.  We must remove this &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo;, Government versus Opposition type of childish politics which has ruined this country.</P>
        <P>There is a grave responsibility on everyone seeking election to the Seanad as well as those elected to the other House to face the reality that Ireland is still on the brink of total disaster.  It is consoling, however, that the incoming national coalition Government will comprise not just Fine Gael and the Labour Party but also the IMF and the ECB.  Regardless of whether we like it, those external structures will put certain pressures and demands on us which we cannot ignore.  I hope for realism, common sense and goodwill because I do not want this to be last Seanad, nor do I want the other House to be the last D&aacute;il.  Democracy is on a knife edge, however, until and unless everyone works together to turn around the country&rsquo;s economic woes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge and respect how the public voted last Friday week and congratulate all those elected to the 31st D&aacute;il.  I also congratulate Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien on his nomination to the Seanad.  I wish the new Government every success in the challenges that lie ahead for it.  I am not going to get into whether it intends to adopt existing policies, but the new Government needs to offer hope and confidence to the public.  I wish it well in its endeavours in that regard because we need to see a sea-change.</P>
        <P>All I have is a notification of the Seanad sitting today.  I do not know what the plans are up to polling day in the Seanad elections.  Will the Leader outline whether the House will sit in the meantime?</P><Col N="574"/>
        <P>Will the leader also highlight the National Transport Authority&rsquo;s public consultations website?  I am referring to the final consultation on Vision 2030 for Dublin transport.  Whether they work or live in Dublin, the National Transport Authority are encouraging as many people as possible to take part in the final consultation.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange to hold a debate on matters relating to the insurance industry, an area in which he has shown an interest?  I am referring to the manner in which crash repair companies are approved by insurance companies, as well as the possible competition related matters on that issue.  That was brought to my attention in the course of the recent general election.</P>

	<P>I was hoping to have an opportunity to ask the Cathaoirleach what would be involved if I wished to make a personal statement in the House, how I should go about it and when I could be accommodated.  Will the Cathaoirleach clarify if, when a point of order is raised with him, he is obliged to rule on it?  I draw his attention to the fact that I have been in correspondence with his office.</P>

	<P>If we in this House are to find our way, we must earn our keep.  We have done so to a certain extent today.  I thank the Leader for arranging for the House to sit today because it has not sat for a number of weeks.  We are meeting in order to pass the Construction Contracts Bill which I hope we will pass today.  I appreciate the Leader&rsquo;s response to my request that we do so.  I do not understand, however, why we will not be meeting in the next few weeks.  The Constitution provides that a vote will not take place for almost two months, yet it is not planned to meet in the intervening period.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has mentioned to me that we have not yet seen the programme for Government, which is exactly what we should be debating.  That is how we will earn our keep.</P>

	<P>We do not deserve to stay alive if we do not do so.  When I was playing rugby for Newbridge College many years ago, the trainer used to refer to the attacking team and the defending team.  When I asked him what he meant by &ldquo;the attacking team&rdquo; and whether this was determined by the position of the ball on the field, he replied that it was not, that the attacking team was the team in possession of the ball, even if it was on their back line.  The Seanad is a little like the attacking team.  We are on the back line and if we are to survive, thrive and succeed, it is in our own hands.  We can make sure we will meet to consider our opportunities.  We must show a degree of optimism and confidence.  Let us not talk ourselves down, as too many are doing in the country, and say things are so bad we cannot get out of <Col N="575"/>the position in which we find ourselves.  We can do a lot.  We must believe in ourselves and that those in this House can prove their worth.</P>
        <P>I welcome Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.  I hope he will be working very hard, at least three or four days a week, for the next two months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s comments, Members must try to be re-elected to the Seanad.  It is unrealistic to expect the Seanad to continue to sit when they are trying to be re-elected.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the results of the general election and wish the new Government well.  Senator Harris hit the nail on the head in cautioning against what might go wrong.  I concur with him that big government is not necessarily healthy government.  I hope the Government will have the courage to tackle issues as it needs to do so.  In that regard, I concur with the assessment of Senator Harris.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Members of this House who have been elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It is a great honour.  I also commiserate with those who were unsuccessful.  It was a difficult election.  I welcome Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien who is most welcome.  I hope he will have a long life in this House.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Prendergast, I acknowledge that today is International Women&rsquo;s Day.  However, I am astonished that she has failed to acknowledge that the membership of the Labour Parliamentary Party in the Seanad is 100% female, something of which she can be very proud.</P>
        <P>To revert to the programme for Government, what worries me about what we have heard about it is the number of reviews being sought.  People have said they want a review to be carried out of the Hunt report that has just been published, as well as a review of the decision on the siting of the proposed children&rsquo;s hospital.  That does not bode well in having a good, dynamic and progressive Government which will have to make tough decisions, but nonetheless I wish it well.  It is in the country&rsquo;s interests that we have a good and strong Government which will tackle the issues that need to be tackled.</P>

        <P>Senator Harris hit the nail on the head when he said it would be a difficult period for the new Government.  It will have difficult decisions to make, but I have no doubt it will make those hard decisions because it will have no choice.  There are parameters set by the IMF and in our banking policy within which the new Government will have to work.  I hope it will state the buck has to stop some place because in the last ten years it did not stop anywhere in any Department, semi-State body or quango.  No one in any place took responsibility.  I hope the new Government will act on this.  With power there is responsibility.  I hope someone will take responsibility and that the buck will stop somewhere.</P>

	<P>I ask the new Government to take on board an issue I have raised in this House on a number of occasions, that of the &euro;2.8 billion in fees in respect of NAMA being paid by banks.  In some instances the consultancy fees have amounted to &euro;3,500 per day.  That is a disgrace and we cannot afford it.  We hear from Senator Harris about the pain inflicted and <Col N="576"/>the cuts that should be proposed.  Right now we cannot afford to pay these fees as a nation.  I hope this will be one of the first things the new Government will do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with those who have congratulated the Members of this House who have been elected to the D&aacute;il.  I will go further and pay tribute to all those who have put their names before the public in the interests of the democratic process.  It is essential that we have people with courage and commitment who are prepared to do so, often at great sacrifice to themselves and their families.  It is important, therefore, that they are recognised.  It is all too easy to offload on politicians, which tends to be done by people in the media and the public at large.  </P>
        <P>I welcome to the House Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien who has been an outstanding politician in the D&aacute;il.  I have no doubt he has a bright future here and I hope he will return to the D&aacute;il in the future.</P>
        <P>I want to raise two items.  A number of weeks ago I raised on the Adjournment the persecution of Christians in the Middle East and Pakistan.  The Minister with responsibility for the minorities in Pakistan, Shahbaz Bhatti, a Christian, has since been murdered outside his parents&rsquo; home.  With one voice we should condemn what is a sectarian murder, an atrocious way for any society to conduct itself.  I would like to think the incoming Minister for Foreign Affairs will make Ireland&rsquo;s voice heard in that regard.</P>
        <P>I read with interest and welcomed a comment made by Deputy Enda Kenny quoted in the newspaper in recent days that the disastrous mistakes made by the coalition Government led by Dr. Garret FitzGerald in the 1980s will not be repeated.  That is essential.  The mistake at the time was that the issues confronting the country were not faced.  They were allowed to fester and as a consequence, they prolonged the recession when the rest of the world was doing extremely well.  I ask that the issues be faced in this instance.</P>
        <P>As with Senator Harris, I am concerned with the programme for Government, which in many instances fudges a number of the huge economic challenges that face us.  It would be terrible if we failed to move ahead, improve economic competitiveness and deal with the real issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Seanad&oacute;ir Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.  Go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; leis.  Ba mhaith liom freisin comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh leo si&uacute;d a fuair su&iacute;och&aacute;n sa D&aacute;il an uair seo.  There is nothing ignoble about aspiring to being in the D&aacute;il if one is a Member of the Seanad although certain members of the public may feel the aspiration to get elected to the D&aacute;il from the Seanad represents some kind of indictment of the latter.  That view reflects widespread ignorance of the different powers of State and Government.  We have the Judiciary, Executive and Legislature.  It is quite clear that anybody who aspires to being a member of the Executive needs to be, in all but very exceptional circumstances, a Member of the D&aacute;il.  That does not detract from the very important role the Oireachtas must play.  It is really time that we asserted the importance of the Legislature in the political system.</P>
        <P>I feel very strongly that the real test of the incoming Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment to political reform will entail two issues.  First, having promised to abolish the Seanad, what will he do when it comes to appointing his 11 nominees?  Will they be people who will take seats for his party at the next election or will they be the types of people who will restore the faith of the public in the Oireachtas?  I refer to people of the calibre of Brian Friel, Gordon Wilson and others who graced the Seanad in the past.  Those are the kinds of people a reforming Taoiseach should think of putting into the Seanad.</P><Col N="577"/>
        <P>The second issue concerns whether the new Taoiseach will let the tail wag the dog.  Fine Gael got an excellent result in this election, partly because it returned to its Christian Democrat roots.  Guarantees were given on the importance of maintaining best maternal care for mothers while vindicating the duty of care to a baby in pregnancy.  We must not have any backsliding on those commitments simply because of the aspirations of a liberal minority party in government.  It will reflect badly on the respect for the public if there is backsliding on those commitments.</P>
        <P>I endorse what Senator Quinn had to say on the fact that the Seanad could be sitting.  If Senator O&rsquo;Malley is correct about the need for Senators to get re-elected, why did we not sit during the general election campaign?  Senator Harris quoted Yeats whereas I am reminded of Hamlet: &ldquo;Sure, he that made us with such large discourse, looking before and after, gave us not that capability and godlike reason to fust in us unused.&rdquo;  We have allowed our capability and God-like reason to fust in us unused instead of having important debates in the House and restoring people&rsquo;s faith in the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>I congratulate Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.  I know from listening to him and having observed his political career to date that his will be a success story.  I wish him the best of luck.</P>
        <P>I congratulate all the Senators who were elected to the D&aacute;il and whom I loved looking at across the floor in the last session.  I recall all the times we had a flip-flop across the floor.  I miss the Senators&rsquo; faces and wish them well.  I am delighted to see they have moved to better places.</P>
        <P>I beg of the Leader of the next Seanad not to seek the abolition of the House.  We had not really had a discussion on reform.  I am a reformist.  We can talk about the selection and election procedures.  All these matters have never been aired.  There is a mood for change and this has been aired already.  Let us start in this Chamber.  What is wrong with having career Senators in addition to using the Seanad as a respite centre for those who stay for a short time and then move on?  I ask the new Leader not to allow the Seanad to be treated as proposed.  There is room for wisdom and experience and for young people entering politics.  It would be a shame to simply put a pen to paper to abolish the Seanad without having any real discussion.  That is not the way I think.  I ask the Leader of the future Seanad to please put this in writing and ensure we have many discussions.  Let us start from today.  I do not know whether I will be returned but I hope to be to continue to work in every way I can to ensure we do not abolish the Seanad.  I want the next Leader&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I agree with other Senators that it is important we are here to debate the Construction Contracts Bill 2010.  It is important we do our job properly and examine legislation.</P>
        <P>I join other Senators who have spoken about the need for a debate on the programme for Government.  We should have debate on it in the remaining lifetime of this Seanad.  It is a useful function we can serve.  I had a look at the programme for Government and the only reference to the Seanad is a mention of abolishing it.  As there will be a Seanad until the matter is put to the people in a referendum, I would like to know what the new Government will do with it.  As Senator Mullen pointed out, the Taoiseach will appoint 11 people to it.  Who will those people be?  Will they be from his party who might be elected in the future or will they be the people with other views of the world?  There is an inherent contradiction in the way the programme for Government deals with the Seanad and political reform.  The reality which will face us is the likelihood that for the lifetime of the next D&aacute;il there will be a Seanad in place.  The people will not stand for a Seanad mainly populated by Fine Gael Senators which will not have any useful function or purpose.  Political reform starts with the people from the ground up, not from the top down as the programme for Government states.  I do not believe getting rid of the oversight which the Seanad has will necessarily give us a better democratic system.  If we are not to reform completely the political system we have at local authority, Seanad and D&aacute;il levels we will not have better politics in this country.</P>

We all know that women are under-represented in politics.  As others have done, I congratulate Senator Prendergast and wish her well.

I also hope that Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s tenure in the House will be a short one and that he will be restored to his rightful place in the Lower House.  I wish Senator Prendergast well.  I am deeply envious that Senator Prendergast, who was on the substitute list, has managed to realise her ambitions.  They may not have been her ambitions during the election but I wish her well now.  Unfortunately, I was unable to persuade my friend and colleague, Pat the Cope Gallagher, MEP, to take a similar route back to the D&aacute;il which would have allowed me to have joined Senator Prendergast in the European Parliament, but be that as it may.</P>

	<P>This is an historic day for this House.  As the reducing echo of the rhetoric in this House wafts its way across to the other House, I hope that many of today&rsquo;s contributions might resonate positively, including those of Senators Harris, O&rsquo;Toole and Quinn.  I do not think the amount of talent in this House should be dismissed so quickly and easily.  I agree with the view that the media should have taken more cognisance of the proceedings of this House and that the media set up public opinion that the Seanad should be abolished.  If there were to be a constitutional referendum, I am sure some people would say the local authorities should also be abolished.  This is the prevailing culture.  The incoming Government has a duty to ensure both sides of the argument are put to the people.</P>

	<P>I will be brief in my contribution.  Like other colleagues, I welcome Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien to the House and congratulate Senator Prendergast on her elevation to the European Parliament.  It was the intention of the outgoing Government to bring in an amendment to the National Asset Management Agency Act.  I have written today to the Office of the Attorney General to ask it to investigate NAMA for breaching the law and the intention of the NAMA legislation as passed by this House in the disposal of assets under its control.  There is no transparency in the current process being pursued by NAMA.  This lack of transparency has been confirmed to me by people who were asked to become involved in a scam whereby the original borrower of the loan would buy back his own loan book for less than the current market value thus causing a significant loss to the taxpayer.  I have sought legal opinion from the Law Library on the matter, which has confirmed my suspicions that not only has the spirit of the law been breached, but also the law and its intent as passed by this House.  Sections 2 and 10 of the National Asset Management Agency Act provided that the taxpayer must be protected, but this is not the case.</P>

        <P>My pleading for the three issues of thalidomide, breast cancer screening and suicide prevention has been successful and they figure in the new programme for Government.  I was Vice Chairman of the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on the High Level of Suicide in Ireland.  The new Government will ring-fence a substantial amount of money to deal with the epidemic of suicide.  I am delighted the programme for Government proposes to extend breast cancer screening to cover women aged from 64 to 69.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I also congratulate Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien on becoming a Member of the House.  We all know he became a member of Fingal County Council in 2004 and a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 2007.  He was the Vice Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, which is the most important committee in the House and was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Foreign Affairs, and Justice, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  He also has a distinguished career in financial services.  With his wife, daughter and family, I congratulate him.  I wish him well and look forward to working with him.</P>
        <P>Senators Cummins, O&rsquo;Toole, Prendergast, Coghlan, Boyle, Harris, Ellis, Bradford, Callely, Quinn, O&rsquo;Malley, Burke, Walsh, Mullen, Ormonde, Feeney, Mooney, Daly and White expressed their serious concerns and strong views regarding many matters on the Order of Business.  First, I congratulate Fine Gael and the Labour Party on their outstanding win in the general election.  I commiserate with some very decent former Deputies on the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party side who worked very hard in the national interest.  There was a mood for change and the electorate certainly had its say.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the very difficult task the Taoiseach, former Deputy Brian Cowen, had. I wish him and the T&aacute;naiste well, as I do everyone who played a part in the national interest in doing his or her very best in what has been the worst recession since 1929.  I look forward to working with colleagues on the future Government side.  I congratulate my constituency colleague, Deputy McFadden.  What a different place this Chamber will be without the former Senator, Deputy Buttimer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>He made a great contribution here and we all worked very closely with him.  We wish him well on becoming a Member of the other House, with the former Senator, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who was Leader of the Opposition in this House on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, and the former Senator, Deputy Alex White, who led the Labour Party in this House.  I congratulate all former colleagues who were elected to the Lower House.  I know what the experience is like.  They will have to experience it to know the value of the Seanad and the high quality of debate that takes place here on the very many topics we are asked to consider.</P>
        <P>The first 100 days of the incoming Government will be crucial in the national interest.  Senator Ellis, who is one of the most experienced Members of both the D&aacute;il and Seanad, said that people need to be given hope.  The people are very down and are looking for confidence measures.  What the incoming Government does in the first 100 days will be crucial in lifting people who lack hope and confidence.  Colleagues on the opposite side of the House should <Col N="582"/>ensure in whatever way they can through their parliamentary parties that that confidence and hope can be given to the people in the first 100 says.</P>
        <P>We have had many reports on Seanad reform and all our submissions to the Minister were on his desk for one and a half years.  This Seanad did everything it possibly could to ensure the views of the House through our party political system and through us as individuals were placed before the Minister.  I firmly believe it will not be possible to reform the Seanad until the D&aacute;il is reformed.  The D&aacute;il must be reformed to meet the challenges of the 21st century.  As we all know, the Seanad, set up by Eamon de Valera under the 1937 Constitution, was to be the watchdog and guardian on behalf of the taxpayers and to give the vocational viewpoint as it has so very well done.</P>
        <P>In 2009 some 1,201 Seanad amendments were accepted by the Government.  That is a very significant amount of legislation that was amended in the interest of the taxpaying citizens to ensure no guillotined legislation slipped through in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that we did not correct here.  With the exception of two occasions we never guillotined the debate on a Bill &mdash; we discussed legislation section by section and line by line.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole, who has been in this House for almost 25 years, strongly advised the new Government to look at the democratic sessions that are taking place in both Houses.  He has proposed that we should row back and let us take our time to do the right thing.  The new Seanad that will be elected will be here for the lifetime of the 31st D&aacute;il.  There is no rush and there is plenty of time to get the entire process right in order that it is fit for purpose in the 21st century.</P>
        <P>I agree with what Senators Prendergast and Feeney said about today being International Women&rsquo;s Day.  I acknowledge the tremendous contribution made by women and this House has been always forthcoming in doing everything we possibly could in debating and discussing the achievements of women.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely spoke about the National Transport Authority seeking additional consultation.  As we all know it has invited as many people as possible to come forward for the final consultation stage.  If this is to be achieved, I would encourage everyone to do so.</P>
      
        <P>The Senator also called for a debate on the insurance industry where massive changes are taking place.  I chaired the inquiry on the industry in 2004, 2005 and 2006, during the course of which premiums were reduced by 50%.  Perhaps it is time for the new Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment to take on this challenge again and conduct a further review of the industry to see how policyholders can be facilitated.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn spoke of the Seanad debating and discussing the programme for Government which is a fair and reasonable request.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley gave her strong views on a number of issues which I shall pass on to the relevant Ministers.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke mentioned the &euro;2.8 billion spent in fees for consultants to NAMA, amounting to &euro;3,500 each per day.  I agree fully with the Senator that this is massively excessive.</P>
        <P>I shall pass on Senator Daly&rsquo;s views to the Minister in question.  Senator Walsh spoke of the murders taking place in Pakistan and the Middle East.  I shall pass on his comments to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P>Senator White mentioned the three issues the cause of which she has championed in the House, namely, the plague of suicide, breast cancer and redress for thalidomide victims. We would welcome it if these issues were addressed in the programme for Government.  The Senator has played a significant part in this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I pay tribute to a dear friend and former colleague, the late Willie Farrell, I acknowledge the presence of his lifelong friend, former Deputy Mattie Brennan and very many friends, including Councillor Patsy Barry, John Feeney and their respective wives who are attending this very special occasion in company with Willie&rsquo;s family.</P>
        <P>With a heavy heart I shall say a few words about the sad passing of a truly remarkable man who was both a friend and colleague to all of us in the House.  I had great admiration for the late Senator Willie Farrell who, we all know, was a great person and a highly intelligent Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and a truly excellent public servant.</P>
        <P>Born in the shadow of Ben Bulben 82 years ago, Willie came from a family steeped in the republican tradition and ideals to which he was true all his life.  There are many facets to Willie Farrell and the political life he served so long and honourably.  There was Willie Farrell the businessman.  There was the man who was so much involved in the community and there was the family man.  As far as Willie was concerned his family were the most important people in the world.  He was blessed with a wonderful marriage to Mary who passed away in 1984.  In latter years he was blessed to have a second marriage to Breda who passed away in 2007.</P>
        <P>Willie Farrell often spoke with pride of his three children, Seamus, Liam and Helen; his daughter-in-law, Siobhan; his son-in-law, Pauric, and his five grandchildren.  He was so very proud of all of them.  They must feel a great loss today but it is nice to see all of them in attendance.</P>
        <P>Before entering public life, Willie Farrell had very many other jobs.  He was an entrepreneur long before his time, even before the word &ldquo;entrepreneur&rdquo; became fashionable.  He had many jobs especially the one he became most involved in, the cattle trade, and went on to become a director of the North West Cattle Market in Grange.  The late Senator was also an undertaker and worked for the ESB.  During that time he suffered a great personal tragedy when he sustained a very serious injury.  Drawing on his own inner strength and with the love and support of his beloved wife, Mary, he recovered and went on to achieve very many great things.  He became involved in the milk business and spent many years running the agency for Alfa Laval and for milking machine suppliers in the west of Ireland.  In 1960, with his wife, Mary, he opened a restaurant and filling station in Grange in the north west.  In latter years he became involved in the auctioneering business and was very successful, becoming its national president.</P>
        <P>Willie Farrell&rsquo;s political career spanned 35 years. He first joined Sligo County Council in 1967 and served for a remarkable 30 years, becoming chairman of the council in 1989.  In that year I had the great honour of visiting New York for St Patrick&rsquo;s Day as chairman of Westmeath County Council and Willie and I had the great distinction of meeting Cardinal O&rsquo;Connor.  That occasion was one of the great memories we had of our public life as county councillors.</P>
        <P>Willie was also a member of the North Western Health Board for many years and served as chairman in 1982.  During his time on the health board he gained a reputation for his very progressive ideas.  Arising from this involvement he served as chairman of the National Health Boards of Ireland for an unbelievable 12 years, such was the esteem in which he was held by his fellow councillors.  The same esteem and respect saw him elected to the Seanad in 1982 on the Industrial and Commercial Panel.  His frequent speeches were carefully listened to by politicians of all parties in the House. He lost his seat in 1983.  Deputy Brennan and I were with him and Mary at 2.20 a.m. when that happened, a sad occasion.  However, he came back and was re-elected in 1987, holding his seat until his retirement in 2002.</P><Col N="584"/>
        <P>Although he was very successful at national level, Willie never lost sight of his roots or from where he came.  He stayed active in his community all his life, believing that local groups working together can achieve great things.  In 1982 the chairman of the North Western Health Board gave him &pound;1,000 for his expenses which he used to help disabled people.  He bought a pony and trap and raised money by travelling from Bundoran to the horse show in Ballsbridge.  He received another &pound;1,000 from the Bank of Ireland manager, Brian O&rsquo;Neill, and raised a total of &pound;20,000 which enabled the construction of a home for the disabled in Bundoran.</P>
        <P>In latter life Willie took up golf and won the world putting championship for one-armed golfers.  Sport, especially golf, played an enormous part in his life.  As many Members know, golf is a difficult game at the best of times.  To become a world champion was a truly remarkable and wonderful achievement but I would not expect anything less of the former Senator.  Willie Farrell was determined to succeed in all he ever attempted.  He went on to become captain of Bundoran Golf Club and of the Oireachtas Golf Society.</P>
        <P>Willie was well regarded throughout the local community for his hard work, and his enthusiasm and warm personality won everybody over.  He was a great support to many people and was always willing to help and offer guidance.  He was an excellent orator and commanded attention when he spoke.  He was often involved in heated discussions on matters close to his heart both on the Seanad floor and in the parliamentary party of Fianna F&aacute;il.  He was a lifelong member of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association and was well known for his strong stance on the dangers of alcohol abuse.</P>
        <P>Willie was a very honourable and loyal public servant, serving at both local and national levels for more than 35 years.  He was an immensely popular man and his loss will be felt widely among his friends and colleagues.  He leaves behind the legacy of what he achieved during his life and the memory of a fantastic spirit and a great character.  No challenge was too great for him.</P>
        <P>We on this side of the House knew Willie to be a great servant of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, of which he was so proud.  He was a staunch defender of the party and a great upholder of its traditional values.  We will miss him dearly.</P>
        <P>On a personal level, I was privileged to serve as Leader of Seanad &Eacute;ireann during Willie&rsquo;s tenure as a Senator.  He served as assistant Government Whip.  I personally owe him a great debt of gratitude, as do all colleagues on this side of the House, for his loyalty, service and sound advice which he gave to many of us from time to time.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the House and especially the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I offer sincere condolences to Willie&rsquo;s sons, Seamus and Liam, daughter, Helen, daughter-in-law, Siobhan, and son-in-law, Pauric, as well as his five grandchildren, on the loss of a truly wonderful father and grandfather.

	<P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I offer sincere sympathy to the Farrell family.  Willie died on 8 April 2010 after a political career which had spanned almost 35 years.  As the Leader of the House stated, he served on Sligo County Council, to which he was elected in 1967.  In 1982 he was elected to the Seanad on the Industrial and Commercial Panel.  Having lost it in 1983, he regained his seat in 1987 in the 18th Seanad and held it until his retirement in 2002.  It is only right and fitting that we should pay tribute to a person with so many years of public service.  To his family, friends and colleagues in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, we offer our sincere sympathy on their sad loss.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am privileged to add to what has been said and offer from the Independent benches our condolences and sympathy to the family of the late Willie Farrell <Col N="585"/>and Fianna F&aacute;il.  I remember Willie for his argumentative nature and because he was always willing to take up a challenge.  He never let his party down and Fianna F&aacute;il could do no wrong, although in private he might say if it had acted in the wrong way.  Generally, he was reidh i gc&oacute;na&iacute; chun an f&oacute;d a seasamh.  Whenever we on these benches got near to ousting him in an argument, he would say it was okay for us on the university seats, but he was brought up in the university of life and knew more about universities than we did.</P>
        <P>On a more serious note, I should mention two matters.  I tend to say the following to those who knew the deceased personally and are aware only from a distance of what they did in their public life.  I spoke earlier about the importance of democracy which will only live if people are prepared to put their names on the ballot paper, take responsibility and speak out.  Willie Farrell had the courage to do this and I would like his family to remember him for this.  No matter how strong the Constitution or our democracy is, it can only work if people are prepared to put themselves on the line, as Willie was prepared to do.  I stand in awe of him.  He spent 35 years in public life which I hope his family and grandchildren will grow to value even more as time passes.</P>
        <P>Wearing my education hat, I regularly raise disability issues and time and again Willie Farrell was first into the fray to offer support from the other side of the House.  He was a classic example of somebody who had turned his disability into an ability.  He never let the fact that he had had a serious accident stop him; he never relied on or hid behind it.  He was proud of what he had achieved.  In that sense, he was a great role model for those dealing with disability issues at various levels.</P>
        <P>One would always remember the glint in Willie&rsquo;s eye when he came at someone.  There was always a smile and he was always ready to get involved.  He was a very diligent Senator at a time when the Whips might have been hard pressed to get Members into the Chamber to speak.  He was always reliable in being present for votes and making contributions with which I may have regularly disagreed.  However, that is not the issue; the importance of the Seanad comes from having different voices expressing different points of view.  We make progress when there is creative tension in having different voices and views.  Willie contributed to this.</P>
        <P>Ba mh&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir domsa aithne a bheith agam air. Ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; lena chlann go ndearna s&eacute; an-obair don t&iacute;r seo san am a chaith s&eacute; ar an obair sin sa Seanad, san rialtas &aacute;iti&uacute;il agus in &aacute;iteanna eile, go h&aacute;irithe d&aacute; dhaoine f&eacute;in ina shr&aacute;idbhaile f&eacute;in.  That is what makes people like Willie Farrell great and we want his family and friends to recognise that we recognise and celebrate such qualities.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh s&eacute;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I would like to be associated with the tributes paid to the late Willie Farrell.  I am sure the family is immensely proud to hear the details of what he did during his life, although I am sure it will not capture enough of the essence of the man.  He had a long and distinguished career.  As has been mentioned, anyone who can overcome a disability and turn it into an ability by achieving greatness shows what can be done.  I did not have the honour or opportunity of serving with Willie, but having listened to the contributions of those who knew him, I feel very humbled to be in a Chamber in which he served so long and well.  I offer my condolences and those of my party to his family on their sad loss.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few brief words about the late Willie Farrell.  Coming from Sligo and a political family, I first came to know him personally from a very young age.  I remember the 1977 general election and, although I was only four years old at the time, remember distinctly that he drove a car that I was convinced was from outer space.  Those who knew him well will recall that he was a great supporter of <Col N="586"/>Citroen vehicles and had an enormous loudspeaker, the biggest I have ever seen.  I will always recall him from a child&rsquo;s perspective.  I always knew him to be someone who was gentle and grandfatherly, if I can use that term.  I became extremely fond of him.</P>
        <P>On the political front, the Leader of the House has covered all of the ground that needs to be covered and Willie&rsquo;s legacy is very significant.  If I was to pick one item, it would be his legacy of employment in the north west &mdash; north County Sligo and his native Grange &mdash; and the country as a whole.  Even in these difficult times, the employment figures are most significant.  SF Engineering is headed by his son, Seamus, but there are many other industries in the area.  There is no town or village of similar size which could compete in terms of the diversity of enterprise and the numbers employed.  That is the legacy of Willie Farrell more than anybody else, including those currently in business in the area. It extends throughout north County Sligo.  People from the county will know that Willie strongly supported getting Branley&rsquo;s Yard in Rathcormack and many other enterprises off the ground.</P>
        <P>Willie Farrell championed people with disabilities, having snatched victory from the jaws of defeat when he turned a terrible accident into an advantage by becoming a world class sportsman in golf and other pursuits.  He also had a commitment to health and other causes and was involved in fund-raising activities, including, I recall, a golfing trip in which he played a game in all four provinces and for which he may have used a helicopter.  The Leader referred to Willie&rsquo;s great fund-raising efforts on behalf of a home for people with disabilities which involved travelling to Dublin by pony and trap.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I extend sympathies to all the Farrell family, including Seamus, Liam and Helen; their husbands and children and Seamus&rsquo;s father-in-law who is also present.  Tributes have been paid to many people in my nine years as a Member of the House but I do not recall so many supporters and other associates of the deceased being present in the Visitors Gallery as are present today.  I note, for instance, the presence of Councillor Patsy Barry and his family, the Feeney family, Hugh Gallagher and former Deputy Matt Brennan.  That the president of the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers is also here is a reminder that the IPAV was the body that nominated Willie to run for the Seanad.  The presence of so many in the House epitomises the respect in which Willie was held and the contribution he made.</P>
        <P>The Leader referred to Willie Farrell&rsquo;s contributions to local government, the Seanad and many aspects of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, Willie had a can-do attitude.  He rose to the challenge and fought for the cause of Fianna F&aacute;il.  While I am sure he would have been saddened to have noted the much depleted numbers of the party in Leinster House, he would have insisted that we rose to the challenge.  The spirit of the Willie Farrell I knew from my childhood, the man who showed through his entrepreneurship what Grange in north County Sligo could achieve, will encourage me, as a relatively young person, to be the best I can in life, business and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  If there is one thing I have learned from Willie, it is do the best I can.  I will sum up Willie Farrell in a single sentence, one I have used to describe other people but which has never been more appropriate.  He was all graces and no airs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome to the House the many friends, colleagues and family members of the late former Senator Willie Farrell and wish to be associated with the words of sympathy extended to them.  The relationship between the late Willie Farrell and me dates back to the early 1980s when County Leitrim rejoined the same constituency as County Sligo.  At that time, we had the benefit of Willie&rsquo;s wise counsel on many occasions.  Former Deputy Matt Brennan, <Col N="587"/>who is present in the Visitors Gallery, and I benefited from Willie&rsquo;s wisdom, sometimes quietly in the ballot box, which was very important because we always needed a few extra votes to survive.  I very much appreciated that.</P>
        <P>Willie served his apprenticeship on Sligo County Council before entering the Seanad.  Anyone who enters either House having served their apprenticeship on a local authority will have a good grounding for continuing to represent their people at this level.</P>
        <P>Willie did a tremendous job for disabled people by showing that a handicap is not a handicap unless one wants to make it one.  That was his contribution.  He never considered the accident which caused his disablement as anything other than one of the things that happens in life.  One gets up and moves on to the next stage.</P>
        <P>North County Sligo has a proud record in terms of service to this House and Willie Farrell did justice to that record.  The late Eugene Gilbride also served the area in my early days.  Councillor Barry, who replaced Willie at local authority level, and Senator MacSharry, who is the only Fianna F&aacute;il Oireachtas Member in north County Sligo, carry on the tradition Willie established.

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Senators, I speak with a heavy heart.  I am, however, proud and privileged to have known the late Willie Farrell.  The former Senator&rsquo;s great achievement in politics, from the time he was elected to Sligo County Council in 1967 until he stood down to facilitate the co-option of Councillor Patsy Barry, who is present, has been highlighted.</P>
        <P>Willie Farrell had a habit of never losing.  He got the best out of people.  A story told about him on the Seanad trail is that he usually asked for a number three or four when he came knocking on doors.  When asked about number ones he would say it was the number threes and fours that would elect him.  There is a lesson in that for all of us.</P>
        <P>While Willie Farrell was a proud, loyal Sligo man, he was also a proud, loyal north Sligo man.  There is a difference.  Willie always said the creature in a Sligo man changed from the moment he came in to the area around Teesan and that townies and north Sligo men and women were breeds of their own.</P>
        <P>I entered the Seanad in 2002 when Willie retired and would not have been elected without his support and encouragement.  He was a wonderful mentor and although he did not travel the country with me, he certainly made telephone calls.  When I knocked on doors, people knew of me through him.</P>
        <P>In sympathising with Willie&rsquo;s family, I also sympathise with Patsy Barry, Mattie Brennan, who was Willie&rsquo;s great friend for many years, and Senators Ellis and Mooney who soldiered in the House with him in difficult times.  As someone who has been living in County Sligo for 30 years, I know that the four men in question came to every comhairle ceantair and comhairle D&aacute;il ceantair.  Sadly, this may be what is lacking in political life today.  The likes of Willie Farrell are no longer around.</P>
        <P>Willie died on 8 April 2010.  When I visited him around 5 April his daughter, Helen, was also visiting.  I knew at the time that he did not have many days left.  Even in his lowest, darkest hour, however, he continued to think of others.  The newspaper on the day in question featured a report on a death and he gave out to me for coming in to see him when I would have been better employed down the country at a funeral looking after my vote, as he would have said.</P>
        <P>Willie would never fail or let anything flop and a lovely story is told about a big concert he had organised in Grange.  I believe it was held in the village hall rather than Barry&rsquo;s pub.  On the night in question, the musicians who had been booked let Willie down and he was awfully knocked about.  No one could get the better of him, however, and he decided he would work something out.  He went on to the main street of Grange, a village people are inclined to speed <Col N="588"/>through quickly, and flagged down a car approaching from Cliffony, which is near Bundoran.  Maisie McDaniels and her two sisters were in the car and whatever chat he put on the three women, they were brought into the hall and entertained all night long.  He was still on a winner and no one was any the wiser as to who had let him down.</P>
        <P>As everyone knows, Willie&rsquo;s family were very important to him.  He used to say to me that he was blessed to have the love and support of two great women.  His first wife, Mary, was the mother of Seamus, Liam and Helen.  He used to say that he could not have been where he was without that support.  When Mary died, he met Breda, with whom he shared a few very good years until her death.  He was immensely proud of his children and even more proud of his five grandchildren, of whom he spoke lovingly.  When his eldest grandson graduated and went to work abroad, he thought that young people like that had a wonderful chance today.  He was proud to see his grandson going so far afield.</P>
        <P>As Senator MacSharry said, Willie Farrell left his legacy in Grange.  In fact, I would say that he made the town.  When I went there 30 years ago there was a small caf&eacute; called Willie&rsquo;s Caf&eacute;, but now there is a small industrial estate on the main road with some of the finest supermarkets and pharmacies, together with SF Engineering which holds its head high in world markets.</P>
        <P>Today we are joined by Willie&rsquo;s three children, Seamus, Liam and Helen, as well as Siobhan, Pauric and their five grandchildren.  We are also joined by a man of whom Willie thought an awful lot, Paddy Smith, who is a great Fianna F&aacute;il man in Sligo.  He is also a proud Cavan man, as I told my Cavan colleague, Senator Wilson.</P>
        <P>I certainly miss Willie Farrell.  If there was any trouble &mdash; for the past few years there has been plenty of trouble in Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; he would always lift the phone and give some advice to be passed on to the Taoiseach, former Deputy Brian Cowen.  Willie Farrell will be sorely missed.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P>I join previous speakers in expressing sympathy to the extended family of the late Willie Farrell, including his children, Seamus, Liam and Helen.  I knew Willie Farrell for a good number of years and served with him in this House from 1989 to 2002 when he retired.  His contribution to public life was wonderful and spanned 35 years.  He served the people of Sligo, and of this country, with distinction for 16 years in this House.  He was a member of the old North Western Health Board and also served as its chairman, a role of which he was proud.  He was elected national president of the Institute of ProfessionalAuctioneers and Valuers Association.  Willie was always proud to invite members of that association to Leinster House where he entertained them.  He always enjoyed such occasions.</P>
        <P>Willie was a good man who achieved much in life, despite his handicap.  He excelled in golfing circles and was well known throughout the length and breadth of the country for his sporting prowess.  He always enjoyed a game of golf and was great company.  The late Senator Paddy McGowan was a great friend of his.  I am honoured to have served in this House with both of them.  A number of Willie&rsquo;s friends and colleagues in the Visitors Gallery have been mentioned, including the former Deputy Mattie Brennan.  I am delighted to see both him and the Sligo councillors here today, along with Willie&rsquo;s children, Seamus, Liam and Helen.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to join with previous speakers in paying tribute to the late Willie Farrell, who was a gentleman.  May he rest in peace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I also want to be associated with all the expressions of sympathy to the family of the late Willie Farrell.  My friend and colleague, Senator Ellis, would have had a more detailed political involvement with Willie Farrell than I would.  That was because Leitrim was reunited with Sligo in 1981 when John Ellis was elected to the D&aacute;il.  Willie Farrell <Col N="589"/>was larger than life and his name was synonymous with the northwest.  I will not add to all the great detail of Willie&rsquo;s life, but I wish to endorse everything that has been said. He was a great friend to us all, as well as being a tremendous contributor to Seanad debates.  In addition, he was a wonderful family man.  It is fitting that Councillor Patsy Barry should be present in the Visitors Gallery today, as Willie Farrell&rsquo;s successor in Grange.  He continues to make a contribution in the northwest.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeney referred to Willie Farrell&rsquo;s travails on the Seanad election trail.  As we know, however, a book has yet to be written on Seanad election campaigns, but we will all buy it when it appears.  There are many stories about Willie, and I will cite two briefly.  One concerns three Senators, including Willie, who were in a lift in Leinster House on the way to their offices.  I will not name the other two in order to spare their blushes.  One Senator said to Willie: &ldquo;By the way, I have got those rugby tickets for you.&rdquo;  Nothing else was said until much later in the bar when the other Senator said: &ldquo;I always wondered who that particular Senator voted for, but now I know, because of the tickets.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The other story concerns a practice of giving pens, that has largely died out now.  I am not referring to Senator Francis O&rsquo;Brien in this context because this was long before.  Willie went to the house of a councillor who said how delighted he was to have received one of those writing instruments.  Willie looked at it rather closely and said: &ldquo;I am not so sure that you are in good standing with that.&rdquo;  The councillor asked &ldquo;Why is that?,&rdquo; and Willie said, &ldquo;I know that he gives gold biros to his number ones.&rdquo;  As those of us in the Seanad will know, that immediately ended any relationship with those who had an ordinary biro, and Willie immediately got the number one vote.  Of course, there was no exchange of biros involved with Willie.  That was the sort of man he was &mdash; larger than life.</P>
        <P>References have been made to his grandchildren and I am sure they will miss him as much, if not more so, than anybody else.  On a previous occasion when there were expressions of sympathy, Senator O&rsquo;Toole said that grandchildren can have a much warmer rapport with their grandparents than the generation in between.  I know they must still be missing their grandfather, Willie Farrell, whose company we enjoyed both in the House and outside it.</P>
        <P>I endorse everything that has been said about this wonderful Irishman, patriot, community activist and family man.  He was an all-round good person.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.  I convey my condolences to Seamus, Liam, Helen and their extended family.</P>

	<P>I pay tribute to the late Willie Farrell, although I did not serve with him in this House having become a Member after his departure from public life.  I knew him for many years outside the House, however, coming from the neighbouring county of Mayo.  I also met him at Ard-fheiseanna.  I am delighted to see people in the Visitors Gallery with whom I spent many late nights during that period.</P>
        <P>Willie made a fantastic speech on the fifth floor at what was my first parliamentary party meeting and his last.  He was proud of his republican Fianna F&aacute;il credentials and did not hide them from anyone.  He was a man of integrity, but I can say no more about him than what has already been said by people who knew him far better than I.  To his family, I offer my sincere sympathy.  To his sons, daughter and, especially, his grandchildren who are present, I hope this will be a memorable day.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to see another old friend today, Mattie Brennan, as well as Patsy Barry, John Feeney and quite a few others.  It is a wonderful tribute to Willie that they came to pay their respects.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P>This has been a wonderful tribute to a wonderful man.  The late Willie Farrell was an extraordinarily intelligent man who brought great progress to north County Sligo, in particular the Grange area.  I extend my sympathy to his sons, Seamus and Liam; his daughter, Helen; his five lovely grandchildren who are in attendance and his good friends and supporters in north County Sligo who supported him for many years on the council, in particular Mattie Brennan, who is looking well, and Councillor Patsy Brennan, who was re-elected to the council in 2004 and 2009 after being co-opted onto it and who continued a great tradition in the area after Willie had left the council.</P>
        <P>I got to know Willie through the parliamentary party.  From my Sligo connections, I knew of his work there.  I also knew him from my time as Minister of State at the then Department of Industry and Commerce when he made great contributions to legislation passing through the Seanad.  He invited me to open a lovely enterprise in Grange, Innisfree Crystal Limited.  I have a lovely cut glass crystal decanter on my sideboard from that company.  It is lovely and I will not return it unless someone wants it back.</P>

	<P>It is a valuable piece.  This is the kind of generosity in question.  He arranged the event and we went to his restaurant.  I was impressed by Grange.  It is an example of a village that has developed well over the years.  This is a tribute to the local vocational school, in which he was involved, its teachers and the people of the area.  It is an extraordinary place.  People could follow the work that has been done.</P>
        <P>Willie was extraordinary.  After being disabled in an accident, he was innovative in raising funds for charity.  He was so intelligent, he could raise a great deal of money when things were difficult.  I am delighted, honoured and proud to have known Willie Farrell, to have been at his funeral and that he is being remembered today.  A video that will be made available will show he was a man of great integrity and ability who achieved much and who left behind a great family and a considerable reputation, which is invaluable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am honoured and privileged to speak of my memories of the late Willie Farrell, who died one year ago.  I have the notes of my meeting with him on 4 June 2002 when he advised my husband and I on my future election campaign for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I kept the notes as a souvenir of Willie&rsquo;s wisdom.</P>
        <P>Just two months before the Seanad election, I decided that I should take the plunge because there were so few women in politics.  Having been elected in 1993 to our national executive by all of the Fianna F&aacute;il Dublin women and having been re-elected to same, I felt I had a responsibility.  When I heard on the airwaves about how there were not enough women in politics, I made my decision on the spur of the moment.  Willie spelled out an awesome and difficult proposal for my election campaign, namely, that I would need to travel 10,000 miles over the following 25 days.  I was to start at the remotest point, which was counties Cork and Kerry for me.  As Senator Feeney stated, I was to look for preferences.  This was a new word to me.  The language was new and the strategy was daunting.  How was I to win the election?  I am forever indebted to my friend.</P>
        <P>The first time I heard of Willie Farrell was from my father-in-law in the neighbouring county of Leitrim.  Mr. Batt White was an agricultural instructor for that county and part of north County Sligo.  Some of the people in the Visitors Gallery will remember my father-in-law with respect and endearment.  I loved him passionately.  My natural political inclination was towards the Labour Party and republican socialism.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to be associated with the many tributes paid to the former Senator, the late Willie Farrell.  I first met him when he came looking for a vote in the 1980s.  I was a councillor at the time and he called to my house.  He seemed like a nice man, someone who was charming, courteous and knew how to make his case.  One could learn much from his understanding of politics.  He knew it inside out.  He had a political nose.  He never needed to learn that skill.  One either has it or one does not; it cannot be learned.  There is no doubt that Willie Farrell had it in abundance.  When he spoke with people, he knew whether they were going to give him a vote or what part of it.  He was twigging all of the time.  This was reflected in how he was elected at every election he contested.  One can only get elected if one is good at one&rsquo;s job and knows one&rsquo;s politics.  It is not about the book politics or the rumours here and there.</P>
        <P>Willie went after politics.  He was an ambitious man, a high achiever.  This was clearly reflected in terms of his &ldquo;disability&rdquo;.  It was not a disability.  He turned it around.  If anything, he is an example of what one can do in life if one sets one&rsquo;s goals high, as he did.  He scored particularly on the political scene, but he also scored on the golf course.  No matter how many times he was asked to speak in the Seanad if we were short of numbers, he was always available and always made fine contributions.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to be here today to say my few words and to acknowledge Mattie Brennan, who is a good friend of this House, and Councillor Patsy Barry, who took over the seat and is still minding it very well.  That is an achievement as a result of the late Willie Farrell.</P>
        <P>I endorse all the other tributes that were paid to the former Senator and extend my sympathy to his whole family.  He will always be in my memory.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to the votes of remembrance for the late Willie Farrell.  I served two Seanad terms with Willie, from 1989 to 1992, when I lost out, and again in 1997, and I remember him coming to my home town of Bantry in west Cork to canvass in 1987 and probably also in 1989, when I was not competing in the campaign.</P><Col N="592"/>
        <P>I have a couple of fond memories of Willie.  In early October 1989, I was in Sligo at a conference and met him outside the hotel on a nice autumn evening.  He had got wind of the fact that I was likely to be one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s 11 nominees to the Seanad, which was the first positive news I had got.  We were all waiting and hoping, but Willie had some inkling after having been in Dublin.  He gave me great encouragement and wished me well.  I remember that I thought he might have been leading me up the garden path, because he was a lovable rogue, but he was not.  He had obviously had some hint that I was likely to be nominated, and as it transpired, he was correct in that information.</P>
        <P>In 1997, I happened to be running for the Seanad on the same panel as Willie, the Industrial and Commercial Panel.  I was down in Kerry canvassing and went to call at a particular house, which shall remain nameless, on a nice Sunday evening in summer.  I waited an hour and a half outside this particular house, and I said to myself that whoever the hell was inside holding confessions must have been having dinner, after-dinner mints and everything else.  It was a normal courtesy not to impose one&rsquo;s self if someone else was ahead; one would wait one&rsquo;s turn, which could sometimes take 15 minutes.  However, this was taking a terribly long time.  There might be differences in footballing terms between Cork and Kerry, my neighbouring county, but normally we are politically quite close.  As I was walking outside the house, I heard the man of the house, who has since also gone to his eternal reward, saying goodbye to Willie.  As he told him that he could be assured of his vote and support, I went into the house meekly, knowing that I certainly was not getting that vote.  I said to myself that if Willie Farrell was getting votes down in Kerry, over the hills from my home town, he was certainly a strong contender.  However, as it happened, we were both elected.</P>
        <P>I have fond memories of Willie in this House, where he was a great contributor.  He was the essence of a man of the people.  He had no airs or graces, but he knew very well the fundamentals of politics and what his Fianna F&aacute;il and republican ideology was all about.  I am glad to be here today to convey my good wishes to his family, to Councillor Barry and to the great retired Oireachtas Member, Mattie Brennan.  It is great that we are here to pay deserved tribute to the late Willie Farrell.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not have the pleasure of working here with the late Willie Farrell, but I did know him as a voter, when he used to come to Kerry at election time, and I found him, as did everybody else, a pleasant and charming man and most interesting company.  He used to play a bit of golf in Ballybunion; I am not certain whether he had relatives in that area, but he used to go there quite a lot.  I am in the menswear business, and he used to come to me for his golf gear.  He always got great value but, of course, it was the number one he was really after.  He was a lovely man.  My cousin, the late Kit Ahern, served with him for a period; she certainly served with Mattie Brennan, of whom she always spoke highly.  When I went on the road and found myself in Grange, he could not have been kinder.  He brought me straight to Councillor Patsy Barry and did everything he could to shorten my road.</P>
        <P>I have nothing further to add to the lovely tributes that have been paid, but this will be a great record for his family and grandchildren in the future.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom aont&uacute; leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ar son an Seanad&oacute;ir Liam &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l anseo inniu.  I first came to be aware of Willie Farrell back in the early 1980s &mdash; I think it was 1981 &mdash; when a good friend of his and of mine, Se&aacute;n McQuaid from Roscommon, approached me to suggest that we nominate him for the Seanad on the Industrial and Commercial Panel.  Se&aacute;n was president of the Irish Road Haulage Association and I was vicepresident at the time.  I agreed, we met Willie, and he went for it.  I cannot recall the outcome at this <Col N="593"/>stage; I know there were a number of elections together, and he won some and lost some.  Little did I realise at that time that I would subsequently come to serve with him in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I found him a great mentor and a wise head, as many have recognised today.</P>
        <P>Those who were here in 1997 will remember that a great friend of mine, Tom Fitzgerald, with whom I served for many years on the General Council of County Councils, was Whip at that time.  Tom could be quite a cantankerous Whip at times, and many of us developed a pattern of going to Willie, who was his <i>aide-de-camp</i> and associate Whip, if we were looking for a pair or some other concession, because he was always much more accommodating.  I got to know him well during that period and I came to admire him and what he stood for.  As a politician, he stood for many of the values and aspects of republican philosophy which most people of our party and of his era would have espoused, and which I hope we will return to in fairly strong fashion in the near future.</P>
        <P>We developed a friendship, and I remember Willie coming to me before the election in 2002 to seek advice and ask whether I would take some soundings on his prospects for re-election because I was the chairman of LAMA at the time.  By the time I got back to him about it he had already decided not to run, but the fact that he was considering it was indicative of the commitment he had and of his young outlook.  It was only subsequently that I found out he had at that stage passed his mid-70s.  It was a hallmark of his enthusiasm and commitment that he was still as interested as he was the first day he entered politics.  He is an example to many young people who now decide to play their part by entering politics.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by sympathising with his son, daughter and extended family.  They will miss him.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P>I join in the words of tribute to my late colleague, former Senator Willie Farrell.  It is many years since I served with him in the Seanad, but he was certainly a politician who existed in what Americans would call the no-spin zone.  What Willie thought, he said.  His views were expressed clearly and strongly, and political correctness was not part of his vocabulary.  He spoke from the heart.  He represented something that is now a thing of the past among politicians, namely, the ability to call things as they are.  Without fear or favour he expressed his views strongly in the House.  I served with him for three years in the Seanad and from time to time on various Oireachtas committees, and he had sincerely held views which were always strongly expressed.</P>
        <P>Willie Farrell always wore a smile on his face and he enjoyed his politics.  He enjoyed the friendship of people right across the political spectrum and was respected because of that.  He wore his disability lightly and was an inspiration to many people who suffered similar burdens in life.  To his friends, and particularly his family, I express my sympathy, although it is some months since he died.  He is one of those political figures whose legacy remains strong.  We all remember him in a very fond fashion.  May he rest in peace.</P>

	<P>I, too, want to be associated with all the kind remarks about the late Willie Farrell.  I served here with him from 1997 until 2002 and we were on the same panel.  I joked earlier about chocolate, but that was a reference to slightly later.  Despite that fact, however, we became great friends.  He had lovely stories and was always prepared to give one the arm, and advice, which was unusual for people on the same panel in this House.  As my colleague here said, he was very much a straight shooter.  He contributed in practically every <Col N="594"/>sitting, particularly on the Order of Business, and he was always extremely practical in what he dealt with. </P>
        <P>I was always very happy to be in his company.  I recall a  nice summer&rsquo;s day in Rosses Point, when he scored very well in an Oireachtas outing.  He was adept at golf, despite his disability and greatly enjoyed it.  He did not seem to be handicapped because he could beat the blazes out of many of us, as I discovered.  I am delighted to be associated with this celebration of his life, in a sense.  There is much more that we could say but the Cathaoirleach does not want us to hold up the House any further, since we have an important Bill to deal with.  That said, I am delighted to be associated with all the tributes that Willie richly deserves.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a ainm d&iacute;lis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very glad that I managed to get back in time to say a few words about the late Willie Farrell.  I knew him for many years in the House.  We crossed swords regularly and we both enjoyed it.  I would meet him in the corridor afterwards with a glint in his eye.  Once or twice matters got fairly hot but we never lost our tempers and there was always a good degree of humour.  That is what I appreciated about him. </P>
        <P>Willie Farrell was very much of the country.  He spoke about his educational background and the traditional Ireland from which he came which now, sadly, is almost entirely gone.  I miss him, he thought I was a rogue and I thought he was another one.  We got along fine.  I have been in Sligo a couple of times recently.  The last time, not so long ago, I sent a message to him and asked whether it might be possible to see him.  By that time, however, he was in a nursing home, it was within a few weeks of his death and it was not appropriate for me to go and see him.  I doubt if any message would have registered with him, in the event.</P>
        <P>However, I have affectionate memories of Willie Farrell, and he certainly stood for certain values.  He came to realise that I shared many of those values, but I approached them in a different way, and from a different period.  I was slightly younger, I believe, but now as I am about the oldest person around, perhaps I am of another age.  In any event, he will be remembered in this House.</P>
        <P>The one thing we will not remember about Willie Farrell is that he lost his arm, because it never stopped him.  However, it did impel him to work on important initiatives for people who were disabled, and he spoke effectively on these issues.  This is not for me a sad, but a nostalgic day.  I have affectionate memories of him and I should like to extend my sympathies to the family, which must still mourn his passing and feel his loss, although a number of months have passed since he died.  I think kindly of him, and I am quite certain that this House will not see his like again, because even in Sligo they are not being made any more.</P>

	<P>I would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the family of the late Willie Farrell.  I knew him from the early 1980s, and regardless of whether it was at a council meeting, in the Chamber here or at a CPP meeting, whenever Willie Farrell spoke everybody listened.  He always had something worthwhile to say and as the Leader of the House said, he was very much into the issue of alcohol abuse.  He spoke very strongly about it and made it a national campaign in this House on several occasions.  Week after week he <Col N="595"/>raised the issue of the abuse of alcohol and the difficulties it caused to families and homes throughout the length and breadth of the country. </P>
        <P>Willie Farrell was a great golfer.  He was a former captain of Bundoran Golf Club.  When he was captain of the Oireachtas Golf Society he led an outing to his beloved home club, Bundoran.  He took us to Rosses Point as well and we had a great few days there.  He enjoyed playing golf, which is hard enough to play with two hands.  Willie Farrell, however, was a champion with one arm.  Whether in wind, rain, hail or snow, if there was an Oireachtas outing he was always there.</P>
        <P>I have very fond memories of the late former Senator and want to be associated with the motions of sympathy to his family.</P>

I had the pleasure of serving with him as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and voting for him on a number of occasions in his Seanad campaigns. </P>
        <P>Willie Farrell was reliable, good humoured and totally committed to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, especially in his role as deputy and Government Whip.  I also knew him on the General Council of County Councils and the Association of Health Boards in Ireland.  I recall one occasion when he was acting Whip in the House on a late Thursday afternoon when we were dealing with a Bill.  The understanding was that there would be no vote, but at that time, people could be Members of the European Parliament as well as Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  A particular MEP used to return here on a Thursday, on occasions.  Luckily, Willie happened to spot this individual coming through a gate, relatively late, and immediately did a round of the House to ensure sufficient Members were present in case of a vote.  Sure enough, there was a vote and I believe the result was seven to six.  Willie always referred thereafter to the &ldquo;magnificent seven&rdquo;, but on that occasion he ensured that a section of a Bill was not defeated here in this House.</P>
        <P>Willie Farrell made an enormous contribution to Irish political life and served the people of Sligo with distinction for many years as a member of Sligo County Council.  To his daughter, Helen; sons, Seamus and Liam; daughter-in-law, Siobhan; son-in-law, Pauric, and all his grandchildren I extend my sincere sympathy.  I now ask Members to stand in silence for one minute. </P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment proposes a new interpretation section for the Bill.  It deals with interpretation matters and sets out definitions of various terms used in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  Senator Quinn has been briefed extensively by senior members of the construction industry.  I imagine that the amendment emerged from discussions subsequent to the satisfactory passage of earlier Stages of the Bill in this House.  It is an important Bill and this is a significant amendment.  It redefines a range of matters from the central matter of the construction contract.  I understand the Bill is not being opposed so there is no need to make the argument for it.  This is a comprehensive and detailed series of definitions and is welcome.</P>
        <P>This Bill indicates the relevance of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The construction industry is in considerable difficulty and the fact that senior members of the construction industry chose to approach a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to assist in the production of this legislation shows that at the centre of our business enterprise, in one of the most significant engines of the economy, leading figures considered Seanad &Eacute;ireann to be the appropriate place for this legislation to be discussed.  That point does not need further underlining but I am pleased to speak in support of Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Bill.  He has done the Seanad considerable service by introducing it.  In the final days of this session of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, it is important that the last act should be the passage of this significant Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise an objection at this point because it concerns section 2 even though it relates to section 5 of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I can allow the Senator to speak on the section later if her contribution does not concern the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It concerns the amendment.  Before we get carried away by what we are doing, we must realise that everyone is agreed on the concept.  However, the details are flawed.  The Bill purports to protect suppliers but it does not protect suppliers and subcontractors.  If we are taking the opportunity to fix something, we should do it comprehensively.  The objection I have to section 2 is that it continues to exclude materials from protection.  I do not understand why.  The exclusion of materials is referred to in the amendment which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">(3) Subject to <i>subsection (4) </i>references in this Act to construction operations do not include the manufacture or delivery to a construction site of&mdash;</P><Col N="599"/>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) building or engineering components or equipment,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) materials, plant or machinery, or</P>
        <P FLI="0">Some of the references to this Bill by Senator Quinn concerned companies that have gone to the wall because they were not paid by major construction companies.  However, the Bill will not protect these people.  The exclusion of people who supply materials, whether concrete or other materials, means they do not get protection.  I will discuss this point again in section 5.  I ask the Minister of State to consider removing this section because it weakens the legislation.  I am interested in hearing the justification for leaving this section in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the comments of Senator Norris.  I thank him for his kind words but I must correct him on one point.  This Bill did not come about because of the construction industry approaching me.  It was not a great honour for the Seanad.  Mr. Se&aacute;n Gallagher was upset by an experience he had and he wrote to his local representative in Cavan-Monaghan, Deputy Margaret Conlon, and she circulated the concerns.  This took place last April.  When I saw this concern, I thought that it seemed wrong that subcontractors were not being paid by someone who was not short of money and had money to build his own home.  I wondered if we could do something about this and I initiated the Bill.  After I went public, the construction industry and others approached me and told me this was exactly what they wanted.  I thank Senator Norris for his words.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an even stronger argument for the retention of the Seanad and an even greater degree of praise attaches to Senator Quinn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Senator O&rsquo;Malley, I understand her concern.  Materials were not included in this legislation.  The reason is that there is sufficient legislation in this regard.  If someone sells me a car and I do not pay, I owe money and the person can get that money from me through various methods.  What we have included in the legislation makes the clarification in regard to that, such that the Bill will apply if the contract concerned also provides for the installation of the material and the equipment and supplies.  If someone offers to supply materials, but has nothing to do with installation, this legislation does not apply because sufficient legislation exists in that regard.  On the other hand, if one is a plumber, a tiler or an electrician and provides the pipes, tiles or wiring and installs them, this legislation applies and covers material on that basis.  We are not trying to cover every item of legislation.  If materials are provided and installed, they are governed by the legislation.  I would like to cover more but I am more anxious to get this legislation passed rather than making it so widespread that it is difficult to enforce.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>In section 2(2)(<i>c</i>), I propose inserting &ldquo;unless the above items are individually designed and manufactured for the relevant construction operations&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This amendment reflects the concern of contractors involved on the Dublin Airport Terminal 2 project.  Bespoke components made for a specific project should come within the legislation.  This is because many construction operations involve fabrication off-site.  Such an amendment would also be supported by the professional bodies.  This is landmark legislation.  While it does not remedy the injustices done to the many thousands of subcontractors who have been left without payment, it will protect subcontractors in future from non-payment, late payment and underpayment.</P>
</Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I am here purely to endorse the points already made.  I took an interest in this issue a long time ago and I was delighted when Senator Quinn initiated a Bill covering this area.  I am reflecting many of the views of subcontractors who came to me and <Col N="600"/>asked me to endorse this Bill.  We discussed that it does not cover some aspects such as the payment of materials and that there is sufficient legislation covering that.  I would like to know what that legislation is and how it can be incorporated in order that people would know where they stand and could be assured that all the conditions of a contract would be fulfilled when it comes to payment.  It is important that a subcontractor who enters into a contract knows exactly where he or she stands before setting out to do the work and getting paid for it, whether that be with or without materials included.  That aspect is a little vague and I would like further clarification on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure whether my query relates to the amendment of this section.  I also pay tribute to Senator Quinn, Sean Gallagher and many people like him whose companies have suffered as a result of this gap in the legislation.  I also pay tribute to the outgoing Government.  When Senator Quinn first brought this before the House as a published Bill, he received a commitment from the outgoing Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that within six months of the date of the passing of Second Stage it would be introduced back into this House.  The timetable has slipped a little and Senator Quinn has indicated he is very pleased we have been brought back into the House today while still under the current Administration and as the hours slip away.  That is not only relevant but also important and significant.  It might be helpful to know where the Bill will go to after today.</P>
        <P>I am curious about one aspect although I am sure it applies to the amendment of this section.  There is great concern that this Bill will not apply retrospectively and is in a way closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  If passed, some flexibility must be built into it, therefore, to address the financial difficulties and disasters that befell subcontractors.  Not all subcontractors are big companies.  Some are small companies, sole traders or family businesses.</P>
        <P>Section 2 in the legislation as initiated states that the term &ldquo;relevant payment date&rdquo; &ldquo;shall have the meaning assigned to it in the European Communities (Late Payments in Commercial Transactions) Regulations, 2002&rdquo;.  In regard to section 3&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should stick to this section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in the context of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it related?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  It is in the context of the question.  Section 3 states that the Bill shall apply only to construction contracts which are entered into after its commencement.  I am curious to know the position in terms of the relevant payment date.  For example, if Mr. Gallagher&rsquo;s company or a similar company submitted an invoice and it was subject to the normal trading conditions of payment within four weeks, two months or three months and the company was not paid, would the European Communities late payment regulations become relevant even though the Bill states they are not being applied retrospectively?  I appreciate I am dancing on the head of a pin here but I am curious to know if there is any redress for such non-payment of a contract.</P>
        <P>I reiterate this is an important day for the Seanad, even in its dying hours.  I again pay tribute to Senator Quinn in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We all subscribe fully to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s intention in the purpose of this Bill, which unfortunately has been watered down, and we may be straying somewhat in not specifically addressing this section, to which the Senator has tried specifically to draw attention.  I share Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s concern that the manufacture and delivery of building <Col N="601"/>materials to site are not covered.  I will deal with my principal concern in regard to securing cash flow being lost when we come to the more relevant section, which is section 8.  I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s amendment and I will have more to say about my disagreements as we progress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>What is covered in the Bill is exactly as Senator Coghlan has said.  It is perhaps not what was intended at the beginning.  The intention was to cover as much as we could.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley said she is disappointed that materials are not included in it.  We recognised very early on that we could not do everything.  What I set out to do was to have certainty of timing of payments, certainty of the amount of payments, certainty of the enforcement whereby one could ensure one would get paid rather than just know that someone owed one money and one was not able to get it, and certainty that the cash was secure.  The other aspect I wanted included was that if a dispute arose, a solution could be found.</P>
        <P>We have gone a long way towards dealing with most of those aspects but we have not yet managed to find a way to ensure the cash is secure &mdash; security of cash &mdash; although it is still possible that a way could be found to ensure that by the time the Bill gets through the D&aacute;il.  Officials in the Department of Finance and in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office have been working very hard to find a solution to that but it is not easy to find.  Rather than delay the passage of the Bill any more, the fact that we are not achieving all four certainties but only part of them is still a better step forward.  I was hoping for 100% and I have got something less than that, but even if it is only 80%, 70% or 40%, it is still a step in the right direction to help those subcontractors who have lost out on that basis.  I understand the concerns of Senators Mooney and O&rsquo;Malley in regard to those particular areas but this Bill aims at achieving as much as we can at this stage.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White raised the very understandable point about materials made specifically for a project.  She referred to the Terminal 2 project and that people who did work on it are concerned.  Parts of the materials used in that building were made specifically for it.  They were not off-the-shelf equipment.  One could understand on that basis the intention would be to have such materials included.  The debate on that can continue but at present such provision has not been included in this legislation.  What we have included is anything that is made and installed by the same maker.  On that basis, that aspect will be included but materials that are what one could call off the shelf are not included.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator O&rsquo;Malley wish to comment further?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Will I be able to come back once the Minister of State has replied to the question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, the Senator can do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I will wait until the Minister of State has replied.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>We want to welcome Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Bill.  The Department has worked hard with him in trying to reach some compromise on it.   With regard to issues that have been raised, I am sure Senator Coghlan will bring them to the attention of his party members who will be in government this time tomorrow.</P>
        <P>In regard to Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s substantive point, we acknowledge that there are some gaps.  However, it is felt that to address those fully, we need a regulatory impact assessment because the impact of what she suggests may be broader than what she intends.  It may add considerably to the regulatory impact.  It would be possible to do such an assessment ahead of this Bill going <Col N="602"/>to the D&aacute;il in the next session and I understand it will be a priority for the incoming Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response, but I do not accept what he has said.  We are seeking to offer protection for people.  A limited amount of protection is being offered.  Rather than not having materials included, as Senator Quinn mentioned, they are expressly excluded. That is why I am seeking the removal of the express exclusion.  It is a very simple amendment and just requires the removal of the reference to materials.  As anybody in the construction industry knows, once one has poured concrete one cannot reverse the process.  While I understand the Minister of State&rsquo;s point that labour cannot be recalled once delivered, I contend the same applies to materials.  The legislation is deeply flawed in this regard.  This can be addressed simply by removing the exclusion of materials, as in the proposed subsection (3)(<i>b</i>).  I do not accept that removing the exclusion is impossible.</P>
        <P>We all agree on the intention of the Bill.  Nobody wants to see anybody who has delivered a service not getting paid.  Suppliers of materials are equally entitled to the protection afforded to service providers.  By removing the reference to materials from the list, we can offer materials suppliers comfort in this regard.  We should do so.</P>
        <P>I accept what the Minister of State said about a regulatory impact study but the purpose of the Bill is to offer protection.  Therefore, I do not believe the regulatory impact assessment is justifiable in respect of materials alone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Might a retention-of-title clause assist in the contract to surmount the problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>Under general law, there is an option to pursue debts through the courts.  It is intended to arrive at a mechanism to strengthen this provision.  It was our intention in drafting the Bill that this would be dealt with within the D&aacute;il process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is simply a matter of excluding the reference to materials.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not as simple as the Senator suggests; that is the difficulty.  Often what we believe in the House to be simple leads to all sorts of issues.  That is why we want to carry out a regulatory impact study and, I hope, introduce a mechanism that can be agreed by the Department, the Seanad and the D&aacute;il in the context of the D&aacute;il legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley has raised a significant point.  This is a question of indebtedness and people who have provided materials or services losing money.  There was a very interesting television programme on this precise point.  A number of people who had incurred losses were interviewed.  The principal person who contacted Senator Quinn to discuss this matter, which interaction led to the Bill, was certainly involved in the programme, but so also were those who had provided goods in addition to services.</P>
        <P>I know what is involved from having been involved in businesses in Temple Bar.  On one occasion, we had to install air conditioning.  Air conditioning units are enormously expensive and can cost from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000 depending on the complexity and scale of the building in which they are to be installed.  This matter really needs to be considered.</P>
        <P>The political question concerns whether, by considering these matters now, we will hold the Bill back from a possible speedy passage that would rescue certain people in difficulty or people who are about to get into difficulty.  Will the Bill be delayed by the Government in the other <Col N="603"/>House?  Perhaps we could have an indication of the attitude of the incoming Government towards the Bill and whether it will be regarded as a priority.  These are decisions we have got to make.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn makes the valid point that this legislation is not perfect, but very little in this life is perfect.  It may be as well to opt for legislation that does not cover every situation.  That entails a political judgment and we should know the timescale if the corrections proposed are to be made.  We need to know the attitude of the incoming Government thereto before these decisions are made.</P>
        <P>I would feel a little aggrieved if I were the supplier of goods of very significant value, whose value had been added to the payment made to somebody.  It would be wrong if one were allowed to hang onto the value that the supply of my goods or materials had contributed.  Those concerned would have been paid for me and, therefore, should pass the value down the chain.  That is the principle of the Bill.  It is a good principle and it should be extended.  I am not certain why there should be a specific exclusion.  Not including a provision is one matter but specifically excluding it is another.  I have not heard sufficient argument to justify a specific exclusion.  Perhaps not including a measure is one argument.  Senator Quinn has been closer to this matter than I have been and he has dealt with it in a most detailed and interesting way.  Perhaps he will return to some of these questions in a subsequent contribution.</P>

	<P>Considering that we will not carry this much farther today, we should just do what we can.  A new Government will enter office tomorrow.  I ask Senator Coghlan, who is taking this legislation on behalf of the other side of the House, to ensure tomorrow, when he is in a position to do so, that it will be put on the agenda for completion very quickly in the new D&aacute;il in order to sort out the problem that has been highlighted.

	<P>The real aim of this legislation was to achieve help for subcontractors.  We did not try to achieve something that changes the law or introduces a new topic in law.  Existing legislation stipulates that I owe one money if I buy something from one.  The legislation stipulates how that money can be obtained.  We require the legislation before us to cover circumstances where goods are bought and installed.  It is a subcontractors Bill and does not attempt to cover all legislation concerning buying and selling.  Regrettably, we did not cover such a wide range because we did not believe we would be able to keep the legislation concise and capable of being passed.</P>
        <P>We copied some British legislation and examined what was done in New Zealand, Malaysia and certain states in Australia.  We learned a great deal from what they have done.  In many of those cases, a decision was made not to include materials unless they were installed as part of the subcontractor&rsquo;s contract.  This legislation may not be as all-encompassing as it might have been but it is aimed at subcontractors who install materials.  It does not include material that is not installed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;3.&mdash;(1) A contract is not a construction contract&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) if one or more than one of the parties to the contract is a state contracting entity and the value of the contract is not more than &euro;50,000,</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) if the value of the contract is more than &euro;200,000, and&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="4">(i) the contract relates only to a dwelling, and</P>
        <P LI="4">(ii) the dwelling has a floor area not greater than 200 square metres, and</P>
        <P LI="4">(iii) one of the parties to the contract is a person who occupies, or intends to occupy, the dwelling as his or her residence,or</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) in any other case, where the value of the contract is not more than &euro;200,000.</P>
        <P LI="2">(2) A contract of employment (within the meaning of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997) is not a construction contract.</P>
        <P LI="2">(3) A contract between a State authority and its partner in a public private partnership arrangement, as those terms are defined in the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Act 2002, is not a construction contract.</P>
        <P LI="2">(4) Where a contract contains provisions in relation to activities other than those referred to in the definition of construction contract and <i>section 2(2)</i>, it is a construction contract only so far as it relates to those activities.</P>
        <P LI="2">(5) This Act applies to a construction contract whether or not&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) the law of the State is otherwise the applicable law in relation to the construction contract, or</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) the parties to the construction contract purport to limit or exclude its application.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Amendment No. 2 concerns the scope and application of the Bill.  It excludes certain contracts from the definition of &ldquo;construction contract&rdquo;.  It ensures the Bill will not apply to contracts whose values are below certain thresholds. It also ensures that in the normal course the Bill would not apply to an ordinary individual who enters a contract for the building, extension or renovation of his or her home.  He or she will not be required to comply with the new rules set out in the Bill.  However, the amendment tries to ensure that contracts concerning so-called &ldquo;trophy homes&rdquo; come within the scope of the Bill.  We must examine this to see how it applies.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 3 sets out new rules to govern payments under construction contracts and this is a core feature of the Bill.  Under the amendment, all construction contracts will have to provide clearly for interim and final payments and for the sums due in each case.  The contract will have to set out clearly when payments of these amounts will fall due.  If a contract fails to <Col N="605"/>specify these matters then the terms set out in amendment No. 12 will apply.  The amendment also ensures &mdash; this is an important part of the Bill which I am very pleased to say will be enforced very successfully &mdash; that &ldquo;pay when paid&rdquo; clauses will no longer be acceptable in contracts.  This means, for example, that subcontractors or sub-subcontractors will no longer be dependent on a main contractor getting paid before they are entitled to receive their payments.  This has been a big problem whereby the main contractor states he or she will not pay until after he or she gets paid.  We will outlaw this in the legislation.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 12 introduces a new schedule to the Bill and it works together with amendment No. 3.  The schedule sets out default arrangements for contract payment terms.  These will be minimum standards for subcontracts.  This is a major innovation which should especially help subcontractors.  These are the three amendments which have been banded together.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed section 3(1)(<i>c</i>) states, &ldquo;in any other case, where the value of the contract is not more than &euro;200,000.&rdquo;  The sum of &euro;50,000 would be a more relevant figure in this case because of the value of what is involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I can understand Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s view.  There is concern about this.  It has come about in a situation whereby it is rather difficult to ensure the correct amount is always the one that should apply.  Certainly, on this basis it seems to me that &euro;200,000 is far too high a figure.  One of the areas we will have a chance to examine in this case is the regulatory impact analysis, RIA, to see the effect of this.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, stated the RIA will have an effect.  The objective of the figure of &euro;200,000 may not stand.  It may be possible to adjust it.  The case made by Senator Coghlan is very worthy of consideration.  This could be considered either with the RIA or in the D&aacute;il.  However, at this stage the figure of &euro;200,000 is the one that has been agreed.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;7.&mdash;(1) This section applies where, not later than 5 days after the payment claim date, an executing party to a construction contract delivers a payment claim notice relating to a payment claim to the other party or another person specified under the construction contract.</P>
        <P LI="2">(2) A payment claim notice is a notice specifying&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) the amount claimed (even if the amount is zero),</P>

        <P LI="4">(iii) the basis on which the amount referred to in <i>subparagraph (i)</i> is calculated,</P>
        <P LI="3">and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) if the matter has not been settled by the day on which the amount is due, shall pay the amount referred to in <i>paragraph (a)</i> to the executing party not later than on that day.</P>
        <P LI="2">(4) Where a reason for the different amount in the response is attributable to a claim for loss or damage arising from an alleged breach of any contractual or other obligation of the executing party (under the construction contract or otherwise), or any other claim that the other person alleges against the executing party, the response shall also specify&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) when the loss was incurred or the damage occurred, or how the other claim arose,</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment concerns arrangements for a party to claim payments under construction contracts.  It sets out detailed procedures for making a payment claim.  In the event that the amount involved is disputed between the parties, the amendment works to ensure that each of the parties is clear about the amount in dispute and the basis on which the dispute arises.  This provides an important clarification which is not readily available to contracting parties at present.  It then forms the basis for seeking a resolution of any payment dispute through moving on to the adjudication process provided under the Bill.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;8.&mdash;(1) Where any amount due under a construction contract is not paid in full by the day on which the amount is due, the executing party may suspend work under the construction contract by giving notice in writing under <i>subsection (2)</i>.</P>
        <P LI="2">(2) Notice under this subsection shall specify the grounds on which it is intended to suspend work and shall be delivered to the other party&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) not earlier than the day after the day on which the amount concerned is due, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) at least 7 days before the proposed suspension is to begin.</P>
        <P LI="2">(3) Work may not be suspended under <i>subsection (1)</i>&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) after payment by the other party of the amount due, or</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) after the end of the period of 14 days beginning with the day on which the suspension begins.</P>
        <P LI="2">(4) Where work is suspended under <i>subsection (1)</i> and the ability of the executing party to complete work within a contractual time limit is affected by the suspension of work, the period of suspension shall be disregarded for the purpose of computing the contractual time limit unless the suspension of work is unjustified in the circumstances.</P>
        <P LI="2">(5) Where work is suspended under <i>subsection (1)</i> and the ability of a subcontractor to complete work within a contractual time limit is affected by the suspension of work, the <Col N="609"/>period of suspension shall be disregarded for the purpose of computing the contractual time limit.</P>
        <P LI="2">(6) A period of suspension of work under <i>subsection (1)</i> shall also be disregarded for the purpose of computing the time taken to complete the work under another construction contract where&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) the construction contract the work under which is suspended is a subcontract,</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) the other construction contract is also a subcontract and the other party to that other subcontract is the same as the other party to the subcontract the work under which is suspended, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) the ability of the executing party under that other subcontract to complete work within a contractual time limit is affected by the suspension of work.</P>
        <P LI="2">(7) This section is without prejudice to the right of the other party to the construction contract under which work is suspended to claim for compensation or damages for any loss due to a suspension of work that is unjustified in the circumstances.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is to insert a new section on the right to suspend work for non-payment.  The amendment confers a new statutory right for contracting parties.  A party which has not been fully paid in accordance with the contract and terms of the Bill will now have the right to suspend work under the contract for a period of up to two weeks.  This has been part of the problem in the past; somebody who has not been paid could not suspend work and had to continue, getting into more and more debt.  The amendment sets out the rules under which the suspension of work can occur.  The aim of the amendment is to help to balance the power between contracting parties without unduly hampering completion of the project.  The existence of the right should help ensure that payments are made on time.</P>
        <P>Where a payment claim is still unpaid following the period of suspension then the appropriate path is for the parties to move on to adjudication and to seek resolution of the matter through that process.  This has been a problem for a long time whereby someone who has done work has not been paid but is still obliged to continue doing the work.  This provides a new right for a non-paid party to suspend the work that would otherwise be required under the construction contract.  This is an important section of the Bill.</P>

        <P>As I mentioned, of the four certainties which I hope to achieve, three would be achieved by this amendment, the certainty of timing, the certainty of the amount and the certainty of being able to stop work if not paid suspension.  We are also looking for a solution to apply to disputes when they occur.  These amendments would create a new process for the adjudication &mdash; note the word &ldquo;adjudication&rdquo; &mdash; of payment disputes and they set out arrangements for this new process.  This is quite a critical aspect of the Bill.  It creates an important mechanism by which unpaid parties to construction contracts can get a relatively quick and cost-effective resolution of their payment disputes.  The amendments deal with the right to refer payment disputes to adjudication, the right to suspend work for failure to comply with the adjudicator&rsquo;s decision, the selection of a panel of adjudicators and the code of practice for adjudication.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 6 makes provision for a new system of adjudication and gives contracting parties the right to refer payment disputes to adjudication and it sets out the arrangements to be followed.  It ensures that a construction contract cannot be drafted to try to negate or to reduce this right to adjudication.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 7 provides that if an adjudicator&rsquo;s award is not paid in full within seven days of the adjudication decision, the unpaid party has a right to suspend work under the construction contract.  The amendment sets out the rules governing this arrangement.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 8 sets up arrangements for the creation of a panel from which an adjudicator can be appointed to deal with a payment dispute.  Amendment No. 9 gives the Minister for Finance the power to prepare and publish a code of practice to govern the conduct of adjudicators.  This is a crucial part of this legislation as it installs something which it is hoped will reduce considerably the number of disputes which are not settled quickly.  It is a way of settling such disputes quickly and fairly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand Senator Quinn&rsquo;s very good intentions but I must strongly oppose amendment No. 6  which proposes:</P>
        <P LI="1">(12) The decision of the adjudicator shall not be binding if the payment dispute is referred to arbitration or proceedings are otherwise initiated in relation to the decision unless the parties agree to accept the decision as finally determining the payment dispute.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is wrong.  I know that Senator Quinn tried to copy best practice as prevails in Britain and this is certainly not what was intended there nor what was achieved there, as I understand it.  This provision will starve subcontractors of cash flow by sending them into a two to three-year arbitration process and delay.  It is contrary to what Senator Quinn intended.  I oppose that section for those reasons as it cuts totally against Senator Quinn&rsquo;s intention, as I understand it. <Col N="612"/> I ask Senator Quinn to elaborate or to comment further.  I believe my interpretation is correct and if I am wrong I ask him to enlighten us further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s view.  If adjudication is to work is it possible to introduce the separate issues of arbitration and litigation?  Once one renders the decision of the adjudicator non-binding, does one really attack the ability of subcontractors to achieve a speedy resolution of these matters?  The Bill provides that the adjudicator shall reach a decision within 28 days and as Senator Coghlan has said, this is kicking the whole issue into the long grass &mdash; he may not have said those words but this is what it amounts to.  I wonder what is the intention behind the change proposed here.  Clearly it was not Senator Quinn&rsquo;s intention that the decision of the adjudicator should be rendered non-binding by the creation of the possibility of referring the dispute to arbitration or proceedings.  This would be very unpopular in the industry and it strikes me that the decision of the adjudicator should be binding.  I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I came to a similar conclusion.  I was involved in the issue of the renovation of Eyre Square which dragged on significantly and caused great difficulty for the city of Galway.  What is required is a quick and clear decision.  I note Senator Quinn&rsquo;s proposal that the Minister should publish guidelines.  A two-track process is not desirable but rather a firm and quick process of decision-making is required which would result in a final decision.  If the process is to be dragged through adjudication and arbitration, this could lead to very long timescales in the case of public sector contracts.  Without having the wording from the future Minister in front of us, it is difficult to say how this would work.  As I would not like to see a two-track process, I support Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s views.  There should be a binding arbitration process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>Much work was undertaken to provide a security of payment provision amenable to both parties.  There is a difficulty about public contracts and having the right to appeal a decision through arbitration to ensure the best value for money is achieved for the taxpayer.  We are still committed to achieving a security payment system which would avoid such situations in both the public and the private sector.  We are committed to discussing this system with the Attorney General and with Senator Quinn in advance of the Bill going to the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no doubt the Minister of State is correct.  It is very difficult to go to an adjudicator and expect his or her decision to be completely binding at all times.  The adjudicator could make a mistake in some cases and this must be allowed for.  I agree with the point that the process should be quick and this would be the most attractive option but I do not think it can be done as simply as that.  I refer to the question of public contracts and in-built arbitration options which will not be changed by this Bill.  I remind the House that adjudicators can make mistakes and we must avoid being hide-bound and being unable to change a decision.</P>
        <P>I suggest two actions that could be taken.  The agreement to accept the decision of the adjudicator as binding could be the default position at the beginning of the process with parties being allowed to opt out.  The second option is that a timeline should be imposed on the arbitration procedure in order for a speedy resolution.  We cannot change what is the law in <Col N="613"/>other places in this regard.  We have to live with Senator Quinn&rsquo;s amendment.  Everyone is agreed on the outcome and it is a case of finding a way to achieve it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The new subsection (12) will kill adjudication.  By the simple expedient of referring the dispute to arbitration or litigation the decision of the adjudicator would be rendered non-binding.  This would be very unpopular in the industry.  The decision of the adjudicator should be binding until there is either an arbitrator&rsquo;s award, a court judgment or until the parties have accepted the adjudicator&rsquo;s decision as the final decision.  The whole industry is behind the adjudication provision.  This introduction of arbitration makes the Bill meaningless.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the intention is to provide a speedy resolution, if the matter is going to arbitration we should not scupper the cash flow.  Could we get around this?  Taking up what Senator O&rsquo;Toole has said, perhaps the money could flow and we could shorten the arbitration period if it is going to go beyond adjudication.  The intention in Britain and elsewhere is to provide a speedy resolution in order that the cash can flow.  As this would seem to be hindering that, I must oppose it as it stands unless the Minister of State can propose a way around it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe Senator O&rsquo;Toole has provided two bases for us to pursue this and I will ask the officials to pursue the matter of timelines for arbitration in advance of the Bill coming to the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Others have hit the nail on the head.  The key is that a speedy decision be made.  As it is, the arbitration process is very long-winded and I do not believe anyone wants to see things kicked into arbitration by right.  That would be the wrong way to go.  In common with most people, I would like to see a single process.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole made an important point in saying that mistakes can be made during adjudication.  Mistakes can also be made during arbitration.  Regardless of the process, there is no such thing as perfection.  When the Bill is passed, it will be key to have a process that will provide speedy resolutions for the people for whom the Bill is intended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 9 allows a code of practice to be drawn up by the Minister.  That code of practice can be drawn up as vigorously as possible to reflect the views of the Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>My enthusiasm for adjudication came about when I learned of the British figures.  In 1998 the United Kingdom introduced this form of adjudication.  While my figures may be a few months out of date, more than 20,000 disputes in construction have occurred in the past 12 years with fewer than 400 going to court.  They went to adjudication and the adjudicator&rsquo;s decision was accepted by all but 400 who ended up in court.  That is a speedy resolution which seems to be accepted and which we sought.  The intention would be to follow that same method of resolving disputes.  Fewer than 2% of the 20,000 disputes ending up in court represents a great success.  While that adjudication process did not stop anyone who was unhappy with it going to court and going to an arbitrator later to find some other solution afterwards, it meant they were paid there and then, which resolved the issue.  People very quickly began to see that the adjudicators&rsquo; views seemed to be accepted by the courts because they were seen to have done a competent job.</P>
        <P>The rationale underpinning the arrangements is as follows.  The decision of the adjudicator is not binding if the payment dispute is referred to arbitration or other legal proceedings.  This has only come in very recently and is one that differs from the British system.  The rationale underpinning the arrangements is connected with the position of the State on public sector <Col N="614"/>contracts as the Minister of State said.  For example, if the State were unhappy with the outcome of an adjudication and decided to refer the dispute onwards for resolution in arbitration or in the courts, it would not be a prudent use of Exchequer funds to pay over the adjudication award upfront, given the risk that it might not be possible to recover the amount at a later date should the arbitration or court proceedings find in favour of the State party.  If the State had to pay out on the basis of an adjudicator&rsquo;s decision and was not able to get that money back when it turned out it won the case in court, the taxpayer would be at a loss.  That is why the Department of Finance believes it is imperative this provision be included.</P>
        <P>We would love to find a different way to be able to resolve this.  Having adjudication only would be the solution were it not for that particular problem.  That is why the Department of Finance believes it is necessary to have this provision.  That sounds as though I am sheltering behind the Department of Finance &mdash; perhaps I am.  I believe the adjudication system is a great system that has worked very well in Britain and other countries.  There is a danger that because it is not binding, if the payment dispute is referred to arbitration, it could weaken it.</P>
        <P>I hope the Bill will pass through the Seanad today.  It will have two other stages to complete, one of which is the regulatory impact analysis and the other is to be passed by the D&aacute;il.  The cases Senators have made today will be considered in both those arenas.  In the case of the D&aacute;il it is worth making the case because there may be a better solution than that proposed in this legislation today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In support of the points made by Senator Quinn, I take on board what others said earlier.  The Irish are very litigious by nature and we tend to go right up the line if there is another option.  If arbitration or court proceedings are options, we will go to the limit, but that is an option that runs out.  I am well aware of the figures Senator Quinn just mentioned.  Britain could teach us a lesson on non-judicial determination of matters.  I am vice chairman of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  When that was set up, we were in court every day of the week and people said that insurance claims for road accidents and work related accidents could never be determined without going to court, which would go on for years with a three-year delay before getting into courts and perhaps a seven-year delay overall before it was ever dealt with.  After only three or four years, there is now more than 60% acceptance of the system without proceeding beyond it, and it is improving all the time.</P>
        <P>In a different area, the same applied when the GAA set up the system of appealing against disciplinary decisions.  Every day two years ago the newspapers reported cases going to the highest level of appeal and it was necessary to bring in lawyers to deal with appeals against decisions made by the disciplinary boards.  While it is not the same, it is a determination process that is non-judicial by nature.  Britain has also used this in cases of medical negligence.  We have made a presentation to Government in recent years outlining how the State could save a considerable amount of money by having determination, conciliation or assessment of medical negligence issues without going through the courts, and it will eventually happen.</P>
        <P>The clinching point in support of the issue brought forward by the Department of Finance and Senator Quinn is having a remedy &mdash; in this case the adjudication &mdash; that is done domestically and is seen to be done fairly.  If that goes up the line through a process of arbitration, through the courts or whatever way it happens to go, it almost becomes a <i>sine qua non</i> that the person on the next level up must take into account what the adjudicator did.  The more the process continues, the more that becomes the benchmark of norm for the decision maker of the higher body.  While it takes time to bed in, if it goes to the courts and they see that a reasonable and fair domestic remedy was put in place, they will not be moved by further argument on the same issue.</P><Col N="615"/>
        <P>A bedding-in process will need to take place.  When this comes into play, the first thing that will happen is that the big guys will continue to challenge the decisions through the courts and string it out.  While they will do that at the beginning, they will eventually conclude that it will lead to them incurring legal fees without getting them any further in the end.  In the beginning matters will be somewhat stretched but this is fundamental.  It is revolutionary as a way of doing business and will take a period to bed in but it will do so along the lines outlined by Senator Quinn.  I support it on that basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Quinn and O&rsquo;Toole have made the case on why subsection (12) should not stand as it is.  We should accept adjudication and cash should flow as a consequence pending arbitration.  We should ensure that we do not scupper cash flow to the subcontractor who could be put out of business being a much smaller unit.   As Senator O&rsquo;Toole observed, the big fellows can play hell with this by going to arbitration which will take another two or three years going through the courts, or whatever.  I would not mind that as long as the cash flow is not scuppered and can flow following adjudication.  The points made by both Senators show the way we must go and therefore I oppose the subsection as it stands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Coghlan.  In the Eyre Square case I saw a situation emerge where public money was used to vindicate what I would consider to be an indefensible position.  These matters can drag on.  If we are to allow this to go through as it stands we need to look at ways whereby public money can be best served and how we can cope with such cases without allowing people to vindicate their position by using public funding to justify mistakes made at an earlier stage.  Arbitration processes can be lengthy and can cost the State a great deal of money.  Measures must be brought in to ensure there is a limit to this process.  The key point is to get a speedy resolution,  one which will ensure that the taxpayer does not lose out as a result of a legal process being followed simply because somebody in an official capacity made a mistake.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>The challenge we have is to protect public money.  In the Senator&rsquo;s scenario if the State seeks to appeal or adjudicate a decision that money  will be paid over regardless of the State&rsquo;s right to appeal.  If the State wins that appeal it will be very difficult for it to get its money back.  We will look at mechanisms to avoid this happening and to allow cash to flow as Senator Coghlan suggested &mdash; we have already done so.   The aim was to try to give protection where the State is part of the contract to protect taxpayers&rsquo; money.  The way suggested by the Senator will take away that protection and allow a greater waste of such money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I will repeat the Minister of State&rsquo;s words.  Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s suggestion is worthy of consideration.  Today&rsquo;s business, which we hope is the final Stages of the Bill in the Seanad, also acts in the manner of a Second Stage debate for the D&aacute;il.  I do not like to say that, but considering there might not be a Seanad in a couple of years&rsquo; time perhaps people should get used to this and realise the benefit there is in having a Seanad.  This debate is very useful and will be listened to.  The arguments made, for this case in particular, are worthy of consideration.  There is great benefit in adjudication which offers a speedy solution.</P>
        <P>However, there is a threat to State finances and the Department of Finance has expressed its concern.  Perhaps we can find a solution, perhaps one can be found in the coming months.  If so, then today&rsquo;s work will have served a purpose.  I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment as it stands in the belief that it is being listened to and will receive consideration.  I hope a solution will be found that will satisfy both arguments.</P>

Many were small subcontractors and this has led to great personal difficulties for them, their employees and others associated with the construction industry in the county.  That situation is replicated throughout the country.  There is great urgency attached to the enactment of this Bill.  Obviously, this Seanad is in its dying days but we should send a very strong message to the Lower House that this matter should be treated as a priority.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Since Senator Quinn initiated this Bill a number of very significant high-profile contractors have gone into receivership and liquidation, leaving a trail of woe among many people across the country, many being small business people who did not take risks but <Col N="619"/>did their work, bought the various supplies to be able to undertake their part of the subcontract and were caught, not only for the income to cover their labour content but for the materials which they inputted into those contracts.  That is unjust and not in the interest of the economy or the construction industry.  We should clearly say this.  I compliment Senator Quinn who has pioneered the Bill and done an enormous amount of work on it.  It needs to be driven in the Lower House as a real priority.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a rare occasion on which I agree with Senator Walsh but we agree this time.  I see the Minister of State&rsquo;s advisers smiling but I hate the phrase &ldquo;on such a day as the Minister may so appoint.&rdquo;  I am of the old school and believe an Act should come into operation when it is passed by the Oireachtas and signed by the President.  A Minister should not have any further function in signing off other than indicating that it would start immediately.  I have seen too many pieces of legislation that have not been initiated immediately on their passing.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In the Honohan report there are several pages dealing with a section of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003, which concerns directors&rsquo; compliance statements.  Honohan made the point that although this was a watered down measure, if it had been implemented it might have saved us much hardship.  It was never implemented because the Minister decided not to pursue the point.  I support completely the point made by Senator Walsh and I know that will also be the view of my colleague, Senator Quinn.  The words are before us but there should be an absolute guarantee that as soon as the legislation is signed by the President, it should come into operation.</P>
        <P>The phrase is &ldquo;entered into after such day as the Minister may by order appoint&rdquo;.  Does the ministerial order commence the entire Bill or does it relate to a section?  Will a statutory instrument apply?  What is the process by which the legislation will be applied?  I know my colleague, Senator Quinn, will ask if the Bill will be operational when it is passed.  Those in the world at large believe that when legislation is passed, it becomes law, but we know in here that this is not the case.  Legislation is passed but we must wait for a Minister to fire the starting gun.  We must be absolutely sure that this legislation will come into operation immediately.</P>
        <P>I know Senator Quinn supports this point.  We must consider how to know when the Bill becomes effective.  Will it involve a ministerial order or statutory instrument?  Will it involve a decision announced by the Minister and must it comply with certain regulations?  One of the options is to bring the Houses into the process but what will happen to bring about commencement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Senator is aware, this Bill will now move to the Lower House for debate and I would be happy to propose an amendment there that the Bill would commence on the signature of the President.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Government had been so amenable in the past five years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure Senator Coghlan will support that amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am no good that way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I will comment on the contributions of Senator O&rsquo;Toole and the Minister of State.  I was fully behind the idea raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I have argued since entering the House that we should in passing legislation allow it to take effect immediately.  Three students from Trinity College came to me a few weeks ago and told me they were doing a project on the Construction Contracts Bill.  They raised concerns and gave a very <Col N="620"/>interesting example.  If a developer makes a contract with a major builder on 10 August and the Bill comes into being on 1 September, the Bill would not apply to the major contract but it would be relevant to the subcontractors.  That would suggest that the major contractor could be relieved of any responsibility but those down the line would be affected.</P>
        <P>The solution is to have a date far enough ahead &mdash; perhaps a couple of months is enough &mdash; so that when a developer goes to a major contractor he or she should have the same contract as the subcontractors.  The developer would not have to sign the contract unless he or she was happy.  There should be a little notice before the measures are introduced and I imagine a couple of months would be plenty of time.  The measures should not come into effect on the day we pass the legislation.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments and I believe he will pursue this in the other House.  I also believe the Government will pursue it because it is good legislation if we can get it right.  It is not right yet and there are a number of areas which can be improved.  Today&rsquo;s debate has shown us some of those areas and the Bill can and will be improved.  There is enough commitment in the new Government to the new legislation and it will want good news to introduce in the first 100 days, I hope.  This could be shown as something which has already gone through the Seanad and is ready for implementation if it goes through the D&aacute;il very quickly.  I hope that will happen, although the implementation should take a couple of months, which would be sufficient notice for everybody to be covered, including those at the top, rather than just those underneath.  It is good legislation that should be passed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I will reinforce what Senator Quinn said.  This kind of debate should take place in this House and the Bill was initiated in the Seanad in order to tease out all the points.  I became a listener at the tail end of this discussion and all we must do now is rely on the Minister of State to ensure that this goes to the Lower House as quickly as possible and that the points raised here will be implemented.  I hope I will return to watch the progress we have begun in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a shame that we are teasing out very important legislation but people want to abolish the Seanad.  What better place is there than in here?  We have had a fantastic afternoon discussing various points and I am delighted that Senator Quinn has brought us through this topic, on which we have had many discussions.  I have reflected these views to contractors and subcontractors and they are waiting to see where we will go from here.  I am not giving up on this issue and want to see it come to fruition.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan will be in a major position to take this on board.  It will be his Government that will deal with it and we will rely on the Senator to ensure we get a speedy solution in the Lower House where all contractors will be relieved of their problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I must be elected again first.  I will cover again what has been said.  I am glad to hear the Minister of State indicate that the officials will consider the Bill with a view to taking on board what has been said, with the Bill being improved.  I am sure the Minister of State will also brief his successor with regard to this measure&rsquo;s importance and that it will be suitably dealt with.  I hope it will come before the other House reasonably quickly once the Minister of State has consulted properly with his officials.  They have done the work in taking on board what we have said.  I am sure we will add to the effort by making represen<Col N="621"/>tations.  There is much interest in this Bill and it is very important for so many people throughout the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are still three amendments to be discussed.  Will I put the question on this amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>We have covered the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 11<i>a</i> in the name of Senator O&rsquo;Malley is out of order because it involves a potential charge on the Exchequer.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley may speak on the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment No. 11<i>a</i> not moved.</P>
        <P Just="Center" el="10">SECTION 10</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 be deleted.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the ruling of the Acting Chairman that my amendment would bring about a charge and has been ruled out of order.  This is an opportunity to raise the matter and as the Bill progresses, the issue may be further considered.  I am seeking a security payment to be written into the Bill.  We have gone through the catalogue of companies which have gone to the wall and people are deprived of their livelihood as a result of there doing so, largely because there was no security established.  An earlier draft of the Bill included a security of payment provision which I would like reinstated.  Contracts must be given to companies which can afford to pay their bills.</P>
        <P>Construction is a highly competitive market.  Intel decided to build a new facility in Ireland largely because construction costs have declined by 40%.  This shocking figure indicates the extent to which costs increased while the boom was in full swing.  It is now possible to secure much better value for money, although contractors will argue that they are undercutting one another and the current position is not sustainable.  We need to reach a happy medium in which customers, specifically the State, obtain value for money and companies are able to operate in a sustainable manner.  Establishing a mechanism, effectively a bond, to ensure security of payment will protect subcontractors and suppliers.  I acknowledge, however, that such a bond could result in slight increases in costs.  My amendment proposed to guarantee the full value of the contract.</P>
        <P>With the benefit of hindsight we would definitely have built security into legislation on the construction industry when it started to run away with itself ten years ago.  The model I hope the Department will adopt in this legislation is the Miller Act in the United States.  The US legislation is a perfectly good example of what could be done here and my research indicates it works very well.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  Let us instead examine good legislation in place elsewhere.  The inclusion of a provision on security of payment would enhance the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully understand Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s motivation.  All of us, including, I believe, the Minister of State, share her concerns.  When I introduced the Bill in May 2010 I indicated I wanted certainty in four areas, namely, timing, amount, enforcement and security with regard to cash.  While I accept that certainty has not been achieved in respect of <Col N="622"/>the fourth area, I am aware that the Department is anxious to find a solution.  When we attempted to address the issue by means of bonds a number of difficulties arose.  As Senator O&rsquo;Malley indicated, it is imperative that we find a solution and I will be disappointed if we do not find one in the months before the Bill becomes law.</P>
        <P>Companies about to embark on work must have some proof that cash is available to pay for their work.  There is a danger, however, that it could prove very expensive for smaller contractors to show they have cash available.  Given that they will not easily obtain money from their banks, a provision on bonds could stifle development, jobs and entrepreneurship.  This is a challenge we should be able to overcome and I will be disappointed if a way has not been found to ensure cash is secure before the legislation is enacted.  Such a change will be essential if the legislation is to work.  While a solution has not yet been found, I hope one will be found in the coming weeks or months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I pay tribute to Senator Quinn and the work he has done on the Bill.  I am pleased to have played a small part along the way.  It is crucial to view the passage of the Bill in this House as a recognition of how good work can be done.  I also pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, and appreciate the commitment he has shown in coming to the House.  He could have been doing better things on his final day in office.</P>
        <P>While I do not wish to dwell on the role of the Seanad, I would like people to see this debate as an example of the House working at its best.  The Bill is what I describe as greenfield legislation which is extraordinarily difficult to deal with because it is not consolidated but has been started from scratch.  This means one hits obstacles and fences which are never easy to surmount.  I compliment my colleague, Senator Quinn, on the work he has done to overcome these hurdles.  I will make a small political point by stating that the Seanad is good at dealing with this type of legislation.  I used to advise Ministers to commence greenfield legislation in this House because we would find its weak points.  A debate such as this would not take place in the D&aacute;il because the time provided in the other House would not be sufficient to reach section 12 or 13.  It is important to consider this issue from that perspective.  I do not propose to overstate my case in this regard.</P><Col N="624"/>
        <P>The legislation shows people who are in difficulty that someone is listening to them, even if it is in the Seanad.  I refer especially to small and medium-sized companies which have done their best and are often the last people involved in the construction phase.  They often make a commitment in terms of labour, materials and machinery on which they subsequently incur losses.  We need proper political processes in order that people can find a voice.  Those who have been pushing this legislation should have a voice in this House.  This is what the Seanad is meant to do.  They are lucky to have a voice in Senator Quinn who has expertise and a background in business.</P>
        <P>The legislation is a fine job of work.  I compliment the Department on the support and assistance it provided to Senator Quinn.  Dealing with Independent Senators is always something of a nuisance for Departments because we are an awkward crowd.  It is important that the legislation has progressed and I congratulate Senator Quinn on his achievement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to sound like a broken record player.  I thank Senator Quinn for processing the legislation and allowing those with concerns to have their views reflected in the Bill.  This debate highlights the important role the Seanad plays in taking time to tease out legislation and listen to the views of members of the public.  It would be a shame if the House were no longer able to continue to initiate and scrutinise legislation.  In the dying days of this Seanad I remain committed to reforming the House.  As a reformist, I want the House to continue to deal with legislation.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for facilitating the House this afternoon and wish him good fortune in the Lower House.  If he is appointed Fianna F&aacute;il Party spokesperson on enterprise, trade and innovation, I hope he will ensure the good work the House has done today is soon reflected in an Act.  Subcontractors need to be certain they will be paid when they enter into a contract.  I also thank the Department of Finance for showing patience and providing advice to Senators on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator Quinn on all the work he has put into this Bill, as well as those who assisted him, especially in the Department of Finance.  I regret that Senator O&rsquo;Toole is bowing out because he has made some very pertinent and relevant points, not just in regard to the Bill but also on greenfield legislation and the value of the Seanad.  It is a pity he is retiring from the House because he has huge experience and a lot more to contribute.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, for the interest he has taken in this legislation.  I look forward to him suitably briefing his successor because this important legislation has to go further.  Well done all around.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to repeat everything that has been said but I commend Senator Quinn on his work on this legislation.  I hope it will have a speedy passage through the D&aacute;il as early as possible.  This Bill shows the value of the Seanad as well as the value of having a consensus approach to legislation which is necessary for society.  There was not enough of such legislation going through the Seanad.  I agree with other speakers that the Seanad should be about progressing legislation in a consensual fashion, although we also need to scrutinise much of the minutiae to get it right.  The Seanad should be a consensus model to bring forward Bills speedily in the public interest.  I agree with Senator Ormonde that Seanad reform is the way forward.  It would be a great loss to the people if the Seanad were abolished because it can be used to bring forward legislation in the public interest using a consensual <Col N="625"/>approach.  It takes Independent Senators and those with a particular passion to drive such legislation forward.  I congratulate Senator Quinn on the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Quinn for his work.  I reiterate what Senator Bradford said earlier, that the Oireachtas should be introducing legislation rather than the Government doing so.  We have long passed the stage in western Europe where parties should be fighting over ideological questions, rather than dealing with the empirical stuff that has to be done.  It is there before us and there is a broad consensus involved.  We should be getting down to the necessary words, sentences and paragraphs.  Empiricism is the best way for democracy to move forward with the job that has to be done, rather than ideological posturing.  Today was a good job of work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is estimated that in the past two years 200,000 jobs have been lost in the construction sector and related areas.  A further 100,000 jobs could be at risk in future because of the reduced level of public and private investment.  It is a devastating situation for individuals and families whose lives depend on the construction sector.  The Bill before us is a great tribute to Senator Quinn.  In addition, the legislation will give hope for the future to people in the construction industry, including their representatives in the Visitors Gallery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the tributes that have been paid to Senator Quinn, as well as to Se&aacute;n Gallagher and former Deputy Margaret Conlon who have championed this legislation collectively.  I also thank the officials in my Department who have worked with Senator Quinn in recent months to bring the Bill to its conclusion.  I thank the Clerk of the Seanad and her officials for their co-operation and work.  I acknowledge the contributions of all those who took part in today&rsquo;s debate.  I intend to champion this Bill in a different capacity in the other House.  I will be happy to brief anyone on it, but Senator Coghlan holds the aces in terms of prioritising this legislation for the new Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have to get re-elected first.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be no bother to him.  As I understand that this is the last sitting of the current Seanad, I wish all retiring Senators health and happiness.  In addition, I wish success to those seeking re-election.  I thank the Clerk and her officials for their co-operation in recent years.  I also thank the outgoing Whips for their co-operation on ordering the Business of the House, including legislation.  This Bill is a personal priority for me.  I have an interest in it and I look forward to working with Senator Quinn in pursuing the legislation in the other House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate everyone who has spoken in this debate, as well as those who were involved on the earlier Stages.  This Bill is not perfect but I hope it can and will be improved.  It falls quite far short of the aims, objectives and wishes of those of us who got together last May to work on it.  I thank all who became involved in that endeavour, while knowing that this is only the first step.  We have further to go and a lot more to do.  There is a huge challenge for the construction industry, as Senator Mary White said.</P>
        <P>I endorse what Senator Coghlan said about Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  When I needed help on how to go about this, I turned to Senator O&rsquo;Toole who was very helpful, not just with this Bill but also in the past 18 years during which I have been a Member of the House.  The Bill would not have come about but for Se&aacute;n Gallagher having initiated it.  He is in the Visitors Gallery.  It <Col N="626"/>may not have achieved everything he set out to do, including security of payment, but I hope that will be achieved later.</P>
        <P>I thank both the small and big players in the industry.  As soon as the Bill was announced, they approached me and I was stunned to discover the problems in the construction sector.  For many years, I have worked in a fairly rough and tough business, but it is nothing compared with the stories I heard about in the construction industry.</P>
        <P>In particular, I want to mention Professor Rudi Klein who lives in England but came over to Ireland and has kept in touch with us.  He gave us advice on how the British system works and put us in touch with the Australians, New Zealanders and others.  A lot of work was put into this Bill by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, and their officials.  In addition, the Leader, Senator Cassidy, found time for the House to deal with this legislation.  The Minister of State said this was the last session of the current Seanad, but I hope not.  I think there is a lot of work to do in the next month or two before we break up.</P>
        <P>A lot of work was also undertaken by the Seanad Office, the Bills Office, the Office of the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel which helped the Bill to pass through the House.  It will eventually be a better Bill and if it is amended by the D&aacute;il, it will have to come back to this House.  I look forward to seeing everyone back in the Seanad when the Bill returns to the House.</P>
