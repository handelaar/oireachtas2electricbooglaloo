	<P>I have received notice from Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to ensure St. Sylvester&rsquo;s infant school, Malahide, County Dublin, is provided with a permanent extension to replace the prefabricated buildings where 50% of pupils are currently accommodated, and if he will provide an update on the progress.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I raised the matter of the welfare allowance cuts for the elderly that were announced by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, on Monday.  It seems the communication within Government on that was not the best and I ask the Leader again, if I may, what the Government position is on the cuts in the fuel allowance, the telephone allowance and the electricity allowance for senior citizens.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was interesting to look back through the D&aacute;il record at statements made by of a couple of our colleagues in the other House.  In October 2010, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, now a Minister of State, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">We are living on an island off Europe where it gets cold and it is damp. The [previous] Government is a disgrace.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This was when the Labour Party was calling for increases in the fuel allowance.  She continued: &ldquo;It must begin to give consideration to those for whom it is responsible, the poor and the newly <Col N="572"/>poor.&rdquo;  Deputy Costello, in that same debate when the Labour Party brought a motion before the D&aacute;il in October last year, called for increases in the fuel allowance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many Members have raised the fact that gas and electricity prices have been flagged for further increases.  Although the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste committed themselves to no welfare cuts and no income tax increases, this, to me, is a welfare cut.  The Government cannot call it anything else.  It is a &euro;65 million cut in one year.  Those affected are the senior citizens, the older people of the State.  What is going on here?  What I really would like to ask the Leader is whether he can tell me, in the programme for Government between the Labour Party and Fine Gael, what commitments they gave to senior citizens and the elderly?</P>
        <P>Many commitments given already have been broken and I will not go back to them.  They are a matter of record.  However, it seems interesting that the Minister did not announce these cuts in the House.  Effectively, she announced them to the media.  What is the commitment, what is the impact of the cuts and what is the Labour Party&rsquo;s view on this when it seemed to be exceptionally strong on this only a few months ago where it was calling for increases in those allowances?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesHeffernan"><NameTxt>Senator James Heffernan</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning in this Chamber we gather in the dark shadow of the report into the diocese of Cloyne.  While we are here trying to digest the horrific findings of this damning report, the main protagonist in it, Bishop Magee, is nowhere to be found.  It is high time he faced the music.  I hope the Garda Commissioner will see fit to follow up on Bishop Magee and make him account for his actions or, rather, his inaction.  What he did is nothing short of criminal negligence.</P>
        <P>I know well the effects clerical abuse have had on victims and their families and I want to take this opportunity to praise those survivors and their families for the bravery they have shown in standing up to these vile and evil perpetrators.  It has not been an easy road for them and I hope they will begin to find some sort of closure with the publication of this report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We cannot let this process stop here.  It is still unknown how many other victims there are in the 26 other dioceses.  The most shocking aspect of this report is that it is not dealing with terrible wrongs committed in the distant past.  Instead, it examines the diocese of Cloyne and how it dealt with complaints made from 1996 to early 2009.  The Vatican, with which the ultimate responsibility for the cover ups and the deception lies, should now be made accountable for its actions.  What we need in this House is for a senior church spokesman, such as the papal nuncio, to come here and explain the measures the church is taking to ensure this will never happen again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I am sure Senator Heffernan&rsquo;s leader can take that up at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesHeffernan"><NameTxt>Senator James Heffernan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask the Leader whether he will facilitate this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Heffernan&rsquo;s remarks on the Cloyne report.  As I stated yesterday, we should ask the Leader to set some time aside to reflect on and bear witness to the outcomes of the Cloyne report.  I support my fellow Senator on this disturbing and shocking report.</P>
        <P>Last week in the Seanad, Senator Eamonn Coghlan spoke eloquently and passionately about the role of the Special Olympics and sport in local communities throughout Ireland.  He also accentuated and encouraged a degree of positivity and gave us an insight into how athletes square up to adversity.  Sometimes in the media this positivity is reported as naive and unrealistic.  In my role as chairman of We the Citizens I have been accused of being chirpy, a way of <Col N="573"/>demeaning citizens who have a mixture of idealism, energy and realism.  I run the Abbey Theatre and I am its artistic director.  Running any theatre or arts organisation demands idealism, positivity and a good dose of business acumen and sales.  It requires all of us to think outside the box as well.  This is the definition of the artist&rsquo;s role in Irish society: to innovate, celebrate, criticise, engage and to offer clarity and, sometimes, hope.  Also, they have bitten the hand that feeds them and that is important too.  Discordant voices and disagreement are an essential part of any healthy society as we have seen in this Chamber.</P>
        <P>Artists have played an important part in our communities for thousands of years.  They are looked up to as chroniclers of our times, passing down through the oral tradition the songs, stories and the dinnseanchas of our tribes.  This is where the Irish imagination was born and reared and it has been one of our greatest assets on our journey to nationhood and sovereignty.  Now that our sovereignty has been undermined and our communities are under threat we should turn to our artists and sports heroes for courage, inspiration and clarity.</P>
        <P>The Chamber is full of Senators who have made contributions to their communities in one way or another.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is a great light and supporter of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, an extraordinary organisation which has knitted and brought communities together throughout the country.  Senator John Whelan is a novelist.  Senator David Norris is a scholar and arts supporter.  Senator MacSharry is an award-winning actor with important experience in the amateur movement.</P>
        <P>All Senators know what it is like to participate in an arts event either as a performer or, just as crucially, as an audience member.  Without an audience there is no art and <i>vice versa</i> and without either there is no community and no dialogue.  I note that yesterday, Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan requested that the Leader call on the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, to come to the Seanad to discuss the role of the arts in these tough times.  The arts have a value.  We could discuss their impact on tourism, local business and the reputational value they bring to our nation internationally.  However, we should remember that all the flourishing arts centres and festivals throughout the country started because artists, arts workers and communities sought a dialogue to inform and entertain each other.  For example, let us consider the Galway arts festival this week, the Kilkenny arts festival to be held in early August, Spraoi, which will be held during the August bank holiday weekend in the Leader&rsquo;s and Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s constituency and the Dublin theatre festival which is coming.  Every weekend there is an extraordinary flourishing and emergence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator, have you a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes I do.  I have asked him a question and I will ask him another question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>You are running out of time, Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his forbearance.  Will the Leader encourage the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, to the House in the autumn when we return and will everyone in the House experience an art event between now and then so that we can contribute to the debate about the value of arts and culture in our communities?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">At 1 p.m., Mr. Chopra will address the nation on television about the recovery package.  Will the Leader impress upon the Committee on Procedure and Privileges the need to expedite our request that Mr. Chopra should address the House?  The Parliament has an important role to play in national recovery.</P><Col N="574"/>
        <P>Arising from our most useful debate last Friday on the health service, I call on the Leader to impress upon the Minister for Health that he should not wait five years to introduce the new scheme for health insurance.  The state of the health service is a matter of political concern in the House at almost every sitting and it will delay our national recovery.  I cannot see the reason for waiting five years because the State already knows the number of people who have medical cards and private health insurance.  It is important for the Leader to impress upon the Minister for Health the need to bring forward this reforming scheme far sooner than the five year period envisaged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday in the House we had the Palestinian, Dr. Nabil Shaath.  I recommend a good publication to people in the House which deals with Palestine and Irish politics.  It reflects upon the visit of de Valera to the USA in 1919 and 1920 where he addressed the Indian population.  It was posted throughout the USA as President de Valera&rsquo;s message to India.  In the 1930s, de Valera opposed the partition of Palestine at the League of Nations and opposed Britain&rsquo;s selfish interests there.  In the 1950s, de Valera went with Ben Briscoe to Israel and met Ben Gurion.  However, he went on to Ramallah to criticise the plight of Palestinian refugees who were living in atrocious conditions there.  After Suez, Liam Cosgrave, as Minister for External Affairs, denounced Israel for its influence on that war.  Frank Aitken brought a three-point plan to the UN Assembly in 1958.  After the six-day war in 1967, Ireland protested at the annexation by Israel of the territories of its neighbours.  I raise this because the issue of the recognition of Palestinian statehood will be raised in September at the UN.  It would be a betrayal of everything this country has stood for and of its unflinching support for the Palestinian people if the T&aacute;naiste as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade either abstained or opposed the resolution.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Since we are coming to the last days before the recess it is imperative to have the T&aacute;naiste here.  I hope the initiative taken by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien to place an all-party motion before the Chamber will be endorsed and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will be present to hear that debate and to announce to the House that it is his intention to support that resolution when it comes before the UN in September.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with my colleagues that it is important to examine the Cloyne report.  A few days should pass before we discuss it because it should be discussed in a calm and forensic manner.  I say this because I have spoken on all the previous reports and I never spoke until I had read them in detail and thought about the implications.</P>
        <P>The implications are extremely sad.  I listened on the radio to a man whose daughter was abused.  There were terrible consequences for her.  He remains a Christian which I think must be rather difficult.  There is a good deal of pain there and we must respect the pain that ordinary Catholic citizens and ordinary decent clergy feel.  Unless I am mistaken I believe that Archbishop Diarmuid Martin comes out of this reasonably well.  Perhaps, he did not get the support that he should have.  I suggest we take this matter seriously but only after we have had an opportunity to reflect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I strongly support Senator Mac Conghail and I am delighted that he raised the matter of the arts.  I am flattered that he mentioned me and my small contribution, which is minute in comparison to others, including Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  However, he is absolutely right about <Col N="575"/>the role of artists.  I go back as far as Plato.  Plato banned poets from the new Republic because poets were liars and artists were unreliable.  That is part of their wonderful value.</P>
        <P>I think back on two men I am proud to have known as friends and teachers, the late Sean O&rsquo;Faolain and the late Frank O&rsquo;Connor.  Both were deeply involved in the Republican movement that gave us this independent State.  However, the minute they had it, they turned into some of its sternest critics and exposed the hypocrisy involved.  Once a State is established one begins to get institutions and those institutions must not be immune from criticism.  I agree with Shelley that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of mankind.  Often, the artistic voice has prophetic knowledge and insight.  At least after the Celtic tiger there are 70 theatres throughout the country which is wonderful.  We should bear in mind the Trondheim report that came out some weeks ago which demonstrates clearly that involvement in the arts at local level by ordinary citizens has a significant impact on mental well-being.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for this House to have a debate on the Cloyne report and its implications.  I agree with Senator Norris that such a debate should be conducted in a calm and forensic way.  He is absolutely correct in this regard.  Many issues are at play because this report brings one up to 2009, which constitutes a shocking indictment of the Catholic Church.  Given what has gone before and all the previous reports from which lessons should have been learned, it appears that those lessons were not learned by all within the Catholic Church.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s proposed meeting with the papal nuncio, which is extremely important and from which it is to be hoped there will be a positive outcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also wish to place this issue in an all-Ireland context because on issues as important as the protection of children, Members must ensure there is all-Ireland joined-up thinking and harmonisation.  I note there is no register for sex offenders across the island of Ireland and there are variances between policies on child protection between North and South.  This is an area in which, through this House or another forum, there may be scope for all-Ireland co-ordination to ensure that children are protected across the island of Ireland because victims of clerical abuse were living both in this State and in the North.</P>
        <P>I revert briefly to an issue that was raised yesterday and support the call by Senator Barrett for Mr. Chopra to be invited to appear before this House.  However, there has been some discussion on the ratings agencies and while I have no gr&aacute; for such agencies and agree with much of what was said about them, the underlying factors that brought them to downgrade our debt to junk status are real and one cannot dismiss those factors.  In response to questions from Deputy Pearse Doherty in the D&aacute;il yesterday, the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude on this point as I have a question for the Leader.  The Minister for Finance conceded that the total profit that will be made by the European Central Bank and the IMF will be &euro;14 billion.  This illustrates the extent of the problem with which we must now grapple and the cuts for this year alone may exceed the original forecast of &euro;4 billion.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien spoke of the potential impact of some of those cuts on older people and so on and, consequently, there is a need for a debate in this House on the bailout, the potential need for a second bailout and whether the country is on the right road.  I made this point a number of weeks ago and it is vital that Members are seen to be scrutinising what is happening.  It will be important to avoid ending up facing an even bigger financial crisis than the current one in four or five years&rsquo; time and for Members not to have been perceived as scrutinising and probing properly the decisions that are being made.  I ask that the Minister for Finance appear in the House at some stage to discuss those important issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join those colleagues who have suggested that at the opportune time, one hopes before the summer recess, Members should reflect by way of a debate on the Cloyne report.  I did not hear the full contribution made by Senator Norris but he indicated Members should read the report in full before commenting in any great detail and I agree with him in that regard.  I speak as a member of the diocese of Cloyne and, obviously, what I have read in the past day or so has been extremely traumatic.  Some of the news is of no great surprise, but when one sees it in print and the conclusions made, it is a source of deep trauma, disappointment and regret.  As I stated, I do not intend to discuss the report in any great detail this morning, but a message of deep sympathy and empathy must go out from this House to all the victims.  It is fair to state a similar message must also go to all the genuine, hard-working and entirely innocent priests and clergy of the people, both in the diocese of Cloyne and nationwide, because they, too, share in the trauma, bitterness and upset.  One cannot repair the horrors of history but one must attempt to move forward.  I look forward to a broad and wide-ranging debate in the House at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, I also heard mention of the position regarding Palestine, Israel and the Middle East, to which reference was also made in this Chamber on Tuesday when a request was made for a debate on the general position in the Middle East.  I look forward to that debate, in which balance will be required.  In the past decade or so, Members have considered the position in the Middle East from one perspective only.  They also must recognise there is a country, state and democracy, indeed the only democracy in the Middle East, called Israel, which consists of a people against whom an attempt was made within the past 50 or 60 years to wipe them off the map.  This must also be reflected on and recollected and Members must have such a balanced debate on the Middle East.  I fully support the right of the Palestinian people to have a state, to be protected and to be defended, but I also wish to put on record my strong support for the recognition and defence of the state of Israel.  I refer to a people who faced the gas chambers.  That is their history and that should not be forgotten by Members, who also should try to empathise with and understand their perspective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I draw Members&rsquo; attention to the fact that as they were going to bed last night, a very important competition in New York was drawing to a conclusion, namely, the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2011.  Each year, Microsoft invites students from all over the world to come up with ideas under a range of headings, including software design, to solve the world&rsquo;s problems.  I am delighted to announce to those Members who are not already aware that Institute of Technology Sligo won the top prize in that competition for the design of software that will help to prevent road accidents.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>In a week in which Members also celebrated the prowess of Trinity College in being among the top 100 universities in the world, is it not fantastic that an Irish institute of technology and its students competed with 350,000 other student entries from 183 countries and not only qualified for the finals but won that event?  I am sure the Leader will permit me to take this opportunity to send good wishes and congratulations to Institute of Technology Sligo and Team HERMES, as it was called, for their extraordinary achievement today.  Following on from this, I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on the issue of entrepreneurship education.  He may recall my previously expressed interest in the potential introduction of entrepreneurship education modules from primary school right through second, third and fourth levels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While it took many years, as an amateur actor I always dreamt that my talent would be discovered by the director of the Abbey Theatre and, consequently, I feel as though I finally have arrived.</P>

	<P>Listening to Senators Mac Conghail and Norris this morning, I felt like a return to Tintern Abbey and Wordsworth country.  Then again, we have Muckross Abbey in my part of the world and so perhaps I am not obliged to go that far to enjoy that sort of beautiful landscape, solitude and all that goes with it.  However, I support Senator Mac Conghail&rsquo;s call to the Leader to have the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, appear in the House in the autumn session.  He is a man who has a great feel for his Department and everything under its aegis.  The Minister, Deputy Deenihan, who comes from the literary capital of the Kingdom, is a very fitting choice for that.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator Heffernan also spoke about the victims.  Forty victims gave evidence to the inquiry.  I refer to a report from the <i>Journal of Interpersonal Violence </i>which carried out a substantial study of child abusers who are not incarcerated.  The study interviewed many abusers who had not been found by the authorities, who came forward under a confidentiality agreement.  It found that there are 150 victims for every child abuser.  This can be multiplied by the Cloyne cases and by the cases in other dioceses and it means tens of thousands of victims, of people who are suffering, according to this report.  We discussed this issue in the House a few weeks ago.  The Catholic Church is not even helping its own structures to carry out an audit on the number of reports of priests who had allegations made against them.  The church does not even have that much respect for the victims that it would assist in trying to calculate the number of people needing to be helped.  The saddest statistic of all is that only one person has been prosecuted in Cloyne.  There are no consequences for these priests who abuse and they, of course, have an effect on the church itself.  The sad aspect is that within the church many people knew what was happening and failed to act.  The new legislation proposes that any person who knows anything about what has happened in the past should come forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened with interest to the various contributions.  I echo the request by Senator Mac Conghail yesterday for a debate on the Cloyne report at the earliest opportunity.  I will reserve my remarks for that debate.  Others speakers have said it is important to approach that debate as people who have briefed ourselves fully, first, by reading the report.  As all of us come from different parts of the country, I suggest we take the opportunity, in the public interest, to get in touch with people involved in local church leadership to find out exactly what is happening now.  I speak as someone who had a position as an employee of the Catholic Church from shortly after the framework document came into force.  There was a public expectation and a public acceptance that the church, throughout its various dioceses and religious orders, was now implementing good practice.  What is really tubaisteach, to borrow the Irish word, and what makes people really feel betrayed, is the fact that church leaders, who had been party to the public proclamation of the introduction of good practice, then slid back from it without anybody knowing.  Today is a day of great release &mdash; I do not like the word, &ldquo;closure&rdquo; and I do not believe in using it &mdash; for the most important people, those who were <Col N="580"/>victimised.  We should be careful to do justice, by researching properly, to the many church leaders, clergy and thousands of ordinary lay people around the country who are doing Trojan work implementing best practice in child protection.  I know many of these people and I know the countless hours people are spending on a voluntary basis trying to get this issue right.</P>

	<P>We will not in any way detract from our solidarity with victims of abuse and from our annoyance with church inaction and bad practice in the past, by also making space for a greater realisation of the many good changes that have come in since such as the Vatican&rsquo;s position as expressed recently to the various dioceses in the world&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>When we talk about victims sometimes we forget that they are real people.  Today we are reminded by these fantastic four young people who won the Imagine Cup yesterday in the United States.  They are &Aacute;ine Conaghan, James McNamara, Calum Cawley and Matthew Padden.  They are the future of our country and these are the people on whom we rely and whom we hope will build the future for us.  We must do everything to protect our children.  When we talk about victims we forget and we group them all together.  They are our neighbours and our friends, our sisters and our brothers.  They are these young people, effectively.  Somewhere in Ireland there are children who had potential like them and now cannot realise it because of what happened to them.</P>
        <P>I echo the comments made here and outside the House on the findings of the Cloyne report.  I, too, would welcome the opportunity to have a debate on it because we need always to look forward and be reminded that these are the people we need, that the young people of Ireland are our future.</P>
        <P>I extend my congratulations to the four young people involved in the project I mentioned.  They show what can happen when one can realise one&rsquo;s potential, when one has the opportunity to do so and when people have faith in one.  They came together from four different counties, disciplines and classes to put together an idea that could win more than a cup.  It could win something for the future of Ireland in terms of how we will build our technology, innovation and research.</P>
        <P>I have raised this point before in the House.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, to come to the House.  When I visited the institute of technology recently, I discovered there are grave difficulties in its enterprise unit in terms of small companies trying to get the funding, space and help they need to expand and build on their plans.  While we ought to celebrate the four young people today, we have to realise that unless we give real support, not just in terms of money but with creative, intelligent responses in our ITs and universities, this will just be a flash in the pan.  There is no doubt that their idea to make drivers safer on the roads will succeed; they have shown it already.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister of State to come into the House to consider whether there are ways in which we can creatively contribute to better <Col N="581"/>ideas locally for supporting ITs to aid the kind of ideas that young people have demonstrated.  They are the future of this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse all the calls for a debate on the publication of the Cloyne report.  I support the calls for it to be held after a suitable period of reflection and reading because it is important, as people have said, that if people are to contribute to the report, they would do so.  We primarily think of the victims, living and deceased.  It is important to remember some are deceased because of the abuse they suffered.</P>
        <P>It is important that in the future the church complies with the law.  We should introduce laws that are suitable for the protection of children.  For members of the church, including myself, it is important that it listens to the voices in the wilderness in the church such as Fr. Doyle who was on television yesterday.  He is a canon lawyer in the US who has consistently argued within the church on this issue.  Fr. Mernagh, the walking priest, spoke very prophetically on the radio today and should be listened to by all sections of society, especially the church.</P>
        <P>Welfare cuts were announced this week.  It was a good day to bury bad news for the Minister, Deputy Burton.  In light of the Cloyne report, we should not have a debate on that issue today.  However, the Minister should be brought before the House next week to discuss the matter.  A firm commitment given on social welfare rates but we are now told it does not apply to household benefits or the smokeless fuel allowance.  I will urge my party and our spokesperson on social welfare, Senator Mooney and the leader, Senator O&rsquo;Brien, to call for a full debate on this issue next week.  The Minister, like other Ministers, has a tendency to blame the IMF for these decisions.  I understand it had no such requirement and that would be confirmed if anyone was to question its representatives at the press conference today.  We need a full debate on why and how this happened.</P>
        <P>It is the first time ever that budget cuts were announced in June, six months before a budget, and it is the first time people have been targeted.  People who benefit from household benefits are not of working age and cannot get a job or re-skill themselves.  They are elderly people over 65 years of age and those in receipt of disability allowance.  The cuts are not across the board, for which we were vilified.  Particular individuals have been targeted as an easy touch and it is most reprehensible.  It is very important that we have a full debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>I urge members of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party to come to this House to give us an account of its meeting on hospitals.  We are all trying to find out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;how it is distributing the spoils and which Deputies will be successful in keeping hospitals open in the future.  Thank God it used to be us and we never heard anything from the Opposition.  It is very important to do that.</P>

        <P>I had tabled matters on the Adjournment which the Cathaoirleach correctly ruled out of order on two separate occasions.  I accept his ruling.  I thank the Leader for his interventions following the seven wonders of nature competition involving the Cliffs of Moher which I raised on the Order of Business on a couple of occasions.  In fairness to the Leader, he brought it to the attention of the Minister and it is to be hoped we will see some Government-led action to ensure the Cliffs of Moher can win the competition on behalf of Ireland.</P><Col N="582"/>
        <P>I am saddened that there is an industrial relations dispute at the Cliffs of Moher which started today.  Unfortunately, there is a picket outside the cliffs.  There was a scheduled press conference by Giovanni Trapattoni, the manager of the Irish soccer team, scheduled for the area tomorrow, but unfortunately it will not now go ahead.  The media opportunity nationally and internationally for the seven wonders of nature competition will not be forthcoming.</P>
        <P>I call on all parties involved in the dispute to re-enter negotiations and go before the Labour Court to resolve the issue.  The competition is not just important for the Cliffs of Moher; it is important for Ireland.  If Ireland can have one of the seven wonders of nature, it will be phenomenal for tourism.  I call on the Leader to speak to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to put pressure on Clare County Council to re-enter the Labour Court and determine whether the dispute can be resolved as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate before the recess on the Cloyne report.  It is very important that we have a full, measured and reasoned debate based on facts.  The report was commissioned during the Fianna F&aacute;il Administration which shows that we were open to it.  The victims are suffering with the release of the report but at least there is some closure, as they said this morning.</P>
        <P>The bishop concerned was involved in a major cover-up in 1978 in the Vatican when Pope John Paul I died tragically and, possibly, under very strange circumstances.  There was a major cover-up at the time.  He was then made Bishop of Cloyne.</P>

	<P>Okay.  The point I am making is that the fundamentals of the church are still right and people should not use the report to get at the church.  The Sermon on the Mount is a fundamental principle of the church and has not changed.  I am not making light of the situation.</P><Col N="583"/>

	<P>I express my shock at some of the remarks made about the latest Cloyne report, that we should not speak about it in the House and that we should delay a debate on it in order to have time to read it.  As the House will be sitting next Tuesday afternoon, I do not see why we cannot debate it then.  This is an urgent national issue.  Child abuse is a most cruel act that also affects the victims&rsquo; parents, families and friends.  People&rsquo;s lives are destroyed by it.  The Catholic Church cannot be above the law and must be responsible to the State.  We have let off bankers and are now letting off church people.  They must stand before the law and be treated accordingly.  As has been said many times in this Chamber, these matters will not be resolved until the people see wrongdoers behind bars for the financial trauma endured by our little country and until the Catholic Church is made accountable and people are sent to prison for what they have done to children.  They must increasingly be seen to be brought in shackled.  I was quite shocked when I heard it said this morning that we should wait a while before having a discussion on the report.  Have we become so anaesthetised to what was eloquently presented to us, with empathy, by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, and our former colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who is an outstanding Minister?  We need an urgent debate on the report with one of the two Ministers in attendance.  We are a shame to the world.  I cannot resist <Col N="584"/>saying the Catholic Church is male-dominated.  How many young men were sent away to become brothers or priests before their sexuality developed?  I know sexual abuse is not confined to religious orders, but we must examine the issue.  They were sent away at 12 or 13 years of age. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>I am quite shocked that humour was brought into the discussion and also that it was suggested we should postpone a debate on the report.  Everybody can read it tonight, as we all have received a copy, or have we become so anaesthetised?  We have received four reports; are we no longer shocked by them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator supporting the call for a debate?</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support the call for an urgent debate on the Cloyne report next Tuesday.  It is an urgent matter that affects many vulnerable individuals in society.  We should hold such a debate next week to show the true value and potential of this House in discussing important matters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support Senator Thomas Byrne&rsquo;s call for an urgent debate on the social welfare cuts to be introduced by the Labour Party Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.  It is outrageous that the most vulnerable in society will have to face such cuts at a difficult economic time for them.  It is disingenuous for any Government representative to say the cuts are being imposed as a result of the conditions attached to the EU-IMF bailout.  As we all know, with no assistance from the Government, the Fianna F&aacute;il grouping, including Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and Thomas Byrne, met the troika officials this week.  They made it abundantly clear that no straitjacket was being imposed on policy issues or financial decisions, that it was solely a matter for the Government to decide.  It is, therefore, disingenuous for the Government or the Minister to say the conditions attached to the EU-IMF bailout are setting the parameters.  It is a political decision by the Labour Party and Fine Gael to cut social welfare jpayments; therefore, they should not try to blame others outside the country for such decisions.</P>
        <P>We should have a debate on the overall social welfare budget to see how the most vulnerable can be protected.  What steps are the Labour Party and the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, taking to protect them?  If those on low incomes are to be affected by social welfare reductions, is that not an indication that the most vulnerable will not be protected?  In a few weeks the House will rise for the summer recess, but I hope a debate can be facilitated on the overall social welfare budget before then.</P>

	<P>The Government has set a course to introduce legislation to make it a criminal offence to withhold information on child abuse.  Such legislation is long overdue.  We had an excellent debate on the Murphy report and it would be worthwhile looking back on the contributions of Members and former Members to that debate.  The protection of children should be paramount in any Government&rsquo;s mind.  Our thoughts must be with and our support provided for the survivors of child abuse, as well as for those victims who have passed on.  We should be thinking of them today after the publication of such a report.  We must also think of the good priests who are working in every community who feel humiliated by the actions of their evil colleagues, not only in Cloyne but also in many other dioceses.  I will try to facilitate a debate on the report next week or the following week.  We will request either the Minister for Justice and Equality or the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to attend the House, although I know a lot of their time will be taken up in preparing legislation to deal with these matters.  However, I am sure that if their diaries permit it, we will have them here to discuss this dreadful situation  as outlined in the report published yesterday.</P>
        <P>I agree totally with Senator Fiach Mac Conghail on idealism and positivity within the arts.  I am a former chairman of the Garter Lane Arts Centre in Waterford, as well as the city&rsquo;s light opera festival committee.  As I said yesterday, a debate on the arts and culture will be organised early in the autumn.  I am sure the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, will be delighted to attend the House for an exchange of views on the arts.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett asked that Mr. Chopra would be invited to address the House.  We will add him to the long list of people who are requested to come to the House and it will be discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I agree with the Senator that if at all possible, universal health insurance should be introduced sooner than the Minister envisages.  I will certainly pass on the Senator&rsquo;s comments to the Minister, on which I am sure he shares the Senator&rsquo;s concerns.  I am also sure the Minister would like to have the universal health insurance in place sooner than envisaged.  We dealt with the issue of Palestinian statehood yesterday.  We will certainly bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and will endeavour at a later stage to invite the Minister to the House to debate the Middle East situation.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane spoke about the Cloyne report and the cuts in social welfare, which I have addressed.  Senator Bradford also wants a debate on the Middle East and I have commented on the Cloyne report.  Senators MacSharry and O&rsquo;Keeffe referred to the wonderful achievements of students attending Sligo IT.  They called for the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, to come to the House to debate support for institutes of technology and Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s request to deal with entrepreneurships in primary schools and beyond.  I will certainly try to get the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, to the House.  I am not sure if he has been here yet.  It is an item on which we hope to get him to come here.</P>
        <P>Senator Paul Coghlan brought to our attention the plight of Killarney House, as he has done on several occasions in the House.  Senator Healy Eames spoke about the discrepancy in the numbers of PPS numbers and the population, which is a frightening situation.  She was asked to raise the matter on the Adjournment and I suggest she should do so.  Senator Conway spoke about the seven wonders of nature competition involving the Cliffs of Moher and the importance of the project for tourism, not only in Clare but throughout the country.  He also spoke <Col N="586"/>about a labour relations problem and I am glad the matter has made progress since he last raised it and I hope he will have further success on the matter.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to comment on Senator D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s comments on the name change for Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>

    <Title>A Vision for Change: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to make a statement to the House on A Vision for Change.  While I will read the official speech as there are details contained in it which the House needs to know, I hope the debate which will ensue will be more free-flowing.</P>
        <P>In 2006, A Vision for Change was widely welcomed as a progressive, evidence based and realistic document which proposed a new model of service delivery which would be patient centred, flexible and community based.  Although progress on implementation has been slower than expected, it is important to recognise and acknowledge that in many parts of the country, services are pressing ahead with developing new ways of working and initiatives to implement A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P>Progress on implementation to date includes the following: a 17% decline in the number of patients resident in Irish psychiatric facilities since 2006; fewer admissions, including involuntary admissions to approved centres; the number of patients readmitted to hospital has shown a year-on-year reduction since 2001, and this reduction points to an improvement in community based services; the length of stay in approved centres has reduced, so that in 2010, 48% of patients were discharged within two weeks of admission; the child and adolescent mental health service has seen a very significant improvement, with 61 mental health teams now in place around the country; bed capacity for children and adolescents has increased from 12 beds in 2007 to 52, with further developments planned which will bring capacity to 66 by 2012; and the increase in bed capacity is reflected in a 37% decrease in admissions of children to adult units since 2008.</P>
        <P>Despite the slowdown in the economy, work on the capital programme is continuing.  Work on the Linn Dara child and adolescent mental health day facility in Cherry Orchard, Dublin is close to completion, acute admissions to St. Brendan&rsquo;s, Grangegorman have ceased and enabling works are under way on the development of a 54-bed replacement long-stay facility as part of the Grangegorman redevelopment project.  In addition, an application for planning permission has been submitted for an acute inpatient psychiatric unit at Beaumont Hospital to replace the unit at St. Ita&rsquo;s, Portrane.  The closure of the long-stay accommodation at St. Senan&rsquo;s, Wexford, will be completed during 2011-12, with the implementation of an approximately <Col N="587"/>&euro;16 million capital investment programme.  A residential unit is under construction in Clonmel which will allow for the closure of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and community services are being developed which will provide alternatives to inpatient admissions.  A community nursing unit has opened in Ballinasloe and the long stay patients have been transferred there from St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
        <P>The active involvement of service users is one of the most significant reforms that have taken place in our mental health services in recent years.  The establishment of the National Service Users Executive is one of the major success stories of A Vision for Change and service users are now actively engaged in the planning and development of services.  Service users have a unique insight into the experience of mental illness and have a greater understanding of mental health and service needs and, therefore, have much to contribute.  NSUE&rsquo;s 2010 second opinion report, &ldquo;Always Look on the Bright side of Life&rdquo;, was published in January and the findings of the report provide real evidence that our services are improving and, importantly, that the recovery ethos underpins that service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recognition of improved services, NSUE awards were made to three services: Loughrea-Athenry community health services for best community mental health team; to Tara Suite mental health day centre, Dunshaughlin, for best day hospital-day centre; and to west Cork mental health services for most improved service.  The results of the survey of service users show that services are improving in some areas and while there is scope for improvement, services are moving in the right direction.</P>
        <P>The remit of the Office for Disability and Mental Health, established within the Department of Health in January 2008, includes bringing a new impetus to the implementation of A Vision for Change and to work in partnership with the HSE and other stakeholders, including other Departments, to drive implementation.  The director of the office is a member of the senior officials group on social inclusion, which monitors progress on the Government&rsquo;s commitments on social policy.  The Office for Disability and Mental Health is also participating in the development by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government of a housing strategy for people with disabilities which will have a particular emphasis on the housing needs of people with mental health difficulties.</P>
        <P>Within the HSE, the assistant national director with responsibility for mental health ensures the delivery of mental health services in line with legislation and Government policy.  Executive clinical directors have also been appointed to lead reform in catchment areas serving populations of 350,000 to 400,000, which is in line with the recommendations in A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P>Implementing A Vision for Change will involve using our existing resources more efficiently and effectively.  It will require the reallocation and remodelling of existing resources to move away from care in institutions to providing care in alternative settings or in the individual&rsquo;s home.  The focal point of modern mental health services should be within a community setting and thus the further development of community based facilities is the priority.  Almost 90% of mental health needs are dealt with at primary care level and this Government is committed to developing closer links between mental health services and primary care, which is a key recommendation in A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P>Centres which house primary care and mental health professionals will provide the full range of care for individuals and will represent a significant step forward for service users and their families.  Having community mental health teams collocated with primary care teams will also help to build and cement closer relationships which will benefit service users and their families, carers and professionals alike.</P>
        <P>Budget 2011 gave special consideration to the mental health sector through a reduction of 1.8% in the allocation of funding for this sector.  An additional &euro;1 million in 2011 was approved <Col N="588"/>for the HSE&rsquo;s national office for suicide prevention.  This funding will enable the office to build on initiatives to date and bring added momentum and new impetus to its activities to address the increasing incidence of deaths by suicide.</P>
        <P>We must change our attitudes and our thinking about mental health; we need to create an environment that recognises and treats people with mental health problems similarly to other health needs.  We must put out the message that it is okay not to be okay.  It is only by openly speaking about mental health that we will change attitudes and normalise mental illness.  In light of this, as part of See Change, the national stigma reduction campaign, I was pleased to launch the Make a Ripple campaign, which aims to recruit a dedicated online community of ambassadors, advocates, story tellers and volunteers who can help to push the campaign&rsquo;s objectives and messages on to the national agenda.  I hope this campaign will contribute to eliminating the stigma so often associated with mental illness.</P>
        <P>Looking to the future, I assure the House that my priority as Minister for State with responsibility for mental health will be to further advance the implementation of A Vision for Change.  I am aware that annual reports of the independent monitoring group for A Vision for Change have highlighted concerns with the absence of a detailed, timelined and costed implementation plan and with the lack of effective leadership within the HSE to implement its recommendations.  I have therefore asked the HSE to prepare an implementation plan which will identify specific recommendations of A Vision for Change to be progressed over the next three years, with timelines, detailed costs and persons responsible for implementation.</P>
        <P>I am also in discussions with my officials with a view to establishing a directorate within the HSE to drive implementation and I hope to be in a position to make a decision on this over the coming months.  I assure the House that this Government is committed to reforming our mental health care services and the implementation of A Vision for Change.  This commitment was clearly shown in the programme for Government which provides that &euro;35 million will be ring-fenced annually in future budgets to develop community mental health care services and to ensure early access to more appropriate services for adults and children.</P>
        <P>I look forward to listening to the contributions from Senators.  While we have A Vision for Change as a template, there are times when we need flexibility in service delivery.  As I read more about this area, I realise how little we know about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and this opportunity to make a few brief points on this important issue.  I look forward to hearing from the professionals in the House who have experience of this issue.</P>
        <P>A Vision for Change was embraced by the previous Government as policy and we all want to see it followed.  I pay tribute to the former Minister of State, Mr. John Maloney, who in a difficult time did a good job in beginning the processes that set out his ambitions.</P>
        <P>Much good work has been done.  The Minister of State highlighted a number of new facilities and additional places that have come on-stream.  I also welcome the way we are moving away from the old model of daunting buildings that seemed more like something from a horror film rather than a place to care for those with an illness.</P>
        <P>The changed focus to a community-based model is welcome, with mental health conditions viewed now as illnesses and the realisation that it is okay not to be okay.  The See Change initiative will help to ensure people are accepted if they are depressed or suffering from mental health problems.  I recall the advertisements on television and feel they were helpful to those who had difficulties.  A close friend suffered from a panic disorder that led to hyperventilation, <Col N="589"/>a condition that affects one in three people.  Inevitably people would ask him why he was panicking or depressed.  It was like asking what the winning lottery numbers would be.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">It is incredible that people would ask those questions of people who are unfortunate enough to have this condition, which is extremely common.  It is an issue of informing and educating people and through schemes like See Change we can begin to tackle it.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>In regard to the Reach Out scheme, in terms of suicide prevention, while an additional &euro;1 million was made available to it, no amount of money is too great to allocate to addressing this issue in any given year.  If there are suicide prevention initiatives that cannot be afforded, I believe any of us in this House would gladly pay more in tax or otherwise, if the money accruing therefrom was ring-fenced specifically for that area.  No mountain is too high in tackling that issue.  When we consider the number of people who die from suicide every year versus our reaction to dealing with high the incidence of road deaths and the great progress that has been made in reducing the number of road deaths, we should, even in these desperate financial and economic times, ensure that we make whatever resources are required available and ring-fence them specifically for that area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a huge concern about resources.  I know the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to the job at hand and that if resources were not an issue, she would have the recommendations in A Vision for Change implemented in a very short period.  I do not doubt her commitment and I am not being remotely political about this as we all know where we are, why we are there and so on, but the resourcing of the implementation of A Vision for Change overall will be an issue.  In the most recent report the implementation body acknowledged and welcomed that funds from the sale of former facilities will be of assistance in implementing A Vision for Change.  From my involvement in the auctioneering business, I know that no sale of any property is taking place.  There will not be any money from that source unless from a State institution or a body of some other description that was purchasing these lands.  There is no speculative development for former hospitals or this kind of initiative.  To claim that resourcing will come from the sale of such facilities concerns me as to the timeframe involved.  If we had 20 years, I do not believe we could sell property and get a level of support and resourcing that is needed for the implementation of the ambitions laid out in A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P>In addition, the moratorium on staff recruitment in the HSE is very worrying, particularly with 1,000 psychiatric nurses having retired between 2009 and 2010.  I am told that another 1,000 may be eligible to retire in the next year or so.  That is very worrying.   I am sure the Minister of State and the Minister would like to assist in this respect but it will be a question of whether the Minister for Finance will allow it.  Is the Minister of State in a position to commit to the preservation of funding attached to any of the mental health posts in which staff may retire in the year ahead to ensure such funding remains in place?  That would be extremely important.</P>
        <P>The big question is one of resourcing.  I am not convinced that A Vision for Change can be implemented with the resourcing available to us.  If the Minister of State agrees with that, what are our alternatives?  There will have to be a longer timeframe for the overall implementation of it.  I have a concern about its resourcing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to raise a final point, on which I am aware Senator Colm Burke agrees, which perhaps I should have raised on the Order of Business.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children is currently meeting.  As is the case with our health services generally where general management and good co-ordination is needed, that is also needed in the management of business of these Houses.  The Child Care (Amendment) Bill is being debated in the D&aacute;il, a debate on mental health services is taking place here and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on <Col N="590"/>Health and Children is meeting in a committee room downstairs.  I am sure there are members of that committee here and that Deputies attending that meeting who would like to be present for the debate in the D&aacute;il.  We should manage our business a little better.</P>
        <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to make these points and I would appreciate a reply from the Minister of State on them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am pleased that we have this opportunity to discuss this report and the wider issue of mental health services provision here.  It is said that a society is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members.  This must be the guiding principle of our society and the Government.  This must be held most true when it comes to how we care for people suffering with mental health issues.</P>
        <P>The original A Vision for Change document summarised the vision for mental health services in Ireland as follows: &ldquo;Service providers should work in partnership with service users and their families, and facilitate recovery and reintegration through the provision of accessible, comprehensive and community-based mental health services.&rdquo;  It also contained the following aspiration: &ldquo;Each citizen should have access to local, specialised and comprehensive mental health service provision that is of the highest standard.&rdquo;  These are most laudable and worthy goals, which we must realise for we have a special duty to those who require these services, a duty we must live up to.</P>
        <P>This is the fifth annual report and its conclusions contain a mixture of welcome news and worrying updates.  The openings of new adult child and adolescent mental health care facilities in Dublin, Cork and Galway must be welcomed as signs of real progress. Similarly, the closure and imminent closure of outdated facilities and services in Wexford, Dublin, Tipperary, Galway and Donegal as well as the partial closure of similar services in Kerry, Carlow and Kilkenny are further signs of the change in mental health treatment in this country with the move to more appropriate community-based services.  Many of these services and facilities belonged to a past era and were wholly out of place in a modern, community-based, patient-focused mental health service.</P>
        <P>While some of these developments were part of A Vision for Change, the impetus for some of them were caused by the conditions set by the Mental Health Commission, MHC, and for this reason it should be commended.</P>
        <P>On the issue of financing, the previous Government must be credited with granting the metal health services with derogation from the budget cuts last year when it only reduced funding by 1.8%.   A further issue on the financing of A Vision for Change is that, unfortunately, in a manner similar to the fair deal, it was to be based on property bubble expectations.  A considerable proportion of the funding for reform and new developments and facilities was expected to come from the sale of land and buildings.  While this may have appeared to be a sensible idea at the time, the collapse of the property market has disappointingly resulted in the projected amount of money not being realised.  This is a very serious issue regarding the implementation of A Vision for Change and I ask the Minister of State to outline what provision is being made to ensure that the recommendations for the implementation of the original A Vision for Change will be properly financed.</P>
        <P>I would also like to raise the recommendations this report makes on the structure of mental health services administration in this country.  It repeats the assertion made in previous progress reports that there is an urgent need to establish a full directorate of mental health care services within the HSE, to which the Minister of State referred.  Is there is a timescale for the formation of this structure?  The absence of a directorate has led to the current state of affairs within the <Col N="591"/>HSE <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> mental health services whereby there is no person or body with direct, sole responsibility for the implementation of the targets set out in A Vision for Change.The was covered in the Minister of State&rsquo;s script but it is important that the directorate would be set up at an early date.  I hope that the directorate which will be established soon will be given the full range of powers and responsibilities recommended in this report.  These are that it must have authority in the reconfiguration of existing services and the development of new mental health services in accordance with A Vision for Change, and it must have control of existing and new mental health care resources.</P>
        <P>A further report with reference to the structural issues is the committee&rsquo;s recommendation that a specific mental health component be included in the special delivery unitestablished by the Minister for Health in the Department.  Is it the Minister of State&rsquo;s intention to implement that recommendation?</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with some points in the report that are a cause of some concern.  My colleague, Senator MacSharry, referred to the issue of staffing levels.  An exemption to the moratorium on public service recruitment was granted in respect of 100 psychiatric nurse positions but more than 1,000 nurses retired last year and a further 1,100 are due to retire this year.  The progress report states that mental health care is experiencing a disproportionate decrease in the number of posts compared with other areas of the health service and this undermines the full implementation of the model of services described in A Vision for Change.  I ask the Minister of State to outline what measures are being considered to address this issue.  Previous annual progress reports have criticised a disappointing lack of progress in the specialist services of forensic mental health care, rehabilitation and recovery, eating disorders, psychiatry for older people, severe mental illness, substance abuse problems and intellectual disabilities.  I hope the Minister of State addresses this worrying lack of progress at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The original strategy envisioned in A Vision for Change involves 99 multidisciplinary child and adult mental health service teams.  Five years into the ten-year plan, the HSE reports that 61 teams are in place, comprising 56 community teams, two day hospital teams and three paediatric hospital liaison teams.  Under the strategy, teams consist of a psychologist, social worker, nurse and occupational therapist under clinical direction of a child psychiatrist.  Amnesty International Ireland director, Colm O&rsquo;Gorman, recently stated that the staff levels on many of these teams is one third less than required for efficient operation.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify the position.</P>
        <P>The report also recommends that a legislative framework be considered to fully implement A Vision for Change.  While I do not want to restrict the Minister of State&rsquo;s role in relation to reform and administration of mental health services, I ask whether such an initiative is under active consideration in her Department and if she is in favour of legislation.</P>
        <P>As the report notes, there is now an urgent need for the Government to turn its attention to the services used by some of the most vulnerable people in society.  I acknowledge the considerable progress that has been made but more is required.  I wish the Minister of State well in her effort to meet the targets.</P>
        <P>During my campaign for election to the Seanad, I learned about a team that was set up in County Leitrim to deal with families who are concerned about relatives at risk of suicide and depression.  Three people are employed in an on-call service to meet those concerned.  The service appears to be working well and perhaps the Minister of State could investigate whether it provides a model that could be implemented elsewhere.  We are going through difficult times and we need to address the problem of suicide, just as a previous Government addressed the issue of road traffic accidents by putting in place a comprehensive education programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and congratulate her on the excellent work she has done to date.  I look forward to working with her on mental health issues.  I have a particular interest in this area because I am the parent of a child with a moderate intellectual disability.  At this stage, I am well qualified to speak about the lack of services in mental health and disability.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In order to highlight where change is needed, I shall share the experiences of two of my constituents, who are also good friends.  These individuals have suffered greatly from the lack of services in this country.  In the past two years, a young friend of mine attended her GP on at least 20 occasions.  We say that we would spend our last penny to make our children better but most families also have to take account of money.   At &euro;50 per visit, 20 trips to the GP is a significant expense.  At each visit, the girl in question was prescribed anti-depressants either in the form of increased dosage or different medication.  As she did not make progress, she was referred to a psychologist who saw her twice at a cost of &euro;80 per session before referring her back to the GP.  After asking for help every single day, she was eventually referred to a psychiatrist who saw her three times.  The initial consultation cost &euro;300 and the remaining two were &euro;180.  Despite these visits, the patient made no improvement and she begged to be admitted to hospital.  On one occasion, she told me that if she was a dog in pain something would be done to help her and she asked if anyone could help her.  Coming from a 19 year old child, this is atrocious.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>The psychiatrist eventually agreed to admit the girl to hospital but she was told she would have to wait at least four weeks before she could be admitted to a private psychiatric hospital.  She was given an option of two hospitals.  On a daily basis, the girl&rsquo;s parents and GP called both hospitals to plead for help but it took four weeks of numerous daily telephone calls to highlight their fears for her safety before she was admitted to a hospital in Dublin.  The other psychiatric hospital only responded to the parents with an offer of a bed after 11 weeks.  The attitude was she would have to wait.  How can we tell someone who is suffering from a depressive illness that we do not have a bed?  Do we ask the person to put off his or her suicidal thoughts for four weeks?  It is atrocious.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This patient was treated at the highest level available but her family nevertheless saw a decline in her mental health.  Before being admitted to the hospital, she was assured of intensive psychiatric care but this did not happen.  This girl spent 11 weeks in a hospital in south Dublin but she was discharged in worse condition than when she was admitted.  She was told to take the tablets and go away.  She was given a further appointment after her discharge and her mother tried to meet the consultant on the day of discharge.  They rang other wards twice but could not get to speak to a doctor.  Eventually an outpatient appointment became necessary.  When the girl attended the appointment, she was horrified to discover that it had been made with a separate doctor, whom she had never met in her 11 weeks in hospital.  When her mother rang to ask if she could see the consultant who had treated her, she was told the consultant had not seen an inpatient as an outpatient for over 11 years, which is absolutely atrocious.  We <Col N="593"/>must provide for a follow-up and let the people with mental health issues who are suicidal or suffer from depression know that we care.  They need somebody who believes in them rather than somebody to lecture them.  If we are paying money for psychiatric services, why can there not be a follow-up with consultants providing treatment?  It beggars belief that this does not happen.</P>
        <P>A friend of mine took his own life four weeks ago.  He had asked to be admitted to hospital to receive help and his family were also told there was a four to six week waiting period.  He was eventually admitted to a psychiatric wing of a general hospital in my constituency.  When a bed eventually became available in a psychiatric hospital, with the patient due to be transferred on a Friday morning, there was no doctor available to sign the release form to allow the patient to be transferred.  His wife had to tell him he would be staying in the general hospital for the weekend as there was no one available to sign the release form.  An hour later he had taken his own life, having felt scared and so alone in the hospital, feelings he had conveyed to his wife.</P>
        <P>Such a case reiterates what I have argued for &mdash; that people should know somebody cares.  This young man had a young family and had pleaded for help from the health system, as many have done.  He was failed miserably.  We must make A Vision for Change a much changed vision for the current system under which the most vulnerable suffer the most.</P>
        <P>I will briefly mention that in my own child&rsquo;s school three 18-year old youths left and they had absolutely nowhere to go and their parents are totally distraught.  If a youth leaves secondary school, there is always somebody available to help, but these children left the school without as much as a goodbye or graduation ceremony.  There was no card or letter of good luck.  We are working with the parents to put something in place.  The system is unfair and the most vulnerable are suffering.</P>
        <P>Recently I attended an excellent conference organised by the charity Save Our Sons and Daughters, SOSAD, which was founded by a Louth man whose son had committed suicide a few years before.  At the conference it was mentioned that there had been 527 documented deaths by suicide in Ireland in 2009, although it is thought the figure is much higher because it does not take into account non-accidental drownings or road fatalities.  In 2010 the figure rose to 700.  The group was founded in Drogheda and has expanded across counties Louth, Meath and Cavan, although it receives calls from all over the country.  One of the most important services provided by it is the listening service about which I spoke.  As SOSAD is a charitable organisation which receives no public funds, I ask the Minister of State to consider assisting such groups which provide such an excellent service.  To date, it has saved over 250 lives by providing a follow-up service.</P>

        <P><i>Notice taken that 12 Members were not present; House counted and 12 Members being present,</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber again.  I will make a point about suicide, although I do not intend to speak about the issue as it relates to A Vision for Change.  It must be acknowledged that over 1,000 people have died by suicide in the past two years.  Every party represented in the Chamber should consider this figure and we should have a debate devoted to the topic.  Mental health services are in tatters.  Not alone do such services not respond to suicide in communities, but in a great number of cases they are not even aware suicides occur.  I have been a health service professional for a long time and I am very aware of this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am very happy to have an opportunity to speak to A Vision for Change.  For too long the mental health service has been seen as the poor cousin in the health service and during the years the level of investment in the service has been little short of scandalous.  In 1984 I started <Col N="594"/>my career working with the service in Cork.  When one becomes part of a system, it is sometimes difficult to see what is wrong with it.  At the time there were over 1,000 patients hospitals and conditions, owing to historic under-investment and wider societal views towards persons with a mental illness, were not good.  Overcrowding, poorly maintained buildings and unstructured days for patients were the most serious problems.  Nevertheless, the staff with whom I worked were probably the most decent people I had ever come across.  They struggled daily in very poor conditions to ensure the dignity of patients received the highest priority.  I learned many lessons in that old institution, the most important being decency is the most vital element.</P>
        <P>In 1984 an important policy document, Planning for the Future, was published.  It was one of the first major documents to be published.  It was heralded at the time as the greatest show in town.  It is unfortunate, therefore, that 27 years later, all of its recommendations have yet to be implemented.  The lack of political will and investment ensured they were implemented in piecemeal fashion.  Most of the institutions are now closed and good riddance to them.  However, promised community developments have not taken place.  It is scarcely believable that some persons in long-term care are living in institutions 27 years after the publication of a report committed to the closure of institutions and developing community services.</P>
        <P>Some years ago I had the opportunity to be involved in an international literature review of mental health policy documents.  We considered a range of policies in many countries and among the many examined we found that the national framework for mental health services in the United Kingdom offered a very good model for service delivery.  I can honestly say the policy framework of A Vision for Change has no peer across Europe or the world.  What particularly impresses me about it are the comprehensive views offered about the potential to create a world-class model in this country.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is driving change in this area and the prospects for delivering such a model are very bright.  The creation of a directorate for mental health, as announced by her, is an excellent start, on which she should be commended.</P>
        <P>A statement in A Vision for Change reads, &ldquo;The vision that guides this policy requires mental health services to be characterised by a partnership between stakeholders&rdquo;.  This is an ambitious statement of intent and requires a complete cultural shift in how we deliver our services.  These services were and still are characterised by a paternalistic approach whereby health care professionals are seen to deliver health care to service users.</P>
        <P>The media reported today on the case of a 40 year old man who is an involuntary patient at Naas General Hospital.  His family is seeking to stop the mental health services from administering electroconvulsive therapy, ECT, to him against his will.  While I fully understand the complexities surrounding this area, it is an indictment on our society that such cases have to be taken.  In any other branch of medicine, or indeed life, a major invasive procedure would not be sanctioned by law.  The law in this instance is section 59(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Mental Health Act 2001, which provides that ECT can be administered if two consultants form the opinion that it is necessary.  Court orders are required in every other branch of medicine before decisions on issues of this import can be made.  The Minister of State said that the health service should be seamless and that the rights of patients in one branch of medicine should be the same as the rights of patients in another branch of medicine.  The case I have mentioned shows that the mental health services have a long way to go in this regard.</P>
        <P>In addition to the need to make a cultural shift, the other challenge we face as we try to implement A Vision for Change relates to costs.  The degree of change that is envisaged would involve significant investment.  It is clear that adequate budgetary plans should run parallel with policy changes.  I am worried about that in this instance.  The challenging financial situation we face does not bode well for these changes.</P><Col N="595"/>
        <P>I understand that the moneys to be raised through land sales will be ring-fenced for investment in mental health services.  Can any of us really say, hand on heart, that we realistically believe much money will be realised from this source in the current economic climate?  The Government should front-load these costs and recoup its investment at a later date when land sales are achieved.</P>
        <P>In tandem with policy changes in mental health services, we must also effect policy change in other areas.  There is no doubt that poverty and social exclusion are related to mental ill health, although the exact pathway remains unclear.  We know that 70% of users of mental health services depend on welfare payments.  Obviously, our policy needs to recognise this.</P>
        <P>I know from working in the area that access to housing is an important element in the recovery and maintenance of good health.  When people are discharged from hospital without having anywhere to go, it poses a significant obstacle to allowing them to return to their communities, where they want to live in quality housing.  We must build partnerships between the mental health services and the local authorities in this area.</P>
        <P>Education policy is vital.  The education system has to recognise its important role in this regard.  Stigma reduction measures should be included in any education policy.  I recognise the importance of A Vision for Change and the Minister of State&rsquo;s undoubted commitment to it.  We also need to recognise that policy changes in other areas are needed before we can deliver the exciting prospects that are outlined in A Vision for Change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We are lucky that a person with such a passion for and commitment to this area is in this role.  I compliment Senator Gilroy on raising the important issue of the involuntary subjection of patients to electroconvulsive therapy.  He is probably aware that working with the Green Party, I introduced legislation in the last Seanad that would have dealt with this issue.  The legislative process was not completed, unfortunately.  Perhaps the Government will consider revisiting the Bill, which relates to a complex area.</P>
        <P>I listened with great admiration to Senator Moran&rsquo;s superb and greatly moving speech.  It was one of the best speeches I have heard in 25 years in this House.  It came from the heart, but it was not just emotional.  It put very clear facts before us.  All of us of all parties and Governments must take some responsibility for those facts as a community.  It is important for these matters to be documented in the manner that was done by Senator Moran.</P>
        <P>I would like to comment on a couple of aspects of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech.  A Vision for Change is an excellent document that has unfortunately been left lying around for some time.  I am glad that the Minister of State acknowledged honestly at the outset that implementation has been slow.  I hope it will speed up under her stewardship.  I am pleased that in the last paragraph of her speech, she said &euro;35 million will be ring-fenced annually.  I like the sound of that because it seems that something will actually be done.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the question of involuntary admissions, which is analogous to the question of the involuntary subjection of patients to invasive treatment.  I was particularly glad to hear her refer to the establishment of a national service users executive.  It is important for us to involve people with mental health issues in their own recovery.  We need to empower them, listen to them and involve them in these discussions.  I was pleased to hear her refer to the See Change alliance and the Make a Ripple initiative, to which I have made a small commitment.</P>
        <P>I hope I am not blowing my own trumpet when I mention a learning experience I have had in recent times.  Mental health was the first of the three pillars I put down when I launched my bid for the Presidency.  I thought it was a quixotic thing, that I was being an idealist.  It has <Col N="596"/>astonished me that people have raised this issue with me every time I have pulled into a petrol station or gone into a little coffee shop.  They ask me to help to smash the stigma and break the silence on this issue, which is exactly what the Minister of State has been saying.  If one is depressed, one needs the help of others to raise the burden off one&rsquo;s shoulders.</P>
        <P>It is helpful to take on board the fact that mental illness is just that &mdash; an illness.  I have been saying for the last six months that people are not ashamed of a broken arm or a touch of bronchitis, but they are ashamed of mental illness.  The reason for that is the existence of this stigma.  It can be a black mark if one is looking for a job.  We need to address that, particularly now that people have been courageous enough to come out and say they have experienced mental health problems.  Some 25% of people in this country will experience serious mental health crises during their lives.</P>
        <P>I remind the House that Catherine Zeta-Jones had a bipolar episode that was triggered by her husband&rsquo;s throat cancer.  Stephen Fry has spoken about the similar difficulties he has experienced.  It is absolutely wonderful that distinguished sports people who are regarded as icons in our society have had the courage and bravery to discuss these issues.  They are to be commended.</P>
        <P>Perhaps we need to consider the definition of &ldquo;mental health&rdquo;.  I think it relates to the old Latin tag, <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i> &mdash; a sound mind in a healthy body.  It describes how we think and feel about ourselves and other people, how we perceive and interpret what is going on in our lives, and our ability to cope and deal with change, transition and significant events.  One&rsquo;s feelings can sometimes become so intense that they interfere with one&rsquo;s day-to-day activities, which leads to physical or behavioural symptoms that can be confusing for one, one&rsquo;s family and the people surrounding one.</P>
        <P>We should remember that mental health spans a continuum that goes from positive mental health to mental distress, mental disorder and mental illness.  Equally, we should examine the history of how this subject has been dealt with.  It is remarkable that Jonathan Swift founded St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital in the 18th century when he recognised that mental illness needed to be considered in parallel with physical illness.  By contrast, we spent the 19th and 20th centuries building institutions that, by the 1950s, were used to incarcerate 25,000 people.  They were sometimes used as repositories for people who were awkward or difficult or were experiencing an emotional crisis.  They were left there.</P>
        <P>I am sure many of my colleagues have read a moving book, <i>Bird&rsquo;s Nest Soup</i>, which was written by Hanna Greally, who spent 40 years in an institution.  When a young psychiatrist recognised that there was nothing wrong with her, she managed to get out even though she had become partly institutionalised.</P>
        <P>I welcome the commencement of the deinstitutionalisation process.  The problem is that it is a question of funding and implementation.  Although community care and alternative services are excellent, they are not yet in place.  I do not think we can responsibly put people back into the community until facilities are available to look after them.  This kind of aftercare was referred to by other speakers.  Although it is good that the number of people in institutions has been decreased to 1,200, it is still problematic.</P>
        <P>Electroconvulsive therapy was not the worst of the forms of psychiatry that were practised in institutions in previous times.  Lobotomies were carried out.  Some Senators may have seen the wonderful series on the Kennedy family that was broadcast recently.  It clearly depicted the distress of Jack Kennedy&rsquo;s mother, who emerged from the series as a remarkable woman, when she discovered that her husband had agreed behind her back to have Rose Kennedy lobotomised.  The same thing happened to the sister of Tennessee Williams, also called Rose, <Col N="597"/>on whom a central figure in his wonderful play, &ldquo;The Glass Menagerie&rdquo;, was based.  We have an alternative way of looking at these things now which is to see people as human beings and complex organisms with an emotional, rational, spiritual and physical presence.  All of us experience periods when we feel sad, hurt, depressed or out of control.  It is all a part of being human but sometimes it can become extreme and lead to suicide, a desperately important issue.</P>
        <P>I was interested to hear Senator Moran use the phrase &ldquo;take their own lives&rdquo;.  All of us used language whose implications we did not understand, such as &ldquo;committing suicide&rdquo;.  I remember Deputy Dan Neville in this House 15 years ago operating on the decriminalisation of suicide.  It is a nonsense to make it a criminal offence.  What does one do?  Does one imprison or fine a corpse?  One cannot do anything to someone who is dead but one can affect the family and that is cruel.  One commits a sin or a crime and the churches were wrong to punish the families by refusing to allow people to be buried in sanctified ground and I am pleased that has changed as well.  Therefore, the language is terribly important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have dealt with SOSAD and I was pleased that it was mentioned.  I have been there, seen them and they are wonderful people.  I have been to Pieta House, run by Joan Freeman, and with Mental Health Ireland, chaired by Michael Hughes.  It is a tribute to our health service that people such as Michael Hughes and his colleagues in D&uacute;n Laoghaire continue their work and that people who worked in the HSE continue in their retirement.  It shows an absolute and real commitment, of which I am very proud.</P>
        <P>One thing I have learned from studying the issue of suicide is that in 98% of cases the intention is not to end the life but to put an end to unbearable emotional and mental agony.  This means it is possible to intervene and there are signs such as giving away something very valued, such as a personal memento, a sporting trophy or a doll retained from childhood, or extended telephone calls with friends who are abroad.  It is possible to intervene at that moment.  We must publicise and learn what these factors are.  There is no doubt whatever that the economic climate has something to do with this.  In the past week, a publication of European statistics showed that throughout the European community there has been a correlative rise in the incidences of suicide that parallels economic pressures directly.  This is a significant matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The three most important mental health problems in Ireland are alcoholism, depression and suicide.  We must approach alcoholism.  I am extremely sorry to discover that the Pioneer Total Abstinence movement, founded by Fr. Matthew of Cork, is in financial difficulty.  I hope some attempt will be made to remedy this.  I am not a pioneer myself, I take a drink, but it is a wonderful organisation and it does fantastic work.  The influence of these enormous conglomerates is awful.  They are no longer Irish companies and we should remember that.  They are international organisations which have meetings in boardrooms in London and New York.  They look at graphs and decide and predict the drinking habits of the young.  It is a remarkably powerful lobby and this Parliament should stand up to it.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution.  This is a good day for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  There have been excellent speeches all around.  I hope the debate will be covered in some of the media because we need the co-operation of the media to ventilate these issues and to support our colleagues who are experiencing these difficulties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I wish to outline a local example of a possible solution which may help to meet some of the housing needs of those with intellectual disability who wish to live independently.  The Brothers of Charity in Clare have gone to great lengths in recent years to provide for the accommodation needs through the rent supplement structure.  Unfortunately, they have met a brick wall with the local community welfare manager.  I can provide the Minister of State with her name afterwards if she so wishes.  I commend the Brothers of Charity in Clare for being among the most progress<Col N="598"/>ive service providers in the country.  I declare an interest, since my daughter, Colleen, receives a day service from it.  I call on the Minister of State to liaise with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, to examine the possibility of a rent supplement scheme or rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which could be used to provide housing for those with an intellectual disability or mental health issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State could also liaise with the Minister for Finance to consider the use of houses in NAMA, of which there are a great many throughout the country.  They could provide an option and the Government would have no need to find the money for these.  The service providers in Clare assure me they will provide the independent living supports necessary for those who need them.  We must work within the structures already in place to find a quick solution and answer and this should be facilitated.  I call on the Minister of State to add the Minister of Finance to the list of Ministers who should help in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I congratulate the Minister of State on her appointment and I have no doubt she will carry our her role with distinction.  It is an important portfolio.  The Minister of State will agree that a former colleague of mine and a personal friend, John Moloney, did a top notch job in this area.  This is an area which has cross-party support and all of us care about the areas of disability, mental health and psychiatric care.  It is in the interests of all of us and all communities.</P>
        <P>A Vision for Change sets out the vision.  The progress that has been made since 2006 outlined by the Minister of State in her contribution is significant.  The moves towards integration within the community, independent living and respite within the community are crucial.  It is crucial to move away from the psychiatric institutions.  Having said that and if I may be parochial for one moment, inpatient beds are required in my area at St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital, Portrane, which has served the areas of Donabate and Portrane since 1901.  It has a track record in looking after people with intellectual and psychiatric disabilities.  Unfortunately, many of the admissions are due to attempted suicide.</P>
        <P>I am concerned and I call on the Minister of State to take this back to the Department.  New admissions to St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital will cease from 31 August.  I welcome that the Minister for Health has informed me that construction on a new inpatient unit in Beaumont Hospital will begin shortly, but what will happen in the interim?  The proposed date, 31 August, is only weeks away.  The staff in St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital are excellent.  I visit it regularly.  However, there is grave concern in the area. I call on the Minister of State to take that back to her Department.  I have no wish to be overly political on it.  I am keen to know about construction, planning and everything else that happens.  Will the Minister of State indicate today when she expects the new inpatient unit in Beaumont Hospital to be open and what are the construction timelines?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of my colleagues mentioned young adults.  Certain organisations deserve support.  The HSE and its staff carry out crucial services, but certain voluntary and community bodies carry out great work as well.  Prosper Fingal looks after many young adults when they leave school and provides training for the workforce in independent living and education.  It looks after hundreds of young adults.  Like everything else, there is pressure on funding.  However, I call on the Department to establish what can be done outside the HSE.  Another example is the Caring and Sharing Association, CASA, which has branches throughout the country and in my area where it provides respite care for people and gives families a break.  We should examine the value for money we are getting.  Some groups are doing fantastic work and it is not a good idea to have everything centralised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the 2011 budget there was a 1.8% decrease in disability funding.  That was significantly less compared with the other decreases that had to be brought forward in the previous budget. <Col N="599"/> This was welcome, especially since we are in a deflationary environment.  Effectively, the budget of &euro;920 million has been retained, which is not insignificant.  I realise we are some way from the budget but we are not too far away from the Estimates.  The Minister of State will get 150% support from this side of the House.  It is crucial that the budget is maintained and that mental health and disability services continue to be ring-fenced.  It is also important that the proceeds from the sale of these assets do not simply go back into the pot and that, instead, these areas continue to be ring-fenced to provide new facilities such as Knockamann which opened up earlier this year in Portrane.  Mr. John Moloney also was able to surmount the moratorium issues to ensure this area was perceived as a crucial priority, because these are the most vulnerable people in society.  How the vulnerable are treated is a reflection of how progressive or good is our society.  While I do not expect the Minister of State to be able to provide a figure today, she should refer to progress being made towards the Estimates project, the ring-fencing of moneys and at the very least, the maintenance of the budget that was provided for in 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to raise a couple of items pertaining to community group funding.  There is a raft of groups nationwide.  I referred to a study being carried out.  Are studies being undertaken on the funding being provided to such groups with reference to the work they carry out?  I refer, in particular, to comparing the work they do with that done within the Department of Health and the HSE.  Crucial work is undertaken by organisations such as the Caring and Sharing Association, CASA, the Arch clubs, Prosper Fingal and other groups throughout the country, which are saving the State money.  While this is not a monetary issue, more of this can be pushed out into the community rather than simply being controlled centrally through the HSE.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well in this portfolio.  She will receive all the support she requires from the Fianna F&aacute;il grouping.  The issue of funding services for mental and intellectual disabilities obviously transcends all political parties and she will find no disagreement from Fianna F&aacute;il if she is able to ensure the budget is maintained and the ring-fencing of moneys for the services continues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome to the House the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services and wish her well in the portfolio.  It is a highly appropriate appointment.  While we do not share a constituency, we are from adjacent constituencies and the Minister of State has had a long-held interest in, and has campaigned for, this area.  I am sure she knew exactly what direction she wished to take before her appointment and I wish her well.</P>
        <P>A Vision for Change sets out an overall blueprint on how services for those with mental illness can be appropriated.  While it was published in 2006, it remains a highly important guiding tool as to how progress should be made in this regard.  The issue of funding has been mentioned and progress in implementing A Vision for Change has not been as good as anyone would wish.  I note the Minister of State acknowledged this point in her contribution.  For example, in 2007 funding of &euro;24 million that had been allocated to implement services pertaining to A Vision for Change was diverted elsewhere.  The Minister of State is faced with the challenge of ensuring that funding allocated mostly through the HSE is appropriated and spent where intended.  I welcome the programme for Government statement that funding will be allocated on an annual basis.  A total of &euro;35 million will be allocated annually for the development of community services, which are extremely important.</P>
        <P>The entire thrust of A Vision for Change is to move away from establishments and from putting people away, as the term was, and towards a focus on developing services within the community, while retaining the support of hospitals.  This involves a sea-change in organisation and money for its implementation.  The development of community services is the key to achieving this goal.  Such services should be provided for the service users, their families and <Col N="600"/>carers and it will be very important to allocate funding for this area in particular, which I will support.</P>
        <P>One has often heard of people being discharged from inpatient care into the community with no support.  While they may have been in receipt of supported services for months, they suddenly are discharged into the community with no intervention and with no one to pick up the telephone to ascertain how they are or to ensure they have accommodation.  Consequently, a range of services must be co-ordinated.  Previous speakers referred to the importance of the role of local authorities in respect of people&rsquo;s housing needs.  I have worked with groups locally in Cork to try to bridge the gap to ensure that housing strategies are being established in local authorities and that the housing needs of those individuals who will need support in the community are addressed.  The original A Vision for Change estimate was that non-capital funding of &euro;151 million would be needed but thus far, only &euro;54 million has been allocated.  In this context, I reiterate the identification of ring-fencing of money in the programme for Government, which is of great importance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The multidisciplinary community medical teams comprise a major plank of the strategy and will identify areas such as adult needs, child and adolescent needs, psychiatry of old age, intellectual disabilities and forensic medical health services.  The Government must ensure the provision of well co-ordinated and evidence-based treatment for individuals in need of those services.  I wish to focus in particular on the child and adolescent services, which have been neglected, although I acknowledge the entire area of mental health has been neglected and has been described as the Cinderella of the health services.  I hope this no longer will be the case, particularly when one notes the relative survival of the allocation for mental health services in the budget for 2011 and that this will continue in the future.  Although there has been a history of provision of child and adolescent services, the focus has been on the lack of inpatient beds.  The number of such beds now has increased substantially to 52 nationally, which is greatly to be welcomed.  While it had been the case that no services were available outside the Dublin region, the recently opened facility in Bessboro, Blackrock, Cork has 20 inpatient spaces and constitutes a highly important development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Members will have heard accounts of children and young people being admitted to adult services.  Although this practice is completely unsuitable, there probably was no alternative.  I read a summary report yesterday on child and adolescent services produced by the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, which produces an annual report and has produced two reports thus far.  It provides an update on services in the area, waiting lists and the type of problems with which it deals.  In 2009, there were 367 admissions of children to inpatient units, of which 212 were to adult facilities and 155 to child and adolescent units.  It also is interesting to note the length of stay in the adult unit was much shorter than was the case in the child and adolescent centres, which may reflect the level of care.  While I cannot be sure of that, it is an interesting statistic.</P>
        <P>Many groups and organisations that work in the mental health sector have been mentioned and are supported by Members.  All Members are well aware of them and encounter them in their work.  In particular, I have had dealings with BodyWhys, an organisation established to help with eating disorders.  This is a specific area in which no dedicated bed was available for children and adolescents until relatively recently.  It has been very important and while an inpatient bed is not the solution to all problems, at some stage it becomes important and necessary.  The subject of eating disorders is worthy of a major discussion on its own in respect of how the media affect it and on the importance of body image.  While it obviously is more prevalent among girls, that is not to state it is absent among young males, as its incidence is increasing in that area.  It is reckoned that of the child and adolescent admissions in 2008, 18% were related to eating disorders, such as anorexia, bulimia or binge eating and most of them occurred within the 15 to 40 age cohort for women.</P><Col N="601"/>
      
        <P Just="Left">An interesting statistic from the United Kingdom shows there has been an 80% increase in hospital admissions for eating disorders in the past decade.  The problem has not gone away.  I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the annual report of the monitoring group which emphasised the need to ensure that recovery becomes part of the ethos.  Recovery was referred to in the A Vision for Change document, yet it has not filtered through the system.  It is clear that a recovery ethos and the principles and practicalities of recovery are not ingrained in the mental health services.  The monitoring group wished to highlight this issue in its annual report.  It stated that recovery is not part of the ethos of psychiatry nor of the Irish College of General Practitioners nor of the Irish Medical Organisation.  Recovery should not just be about rehabilitation but also about confirming to the individual that he or she can get to a point where he or she can live a full and fruitful life.  I thank the Minister of State for her attendance and for her contribution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  Without sounding like a broken record, it is very welcome to have a person in her position with such a commitment to the cause of reform in this area where reform is greatly needed.  I was moved by Senator Moran&rsquo;s contribution.  As she was speaking, I did a very sad mental inventory and I could think immediately of eight medical students, doctors or nurses I knew over the years who had taken their own lives.  I knew many other patients and acquaintances who, when confronted with very bad news, had made similar decisions.  These are the dramatic cases but at its most extreme, mental illness and disabilities of various kinds are a great burden for the individuals concerned, for their families and for society in general.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P Just="Left">At the risk of sounding like a slightly different broken record, I ask the Minister of State a few questions.  I do not expect her to answer them because I suspect she does not have the information at her fingertips, but these are numbers with which she will need to arm herself in analysing the situation regarding the psychiatric component of the health system.  As anyone who has heard me speaking here will guess, the first question I will ask is the number of trained career level psychiatrists available in the country.  I ask how many psychiatrists are in Northern Ireland considering the population there is one third the size of ours.  I ask how many psychiatrists are in the United Kingdom and in Europe.  I ask what is the approximate number of trained career level psychiatrists per head of population in our jurisdiction compared with other comparable jurisdictions.  I do not know the numbers and these are not trick questions.</P>
        <P>As a good rule of thumb, for any specialty one cares to mention, we tend to be way below the international averages.  I was thinking of this when I heard Senator Moran&rsquo;s stories about particular hardships which people had encountered.  It made my blood boil a little but I was also thinking how many patients had those doctors seen that day compared with a doctor working in a leading psychiatric institution in London or in Louvain.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to see that an issue I have raised in a few contexts is now getting some attention.  It is the question of the structures of medical education in this country.  I would like to know the number of full-time academic psychiatrists attached to our six medical schools.  I am guessing that with an average number of full-time faculty members, according to international guidelines, there would probably be between three and ten per medical school.  I suspect the number is closer to zero.  Without wishing to be provocative, I ask the number of grade eight officers in health administration whose work is entirely directed to the administration and supervision of the rather small number of full-time psychiatry professionals in the country.</P>
        <P>The move to outpatient care is obviously an excellent decision.  I do not wish to sound judgmental because we inherited them but anyone who has visited some of the truly Dickensian facilities in which patients received treatment over the years will be fully appreciative of the humanity shown in moving people from an inpatient setting to an outpatient setting.  This is also a change taking <Col N="602"/>place in other areas of medicine.  Most oncological work is carried out in an outpatient setting and this is true for surgery where ambulatory care has also moved to such a setting.  The closure of inpatient facilities without simultaneously developing the necessary outpatient facilities is a cutback by other means.  It is crucial to ensure a match between what is developed in the outpatient setting and what is closed in the inpatient setting.  The Minister of State and other Members will be aware of the awful financial situation and the pressure there will be to try to find means of curtailing spending at all times.  I ask that we try to ensure a match between what facilities are closed and what facilities are opened.</P>
        <P>I will probably be seen off the premises by security for being in breach of the orders of the House because we are not supposed to talk about money and raising taxes but perhaps I could suggest to the Minister of State in a friendly fashion that we might consider a ring-fenced vice tax on alcohol which could be used for nothing other than alcohol related health issues and perhaps greater issues of support for mental health services.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for her attention to these matters.  I would welcome the opportunity to have a systematic analysis of the person power available at senior specialist and other support levels within the health service.  The Joint Committee on Health and Children may be the best forum for this information.  I wish the Minister of State the very best with her endeavours.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Like previous speakers I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Like Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, who said that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party would give the Minister of State its full support, Sinn F&eacute;in will also give her its full support on this issue.  We all need to unite on issues such as this to ensure they are not used as political footballs and that we work together instead to ensure the best world-class services available for people with mental illness problems.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have taken a significant interest in this issue in recent years, since before I became active in politics.  I attended a number of events organised by advocate groups for people with mental health problems.  I was always impressed by the personal stories of people suffering from various forms of mental illness and the stigma they said was attached to the illness.  Many efforts have been made in recent years to challenge those stigmas but many people believe they still exist.  I recently attended an event at which I spoke to a local Waterford GP.  He said it was amazing how many men came to his clinic every day suffering from depression.  They know they are unable to function and cannot eat.  When they speak openly to their loved ones or partners or parents, they are often told to snap out of it.  There is a lack of knowledge about depression and how difficult depression can be for many people.  The GP in question is a pioneer in this area so he knows what he is talking about.  He says it is a big problem that needs to be challenged, primarily in the case of men but also for all individuals.</P>
        <P>I was also very impressed at the same event by stories told by people who were in State institutions.  It is appalling and one of the worst chapters in the history of this State that previous generations put people into institutions often run by religious orders.  We now know exactly what happened to some of those people in State care.  I listened to the tragedies and the personal stories of the victims of State care.  One of the most important steps taken by the previous Government, and I assume it will be supported by the present Government, is the move towards community-based care.  This initiative has to be continued by this Government.</P>
        <P>Mental illness has been the Cinderella of the health services and this view is repeated by all advocate groups and by sufferers.  It is the first thing they or somebody who suffers from the illness will say.  One will find it is true when one looks at the record.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Crown spoke about using comparisons with the North, Great Britain or elsewhere in Europe.  We always seem to fare very badly, but on this issue we fare extremely badly.  My party fully supported A Vision for Change because it was a first-class document which set out a very <Col N="603"/>real vision as to how we deal with these problems.  Funding, the disposal of assets and the ring-fencing of funding is welcome.  As a previous Senator said, given that there has been a change in the economy and the environment in which assets can be disposed of, there is very real concern that the funding necessary may not be available.</P>
        <P>There are many other issues I could raise.  The Minister of State is here to take some advice.  If we are here to support the Minister of State and Government and there is to be all-party support on issues like this, the views and proposals of parties should be taken on board.  My party has been pushing for all-Ireland policies and co-ordination in this area.  I refer in particular to the need to have an all-Ireland suicide prevention strategy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is wrong that we have two health systems and sets of policies.  We need to make sure that if there is good practice in the North it is taken on board and put into practice in this state and <i>vice versa</i>.  There is much that both Administrations can learn from.  The objective has to be to provide the best services for people North and South.  We also need improved accountability and transparency in planning and financing mental health service reform.</P>
        <P>We need to modernise mental health legislation in line with the new convention on the rights of persons with disabilities.  Crucially, we need cross-departmental action to combat social exclusion, prejudice and discrimination against people with mental health problems.  We spoke about that in terms of stigma and perhaps this is an area which could straddle a number of Departments.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have specifically called for funding for mental health services.  Given that it is accepted, not just by advocate groups but the entire political system, that mental health has been chronically under-funded we have sought to ringfence 12% of the entire health budget for mental health services.  It is a policy advocated by the World Health Organization.  It made recommendations on how states and countries deal with mental health.</P>
        <P>We need to develop and promote suicide prevention strategies, ensure the provision of the required child and adolescent community-based mental health services and end placement of children in adult inpatient facilities.  I remember meeting the family of a child who was put into an adult facility.  It is a bad practice which needs to end.  I congratulate the Minister of State, not just on her appointment but on the forthright way in which she has taken to her position.</P>
        <P>People across all parties are delighted that we have a Minister of State who is passionate about the issue.  I am sure she will do her absolute best, given the economic circumstances which prevail.  These issues need to be tackled and people with mental health problems need to be supported.</P>
        <P>I hope the document, which was one of the best produced by the previous Government, will not be a victim of the austerity measures in place.  Mental health is an area we should prioritise in future budgets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not listed to speak but I want to make a few comments.  I join in welcoming the Minister of State.  Everybody in the House agrees that she is a reforming, committed Minister of State who will do a fantastic job.  I also acknowledge the fine work done over the years by the previous Minister of State, Mr. John Moloney.  I was fortunate to meet him on several occasions in Ballinasloe in regard to mental health issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The strategy in A Vision for Change is enlightened.  Our only concern is the slow pace in implementation of all of its fine recommendations.  I come from a town that had a psychiatric hospital which a few short years ago had close to 2,000 patients.  Very few knew exactly what had happened there.  Many of the patients should not have been there in the first place.  They were there for all sorts of reasons, something to which other Senators referred.  Many of them are living in the community today, supported by wonderful HSE staff, and live normal and fulfilling lives.  I have had the pleasure of being at many functions over the years in which they actively participated. <Col N="604"/> They are very much part of the community and are welcomed into it.  We want to see that development continue.</P>
        <P>Several Senators have raised the issue of suicide.  We all want to make sure that resources are made available to assist people who are suffering from depression and in danger of taking their lives or causing themselves harm.  I would be concerned that in a time of economic difficulty like that which we are currently experiencing the resources required will not be made available.  I join other Senators in calling for resources to be ring-fenced for this area.  We are dealing with the most vulnerable sections of our community and we all want to make sure they are given priority.</P>
        <P>Other Senators spoke about the difficulties associated with alcohol and alcohol-induced illnesses.  In my town a fine unit was attached to St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospital in Ballinasloe.  It was probably one of the best addiction units in the country with high success rates.  Many people I worked with over the years were referred to the unit.  I was a personnel officer in a manufacturing company and know of many people who came through the institution, returned to work and lived full lives.  The old health board, in its wisdom, decided to close the unit and facilities were not put in place to replace it.</P>
        <P>People who can afford to go to private institutions for treatment for alcohol addiction are looked after.  However, I have represented many people over the years in my town who cannot afford to go to such facilities.  The unit to which I referred was  available to help people and brought them back from the brink.  It enabled them to live full lives.  Many people are now in dire situations, living rough and drinking outdoors on benches around the town.  If the unit was open those people would not be in difficulty.</P>
        <P>If the Minister of State disposes of buildings, particularly those in Ballinasloe, she should ensure that the moneys are ring-fenced for investment in mental health services.  I know it is not a good time to talk about disposing of buildings, but I hope that when the market improves in a couple of years the moneys realised from the sale of those assets will be ring-fenced for mental health services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I again wish the Minister of State well.  I have every confidence that she is the person for the job.  I know of her commitment over the years when she was in Opposition. She will relish the opportunity in government to put many of her ideas to work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I endorse all that has been said in praise of the Minister of State with whom I have worked in a variety of areas for several years.  I am delighted that she has been given this portfolio because she showed remarkable commitment and dedication during her time in opposition in this area.  She now brings that body of expertise to her new portfolio.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that there has been praise on all sides of the House for the former Minister of State, Mr. John Moloney.  It is particularly gratifying for those of us on this side of the house.</P>
        <P>I could not help but reflect on the vagaries of the democratic system in that the tsunami that swept over Fianna F&aacute;il in the last election swept away people of the highest calibre and integrity, of whom Deputy Moloney was one.  It is somewhat ironic in a way how cruel the public can be in regard to a Minister of State who had worked exceptionally hard and himself had a vision in initiating and implementing A Vision for Change, as Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, graciously acknowledged.  Despite or in spite of the economic woes that were beginning to descend on the country from 2008 onwards, he managed single mindedly and determinedly to ensure the A Vision for Change recommendations were implemented, in so far as he could do so, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has pledged herself to continue that.</P>
        <P>While that may sound like sour grapes, I do not mean it to sound like that.  I simply mean it is sometimes a sad by-product of the democratic system that this happens to good people &mdash; this applies to all parties in all elections.  However, to use that awful clich&eacute;, we are where we are.</P><Col N="605"/>
        <P>I want to focus on two particular aspects that are of personal interest to me and of which the Minister of State will be aware from our informal discussions since she was appointed.  I note in her contribution she refers to the fact that the Office for Disability and Mental Health is participating in the development by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government of a housing strategy for people with disabilities which will have a particular emphasis on the housing needs of people with mental health difficulties.  The former Minister of State, Mr. Jimmy Devins, initiated a process in discussions with the Prader-Willi association here in Ireland.  Our daughter, Siobhan, is a Prader-Willi sufferer and, indeed, Senator Mary Moran has a son who is also a Prader-Willi sufferer, so we have a common bond in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Prader-Willi syndrome is a unique and somewhat unknown condition.  It is effectively a deletion of chromosome 15, which affects the capacity of those who suffer to be aware of when they are full.  To put it bluntly, an American reference to the condition is that Prader-Willi syndrome sufferers are permanently hungry and, consequently, a great deal of stress is brought about in ensuring the sufferer does not eat themselves to death, which is quite possible if they were allowed to eat unchecked.  There are other aspects to the condition, such as behavioural problems and other physical problems.  It is so variable, in fact, that there is no one-size-fits-all type, as with other chromosome deletions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As with many other conditions where people are mildly mentally and physically handicapped, it is a mild form of disability &mdash; it is reckoned to be about 5% disability &mdash; but, nonetheless, the sufferers have special needs, to put it bluntly.  Therefore, there is a need for respite care.  To be fair to the HSE, it has gone out of its way to ensure respite is provided.  I cannot but have the highest of praise for the HSE in the north west.  Siobhan is now 21 and from the time she was born and we began relying on State services, they have risen to that challenge admirably.</P>
        <P>It is rather sad that one of the aspects of the discussions I had with Mr. John Moloney and Mr. Jimmy Devins, and, briefly, with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was that a recommendation was made as a result of discussions that were taking place between the health services and parents.  My wife was involved in these discussions.  The Department of Health and Children, the HSE and Mr. John Moloney, as the then Minister of State, had agreed in principle that a residential care centre would be provided somewhere in the midlands that would be of benefit to those outside of Dublin.  There is currently a HSE-funded residential care centre in Dublin for adult Prader-Willi sufferers, which has six permanent places, but these places are so permanent that it is unlikely there will be vacancies.  It was agreed there should be a similar residence somewhere outside Dublin, and the former Minster of State, Mr. Moloney, had advanced this considerably.</P>
        <P>All I am doing here is making a plea on behalf of parents of Prader-Willi sufferers that the Minister of State would look at the files and perhaps come back to the House at some other time, perhaps on an Adjournment matter, to indicate how far advanced the proposal is.  It had certainly gone beyond the point of discussion and it had actually been agreed in principle that this would be implemented.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State in her very busy portfolio would consider this aspect.  I wish her well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I am confident she is an inspirational lady and, if I can be flaith&uacute;lach, she is charismatic.  My 40 year old daughter, my only child, always said that Deputy Lynch, during her time as a Deputy, was the most charismatic person on television.  That is the greatest compliment I could give her.  My husband concurs.  He saw Deputy Lynch on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; recently and said to me: &ldquo;I always told you how brilliant she was.&rdquo;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There are so few ladies here, we really have to stick together.  I want to highlight some points about the document I produced in 2008 concerning what we can do about suicide in the new Ireland.  It is still very much an issue that is taboo, no matter what we say.  I prepared my document as a lay person.  I held public meetings in the city here and spoke to parents and family members of those, young and old, who have died by suicide.</P>
        <P>There are three elements, which it has been proven internationally in the most up-to-date academic work, that can act to reduce the incidence of suicide.  One is alcohol consumption.  There is no doubt that we in this country are too free and easy about alcohol.  The problem goes on and on but we do not address it.  Nearly half of those who die from suicide have alcohol in their blood.  That does not mean they drank themselves to death but if they were feeling depressed or overwhelmed by economic problems, which are rampant during this time of economic recession, alcohol would mean they could not have thought rationally or thought of how they could get out of a situation.</P>
        <P>We need a national campaign of awareness because we are too liberal with alcohol.  As I have said many times, while I am not against alcohol consumption, just walking around a supermarket here or in the North, one can see the prevalence of tins of beer, full trolleys and so on.  I have no doubt the consumption of alcohol is a huge part of the prevalence of mental illness and affects general mental health, quite apart from death from suicide.</P>
        <P>One way of reducing alcohol consumption, which has been proven internationally, is to ensure GPs are trained up to modern, best-in-the-class standards in regard to identifying depression when they see it, and are up to date on how they treat it, whether through counselling, medication or otherwise.  Having spoken to parents whose child died from suicide, I know their GPs often told them their teenager would grow out of it.  The incidence of suicide is quite flat until children reach the age of 17 or 18 and it then rises very fast, especially among young men, who are four times more likely to die from suicide than women.  Parents told me that their doctors told them their child would grow out of this depression, yet they died from suicide.  That has been my experience from these meetings.</P>
        <P>A second element is the restriction of access to lethal means.  We have talked in this Chamber over the years of how unfair the waiting list is for children with mental problems who cannot afford counselling.  I pushed in the House for the health service throughout the country to have a plan for each health service area in order that children who cannot afford it could access counselling.  Hundreds of depressed children are waiting for help, and even children of ten or 12 years may be suicidal.  We need to achieve delivery on this in order that we can get rid of the waiting list for children awaiting counselling, which would help them to stabilise and improve their cognitive skills.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all feel in bad form now and again, and I am still not feeling great over our post-election trauma.  I am still quite upset.  I have just come from a committee.  It is very frustrating being in opposition.  At that committee this morning with representatives from the Assembly and Westminster and Seanad colleagues, I was reassured something will happen that I can get stuck into.  It was great when we had our parliamentary party meetings with the Taoiseach.</P>

	<P>It is good to see we can still have a bit of banter.  I thank all the Senators who contributed.  This was the sort of debate I hoped we would have, with individual issues raised but it was on the generalisation of mental ill health and how we deal with it.</P><Col N="607"/>
        <P>After listening to Senator Norris&rsquo;s contribution, I am reminded of Ivor Brown&rsquo;s paper on the great illusion, which asked if it is an illness at all.  We could go along with the theory that illnesses are usually caused by probably something germ related when we look at it.  I am not certain that we know everything about this issue, and I am sure we will continue to learn and to see it develop.</P>
        <P>Senator Gilroy asked about ECT and I am aware of it.  Senator Norris mentioned the Bill introduced by the Green Party and Independents and it was agreed by everyone, including me, that forced ECT would no longer be part of what we offered and that will be put into legislation.  That is all I can say about that now.  We were all agreed that forced ECT was not the way to go.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Brien mentioned the unit in St. Ita&rsquo;s.  It had conditions attached to it by the Mental Health Commission, which asked that it would be closed by 31 August.  It was also recommended a different part of the building be refurbished to provide a service until the Beaumont unit came on stream.  That did not happen but the HSE assures me that access to appropriate acute mental health services will be in place until the Beaumont unit comes on stream.  We can talk about that later.  I am also told the unit in Beaumont will take approximately 12 months; therefore, that might be the gap.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not have the information Senator Crown requested but I am told we made a submission to the World Health Organization recently where all the statistical data were put in and the WHO will come back to us.  That will give us a huge amount of comparative information that we need to take seriously.  Senator Cullinane raised the issue of an all-Ireland approach.  We have an all-Ireland approach on suicide and training registration for self-harm.  That co-operation is ongoing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What can I say about the Brothers of Charity services in Clare?  They are excellent.  I know the organisation and it is incredible with a different way of doing things, a different way of thinking and a different approach to what we should do across all of the services.  I am surprised to hear there is a difficulty on the rental issue because we have a housing statement that has gone to Government and is now in the wider community.  It is clearly directed towards dealing with people in the community who have mental health problems.  I include in that, people with disabilities who have mental health difficulties because they do not live in a separate space from the rest of us.  They equally have issues that must be dealt with.  I will take that up with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>
        <P>No health structure can ever be based on the vagaries of the property market; to do that is to build a house on sand.  To depend on how much money is in the country and how foolish people are, does not provide a proper structure and it will not work.  If there is a bubble, there will be enormous amounts of money we might not have the capacity to put into the system and, when the bubble bursts, we will be left with a system that has capacity but no money.  We cannot operate like that; it must be a steady, well thought out, planned approach.  I hope that is what we have now, coming down from the heady days when we had more money than capacity.  I hope that is where that will go.</P>
        <P>Fear is as big an issue as stigma and maybe it is bigger.  Fear brings about the stigma.  Fear of poor mental health is probably what gives it the stigma.  We are all conscious that we are vulnerable to poor mental health.  We could all end up in that position.  It is the fear of it that keeps us at arm&rsquo;s length and makes us worry about people in those circumstances.</P>
        <P>We have a big issue with staff.  In nursing for mental health there is an older age profile who can retire at a younger age.  That leads to problems.  Our problems will be compounded next year.  Senator Mullins said that next year we have the possibility of 1,200 people who could retire if they wanted.  I have no doubt that they will retire because it is a difficult job.  If all of those who can retire next year do retire, we have a big problem but it is solvable.  I pay tribute to Mr. John Maloney and his efforts on A Vision for Change; circumstances overtook him but that does not take away from his commitment or the great things he did.  He got a breach in the moratorium last <Col N="608"/>year and gave us an additional 100 nurses.  There was another breach this year that gave us another 100 nurses.  That will not be enough in the years to come.  We will need additional posts.  I am reluctant to say it but I need to say it; to a great extent in the circumstances in which we find ourselves in the next few years, if we can get the breach and the 300 additional posts per year, maybe people coming from a different sector of the service might not be a bad thing because we need a different skill mix if we are to go into the community.  We must be able to provide within the community people who probably come from a different culture, and I say that with all due respect, because we must deliver a different type of service in the community.  It is good that we are cutting down on admissions and the length of people&rsquo;s hospital stays, but we must consider the fact that we will always need acute beds.  The flexibility provided by A Vision for Change is important.  I am uncertain as to whether we know the exact number of acute beds we will need or by how much that number will change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all know what the position is on funding.  I will not trot out the usual comments about where the country is, but we are definitely not as flush as we used to be.  We will need to do things differently, but this does not mean that we will not be able to provide a better level of care in the main.  We can do this by changing how we do things, including our skill mix, and by providing services in different areas.</P>

	<P>Not everyone who requires support needs to attend a high-tech clinic.  Perhaps people need to stay in their homes and receive telephone calls or postcards.  Perhaps it is just about keeping in touch.</P>
        <P>When it comes to suicide, to a great extent people want to be treated with kindness, respect and dignity.  I hear this every day.  We are too wedded to the medical model when it comes to mental health.  Senator White was correct about education, in that we can educate general practitioners, GPs, community workers and social workers to make them realise when someone has a difficulty.  Most GPs know that the majority of people presenting to them are doing so for reasons other than the ones they give.  We need to get GPs to recognise when this is the case.  However, if a GP&rsquo;s only possible course of action is to prescribe an anti-depressant or to send someone to the local psychiatric unit, people are not encouraged to present.  We should focus on the piece in the middle, namely, primary care teams, whereby GPs will be able to send someone next door to a psychiatrist, social worker or counsellor if someone presents with a difficulty.  A person needs to be able to tap into those services.  It could be easily done.  An entire unit in the Department of Health is telling people that the Department will provide an investment of &euro;4 million if the recipients make savings of &euro;8 million while supplying a better service by providing it differently.  We will need acute beds but, if we move the bulk of our services from large institutions into communities, not only will there be a saving, there will also be a better way of doing things.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Most people who approach a GP, community nurse or Member want a listening ear and someone to put his or her arms around them and ask whether there is a problem.  Where people with eating disorders are concerned, our first port of call is foraging for beds for them.  We must stop doing that.  We should be able to intervene with people at an earlier stage to stop such embedded behaviour from developing.  We can do it.  I feel like President Obama.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, is welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is welcome and I thank him for attending to take what is my first Adjournment motion in the Seanad.  I will declare an interest, as St. Sylvester&rsquo;s infant school in Malahide was my first school.  I attended it when I was a kid and have had a long association with it.  When I started junior infants in 1978, it was in a prefab.  The former Government must take responsibility for the fact that 50% of the school&rsquo;s pupils are still being taught in prefabricated buildings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I tabled this motion to be updated on the extension&rsquo;s progress, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, received a letter a number of days ago.  If I may, I will relate the relevant points.  On 16 June, a letter, entitled &ldquo;The health and safety dangers of our prefabs&rdquo;, was written.  A further letter, dated 10 July, told of how a professional investigation had resulted in one of the school&rsquo;s prefabs, room 15, being condemned with immediate closure.  The engineering report confirmed that, as suspected, the flooring had disintegrated.  The report was attached to the documentation.  It recommended that all entrances and lobbies be replaced immediately to maintain safe access to and egress from classrooms.</P>
        <P>Indications are that the failures are systemic.  In the prefabs, the engineers have recommended that all toilets should not be used until such time as all floors are replaced, leaving 150 infants without toilets.  The chair of the board of management states that this is a matter of extreme urgency, as 150 infants are due to return to school on Wednesday, 31 August.  Under the present circumstances, the school cannot permit them safe access to the prefabs.</P>
        <P>The issue of the extension is twofold and the Minister of State will encounter similar matters in his role.  I lobbied against the purchase of the prefabs, but the Department went against the recommendations of the school&rsquo;s board of management.  Like other public representatives, I have letters on file.  The prefabs are in bits, but they are now the responsibility of the board because the Department went ahead and purchased them.  The board has no money to carry out the necessary work.  NTW is the consultant engineering company.  Ironically, the Department purchased the prefabs under the better value for money scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will funding be provided for the school to replace or make good the prefabs?  It is one of the country&rsquo;s few infant schools.  Some 150 pupils will not be able to go to school on 31 August.  Does the Minister of State have an update?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am replying to this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  I thank Senator O&rsquo;Brien for raising this matter, as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the Seanad the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and the current position on St. Sylvester&rsquo;s infant school, Malahide, County Dublin.</P><Col N="610"/>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, the school authority submitted an application for major capital funding for an extension and refurbishment project.  As part of the assessment process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  A building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  The project for St. Sylvester&rsquo;s infant school has been assigned a band rating of 2.4.  The progression of all large-scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase is contingent on the availability of funding within the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme and the competing demands for this funding.</P>
        <P>In the case of the temporary accommodation in St. Sylvester&rsquo;s infants national school, the Department carried out a technical inspection of the accommodation concerned in October 2010 as part of an overall review of temporary accommodation in schools throughout the country.  The accommodation concerned was found to be in good condition and well maintained.  Subsequently, it was determined that better value for money could be achieved by purchasing the rented units at the school rather than continuing with their rental.  As the Senator advised, the Department has received correspondence this week from the school advising of a deterioration in the rented units.  In light of this correspondence, the Department will be contacting the school to arrange a further technical visit to examine the accommodation concerned.  The school authorities have been advised that the purchase of the accommodation does not affect the progress of the school&rsquo;s major capital application for permanent accommodation which will continue to be considered under the school building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator again for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position on St Sylvester&rsquo;s junior national school in Malahide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I neglected to congratulate him on his appointment but I believe I did so on radio on the day of his appointment.</P>
        <P>I advise the Minister of State, and this should be borne in mind for future school assessments, that the technical assessment carried out on this school was a joke.  I have pictures, which I will give the Minister of State, that show the condition of the floors in the classrooms and the toilets.  The inspection carried out in this school and in other schools, of which I am aware, was simply a visual one.  I welcome very much the fact that the Department will contact the school as a matter of urgency.  The school authorities&rsquo; insurance company has been informed of the position.  The 150 junior infants at the school will not be able to use the classes concerned when they return to school on 31 August.  We will deal separately on another occasion with the extension works to the school and I will continue to lobby on behalf of the school to improve the band rating.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Department the extreme urgency of these works and I will give him the independent report.  I thank him for his attention to this matter.</P>
