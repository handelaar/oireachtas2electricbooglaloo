	<P>I have received notice from Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to clarify the reason Meadhbh McGivern was unable to travel to London for a liver transplant and the steps that will be taken to ensure a similar situation will not arise in the future.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator C&aacute;it Keane of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to outline the mechanisms that will be used to advance different mechanisms to promote the recognition of Irish sign language; the timeframe expected in order to complete the examination; and the implementation of proposals in order to ensure that ISL is recognised in Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to outline if it is proposed to provide a permanent structure by way of an extension at Kealkill national school, Kealkill, Bantry, County Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Mooney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to consider including Mandarin Chinese on the junior certificate and leaving certificate syllabi in view of the growing economic and cultural relationship between Ireland and China.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Terry Leyden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to honour his pre-election commitments to ensure the continuation of the existing 24 hour, seven day a week accident and emergency service at Roscommon County Hospital.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kathryn Reilly of the following matter:</P><Col N="174"/>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to provide an update on the investigation into fraud at NCT centres and to outline what has been done to ensure that no car passes the NCT fraudulently.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator David Cullinane of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to provide funding as a matter of urgency to remediate the pier at Helvick, County Waterford.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators O&rsquo;Keeffe, Keane, O&rsquo;Donovan, Mooney, Leyden, Reilly and Cullinane as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators O&rsquo;Keeffe, Keane, O&rsquo;Donovan and Mooney and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Conway as it is a matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 1, motion to amend the order of the Seanad of 16 June 2011 in respect of the establishment of a select committee to include the Department of the Taoiseach under the remit of the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, to be taken without debate; No. 2, the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 5.45 p.m.; and No. 3, statements on food safety, to commence at 5.45 p.m. and conclude not later than 7.45 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed six minutes, and the Minister or the Minister of State to be called on to reply not later than 7.40 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for outlining the Order of Business.  In regard to the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, a number of amendments have been tabled from our side of the House and from other Senators.  I ask Senators to take a detailed look at these as I believe they will strengthen the Bill.  Our justice spokesperson, Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan, will propose a number of my party&rsquo;s amendments.</P>
        <P>On other issues, I welcome the report of the independent review group on the national children&rsquo;s hospital and that the group has effectively confirmed the decision of the McKinsey report of 2005, namely, that the Mater Hospital site is suitable for this hospital, contrary to many remarks made by the current Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, while in opposition.  In that vein, and on foot of the independent review board&rsquo;s report, with minor amendments as proposed, will the Government &mdash; and the Minister for Health &mdash; confirm that the Mater site is suitable, reaffirm and commit that the new national children&rsquo;s hospital will be opened in 2015, that the funding for it, which is part of the capital envelope in the four year plan agreed with the troika, is ring-fenced and will be used to build the hospital, and that the Government will move very quickly to lodge a planning application for the Mater site to ensure this hospital will be open in 2015?  Every Member of the House will agree with what is proposed, namely, that the new national children&rsquo;s hospital is the way forward with its 445 beds and, most important, that 392 of those beds are single room beds that will allow dealing with <Col N="175"/>and assistance for children who are badly in need of medical care.  It is important that this Government reaffirm its commitment to the planned hospital, accept the findings of the independent review and push forward and reconfirm its commitment to having the hospital open in 2015.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister for Transport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, come to the House to discuss the issue of regional airports, particularly in regard to Galway and Sligo airports over which closure orders are effectively dangling?  I ask this in the context that the Minister was able to find, in the space of 24 hours and on foot of community protests, &euro;1 million to ensure that a train station in Ongar, in his constituency of Dublin West is opened.  If the Minister can find &euro;1 million to open a train station in his constituency, which is well served by public transport, surely to God he can find the resources to ensure that Galway and Sligo airports remain open and that the Government will confirm to the electorate the commitments it gave during the general election campaign to ensure regional airports stayed open and operational.  If the Minister is able to find &euro;1 million for his own constituency, it is crucially important that he find &euro;5 million for Sligo and Galway airports.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator O&rsquo;Brien, I welcome the report from the independent body that looked at the siting of the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  Many concerns have been expressed about the way in which the decision to locate the hospital on the Mater Hospital site was taken originally. I was among the many who had misgivings about the decision, validly, I believe.  People were concerned the decision had been taken for the wrong reasons at that time. It is good now to see another report confirming this to be the right siting.</P>

	<P>The Senator might say &ldquo;sorry&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator O&rsquo;Brien noted, we now need to know there will be commitment to open the hospital by 2015. This is very much contingent on funding, as we all know.  The original plan had envisaged a substantial amount of funding would be sourced from private benefactors but there is a large question mark over that now, quite apart from the issue of Government funding.</P>
        <P>In the context of the children&rsquo;s hospital, I pay tribute to TG4 which broadcast a remarkable documentary about Dr. Kathleen Lynn some weeks ago.  Much of the programme was devoted to the difficulty she had in establishing a children&rsquo;s hospital according to enlightened and progressive principles many decades ago.  It is unfortunate that we have had such a protracted debate over the siting of the new and much needed national children&rsquo;s hospital.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on children&rsquo;s rights.  We have talked previously about the children&rsquo;s rights referendum.  It would be useful to have the Minister for Children in the House to hear more about the proposed timeframe for the referendum.  We had national play day on Sunday and one of the rights recognised in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is the right of children to play.  It is hugely important in every culture and is one of the things we should examine in the context of the wording of a children&rsquo;s rights referendum.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Senator Martin McAleese who has been appointed by the Government to chair the inquiry into the Magdalene laundries.  That is a worthy appointment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s calls for a discussion on a children&rsquo;s rights referendum but we must discuss the supporting legislation that is needed, in particular, the heads of Bills and the policy intent of such a referendum.</P>
        <P>I refer to the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union in 2013.  Today is the first working day of the Polish Presidency which started on 1 July.  It is the first part of what is called a trio presidency programme of Poland, Denmark and Cyprus .  Under the Lisbon treaty we now have team presidencies that put forward an 18 month programme, and Ireland will be the first part of the next trio presidency which starts on 1 January 2013.  We will be joined with Lithuania and Greece.</P>
        <P>That date of 1 January 2013 will also coincide with the 40th anniversary of Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the EU.  I raise this matter because the thinking and discussions on the priorities and work programme of Ireland&rsquo;s presidency programme are already under way and I believe this House has a role to play in informing and shaping our role in the EU and our role during the presidency.  It is an opportunity for us to rebuild Ireland&rsquo;s reputation both on the European and the world stage.  I note that an interdepartmental committee is already established.  It met in April and is already examining the priorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to ensure that we play a role in informing the setting of Ireland&rsquo;s priorities during its presidency of the EU.  Regarding some of the major issues, when the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, was here we discussed the seven year multi-annual financial framework programme which is due to be finalised at the end of 2012 during the Danish Presidency.  It is far more likely, however, and all the indications are that it will be left to Ireland to finalise that extremely important funding programme.  We also have the Horizon 2020, which is the big research programme due to start in 2014.  Of particular importance to Ireland is the Common Agricultural Policy, which comes to an end in 2013, and, therefore, European agricultural reform will be a big part of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency.  They are big issues in which this House must play a role in terms of setting the agenda.  I ask the Leader to ensure that time is given for that discussion over the coming months because we must agree this programme with the other two countries within our trio and agree our programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Recently, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport announced that he will decide by the end of September on joining the two Luas lines and on the metro to the airport and Swords and that this would be published as part of the national development plan.  I ask the Leader to communicate to the Minister that he should separate the two issues and discuss the Luas-metro issue here.  We should beware preparing a national development plan by the end of September given that the last one to run until 2013 was sub-titled, A Better Quality of Life for All.  We will be about 40% short of the incomes the last NDP planned for.  It was a programme twice the EU average and in view of the difficulties we have got into since, that may have been a bad idea.  There is a lack of quantification, a lack of economics in Departments, a view that it was captured by interest groups and that it was too expensive.  There is no urgency in preparing a national development plan by the end of September and, therefore, I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to address the Luas and metro issue separately and that drafts of the national development plan might be sent here first rather that we being presented with a fait accompli on 30 September.</P>

	<P>Last Saturday evening the McGivern family in County Leitrim got the call they were eagerly awaiting for their daughter Maedhbh.

      <Speaker pid="ImeldaHenry"><NameTxt>Senator Imelda Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister for Health comes to the House &mdash; I believe it will be very soon &mdash; I want him to address this subject.

	<P>On one of my first occasions to speak in this House, we were debating the motion on the Smithwick tribunal.  It is the case that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, misled the House on that occasion by withholding correspondence.  It was, I understand, published subsequently, at the suggestion of the judge in the case.  The information on this very serious matter was not available to us on the night of the debate.</P>
        <P>In his statement to the Seanad, the Minister stated: &ldquo;There has been some misreporting surrounding the reasons for putting forward this motion.  Its purpose is not to curtail, impede, confine or interfere with the independence of the tribunal.&rdquo;  In spite of his having said this, the Minister had received correspondence from Mr. Justice Smithwick some days earlier stating: &ldquo;I see this as a wholly inappropriate attempt by the executive to interfere with the independence of my tribunal.&rdquo;  I did not even make that charge in my speech, nor did I go as far as the judge, yet the Minister said my &ldquo;hysterical and grossly distorted misrepresentation of the Government&rsquo;s position and of the motion before this House is to no benefit of this State or his party&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Shame on him for not telling us about this correspondence in the House.  He came here to address a very serious matter of public concern, a serious matter of British-Irish relations concerning families and individuals, and did not tell us about what a judge had told him in correspondence.  The judge suggested this should be made public and that he had no objection to that.  The Minister, if he is not going to resign over this, should be brought into the House as soon as possible to explain to the Seanad why the correspondence was not put before us.  It is an absolute disgrace, particularly because of the comments he made about me and my party.  God knows what he is saying about the judge.</P>

	<P>I welcome Team Ireland home from the Special Olympics World Games in Athens.  The team members, who arrived in Dublin Airport today at 12.30 p.m., made a really successful contribution to the games.  I congratulate the 126 athletes, who between them won 107 medals.  Many of the athletes recorded personal bests.  I ask the Leader to ensure that we continue to support the Team Ireland athletes and their families.  I thank them for representing our country so well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As the person who raised the question of the Mater hospital and the establishment of an international peer review group some years ago, I very much welcome what has happened in this regard, although I had reservations about the site.  It is important that the project proceed straight away.  The children cannot wait.  In light of the contribution <Col N="178"/>by my distinguished colleague, Senator Sean Barrett, I contend the project will have implications for the metro.  As I understand it, the metro is an integral part of the development at the hospital.  I am not sure the hospital would work as efficiently as one would wish without development of the metro.  It is important that we discuss this problem also.  I important that it be an investment in building.  The site is on the north side of Dublin and I certainly welcome the project from a human point of view.</P>
        <P>I have received correspondence from a former academic colleague who engaged in civil partnership.  He did so in the British embassy in Dublin under British law.  He communicated with the various authorities, both British and Irish, to ascertain his status and whether it was recognised under the new legislation.  He was first told it was, then told it was not and thereafter told something totally different.  In his final sentence he describes how having been unpartnered, then partnered and then both on the same day, he feels very close to despair.  I understand we will deal with some of the matters consequent on the passage of the civil partnership Bill, particularly the economic conditions.  This was a commitment I received from the previous Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan.  I am very glad it is coming to the House.  Will the Leader inquire whether these other anomalies that exist and disadvantage people who are already in partnerships entered into in other countries or in the embassies of foreign countries in Ireland can be addressed and rectified at the same time?</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to make a statement to the House on the administrative centres of the proposed new VECs clarifying from where each VEC will be administered and what will happen to the present VEC offices.  Some of the proposed changes involve amalgamating the VECs of two counties.  A VEC may own offices in one county.  Will this be the administrative centre or might it be in leased properties in the other county?  If the administrative centre will be in leased properties, what will happen to the VEC offices which are owned?  Will they be let or sold?  Will some staff from each county be retained?</P>

	<P>I also want to pay tribute to all of those in Waterford who were part of the tall ships event.  It was one of the best festivals which took place in the State over many years and has set a benchmark for the future.  Hundreds of thousands of people were on the quays in Waterford and a huge effort went into organising and planning the event.  I commend all of the volunteers, staff, management and local councillors and all of those who were supportive of the event and who attended it.</P><Col N="179"/>
        <P>Two years ago, the only Irish sail training ship, the <i>Asgard II</i>, sank.  As an island nation with maritime history, we have no sail training programme in the State or on the island.  It is an issue that could be addressed by the House through all-Ireland North-South co-operation.  The First Minister and Deputy First Minister are to come before the House and this is an issue on which we should work on an all-Ireland basis.  Many young children who took part in the sail training programmes on the <i>Asgard II</i> experienced a life-changing event.  This matter should be re-examined and the programme reinstated.</P>
        <P>I restate our intent to have the Minister for Health come before the House to discuss issues which are of concern not only to Members of the House but also to those outside the House.  The Minister will be in the House for seven hours this week to discuss legislation.  This is fair enough but there is a plethora of health issues including the potential closure of accident and emergency departments in a number of hospitals, a shortage of junior doctors and nurses and a general crisis in health services.  We want to have discussions on these with the Minister for Health but we cannot.  However, he is coming to the House for seven hours to discuss legislation.  The issues to be discussed in the context of the legislation pale into insignificance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Special Olympics team, many of whom come from Donegal.  They have done the country and every county proud.  Every medal is a marvellous achievement and they won 107.  I join with other Members in congratulating them.</P>
        <P>I want to raise an issue which was front page news in the <i>Derry Journal</i> today, which is robberies in Inishowen &mdash; which has a population of 33,000 &mdash; in County Donegal over the past week and I call on the Minister for Justice and Equality to make a statement on the matter.  Around this time last year, eight people died in a tragic car crash on the peninsula.  In fairness to the authorities, a large number of garda&iacute; were mobilised in response to carry out speed checks.  When asked, garda&iacute; came out in force after the tragedy in question to monitor speed on the roads and set up checkpoints.  In light of the considerable local reaction to a number of robberies at the weekend and in previous weeks, will the Minister make a statement on the Garda resources available in Inishowen and the rest of County Donegal?  As I stated, the local news this morning focused on the fear people are experiencing in rural areas as well as towns where businesses have been broken into.  I do not know if the Garda believes the attacks are being carried out by a single gang but the break-ins seem to be targeted at obtaining cash.  I ask the Leader to request that the Minister make a statement on recent events in Inishowen.</P>

	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to allow the Minister for Health to come before the House to explain the position regarding the accident and emergency department in Roscommon County Hospital.  People in County Roscommon are in revolt because of the proposal to curtail the department from Monday next.  They will come to Dublin tomorrow to protest because the absence of an accident and emergency department will require people to travel a distance of as much as 125 km in emergencies.  This a matter of life or death.  I remind Fine Gael and Labour Party Senators that the first hour in an emergency is critical and the absence of a hospital means death.  As many as 15,000 people will travel from County Roscommon to Leinster House tomorrow when the D&aacute;il will discuss a Private Members&rsquo; motion on accident and emergency departments which will be tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in and supported by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.</P>
        <P>The former Minister of State, Mr. Michael Finneran, has made an important statement in which he hits out at the single, greatest crime perpetrated on the people of Roscommon by the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  People will die as a result of this decision.</P>

	<P>I do not believe Deputies Naughten or Feighan or Senator Kelly realise how serious this matter is.  It is a matter of life or death for people in County Roscommon.  The 14,000 people who attend the accident and emergency unit in Roscommon County Hospital every year do not have anywhere else to go as there is no room in the inn.  This was the greatest U-turn and betrayal perpetrated by any Government in the history of the State.</P>

	<P>Why does the HSE continue to operate as if it is an independent republic, even in the case of Roscommon County Hospital?

	<P>It is not unusual to learn that a black market thrives during a recession.  However, I heard about two cases last weekend that absolutely horrified me, where consultants in a midland hospital and a Dublin hospital are seeking cash payments from their patients.  Will the Leader bring this to the attention of the Minister for Health and ask him to issue a directive in this regard?  Obviously, patients are very vulnerable.  They wait a long time to get on a list and when they do they are glad to pay up.  However, this practice is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Finally, I learned this morning that Threshold has issued a good report on Galway city which indicates that almost 4,000 houses in the city are empty.  This phenomenon is not unique to Galway but occurs throughout the country.  It is a big issue and it is important that there be joined-up thinking on it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two useful statistics we should note from the 2010 report of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  The first is that the number of applicants granted refugee status has fallen to 1.1%, which equates to 24 persons granted refugee status.  The second notable statistic is that approximately &euro;1.2 million has been paid out in legal costs arising from judicial reviews of decisions that were settled or lost by the State.  Clearly, this points to a problem in our system of adjudication of applications for immigration and asylum.  The Irish Refugee Council has proposed that we establish a model immigration and protection tribunal, which would guarantee proper second scrutiny of applications not just for refugee status but also for visas, residency, citizenship and so forth.  It is also clear that we need a more robust first decision making stage if those statistics are the consequence.  If so few people are being granted refugee status, it raises a significant issue of concern, as does the amount of money being paid out in legal costs.  It would be useful to have the Minister for Justice and Equality address the House on his intentions in this area, particularly in the context of the forthcoming Bill.  It appears that structural renewal is needed in the adjudication of immigration matters.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I also wish to refer briefly to the memorandum sent by senior members of the Judiciary to the Office of the Attorney General regarding their concerns about judicial independence in the context of proposals to reduce judges&rsquo; pay.  I have spoken previously about this issue in the House and made the point that the concerns the Judiciary might have could be addressed somewhat by ensuring that in a situation where judicial pay is being reduced it would also be the case that the pay of senior officials, members of the Government and so forth would be reduced too.  The concerns of the Judiciary deserve to be taken seriously.  It is not just self interest but, as I said previously, there is a cherished tradition of judicial independence that must not be compromised.</P>
        <P>However, another issue that must be considered is the way in which judges are appointed.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board certainly does its work, but it remains a fact that the system of patronage surrounding the appointment of judges has not changed.  The fact remains that membership of certain political parties is no load, to say the least, when it comes to the making of appointments to the Judiciary, and appointment will depend on which Government is in power.  That is not to reflect on the quality of our judges.  They cherish their independence, once appointed.  However, we need to be looking at systems in other countries.</P>
        <P>I would like a debate on how we appoint our judges.  We need to reflect on the separation of powers in our country and in our institutions.  We also need to reflect on increasing the role of the Oireachtas in the scrutiny of judicial appointments.  Parliament should not be a fiefdom of the Executive.  Although we may not have experienced problems so far, we may do so in the future.  In reflecting on judicial independence, which we now have to do, we should also consider the manner in which we appoint members of the Judiciary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the Leader examine further the facts put before the House by Senator Healy Eames regarding hospital consultants, working on behalf of the State to save people&rsquo;s lives, seeking cash from patients? While the Leader is bringing that matter to the attention of the Minister for Health he might also ascertain from the Minister the progress he <Col N="183"/>has made in curtailing and reducing the cost of hospital consultants&rsquo; contracts to the State.  Has any progress been made in bringing down this cost? Consultants are paid massive amounts of money from the public purse.  Cost efficiencies could certainly be achieved there.  When the Minister for Health comes to the House, could he reflect on the progress made in this regard?</P>
        <P>A Chathaoirligh, given that you ruled my Adjournment matter regarding the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience and the competition to find the New 7 Wonders of Nature out of order, could the Leader ask Deputy Michael Ring, the Minister of State with responsibility for tourism, to find out what F&aacute;ilte Ireland is doing to promote the New 7 Wonders of Nature vote?  If the Cliffs of Moher become one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature it will be a major boost for tourism, not only in County Clare but throughout the country.  This competition has enormous status throughout the world and millions of visitors would be attracted to this country were the Cliffs of Moher to become one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature.  It is incumbent on the Government to prioritise this.</P>
        <P>The working group in Clare are completely frustrated by the lack of involvement by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport.  This is an urgent matter that needs the urgent attention of the Minister.  I ask the Leader to bring it to his attention.</P>

The games are a wonderful initiative.  The psychological benefits for the individuals taking part and for all around them cannot be counted in monetary terms.</P>

	<P>I have ruled on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>All I ask is that the Leader, having put the question to the Minister, would come back with some indication of what went wrong.  When the opportunity arises, which I hope it will sooner rather than later, I hope there will be a seamless transfer of Ms McGivern to the relevant hospital and that her family will not have to suffer what they have been grievously suffering over the last number of days.  I would very much like to have the person responsible named and shamed.  Some individual made the decision.  We do not have a culture of naming and shaming in this country.</P>
        <P>In light of the guillotining of the social welfare Bill last week, the opportunity to question the Minister about the sections covering the habitual residence rule did not arise.  However, I was delighted to read over the weekend that she has issued guidelines to all community welfare offices to ensure returning emigrants will not be discriminated against when they sign on legitimately for social welfare benefits.  Will the guidelines be circulated to Members in order that we have an idea of what they involve rather than us having to rely on newspaper reports?  It was a shame that those who contributed so much to this country but who had to leave because they had no option were being denied social welfare payments when they returned.  It was a <Col N="184"/>national scandal and I compliment the Minister on seeing fit to issue the guidelines, which are the result of the lobbying that has taken place in this regard both by Irish organisations working on behalf of emigrants in England and organisations here such as Crosscare Migrant Project FLAC.  I hope the Minister will give us an assurance that they will be adhered to and they will not be strictly enforced to ensure no returning emigrant will be denied the right that those of us living in the country enjoy.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to the House as soon as possible to discuss the free legal aid scheme?  This is one of the most abused schemes in the State.  It s being abused not only by criminals but also by the legal profession itself.  I was sickened when I saw a court report on the television news regarding an individual with 67 previous convictions who was afforded free legal aid.  The scheme should be amended.  If one has three strikes, one should be out because there is no incentive for criminals not to re-offend.  I would like the Minister to come to the House to tease out his thoughts on the abuse of the free legal aid scheme and changes to its delivery.</P>

	<P>If we are to get the economy right again, we will have to depend on small and medium-sized enterprises.  While they are not looking for help, they are looking for a fair deal.  I am concerned greatly by the figures published yesterday, which highlight that the State is delaying payments to small and medium enterprises for goods and services that should be paid within 30 days for an average of 73 days.  This is either policy or inefficiency.  Will the Leader follow this up with the Minister for Finance to find out whether it is the result of policy or inefficiency that the State is delaying payment to small and medium enterprises, the very people we have to rely on if we are going to get the economy right again, for up to 77 days and, on average, 73 days?  This is probably due to inefficiency but I would hate to think it is due to Government policy.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise an issue raised by Deputy Tom Fleming in the Lower House last week in connection with the payment of more than &euro;1 million to one particular consultant and other high payments of six-figure sums to others.  The answer given by the Minister for Health was far from satisfactory.  He said that while it would be inappropriate for any Minister to intervene directly in matters relating to prices, he had concerns about the level of claims, in particular, the cost of services being provided to and paid for by the VHI.</P>
        <P>Many people have opted out of health insurance because of the escalating cost.  The cost is a direct result of medical inflation in recent years, not least of which is the huge increase in salaries.  I suspect the particular individual was probably in receipt of another &euro;250,000 from the State if he was in the pay of the HSE for hospital work.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health to the House as a matter of urgency to debate the issue.  It is one thing to reduce the salaries of staff on modest incomes for the optics value but people who earn six and seven-figure sums are getting away with no account being taken of their earnings.  If the Minister will not intervene to correct the profiteering that is going on within a number of the professions, who will do it?  There is no other port of call for the matter to be corrected, other than the Minister.</P>
        <P>In reference to what Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen said, we all took note of the statement made by the judges over the weekend.  Judicial independence is paramount to the judicial and democratic system, but that does not imply that the Chief Justice should be paid &euro;130,000 a year more than the Chief Justice in the United States or that Supreme Court judges in this country should be paid &euro;100,000 more than their counterparts in the United States.  Everyone must put his or her shoulder to the wheel.  I call for the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to say what exactly he intends to do about the fairly scandalous situation of fees within the legal profession.</P>
        <P>I tabled a motion with a quarter of Senators in the previous Seanad on bringing the escalating cost of tribunals of inquiry to account.  I could not get a sufficient number of Seanad colleagues to bring the motion to the floor.  That is unacceptable.  We need to change that culture in the interests of people who are struggling to make ends meet.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise the Foreshore (Amendment) Bill which is before the House tomorrow.  The legislation was not published until yesterday evening.  That does not give appropriate time to scrutinise the Bill.  Rushing legislation without affording appropriate time for it to come before the House does not do justice to it or to the House.  A similar issue arose last week.  Perhaps the Leader could investigate the matter and ensure that legislation of this nature is not rushed into this House again.  As an Opposition spokesperson on agriculture, marine and food, I only found out this morning that a briefing had been organised by the Department yesterday evening, despite the fact that most rural Members of the House &mdash; and, indeed, of the D&aacute;il &mdash; tend to be in their areas or constituencies, rather than in Dublin, on Monday evenings.  I ask the Leader to make sure this does not happen again.</P><Col N="186"/>
        <P>The social welfare budget represents over 40% of State funding this year.  Currently, there are more than 33,000 appeals lodged with the social welfare appeals office, and many of these are taking between six and 12 months to determine.  This is totally unacceptable.  I am calling for an emergency debate on the operations of the social welfare appeals office.  It is unacceptable that any member of the public would have to wait for up to a year for a genuine appeal to be heard.  I have heard of a number of cases over the last 12 months in which applicants were refused supplementary welfare allowance while their cases were on appeal, yet when the appeal decision was made they were awarded social welfare entitlements.</P>
        <P>There are problems, as I understand it, due to the moving of community welfare officers from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection.  Less leniency is being shown by CWOs at a local level than when they were under the HSE.  This is a serious issue that is affecting more than 33,000 of our citizens.  I ask the Leader to convene a debate on the social welfare appeals office as quickly as possible.</P>

There is a long-established gaelscoil in the town of Loughrea, in my area, which is operating entirely out of prefabricated buildings.  In this day and age, this is not acceptable.

        <P>I ask the Leader for clarification with regard to the statements on food safety planned for later this afternoon.  Are these the statements on food labelling that were requested a few weeks back?  If so, I must voice my concerns at the fact that the Minister for Health will not be present for the debate.  Why is the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food attending this debate, given that the labelling issue falls under the Department of Health&rsquo;s remit?  If these statements will not include the issue of food labelling, when can we expect a debate on it, given <Col N="187"/>that the European Parliament will vote this week on a compromise text regarding nutritional and energy content of product labelling and country of origin food labelling?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister for Finance attend the House before the summer recess to clear up some issues relating to the budgetary process?

Exchequer returns show that one in every five euro of Government revenue is spent servicing our growing debt.

It will be very difficult to find millions of euro for every project.  There is also the question of ongoing costs at these airports, not just a once-off &euro;5 million payment.</P>

        <P>Senator Bacik called for a debate on the children&rsquo;s rights referendum.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has indicated she would be willing to attend the Seanad at an early point for such a debate.  All Members join with Senator Bacik&rsquo;s congratulations to Senator Martin McAleese on becoming the chairperson of the Magdalene laundries investigation.  He is a fitting person to deal with it and I wish him well in his task.</P>
        <P>Senator Jillian van Turnhout inquired of the preparations for Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency term in 2013.  I will arrange for the House to have ongoing debates on this matter and Europe over the next several months.  With the permission of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I intend to have the President of the European Parliament address the House next week.</P>
        <P>Senator Sean D. Barrett asked that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport would deal with the Luas and metro issues separately.  He also asked that the Minister would forward the drafts of the next national development plan to the House for debates on them rather than announcing that the plan has simply been decided.  I will raise this matter with the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Imelda Henry and several other Members raised the case of Maedhbh McGivern who lost her opportunity for a liver transplant due to a failure in transportation services.  As the Cathaoirleach said, the matter will be dealt with on the Adjournment.  The Minister for Health has expressed his deep concern and sympathy to the McGivern family over the traumatic events which led to the lost transplant opportunity.  He has ordered HIQA, the Health Information and Quality Authority, to deal with this matter as expeditiously as possible.  Every Member will agree the HIQA inquiry is essential in ensuring the McGivern family and others in similar predicaments do not face such heartbreaking outcomes in the future.</P>
        <P>Senator Byrne raised the issue of the Smithwick report.  The Minister has agreed to come into the House when the report is published and I am sure he will address the concerns outlined by Senator Byrne in that regard.  Senators Moran, Harte, Mooney, Mullins, Reilly, Cullinane and others mentioned the Special Olympics, a matter we dealt with last week.  I would like to <Col N="188"/>compliment all the participants, the coaches and the families involved.  The athletes are a great credit to their families, their counties and their country.  We would all like to join in congratulating each and every one of them.</P>

	<P>Senator Norris mentioned anomalies regarding the civil partnership legislation.  We hope these can be addressed through the Finance (No. 3) Bill which will come before the House in the next week or so.  Senator O&rsquo;Neill spoke about the VECs and Senator Mullins spoke about the administrative centres and called for a debate on education.  We will arrange for the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House in the next session for a wide-ranging debate on education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Cullinane mentioned the tall ships festival.  I had the pleasure of being in Waterford for the festival for a number of days and I join in congratulating the organising committee, the city manager, the Garda, the Civil Defence and everybody involved on what was a wonderful festival that hosted over 500,000 people in Waterford over the weekend.  With regard to <i>Asgard II</i> and the sail training programme, this is something that can and should be addressed on an all-Ireland basis.  As someone whose grandfather was a sea captain who sailed on three-masted schooners many moons ago, sailing is something very close to my heart.  I will raise the issue of sail training with the relevant Minister.</P>

        <P>Senator Leyden has put forward an amendment to the Order of Business but I do not propose to accept it.  He will have ample opportunity on Friday to deal with health matters when the Minister will be in the House for six or seven hours.  On the question of letters, there have been letters from the Minister.  However, I was reminded last week at a meeting held by the hospice in Waterford that it had letters from a former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, before the 2007 general election, promising a 20-bed hospice at Waterford Regional Hospital which has still not been delivered.  There was also a letter on the front page of local newspapers in Waterford prior to the 2011 general election insisting that the Waterford Institute of Technology would be upgraded immediately to university status.</P>

	<P>Senator Healy Eames made a serious allegation concerning consultants demanding cash from patients.  I hope she brings any evidence she has in that regard to the attention of the Minister for Health.  This is a serious allegation and I hope the evidence will be brought to the Minister as a matter of urgency.  We cannot allow such activity to occur in our hospitals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mullen raised the issues of the Refugees Appeals Tribunal, legal fees and judges' pay.  The Government is committed to a referendum on judges pay and it will go ahead.  With regard to how we appoint our judges, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board advises the Government on appointments to the Judiciary and does an excellent job in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Conway asked about F&aacute;ilte Ireland and its lack of involvement in the competition to find the New 7 Wonders of Nature.  This is a matter we can raise with the relevant Minister of State, Deputy Ring.  Senator Mooney referred to the guidelines for habitual residence.  We will arrange that the guidelines are circulated to all Members.  The point raised is valid.  Senator Sheahan raised the anomalies in free legal aid, a matter we will ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to address.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn mentioned delays in payments.  When he attended this Chamber a week ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, set limits for the payment of small and medium-sized enterprises by State bodies.  He said they were almost on target for 30 days and that he hoped it would be reduced to 15 days for all State bodies to pay suppliers.  I am concerned at a report that it was taking 73 days.  It is the intention of the Government that 30 days is the maximum and the Government intends to reduce this period.  It is unacceptable that State bodies contribute to small businesses going to the wall.  That is not the intention of the Government.  The Minister of State is chasing up that matter as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh called for a debate on fisheries.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will appear in the Chamber on 20 July.  Senator Walsh made reference to escalating costs and consultants&rsquo; pay.  The Minister for Health will be in the Chamber and Senator Walsh can address it with him then.  Senator Walsh has raised the matter of judicial pay and fees for legal practitioners on several occasions.  Regarding Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s contribution, I advised Members last week that we would have emergency legislation and that we would be dealing with the Foreshore Act and health legislation.  I do not like to have emergency legislation rushed through the House but the Government is publishing the Bills today and they will be introduced and passed by both Houses by Friday.</P>
        <P>Senator Michael Mullins referred to businesses passing on the VAT reduction.  I hope all businesses that have benefited from the VAT reduction pass on these reductions to the customer.  Regarding Senator Reilly&rsquo;s question, we will have the debate on food safety today and labelling comes into that.  The figures released yesterday are mainly on target.  If necessary, we will invite the Minister for Finance to the Chamber before the end of July.</P>

	<P>This amendment provides that section 39 of the Bill in relation to court matters will not require a commencement order.  It is likely that further amendments to section 1 will be required on Report Stage to ensure we include all provisions that do not require a commencement order.  This will be necessary as a number of further amendments are being contemplated in regard to existing Parts of the Bill, some of which I mentioned on Second Stage.  The amendments, many of which are technical, will concern the following: Part 4, the Private Security Services Act 2004, an amendment to its appeals board procedures; Part 6, the Equality Act 1998; Part 8, enforcement of maintenance <Col N="192"/>orders; Part 10, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, to provide a formal legal provision with regard to citizenship ceremonies; Part 10 relating to taxing masters, an increase in the proposed retirement age, as was raised by Senators during the debate on Second Stage; and Part 15 and miscellaneous where we will make a small technical amendment to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A number of courts related amendments concerning the charging of court fees, the operation of the High Court on circuit and the introduction of new provisions to allow for county registrars, where requested, to tax or settle a bill of costs between a solicitor and client in Circuit Court proceedings, arise under the courts legislation.  We will also insert a provision regarding fines in the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 and a text correction in the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.  There will also be a new Part dealing with issues relating to the handling of documents following the completion of a tribunal of inquiry.  Members will have the opportunity to consider and discuss these amendments on Report Stage.  This initial amendment is merely a technical amendment to the first section of the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>This section will permit the Legal Aid Board to grant legal advice to a person who is a victim of human trafficking in the context of an alleged trafficking offence or related offences.  This extension of legal aid is welcome but I understand that the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, hope that it might go further.  FLAC notes that the section does not extend a right to legal aid, which is the right of representation in court, to the victims of trafficking.  The bulk of the assistance offered is also confined to the very limited crime of trafficking.  Very few people in Ireland have been identified formally as such.  Finally, according to FLAC, the legal aid is available only with regard to matters connected with the commission of the offence or any other offence connected with the alleged trafficking offence.  Thus, it does not appear to include assistance or representation, as necessary, to help victims of trafficking with immigration or domestic problems or with seeking compensation from the wrongdoer.</P>
        <P>I am not familiar with this area but I hope I am outlining the concerns of FLAC correctly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator Quinn&rsquo;s concerns.  I welcome the Minister back to the House.  I also welcome the fact that legal aid is being extended to victims of trafficking but, like Senator Quinn, I am concerned about the extent of that legal aid.  Is it only legal advice that is being made available?  Is it only available for matters connected with the commission of the offence or any other offence connected with the alleged trafficking offence?  There are other issues on which those victims would require legal representation, such as domestic matters, immigration and so forth.  While I welcome the extension of the advice being made available, there is also the issue of the representation in court that victims would require.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister intend to protect those who do not fall within the definition of trafficked persons but who are still victims of the sex industry?  Surely they will also require representation.  Senator Quinn cited FLAC, which has noted that very few people in Ireland have been <Col N="193"/>identified as trafficked persons.  That is a concern, and we should pause and reflect on it.  Does the Department intend to deal with the fact that although the extension of legal advice applies to victims of trafficking it does not apply to victims of the sex industry generally?  I hope the Minister will reflect on that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support my colleagues on this issue.  The Minister would do well to note the concerns expressed by the Free Legal Aid Centres.  There are vulnerable people in society who may have language difficulties or be living in the most appalling circumstances.  I am sure the Minister will take account of the points made by Senators Quinn and Cullinane.  I add my voice of concern to the points they made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome what the Minister is proposing in the legislation, as a step in the right direction.  Legal advice in the area of trafficking is most important.  I share the concerns of others.  There should be more than legal advice.  Perhaps the Minister is planning to do something in that regard.  As recently as last weekend I dealt with a non-national who is the subject of severe domestic violence and who went to a solicitor, under the free legal aid scheme, for advice.  The person was told witnesses were required, even though there was significant medical evidence of violence.  I am working on this case and it is ongoing.</P>
        <P>The manner in which non-nationals engage with the legal system and with the free legal aid system is unsatisfactory.  Senator Cullinane made an important point about trafficking and the sex industry in general.  Further legislation will, possibly, be needed in this area.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>This provision is a big step forward.  I recall saying from the Opposition side of the D&aacute;il over a number of years that it was of crucial importance that victims of human trafficking should have access to legal assistance and advice.  The Bill puts this in statutory form in a manner that also allows us to comply with international obligations.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  The existing legal aid system does not exclude people from obtaining legal advice who qualify for it on other civil matters.  The legal aid system operated by the Legal Aid Board is, essentially, intended to provide legal assistance in the civil law area.  The Bill extends this into providing legal advice to those who are the victims of human trafficking so they are made fully aware of the law applicable, of the assistance they can give to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, of what will occur should a prosecution take place and of the court processes.</P>
        <P>The provision does not go beyond that.  We do not generally provide legal advice through Government law centres to all victims of criminal offences.  We do not have the resources to do that.  At a time when resources are stretched I am conducting a battle, as Minister, to try to ensure that adequate resources are available to the current law centres, which are substantially under-resourced since the budget of last December, introduced by the previous Government.  Our current difficulty in the law centres is as a consequence of the economic recession and the huge number unemployed, which is just below 450,000.  A substantial additional number of people are seeking legal aid in civil matters through law centres, particularly in the areas of family law and domestic violence.  In some law centres there is, unfortunately, a substantial delay in people getting access to legal advice because of the pressures the centres are under due to the lack of resources as a consequence of last year&rsquo;s budget and the huge additional numbers seeking assistance.  We are looking at how we can address that issue in a manner that ensures that people who need to gain access to civil legal aid do so.</P>
        <P>There are not sufficient resources to provide additional assistance through this legal aid scheme beyond what we are providing here.  This is a new and important right.  The Bill grants the right to victims of human trafficking who are co-operating with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to <Col N="194"/>obtain legal advice.  During the debate on Second Stage some Senators raised the issue of legal representation in the criminal courts during a prosecution that ensues as a result of human trafficking and I explained on that occasion that, under our criminal system, the DPP prosecutes on behalf of the State, the defendant is legally represented and, by and large, witnesses and victims are not represented.  I acknowledge that with regard to certain sexual offences, assistance by way of advice is given to victims but this is a separate and discrete area.  I do not have the capacity to extend this beyond what I am doing, but what I am doing is an important step forward and I hope Senators will support it.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 4</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) the purpose of benefiting the community;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a simple and straightforward amendment.  By and large, I support the thrust of the Bill.  The section states:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;voluntary work&rdquo; means any work or other activity that is carried out for any of the following purposes:</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) a charitable purpose within the meaning of the Charities Act 2009;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (<i>a</i>), the purpose of providing assistance, advice or care in an emergency or so as to prevent an emergency;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) the purpose of sport or recreation;</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendments provide for a further purpose, which is &ldquo;the purpose of benefitting the community&rdquo;.  Based on statistics from 1999, some 33% of the adult population was engaged in volunteering.  I hope the amendment will be accepted.  I referred to hill walking on the Sheep&rsquo;s Head Way on Second Stage but, for example, people volunteer to control traffic at agricultural shows, Macra na Feirme outings or local carnivals.  They wear jackets and they are assisted by members of Macra na Feirme or the IFA.  It is a form of volunteering in the community.</P>
        <P>I refer to the definitions of &ldquo;good Samaritan&rdquo; and &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo; in other countries such as Australia and America.  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Dermot Ahern, introduced this Bill and it goes a long way to address a major lacuna for the past number of decades.  I urge him to take an extra step to include these amendments to benefit the community as a gesture of respect to all those who work on behalf of the community.  The work of volunteers and community spirit have never been needed more because of the difficult economic climate in which we find ourselves.  These people work for free on behalf of the community to, for example, police GAA matches, local shows or Macra na Feirme events.  People may also be engaged in community work to raise funds for local cancer charities and GAA clubs.  If the Minister were to accept the amendment it would bolster the community spirit, the meitheal spirit, so to speak, that is so important in society today.  It was probably never more acutely needed than in the current situation.  The amendment is a simple one.  I will not labour the point at this stage, except to <Col N="195"/>say that the Minister could easily add paragraph (<i>d</i>) as it would bolster the Bill and add greater value to the legislation.  I hope the Minister will accede to my earnest request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose to discuss amendments Nos. 2 and 3 together.  I thank the Senator for proposing the amendment.  I disagree in principle with absolutely nothing he said.  Amendment No. 2 proposes to add a new subparagraph (<i>d</i>) to the provision which makes reference to the purposes of benefitting the community in the context of the definition of voluntary work.  I am advised that the amendments are not necessary because the definition of voluntary work in the new Part IVA of the Civil Liability Act 1961, as inserted by the Bill, means any work or other activity that is carried out for certain purposes.  The purposes include, by reference to the Charities Act 2009, a purpose that is of benefit to the community.  In section 3(1) of the Charities Act 2009 a charitable purpose includes &ldquo;any other purpose that is of benefit to the community&rdquo;.  Section 3(11) of the 2009 Act provides a long indicative list of activities deemed to be of benefit to the community.</P>
        <P>While I agree with the Senator that work done for the benefit of the community is clearly relevant to the definition of voluntary work for the purpose of the Bill, this in fact is already achieved in section 51A(1)(<i>a</i>) by the reference contained in it.  Repetition would not add anything to the Bill or be appropriate.</P>
        <P>With respect to amendment No. 3, again, I do not believe that the additional words proposed are required.  The new section 51G in the new Part IVA of the Act of 1961 requires that in proceedings relating to the liability of a volunteer organisation, a court is required to consider whether it would be just and reasonable to find that the organisation owed a duty of care, having regard to the social utility of the activities concerned.</P>
        <P>The benefit brought to the community by the activities of volunteer organisations clearly falls within the ambit of social utility.  I do not believe it would improve the Bill to insert the additional words.  If I was advised that the words proposed by the Senator were necessary I would without hesitation be willing to include them in the Bill but those matters are already addressed within the parameters of the Bill in the context of the proposed amendments to the law being made, as contained in it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the amendment being pressed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response but it is not patently obvious that my concern is addressed in other legislation and that it is so obvious as not to require the inclusion of the amendment.  I refer to the Latin maxim of interpretation, <i>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius</i>.  In that regard it would be safer to include the proposed paragraph as it would act in the manner of a belt and braces and avoid all doubt.  I understand where the Minister is coming from but the addition of the proposed small paragraph would give greater clarity to the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a measure that must be welcomed.  All one has to do is refer back to the previous winter or the one before that when people could not get out of their homes.  There was a certain reluctance on the part of some to spread the necessary grit outside of driveways for fear there would be an accident and they would end up being liable.  Therefore, I welcome the provision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I seek clarification from the Minister on one possible scenario.  If someone acting in the capacity of a good samaritan were to spread salt outside a commercial premises there would be a financial benefit because it would provide easier access for customers.  If that person does not receive any remuneration, and subsequently there is a problem, given the fact that it may not necessarily be regarded as a charitable act because somebody is going to benefit financially <Col N="196"/>from it, would he or she be covered?  This is something I would like clarified.  However, the overall thrust of what he is proposing is welcome.  Over the past decade and probably longer, it is increasingly the case that no matter what one does, even when trying to help people, one must look over one&rsquo;s shoulder.  Even a person who helps somebody to change a wheel at the side of the road, if he or she does it wrongly in some shape or form, could end up being liable if there is an accident afterwards.  I ask the Minister to clarify this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>On the latter issue, this is an area about which I am particularly concerned.  We had difficulties last winter when some people were worried that if they voluntarily cleared the paths outside their houses and someone later slipped there, they might be sued.  Some shopkeepers in retail outlets across the country were vigorous in trying to tidy up areas adjacent to their shops while others did nothing.  There was some confusion about where people stood legally in those circumstances.  In the context of this legislation, I want to be clear that it does not yet deal with that aspect.  It provides protection in situations in which a person who is working for an organisation engages in that sort of work, but it does not provide protection for individuals.  I have asked about this within the Department and it seems to be a more complex issue than those dealt with in the Bill; however, I have asked for work to be undertaken in this regard.  It is important that the law in this regard is clear.  In fact, I believe that under the current law, if one undertakes such works in good faith, employing a reasonable degree of common sense, it is very unlikely one will be held liable in the event of an accident.  Obviously, if one leaves a stack of ice in a location after moving it from point A to point B and someone slips on the hazard one has created, that is a different issue.</P>
        <P>We are considering whether we can add further to the Bill by addressing the particular issue raised.  I am not sure whether this can be addressed through the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in time to add it to this legislation; if not, it can be dealt with in a different Bill later in the year, not necessarily from the Department of Justice and Equality but from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We are investigating whether the issue can be dealt with during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the Seanad, but I do not think it will be possible.  If it proves possible, however, to deal with it on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, I intend to do so.  If I succeed, I may interrupt the Seanad&rsquo;s proceedings for a few minutes in the last week of July.  However, under this Bill, where an individual working for an organisation, such as the Red Cross or a local voluntary organisation, engages in works of that nature, he or she does have protection.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan made reference to the community.  As I have already said, the issue is properly addressed in the new section 51A of the Civil Liability Act 1961, in which voluntary work is said to mean</P>
        <P LI="1">any work or other activity that is carried out for any of the following purposes:</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) a charitable purpose within the meaning of the Charities Act 2009[.]</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have already made reference to the fact that charitable purposes are defined as something that is undertaken on behalf of the community.  I thank Senator O&rsquo;Donovan for raising the issue, but with regard to the terminology in which he partially addressed the matter, I respond by saying <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I urge the Minister to proceed, along with his officials, in finding a solution to the issue of individual liability.  For the last number of winters we have had inclement weather, and if the issue could be clarified in this Bill it would certainly give much comfort to persons who wish to act as good Samaritans in helping their neighbours.  The organisational <Col N="197"/>aspect is most welcome but I am sure the Minister sees my point on this.  The House would facilitate him in the last week of July if he wished to fast-track this.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 10, lines 24 to 26, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;is&rdquo; in line 24 down to and including &ldquo;equipment&rdquo;:&rdquo; in line 26 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;is amended&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>a</i>) by the substitution of the following for the definition of &ldquo;installer of security equipment&rdquo;:&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>These are technical amendments to section 2(1) of the Private Security Services Act 2004.  Amendment No. 4 is a drafting amendment to improve the layout of the section and was advised by the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 and paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) of amendment No. 7 replace the reference to &ldquo;for remuneration&rdquo; with &ldquo;in the course of a business, trade or profession&rdquo;.  This change in several existing definitions is necessary in light of the Private Security Authority&rsquo;s experience of regulating the private security industry.  It has shown the use of &ldquo;for remuneration&rdquo; has given rise to a loophole which has been exploited in some instances.  An example would be where an electrician may install an alarm for free but, instead, charge for the associated electrical wiring so as to get around the existing definition which mentions remuneration.  The amendments will counteract such a activity.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (<i>d</i>) of amendment No. 7 relates to the definition of &ldquo;security service&rdquo;, removing suppliers of security equipment from the regulatory framework.  The intention of the 2004 Act was not to regulate those selling electronic security equipment, such as alarms, etc., as they do not provide a security service.  This amendment corrects that position.  It remains open, however, to the Private Security Authority, as part of an investigation into the unlicensed installation of electrical security, to use its existing statutory powers to seek any information relevant to the investigation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his explanation of these amendments.  At first, I could not figure out what they related to but they seem reasonable and a reminder of the tricks someone can get up if he or she wants to get around legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Could this section be adapted to deal with the rise in unauthorised surveillance, particularly in light of certain media activities in the United Kingdom reported this morning?</P><Col N="198"/>
        <P>Will the Minister consider bringing debt collectors, who have a fairly appalling image and record, into the licensing system of the Private Security Authority to remove strong-arm merchants and thugs?  I realise I cannot expect an instant response at this point, but l put these questions forward to the Minister for consideration for the next date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The alleged scandalous conduct revealed by a certain newspaper in the United Kingdom would, under our legislation, fall under telecommunications legislation and would be dealt with in that context.  I will not pretend to be an expert in the law in those areas, but I understand that type of conduct, where a media outlet conducts itself in that fashion, may well give rise to criminal offences in this State, but it is an issue exterior to this legislation.</P>
        <P>The issue of debt collecting is another day&rsquo;s work.  It is important that those engaged in that area behave with responsibility and decency and do not engage in the type of activity the Senator mentioned.  Again, this does not fall within the ambit of the legislation with which we are dealing this afternoon.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Just a quick question to ask the Minister to tease out for me what exactly this section provides for.  This is a brief section and as far as I understand, it seems to <Col N="199"/>provide for the contracting out of inspections.  I am concerned by that because the inspection regime was introduced to deal with some unsavoury incidents.  I would be concerned by a contracting out of the sector.  We could take the NCT sector as an example.  A recent &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme demonstrated how some people could, effectively, buy their NCT certificate.  Therefore, there are issues with regard to the robust enforcement of these areas.  I hope there is sufficient robustness in the system provided for in this legislation to allow for this.  Does the section allow for the contracting out of inspections?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the section allows for the appointment of individuals as inspectors, subject to specific contractual conditions.  It would be for the authority to ensure compliance with those conditions and that there is proper compliance with the law.  That is the essential position.  For the Senator&rsquo;s information, the authority currently has four full-time inspectors who are appointed from within the authority&rsquo;s own staff.  The current working of the Act does not allow for the appointment of outside inspectors, but the amendment in section 7 will enable that to happen, if necessary.  The position with regard to the current wording of the Act is that it is unsatisfactory given the level of intimidation frequently faced by staff.  The need for specialist knowledge arises in certain circumstances.  The section allows for the contracting out of work, but it would be for the authority to ensure it was contracted to responsible people, that they do the work in an appropriate fashion and report back to the authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree it is an area where unsuitable staff working in the sector could have dire consequences?  I have had to deal with a number of people who were victims of security staff who worked, for example, for night clubs or bars.  It is an area in which we must ensure there is proper enforcement.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response, but I hope the system and the guidelines under which any outsourcing will operate are robust enough to ensure the staff are properly monitored.  That is necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree entirely with the Senator that all of those issues are issues of concern and importance.  We are all aware of unsavoury and unnecessary incidents that have occurred on occasion.  We have read about such incidents in court proceedings that have ensued.  There is a responsibility on the authority to ensure it deals with the inspections appropriately and that appropriate people are appointed.  Ultimately, it is desirable that those individuals who are recruited to act in a security context in any location, be it a nightclub or a public house, behave with both insight and responsibility.  It is an ongoing concern that we ensure that is the position.  In particular, as happens on occasion, we must ensure that there is not an unnecessary or ill-considered incident involving young people. </P>

        <P>Sections 8 to 12, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      
        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS</P>
        <P>Government amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 13, before section 13, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;13.&mdash;Section 37(1) of the Act of 2004 is amended by the substitution of &ldquo;A person shall not provide a security service insofar as this Act has come into operation as respects the security service concerned and shall not hold himself or herself out&rdquo; for &ldquo;A private security employer or an individual referred to in any of the paragraphs of the definition of &ldquo;security service&rdquo; in section 2(1) shall not, on or after the commencement of the paragraph concerned, provide a security service or hold himself or herself out.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="200"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>This amends section 37 of the Private Security Services Act 2004 and is proposed to deal with the prohibition of an unlicensed security service.  This section requires the licensing of both individuals and contractors in all cases.  Research carried out by the Private Security Authority indicates there may be instances where it may not always be necessary, particularly in light of the regulatory burden that applies in some categories, to license both individuals and contractors in all cases.  In some cases, regulation of contractors may only be required.  This will allow the Private Security Authority more flexibility in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
        <P>Government amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 13, before section 13, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;14.&mdash;Section 48 of the Act of 2004 is amended by the insertion after subsection (5) of the following subsection:</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>This inserts a new subsection in section 48 of the 2004 Act to allow for the possibility of costs and expenses to be awarded to the Private Security Authority in cases prosecuted by the authority.  There is currently no express jurisdiction to award costs and the amendment rectifies this position.  It is a desirable amendment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good to see that this issue is being examined.  The code of practice must be all-embracing.  It needs to consider the operations of premises that have wine licences as well as full alcohol licences.  This is particularly true when young people of 15 to 17 years of age have summer jobs working on the premises.  There must be some training as part of a code of practice.  This must also be considered in terms of regions.  Abuse of alcohol is prevalent in certain resorts and areas.  There may be a number of establishments in the town and two or three of them are flagrantly doing what they should not be doing.  A code of practice is important and is welcome.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on his thoughts on the draft code of practice.</P>

	<P>I support the previous speaker.  I have called for the preparation and publication of a code of practice for many years.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment.  It is one of the good aspects of this Bill.  It is also important to encourage those who work in the drinks industry to take a lead and, through the joint policing committees, there is an opportunity for this to happen.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local public and community representatives are present at these meetings.  A number of sub-committees in Waterford and Cork were set up specifically to deal with publicans and vintners.  It is a holistic way of making sure the drinks industry lives up to its responsibilities.  A statutory footing was required for the code of practice.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment but enforcement is the important thing.  The Minister should be commended on his intention to publish the code of practice.</P>

	<P Just="Left">We spoke about this topic on Second Stage.  I compliment the Minister on the steps he has taken.  He expressed concern that the code of practice was not universal and had not been accepted by all bodies.  Has there been development on that since last week?  I doubt there has been.  I have seen codes of practice work very well in the past.  This can work very well and, as far as I can see, it is being adhered to by the vast majority of those involved.  The major threat is that if everyone does not get involved, the Minister can take another step.  It would be ideal if the code of practice worked.  Has there been a development on this?</P>

	<P Just="Left">Regarding the last issue, since I made my comments I have heard no more from the vintners' groups to indicate that they are extricating themselves from their agreement to abide by the code of practice.  I am still hoping we will get more enlightenment in a response to that issue.  It is important the code of practice is given statutory effect.  This is an important move forward.  Consideration was given to enforcement and the main enforcement mechanism in the legislation is that, if there is a failure to abide by the code of practice, it can be raised at the annual licensing courts by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or others and this will raise the issue of what a court might do.  This is a way of ensuring some transparency with regard to the application of the code.</P>
        <P>Work is being done on the code and it will ultimately be published.  It will be a transparent code that people can access.  It is important to create a situation where it has a statutory backdrop, meaning there is a validity in raising it in the legal context of a court application for a licence renewal in circumstances where those who should abide by it have failed to do so.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 11 is a technical drafting amendment to provide for definitions of the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Act relevant to Part 6 of the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 16 to 18, inclusive, insert a new section before section 19 and a new section after section 19.  Amendment No. 16 substitutes a new paragraph (a) in section 21(7a) of Equal Status Act, as amended, to correct a drafting error in the existing text.  The existing text refers to section 21(7), where the correct reference should be to section 21(6).  I presume that is not a matter of any great controversy.  Amendment No. 17 is consequent on the acceptance of amendment No. 11 and provides simply for the substitution of the reference to section 25 of the Act of 2000, as amended, for section 25 of the Equal Status Act, as amended.  Amendment No. 18 corrects a typographical error, where equality was incorrectly spelled in section 39 of the Equal Status Act.  That it is incorrectly spelt has not resulted in the world ceasing to revolve on its axis.  Originally it was a typographical error and it has been corrected under the mechanism of this Bill.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 12 inserts a new section in Part VI of the Bill, the effect being again to correct a typographical error in the context of the word &ldquo;construed&rdquo; in the existing Act of 1998.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 13 deletes subsection (2) in section 5 of the Act of 1998, which is now redundant.  Subsection (2) makes reference to section 14 of the Employment Equality Act 1977 and orders made thereunder.  Section 14 allowed the Minister, by order, to amend or repeal certain other Acts.  However, each of the Acts therein referred to have been separately repealed by other primary legislation and the provision is superfluous.  The Acts listed in section 14 of the Employment Equality Act 1977 are: the Condition of Employment Act 1936, repealed by section 9 the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997; the Shops Condition of Employment Act 1938, repealed by section 9 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997; the Factories Act 1955, repealed by section 4 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005; and the Mines and Quarries Act 1965, repealed by section 4 of the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</P>
        <P>I am sure Senators did not expect we would stray all the way into the Mines and Quarries Act 1965 when we were dealing with the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill but it indicates the extent of what we do in tidying up areas of law.</P><Col N="203"/>
        <P>Amendment No. 14, namely, the new section 18, substitutes a new section 4(A) in section 75 of the Act of 1998.  The director of the equality tribunal currently has powers to outsource mediation and the amendment proposes to extend these current powers to permit outsourcing of the equality officer functions in investigating and hearing cases.  The effect of this amendment is to facilitate a service model which would be more flexible in coping with fluctuations in demand and permit a greater geographical spread of locations where hearings might be held.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 15, namely, the new section 19, substitutes a new paragraph in subsection (12) of section 77 of the Act of 1998, again to correct a drafting error.  The existing text of the 1998 Act refers to subsection (6) whereas the correct reference should have been to subsection (5).  This amendment will bring that about.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 19, line 27, to delete &ldquo;12th anniversary&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;3rd anniversary&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I raised this matter on Second Stage, have reflected on it and believe strongly in it.  As the Minister will be acutely aware, we are in the most difficult financial circumstances ever envisaged by the State since its foundation.  The only comparable situation, internationally, goes back to the Wall Street crash in the United States.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On Second Stage I agreed with the Minister&rsquo;s position.  The previous Minister, former Deputy Dermot Ahern, had suggested a six year period and the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has reduced this to five years.  In present circumstances we should consider my proposal that the 12 year period be reduced not to five years but to three years and, in that regard, the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s consultation paper made certain suggestions.  The 1998 Act is totally outdated and belongs to a different era.  As the situation stands, we do not know, although perhaps the Minister has figures, how many people currently face bankruptcy.  I do not refer to the 40, 50 <Col N="205"/>or 60 big developers who brought this situation about and the banks that facilitated them but to the people who may owe &euro;500,000 or &euro;1 million, business people who find the situation impossible, having been caught and being unable to survive because of the banks&rsquo; perspective.  The banks loaned them money within the past four or five years and they are now being crippled and crucified by the same banks.  In my experience, they are also, inevitably, caught by the Revenue, which debt remains outstanding.</P>
        <P>It is important to be aware that the bankruptcy legislation of most our EU partners applies to a period of under five years.  The Bill proposes amending the Bankruptcy Act to reduce the period, from 12 to five years, wherein a person can apply to be discharged from the court ruling.  I suggest it be reduced further to three years because of the chronic economic situation we face.  In that regard one must take account of the fact that in the United Kingdom, including over the Border in Northern Ireland, the period in question is one year.  I accept there is some rethinking, and that the one year period may be totally inappropriate and is being abused.  However, the gap between one year and five years is too much.  I am aware there are people in business in the Republic who are currently skipping over the Border and applying for bankruptcy under the 12 month ruling in the neighbouring jurisdiction of the Six Counties.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on that.  If it is the case that certain people are availing of that situation it is wrong.</P>
        <P>I do not accept that 12 months is a sufficient period, nor perhaps is two years, but I believe strongly that three years offers a reasonable balance.  In its recent report, &ldquo;Growing Enterprise for Ireland&rdquo;, Forf&aacute;s stated: &ldquo;In order to encourage potential entrepreneurs unnecessary disincentives such as our current bankruptcy procedures should be modernised.&rdquo;  It further stated that the provisions of the previous Bill, which are very similar to those of this Bill, did not go far enough in this regard.  The current bankruptcy laws, specifically the Bankruptcy Act 1988, are more severe than similar laws elsewhere.  For example, in the UK such a ruling may contribute to a fear of failure and thus impede potential entrepreneurs.  Under existing laws any person who becomes bankrupt in Ireland currently faces a 12 year waiting period to be discharged.  The Minister proposes reducing this to five years but the comparison remains to a period of only 12 months in the UK.  The current provisions outlined in the Bill, however, would still not bring Irish law into line with other jurisdictions.  In that regard it is most important that we take cognisance of what Forf&aacute;s stated.  There is absolutely no doubt that we need entrepreneurs.  The Government has introduced initiatives to try to create jobs and so on, but we need entrepreneurial skills and development and need to encourage people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Speaking from my own perspective, being in business and knowing what is going on around me in my constituency and in neighbouring constituencies, probably 75% of business people who are currently in trouble are that way through no fault of their own.   They were expanding their business, buying a new one, or whatever.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I am not talking about people who recklessly engaged in desperate borrowing.  I am aware of a case in a town in my constituency where somebody bought a business, sold their house in Dublin and made some money on that.  They were advised by the banks to expand the business, which they did.  They invested the spare cash in bank shares on the advice of their banks but within a period of three to four years they were in a position where they had to close down the business and give the keys to the bank because of a &euro;35,000 or &euro;40,000 debt to the Revenue and an overdraft they could not service as they were marginally off the mark in that respect.  There are hundreds and possibly thousands of such people in our society.  The full scale of the problem has yet to be known because the Irish people are proud.  People who are in business do not capitulate easily but that problem is rife.</P><Col N="206"/>
        <P>We should take into account also the view of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.  Mr. Michael Culloty, the MABS national press officer, stated: &ldquo;The processes are the same, the costs are still the same and the time period is still long by international comparison.&rdquo;  He went on to state: &ldquo;We still wouldn&rsquo;t be recommending it as an option for the people we&rsquo;re dealing with, 70 per cent of who are on social welfare.&rdquo;  That may be an opt-out clause but MABS is concerned about the position as well.</P>
        <P>The Irish Property Council also added its weight to the argument in this regard.  There would not be much sympathy for people involved in the property market but many small operators, not the huge developers who were borrowing millions, may have borrowed &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million to take the opportunity to build some houses or to expand, primarily on the advice of banks, believing they were doing the right thing.</P>
        <P>By international standards we are still a long way off the mark with regard to our five year requirement.  I feel strongly about this matter and unless the Minister concedes and accepts my amendment, I will push it to a vote.  This is important to note.</P>
        <P>Regarding my amendment which was ruled out of order, I made the point about the costs involved for a bankrupt person applying to the court to be discharged of his or her bankruptcy.  That is an aspect the Minister might have regard for also.</P>
        <P>There are many reasons this amendment should be accepted.  The Minister responded on Second Stage that he had an open mind as to whether the period should be six, five, three years or whatever.  He took the view that it should be five years but stated that he was open to accepting an amendment on that.  In that regard I ask the Minister to consider seriously the position in which we find ourselves.  We have not reached the bottom of the barrel in this regard.  I reckon it will take another two to three years before the full impact of this recession hits the business people of this country.  When the Bankruptcy Act 1998 was enacted and despite the fact that we were coming through a difficult time in the 1980s, nobody then would have envisaged the type of recession we are now facing.  To enable this country to have the resurgence we need and get the business people who failed, many through no fault of their own, to re-emerge, it is essential that we grasp the nettle, take a leap of faith and opt for the three year period.  The Minister will understand in time that it is a fair compromise and if in ten or 15 years time it is decided that the period is too short, the legislation can be easily amended to extend it to five years.  While I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s intention to reduce the period to five years, I am convinced that period is too long and that it will damage the recovery of our economy and the people who are caught in an invidious position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan to a large degree.  However, my problem with amending the period to three years is that while much work has been done to improve the current procedures on bankruptcy, once a person is declared bankrupt it still takes time to go through the entire procedure of collecting and distributing whatever money is involved.  I would be inclined to move to the five year period.  It is an issue we should revisit in two or three years time with a view to reducing the period further.  It would be unwise to reduce it from 12 to three years because of the existing procedures.  I am not satisfied that in many cases all of the issues are resolved.  That is happening also in a large number of receiverships dealing with companies where many of the issues are not resolved within the three year period.  The five year period is the one to decide on and I would say to the Minister that we should mark it for review within the next two years to determine if it should be reduced further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am leaning towards supporting the amendment.  We all accept there is a need for reform in this area but Senator O&rsquo;Donovan hit the nail on the head when <Col N="207"/>he spoke about the need for this State to support entrepreneurship.  Entrepreneurs take a risk and often when they take a risk it can be positive for this State because they set up businesses, create jobs, pay taxes and we all benefit.  Sometimes, however, people fail and when that happens in this State they are punished and it can be very difficult for those people to recover.  In this period we need entrepreneurs and innovators to come forward and create the jobs of tomorrow.  It is very difficult for people who take that risk to have to shoulder the responsibility of all of the costs associated with that.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan made the comparison with the United Kingdom but we could also make comparisons in regard to other countries in Europe and the United States where the bankruptcy laws are far less restrictive.  While I accept proposals in this area are under consideration by the Government, the comparable legislation elsewhere is less restrictive for risk takers and entrepreneurs.  Even if somebody is successful in obtaining a discharge, they will still have to pay all of the expenses of the bankruptcy and any costs owed to the person who made them bankrupt, as well as preferential costs.</P>
        <P>I note also that the new provisions do not state how a person is to be released from bankruptcy.  The Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, has rightly noted that a public announcement would be entirely inappropriate but I believe this measure would discourage people from applying.  I ask the Minister to respond on that aspect.</P>
        <P>It is also an area which needs further scrutiny and discussion.  When we get the new proposals that are coming on stream, we can have a more detailed debate on it.  Legislation is not unwelcome but the main point is that we are sending out a message to entrepreneurs, innovators and risk takers who take a risk but for whom things do not work out.  There are people who gamble and make mistakes due to their own fault, but that is a separate issue.  I refer to people who are victims of circumstance in regard to the change of markets or the business environment in which they operate who find themselves bankrupt and unable to get a second chance.  That is wrong.  I accept that the Government is trying to address that problem but the three year period would be more appropriate and I would lean towards supporting the amendment for that reason.  We must send out a strong message to people that taking a risk is seen as a good thing by the State and that we need people to create the jobs of tomorrow.  I hope the Minister will reflect on those issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two issues involved in this area.  The first is the period a person who is declared bankrupt must serve before they can get back into active participation in the economy.  I was interested in what Senator Burke had to say on that.  I might or might not disagree with him in normal times but we are in unprecedented territory.  None of us has seen it in our lifetime and as many Members will be aware, while I was friendly with the former Minister, Dermot Ahern, I was critical of our failure to deal with this and other issues.  We are almost three years into the most significant economic crisis we have ever faced.  It parallels and is as bad as the Great Depression which, it could be argued, lasted into the 1950s.  It lasted for 20 years.  I know there was a world war in the middle which makes it difficult to equate, but I suggest we will be lucky to recover from the current crisis in this decade.</P>
        <P>If interest rates are increased to a level which will add to the stress of already stressed borrowers, which is very likely, far more people will go to the wall.  Many of them may not be pressed into bankruptcy because creditors will realise nothing is to be gained from it.  Bankruptcy can be a little like liquidation and receivership whereby the professional classes are the beneficiaries rather than the creditors of the companies.  Unless one who is declared bankrupt has a phenomenally complicated asset structure and a very extensive asset portfolio, the normal bankruptcy procedures should be more than adequate to deal with it.  If the Minister is of a mind to examine this particular issue, provision could be made whereby in circumstances where <Col N="208"/>such a situation arises which is being dealt with expeditiously, it could be returned to the courts for an extension to deal with the disposal of assets.</P>
        <P>It was suggested that we re-examine this in two or three years, which will be six years into the crisis.  Not only are people going across the Border, good employers of this country have moved to Britain, the Continent and the United States.  They are trying to reconstruct their lives and businesses in these jurisdictions.  The crisis may deteriorate further and we will need people like these to generate jobs.  I was critical of the five year term that Fianna F&aacute;il proposed as I felt it was far too long.  Given the cataclysmic situation we are in, I would have argued for a shorter period than three years but I have been persuaded by my colleague that the three year period would be more prudent.  I urge the Minister to examine this matter and be prepared to consider it on Report Stage.  I see no good reason for not reducing it to three years particularly given the current situation.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes that one can apply to be discharged on the third anniversary rather than the 12th anniversary.  This deals with an amendment we tabled that was ruled out of order which proposed removing the provision made for the payment of expenses, fees and costs of bankruptcy and preferential payments.  It was ruled out of order because it could conceivably be a cost to the Exchequer, but let us think about it.  This involves somebody who does not have sufficient wealth to discharge his or her liabilities; the amount of assets is less than the amount of liabilities, and one can presume they are significantly less as otherwise the creditors would work through the situation with the person involved.  Therefore, I cannot envisage any circumstances &mdash; unless the person has won the lottery during the three years &mdash; in which he or she would be in a position to meet the costs involved in the bankruptcy, which can be quite high.  Many creditors in most receiverships and liquidations complain that it takes far longer than it should.  There is an incentive and an inducement to the people involved because the longer it continues, the higher the fees.  We need to be careful in this regard.</P>
        <P>If we tell people that after three years they are no longer bankrupt but not discharged simply because they have not paid the costs of the bankruptcy and their preferential creditors, the effect of this measure will be null and void and it will not have the desired effect.  Why are we reducing it in the first place?  It is to recognise the severe situation in which people find themselves.  Most people involved come from a business background.  They are risk-takers and entrepreneurs but they are also employers and this is the real motivation behind these amendments.  Unless we are prepared to give them an avenue to return to their businesses and restart them, we will struggle for a very long time to address the issue of the 440,000 people who are unemployed.  I strongly suggest the Minister considers this in a favourable way.</P>
        <P>Much of the foundation of the bankruptcy legislation is from a different era and was primarily to ensure people did not act recklessly or fraudulently and to hold them to account if they did so.  Nobody would disagree with this but today&rsquo;s climate is very different.  We would all accept that most people involved will be those who got into difficulties through making miscalculations based on economic projections supported by international institutions including many of the rating agencies.  I urge the Minister to make provision for them in the Bill so they have an incentive to return to business in this country, which is where we need them, rather than have them go abroad where their talents and risk-taking will be of benefit to other countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add weight to the arguments put forward by my colleagues on this side of the House.  The debate reminds me of the question the former Minister, Mary Harney, asked about where we were as a country in choosing between Boston and Berlin as the way forward.  In my experience in the House, when it comes to legislation relating to industrial development or proposals to facilitate business or the commercial world we most <Col N="209"/>definitely have come down on the side of Boston rather than Berlin.  Over the past 20 years, we have introduced legislation here and in the D&aacute;il that has strongly facilitated the development of foreign direct investment to an enormous degree.  Successive Administrations over the past 25 years can be proud of this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge that by introducing this legislation the Minister is at least addressing an archaic law which should have been addressed long before now.  What we are quibbling about is the time periods.  I am not <i>au fait</i> with the situation in the United States but I will continue the theme of suggesting we take a leaf out of its book.  I understand the period of bankruptcy there is approximately two years.  I am aware of a clich&eacute; that has existed for generations about businessmen from the United States whereby if one has not failed at least twice in business, one is not a success.  In the United States, failure in business is seen as a badge of honour and a rite of passage rather than a failure.  In this country and in western Europe in general there is a culture of holding the opposite view and this has militated against the liberalisation of bankruptcy laws. It is salutary to remind the House, as Senator O&rsquo;Donovan did, that in our nearest neighbour&rsquo;s jurisdiction the length of time is much shorter than what is proposed here.</P>
        <P>I agree with the points that have been made, and they need to be reinforced, on the fact that we are facing an unprecedented crisis.  Even the founding fathers of the State would never have envisaged it.  Certainly, it is on a parallel with the Wall Street crash of 1929 and I agree with Senator Walsh&rsquo;s referral to the length of time it takes to get out of recession.  If my memory serves me correctly, it was the intervention of a war that lifted the United States out of recession, which raises the question as to what would have happened to various economies, specifically the US economy which was the engine of growth in the world at the time, if there had not been a war.</P>
        <P>The Minister should be bold and take the philosophy of a legal contemporary of his who famously stated in another context that one should be radical or redundant.  The Minister will hardly be redundant as I know his philosophy has been one of taking a radical approach to the law.  As an expert in various aspects of the law, he does not need Senators to remind him where his duty lies in that respect.  However, we are dealing here with the impact the legislation will have on commercial life.  As Senator O&rsquo;Donovan noted, a significant number of people with entrepreneurial skills have found themselves in the bankruptcy courts as a result of circumstances arising from the economic collapse of recent years.  This does not detract from their entrepreneurial skills or ability to rise phoenix like from the ashes and make a corporate success of themselves.  This will, in turn, generate more employment.</P>
        <P>The Minister will, I believe, agree with the general philosophy behind the amendment, which is to ensure further obstacles are not placed in the way of good business people who have sound business ideas but are being prevented from re-entering the marketplace as a result of the archaic nature of our bankruptcy laws.  I agree the steps he is taking are a significant advance and I am interested to hear his reflections on the contributions Senators have made on the proposed amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I listened carefully to the Minister&rsquo;s logical contribution on Second Stage when he proposed to reduce the term before an application for discharge from bankruptcy may be made from 12 to five years, having first proposed reducing it to six years.  This is a significant advance.  I gather the 1998 Act was almost ten years out of date when introduced having been based on a report published in 1978.  I am pleased, therefore, that the law is being changed in this respect.  Like Senator Mooney, I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s reflections on the strong case in favour of the amendment proposed by Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and Walsh.</P>
         <P>Unemployment is a scandal.  It is also scandalous, however, that people are declared bankrupt for 12 years.  It is equally scandalous when people are seen to be living a life of luxury within <Col N="210"/>a short period of being declared bankrupt.  Let us ensure we strike the correct balance.  A strong case has been made for reducing the bankruptcy period to between three and five years.  I am impressed by the position adopted in the United States where bankruptcy is accepted.  As I noted on another occasion, F. W. Woolworth was made bankrupt three times before he succeeded.  On the other hand, I am also aware of people who got away with not paying their debts.  They were not made bankrupt and those to whom they owed money had to put up with watching their behaviour.  For this reason, we must strike a balance.</P>
        <P>On listening to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution on Second Stage, I considered the proposal to introduce a bankruptcy period of five years acceptable.  I would not be surprised, however, if he has been influenced by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and will consider reducing the period even further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senators Quinn and Mooney, I welcome the proposed change, which is a significant improvement on the utterly inadequate legal position currently in place, to allow for the first time a limit of 12 years on the length of a bankruptcy and to allow an application for discharge after five rather than 12 years.  I do not want to go over what has been a long debate on this issue on which I spoke on Second Stage.  I also listened to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution on the matter.</P>
        <P>As Senator Mooney noted, we are quibbling about time periods.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on Second Stage on introducing comprehensive reform through the forthcoming personal insolvency Bill.  The debate on that legislation is the appropriate occasion for a more comprehensive discussion of bankruptcy.  I was also encouraged to note that the proposals in this legislation do not amount to comprehensive reform but are focused on addressing the issue of the legacy bankruptcies which remain on the books.  That is an important point.</P>
        <P>The Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, provided Members with a useful briefing which noted that the original legislation is entirely inadequate and while the proposed change marks a great and welcome improvement, much wider law reform is needed.  The Minister has taken this on board and will acknowledge that a much more radical and comprehensive reform programme for bankruptcy law is being envisaged.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate a timeframe for its introduction.  I hope it will be soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>While we could wait for the more comprehensive reform to which Senator Bacik alluded, I support the amendment tabled by my colleagues opposite for the reasons other Senators have described so well, namely, the context in which we find ourselves, the findings of the comparative research done on how other countries deal with bankruptcy and the recommendation by the Law Reform Commission of a period of three years.</P>
        <P>I have one other point to make from the perspective of a witness.  Another speaker indicated that failure in the United States is a badge of honour.  While that may be the case, bankruptcy is not a badge of honour.  My father was an entrepreneur who went through bankruptcy and I assure Senators that whereas being an entrepreneur is something of which one can be proud, bankruptcy is a shameful experience.  In light of my witness and experience, I believe a three-year period would be much more appropriate.  The entrepreneurial spirit does not last forever but is supported by prevailing conditions and law.  I concur with Senators who have suggested that this is a time for being bold in this regard as distinct from being cautious.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Senators who have contributed to this debate.  This is only the start of a debate on a very important issue.  I return to what I said on Second Stage, namely, these are two reforms of importance but they are small compared with the very substantial insolvency Bill which is being prepared in my Department and which we are required to publish in the first quarter of 2012 under the EU-IMF agreement.  I am optimistically hoping we will <Col N="211"/>be able to publish it before Christmas.  While I cannot guarantee we will do so, work on the legislation is advancing.  The Bill will introduce some very important and radical changes in this area of the law.  What we are doing at the moment is addressing two aspects of it.  We are doing so in a careful way and, as one speaker stated, to deal with legacy issues.  Speaking from memory, I believe the 12-year rule we will introduce will allow in the region of 350 bankruptcies to be terminated.</P>
        <P>We should keep all of this in context.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan wanted me to predict the future, as to how many people may be rendered bankrupt.  I do not know the answer to his question but I have information about the past.  Despite the economic tsunami that has hit this country and the major personal difficulties many people have found themselves in, I am advised that in 2010 a total of 27 people were adjudicated bankrupt.  Resort is not made to our bankruptcy laws to an enormous extent.  Part of the reason for this is, as Senator Quinn fairly noted, that the law is substantially out of date and is not working the way we need it to work.</P>
        <P>As a number of Senators stated, it is important to have a balance in this area.  We want to ensure that those with entrepreneurial skills who fail through no fault of their own and do not set out to deliberately defraud other individuals are given a second chance to get back into business and extricate themselves from debt.  However, we also have to protect the community from those who deliberately trade recklessly and often destroy the lives and businesses of other people who have dealt with them in good faith.  There is a balance to be achieved in this respect.  As we develop and change our law in this area, I wish to do it in a coherent and comprehensive way through the insolvency Bill.  These are just two preliminary steps along that route.  I welcome the fact that many of the Senators who spoke on Second Stage, while expressing some concerns about the number of years applicable, generally welcomed the fact that we are introducing changes.</P>
        <P>To put the changes in focus, in section 20 I am providing for an automatic discharge, for the first time, of bankruptcies on the 12th anniversary of adjudication, with no conditions.  This will deal with people in this country, numbering in excess of 300, who might have been bankrupt for decades.  There are people who have gone to their graves bankrupt.  It achieves no benefit to society and leaves them with a permanent stigma.  The stigma remains even if they became bankrupt through no fault of their own, for example, because others who owed them money got into difficulties and caused unexpected troubles in their lives.  It is a very significant reform and would not diminish it in any way.  There are issues for the future such as, for example, whether that 12-year period should remain that length.  This legislation allows us, through the Office of the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy, to resolve outstanding issues with regard to legacy bankruptcies of long duration and, in a sense, clear the way for implementing the new insolvency legislation when it is introduced.</P>
        <P>As I said on Second Stage, I was not happy with the six years in the Bill published by my predecessor.  We wrestled over whether it should be three, four or five years.  There is no monopoly on wisdom in these matters, and I do not pretend to have such a monopoly.  However, as Senator O&rsquo;Donovan acknowledged, there is now concern in the UK about the effect of the one-year rule.  I do not know to what extent research has been carried out in Northern Ireland in that context but there is a concern that it is creating a huge difficulty in facilitating people who have traded recklessly and got other people unfairly into financial difficulties to very easily extricate themselves from debt, wave goodbye to their obligations and start up again.  I am anxious to ensure we do not create that type of situation.</P>
        <P>The five-year rule allows people to extricate themselves after they have discharged what are described as debts to preferential creditors.  Such creditors include the Revenue Commissioners, where taxes and rates are owed.  Importantly, where people have been employed in circum<Col N="212"/>stances where the employer is not a limited liability company and where there is a personal liability, the preferential creditors include the former employees who are owed money by the bankrupt.  There are issues surrounding that.  There is a debate as to whether at the end of a period of less than 12 years one should be discharged from bankruptcy without having to meet what are described as preferential debts.  To what extent and at what time does one&rsquo;s liability to the State cease?  Based on the new 12-year provision, if there are taxes owing that one cannot pay and if there are genuinely no assets or income out of which they can be paid, essentially one is free of those debts after 12 years.</P>
        <P>If one is a compliant taxpayer and one has watched people leading a very high lifestyle, living excessively, buying cars that cost &euro;100,000 or &euro;200,000, going off to the Caribbean five times a year and they suddenly render themselves bankrupt and owe the Revenue Commissioners &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000, at what point is it morally justifiable that they are released from that debt?  That is a serious issue.  At what point are ordinary workers who are paying their taxes through the PAYE system required to pick up the tab for somebody else by filling the gap of the tax payment they failed to make?  At what point does one recognise the loss of funds to fund essential services that the State provides and that the loss should not be recouped?</P>
        <P>One must bear in mind that it is not simply black and white in these areas.  At a time when the State is short of money and is borrowing &euro;18 billion per year from the ECB and the IMF, at what point in time does one forgive debt that is owed to the Revenue Commissioners by people who deliberately did not pay taxes and led a foolish, high lifestyle that more responsible people did not lead?  This is not a black and white issue.  There are grey areas, value judgments to be made and moral hazards.  We will have a more comprehensive consideration of these in the context of the insolvency Bill and in the work being done in the Department on that and the recommendations for reform made by the Law Reform Commission.  We must examine it not only from the legal perspective but also from the economic and moral hazard perspectives to ensure we do not greatly advantage people who have behaved with gross irresponsibility, to the disadvantage of those who have behaved responsibly.</P>
        <P>It is, of course, important that people engaged in business, who genuinely operate their business responsibly but who are the victims of circumstances that are not their fault or where they simply made a poor judgment that anybody else might make, are not pilloried in the future and rendered incapable of starting up a business again.  However, there is a balance and in that context the Government decided to opt for the five-year period rather than the three-year period.  I appreciate the arguments made by Senators in favour of the three-year period but I cannot accept the amendment they propose in that regard.  I am not opposed in principle to a further reduction in the 12-year period concerning automatic discharge.  It is an issue to which we will give further consideration.  However, I cannot accept the proposed amendments at this time.</P>
        <P>This debate is important and it will feed into the work we are doing on the insolvency Bill.  I hope Senators will support the provision in the Bill as it stands so we can proceed to implement it.  I expect to revisit this issue in the Seanad if not this side of Christmas, certainly in the first part of next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened carefully to the Minister.  Going from 12 to five years is a significant improvement.  I also welcome the news that we are likely to see the insolvency Bill this side of Christmas.  That is significant, although I realise it is part of our commitment under the EU-IMF agreement.</P>
        <P>Company law in this country is not up to standard or fit for purpose.  In the last two years numerous companies have gone into examinership.  Some of them had legitimate reasons for <Col N="213"/>doing so and the examinership has helped to re-establish their business model, so they have emerged from it successfully.  I also believe that if somebody goes into examinership, emerges from it in a couple of years and is in a position to honour the debts that existed prior to that, this should be considered.  I agree with the Minister that we must be careful to get the balance right.</P>
        <P>In the present climate it is extremely important to initiate job creation and promote entrepreneurship.  However, the State is borrowing &euro;18 billion per year and it must be in a position to meet its commitments in that regard.  We cannot simply walk away from debt willy-nilly.  The insolvency legislation is prudent and will make a huge difference in terms of how we do business not just with regard to bankruptcy but also company law in general.  I look forward to it.  For the sake of the two years and given the legislation that is due to be introduced, I hope the amendment will not be pressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed by the Minister&rsquo;s response.  I will not say the reduction from 12 to five years is immaterial but it is relatively insignificant.  The automatic discharge at 12 years is a significant step.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has said he will look at reducing that.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I note that the Minister laid heavy emphasis on people who had been living a lavish lifestyle and may have traded recklessly or extracted money from their business operations for their own consumption rather than applying it to creditors and other causes.  I accept that.  Surely it is not beyond our wit to make a distinction in legislation between those who trade in that manner or operate recklessly and those who operate on a bone fide basis.  Many of the people who could find themselves in bankruptcy in the next few years may be subcontractors who were not preferential creditors of main contractors.  These are small people with families who owed money to suppliers for work they did on behalf of main contractors and who will find themselves and their families ruined financially as a consequence.  A distinction needs to be made.  I agree with Senator Quinn when he says we must maintain a balance, but we cannot brand honest-to-goodness people who have worked hard and given employment, and condemn them to a lifetime of inactivity simply because we have antiquated laws.</P>
        <P>Will the insolvency Bill deal with these issues?  Is that the purpose of the insolvency Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with everything the Minister said in respect of those who live lavish lifestyles on the backs of their businesses and put their businesses in jeopardy.  I still think it is possible to separate the reckless from the unfortunate and to do so within the three-year timeframe.  I support the amendment on that basis.</P>
        <P>I asked how a person is to be released from bankruptcy.  I do not see any new provision in that regard.  Will this be considered at a later point?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that the Minister is not ideologically wedded to the notion of five years and that he will return to this matter.</P>
        <P>I take issue with Senator Conway on a small matter of company law.  Senator Conway referred to the fact that company law is not fit for purpose.  I am sure he will agree that the initiative presented by the previous Administration to allow for a court examinership, similar to Chapter 11 in the United States, went a long way to ensuring that jobs were maintained in this country at a time when, without that legislation, they might have been lost.</P>
        <P>Is it suggested that a person who is no longer trading and is judged a bankrupt is excluded from trading until he or she is discharged from that bankruptcy?  In other words, even with the <Col N="214"/>five year rule, if a person is adjudged a bankrupt subsequent to the passing of the Bill, can he or she continue to trade or restart in another guise.</P>
        <P>My last question relates to those who live a lavish lifestyle.  People who are leading lavish lifestyles, who do not seem to have a financial foundation for doing so and who are not discharging their financial responsibilities, may have very clever lawyers who ensure they are able to continue to live this lifestyle while thumbing their noses at society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I stated that there were many examples of the examiner legislation leading to companies getting back on their feet.  However, I also have numerous examples of the examiner legislation being abused.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment proposes a reduction of the period before application for an order for discharge can be made from five to three years.  It makes no distinction regarding individuals who might have recklessly traded or led extraordinarily or foolishly lavish lifestyles compared with their neighbours and, as a consequence, did not pay their taxes.  There is no distinction in the legislation or in the amendment.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh referred to small contractors who get caught up.  There have been many instances, particularly in the construction industry, of contractors who lost substantial sums of money where the principal building firm has collapsed and the contractors have not been paid for their work.  The overwhelming majority of those firms are limited liability companies.  That is dealt with through company law and not through bankruptcy law.</P>
        <P>The numbers rendered bankrupt is extremely small, given the overall financial difficulties that exist and the number of businesses that have closed.  There were 27 in 2010.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pleasure to be back in the House to discuss agriculture, food safety and related matters.  Over the past three or four months, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I have been given the opportunity to promote agriculture and to work in conjunction with our Department and everybody in the industry.  It is an exciting industry to be involved in, given the opportunities presented by the great demand for food and energy.  I am glad to be in the House to hear the views of Senators and to share my views on horticulture and forestry.  The greyhound industry is also under my remit but everything comes back to jobs.</P>
        <P>On several occasions I have been asked by the Minister to attend functions relating to the dairy, sheep, beef or pig industries and food safety is important.  I left school at 15 to be a farmer at the time we joined the EEC.  The agriculture industry expanded to produce food on a massive scale.  It was always exciting to be involved and to get paid until the mid-1990s but now the door has opened again.  If one&rsquo;s daughter was getting married to a farmer 15 years ago, the question everyone asked was how much road frontage he had whereas ten years ago it was different but now they are talking about road frontage again.  That is a sign of the times.  There is a significant difference between the time we joined the EU and now in that Ireland has become a serious food exporter.  This is where the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, comes in.  Farmers do not like to be led in certain ways but the farming community and producers of all types of food have worked with the FSAI.  Regulations must be in place for everything related to eating and it is a pleasure to know that it is an independent body.  It has no vested interests and its members have called the shots in the interests of the consumer from day one.  We are in a fantastic position.  I ask Senators for their views and I do not want everybody to be nice to me.  If Members do not think something is right, I expect them to point that out.</P>
        <P>We must not alone sell our food but also our technology.  The most interesting meeting I had since taking office was with the Minister for agriculture from China.  He arrived in Ireland having visited many other countries.  He was amazed by our environment, food traceability standards, the manner in which we ran our herds and the manner in which every ounce of food produced met various standards.  We must work as a team.  Every Member comes from a differ<Col N="216"/>ent area, which is engaged in some aspect of the food industry.  We have a responsibility to promote it.  At the end of the year, we will show the EU that we are good at producing food and we have the capacity to feed at least 40 million people and to export our technology.  Our technology has been rated through the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the farming and food producing communities.  We have the required technology for all types of food production and it has been recognised that it is the best in the world.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to address the Seanad on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing the agriculture, agrifood and related sectors and, in particular, to deal with the specific areas for which I have ministerial responsibility.  Together with the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, I am determined to ensure that the sector fully realises its potential and maximises its economic and social contribution to the country.  In my first few months in office, I have travelled widely throughout the country and have met thousands of stakeholders.  I have been very impressed by their enthusiasm and optimism.</P>
        <P>The Government has fully embraced the Food Harvest 2020 strategy and we intend to drive the strategy to significantly grow the sector in the next ten years.  We are all aware of the headline targets set out in the strategy which the Government believes are achievable.  There is an increasing recognition that our economic recovery will be export-led and, in that regard, agriculture and the agrifood sector has a particularly important part to play.</P>
        <P>The value of agricultural and agrifood exports increased to &euro;8 billion in 2010 and recent CSO figures suggest that the trend will continue this year.  The Food Harvest 2020 strategy targets an increase in dairy production of 50% by 2020.  When one considers that approximately 85% of Irish dairy produce is exported, an increasing proportion to emerging markets in the Middle East and Far East, one can see the enormous contribution that the Irish dairy sector can make through a significant increase in exports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Similarly, the Food Harvest 2020 strategy targeted an increase in the output value of Irish beef of 20% by the end of the decade.  However, last week, the Beef Activation Group revised the figure upwards to 40%.  Given the sector&rsquo;s strong export focus, with approximately 98% of Irish beef exports going to high-value EU markets, and the fact that it is employment intensive, that is vitally important in terms of economic recovery, job retention and creation.</P>
        <P>Irish agriculture and the wider agrifood sector are uniquely positioned to benefit from a rapidly increasing global population, increasing urbanisation and the westernisation of diets in developing economies.  Those factors will lead to an increase of 50% in demand for food globally by 2030, rising to 70% by 2050.  Given that background, I welcome the new, ambitious growth target for the Irish beef sector and, with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, I wish to work with all the stakeholders in the agriculture and agrifood sector to ensure that the targets are met and the sector delivers on its undoubted potential.</P>
        <P>This country, rightly, has an international reputation as a clean, green, high quality, innovative producer of excellent food and drink.  A critical part of the reputation arises from the emphasis we continue to place on food safety.  Food safety is the cornerstone of our international reputation for food production.  The production of food to the highest standards of safety within sustainable farming systems is the very foundation on which the agrifood sector is built and is one of the major goals and objectives of the Department, which it pursues through monitoring, surveillance and inspection services along the links of the food chain within its area of responsibility through the enforcement of strict regulatory standards on animal identification and traceability, farm inputs, animal health, animal welfare, veterinary hygiene, animal remedies, plant health and pesticides.  In addition, there is the enforcement of EU and national rules relating to transport, marketing centres, processing plants, storage and distri<Col N="217"/>bution operations.  The import and export of animals and plant products is controlled.  The network of veterinary research laboratories, dairy science laboratories, the pesticides laboratory and private laboratories all work in close co-operation with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, and other Government agencies on food safety issues.</P>
        <P>My Department also enforces food safety controls under the single payments scheme, through cross-compliance with environmental, animal welfare and food and feed hygiene regulations.  With such attributes as animal welfare and traceability, Irish food products have a valuable edge in the international marketplace.  My Department has responsibility for the food safety standards of approximately 650 food premises, primary producers of milk, dairy and eggs, large meat producers and premises producing food of non-animal origin.  It is also responsible for the safety of imports of food of animal origin from outside the EU and for residue monitoring.  Standards across the food production sector are subject to regulation under the hygiene package for food and feed, a system introduced to regulate food business operatives.  Primary responsibility for the safety of food to consumers continues to rest with individual food business operators.</P>
        <P>My Department works closely with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The FSAI was established in 1999 as an independent regulatory agency and my Department, along with other agencies including the HSE, local authority veterinary services and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority operates under contract to the FSAI in so far as food safety is concerned.  The FSAI, through its service contract mechanism, ensures overarching co-ordination of food safety controls and the application of controls across the food chain based on risk and in a proportionate manner.  Ireland was one of the first countries to set up a national food safety authority.  It is fair to say and generally acknowledged that it has gained both national and international credibility and adds to the level of assurance for both domestic and international consumers in the food safety control infrastructure which underpins the safety of Irish food products.</P>
        <P>Safety of the food chain can never be taken for granted as food production continues to evolve with new processes and products rapidly emerging.  Major food incidents, both in this country and abroad, have brought home in no uncertain manner the importance of being prepared to deal swiftly and effectively with new challenges.  This country has established a reputation as a producer of safe food but there is no room for complacency.  The food and feed hygiene legislation clearly places responsibility on food and feed business operators whether as producers, processors, distributors, retailers or caterers to ensure that the food chain is safe.  At the end of the day, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link and the Government will continue to give priority to the maintenance of the highest standards of food safety.</P>
        <P>A critical part of Irish agriculture and agrifood is the horticulture and potato sector which has an output value at farm gate of approximately &euro;350 million.  That figure includes both the food and amenity sectors of horticulture which make up 80% and 20% respectively of the output value.  A Bord Bia review of labour in the horticulture sector in 2007 showed that full-time employment in primary production activity was estimated at 6,000.  That does not include employment upstream or downstream of the primary production process on which the horticultural sector impacts, for example, preparing and packing produce, garden design and landscaping and retail, which generates upwards of a further 10,000 jobs.</P>
        <P>The key market for the horticultural industry is the domestic market.  The two main areas of export are mushrooms to the UK where we have 62% of the market and amenity horticultural products worth approximately &euro;10 million annually.  The majority of horticultural production is sold on the home market and the key outlets are the retail market, which is valued at &euro;1.2 billion per annum.</P><Col N="218"/>
        <P>The other important outlet for produce is the food service or catering sector.  Since my appointment, I have visited a large number of producers and marketing companies.  I have been most impressed by the knowledge and professionalism of growers and the consumer-orientated focus of their business.  Growers are much attuned to the changes in the markets and have responded accordingly.  One grower indicated to me that ten years ago 90% of his production was based on loose tomatoes but today it is less than 10%.  He has now diversified into many different speciality tomato lines, adding value all the time.  That is a reflection of both the dynamism and evolution of the industry.</P>
        <P>The Food Harvest 2020 strategy identified &ldquo;potential for further development in the sector&rdquo;.  I wish to ensure that the potential is fully realised.  Despite short-term difficulties, it is vital for the industry to continue investment in order to meet the competitive pressures the industry currently faces.  The pressures arise, in particular, from high input costs, competitively priced imports, lack of scale and limited development in innovation.  To that end, I was particularly pleased to have been in a position last month to announce a grant aid package of &euro;4.1 million under the 2011 scheme of investment aid for the development of the commercial horticulture sector.  The package will provide grants for 157 horticultural producers to assist in funding capital investments in specialist new equipment and facilities.  The grant aid covers all areas of the horticultural industry including field vegetables, mushrooms, protected crops, nursery crops, soft fruits and apples, cut foliage and bee-keeping &mdash; and will assist in funding investments of approximately &euro;10.2 million between now and the end of the year.</P>
        <P>In the past decade the industry has consolidated with fewer but significantly larger producers.  Growers have become more specialised and have invested considerably in recent years thanks in no small way to grant aid from my Department under the national development plan.  Over the past decade the Department has provided grant aid of just under &euro;30 million to horticulture projects, which supported investment of almost &euro;78 million by the industry itself.</P>
        <P>The extent of the competitive environment within which the Irish horticulture industry operates was illustrated clearly just a couple of weeks ago in a report from the Horticulture Action Group, which pointed out that the cost of hiring labour in this country is 26% higher than it is in the UK, given the labour-intensive nature of picking and harvesting fresh produce.  The report also emphasised that the Irish retail and catering markets are the most important outlets for fresh Irish horticulture produce.  Growers of potatoes, vegetables and fruit are extremely concerned at the dominant role of supermarkets in controlling the prices and quantities of produce marketed.  I agree entirely with the conclusion and recommendations of the action group with regard to creating a more level playing field in the retail sector.  I have written to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to emphasise the importance of greater statutory oversight on retail multiples because of their negative impact on the industry, and I have asked him to give serious consideration to the issues raised by the action group in this regard.</P>
        <P>I am supportive of the group&rsquo;s emphasis on the urgency of promoting and facilitating more collaborative initiatives within horticulture.  This is something I feel strongly about and will be working to promote.  Collaboration and co-operation between producers increases their purchasing power for inputs as well as their selling power to the big supermarket chains.  In addition, growers who come together have the opportunity to form EU-recognised producer organisations.  We currently have three such organisations, which received almost &euro;6 million in funding from the EU in 2010.  I am anxious to see further developments and I know that both Bord Bia and officials from my own Department are talking to producers about this.</P><Col N="219"/>
        <P>The organic sector, although relatively small, also represents an opportunity for growth.  Organic production, unlike the industry as a whole, is particularly suited to small-scale production.  The Food Harvest 2020 strategy identified the potential for significant growth by focusing on two areas: import substitution in areas in which Ireland is under-producing at present; and large export markets such as the UK and Germany.  I again emphasise my positive impressions of the horticulture sector and my belief that if we can successfully address the issues I have highlighted, horticulture operators will expand and contribute to the ambitious targets set for the agricultural industry as a whole in Food Harvest 2020.</P>
        <P>Shortly after my appointment as Minister of State, I stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">Forestry provides a welcome income stream for owners, the majority of whom are farmers. ...  Forestry, as an indigenous industry, also provides a wider ranging, long term economic return in that it provides jobs, both directly and indirectly, and contributes to our export performance.  It also provides benefits to the environment and recreation and amenity value to society in general.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The programme for Government includes a commitment to invest in a 14,700 ha. per annum afforestation programme.  The private timber resource is becoming a significant element of our timber supply, with privately owned forests now accounting for about 46% of Ireland&rsquo;s forest resource.  Significantly, these are mainly owned by farmers, and the afforestation programme is driven largely by farm forestry, with farmers now responsible for more than 90% of new forestry.  The Government has made a significant investment in the development of forestry over the years in order to ensure there is a critical mass of timber coming on stream to sustain the timber and timber products sector.  For example, just over &euro;72 million was paid in premiums in 2010 to both farmer and non-farmer forestry owners, which gives a good idea of the ongoing investment in this area.  I am not sure about this if we cannot maintain this level of investment.</P>
        <P>The forestry sector is an important one, which has given rise to a vibrant and export-oriented forest products sector.  The primary products produced by the Irish sawmill sector include construction and structural timber, pallet and packaging timber, and fencing products.  While construction lumber is largely sold on the home market, pallet and fencing products make up the bulk of sawn timber exports.  In 2010, exports totalled &euro;286 million, which was up from &euro;243 million in 2009.  Given the number of elements within the sector, the forestry sector overall makes a significant contribution to the economy, both nationally and at a local level, through direct and indirect employment.  The output of the forest industry in 2008, comprising the growing, harvesting and processing sectors, was around &euro;1.89 billion, or just under 1% of GDP, with some 16,000 jobs dependent on it.  If we are to reap the immense benefits that a healthy and vibrant forest sector can bring to our society, our forests must be managed in a sustainable way.</P>
        <P>Forestry also makes a significant contribution as a means to displace fossil fuel, particularly in the generation of heat in industrial, commercial, domestic and institutional markets.  Wood energy, which is energy produced from wood or wood by-products, is a home-grown, renewable, sustainable, carbon-neutral and secure source of heat, electricity and bio-fuel.  The increasing focus on renewable energy highlights the potential of wood energy for heat and power generation.  Our forests are estimated to absorb 4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, or about 6% of our total greenhouse gas emissions, which is a significant contribution to our efforts to ameliorate climate change.  In complying with our Kyoto targets, the annual contribution from eligible forests will be around 2.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.  This represents a projected annual saving to the taxpayer of &euro;44 million.</P><Col N="220"/>
        <P>Just 12 months ago, in response to a spate of forest fires, my Department established the land and forest fires working group.  It was deeply regrettable and indeed distressing to see the devastating impact of the recent series of forest fires, which caused millions of euro of damage to the national forestry estate.  However, despite the current economic situation, that is only money.  I condemn in the strongest terms those, albeit a small minority, who showed such flagrant disregard for the law, property and people&rsquo;s lives, due to their highly irresponsible and criminal behaviour of starting fires around the country.  I also reiterate my appreciation and that of the Government to all those who were involved in fighting recent forest and land fires.  Those people, many of them members of the emergency services, demonstrated a tremendous commitment to their task and no small courage.  It is quite frankly mind-boggling and totally incomprehensible that there are those in our society who willingly and knowingly embark on actions that risk the safety and lives of emergency service personnel, landowners, forest owners and fellow members of the public.  The perpetrators of these acts of criminal damage can be assured that, if they are identified, they will face the possibility of prosecution, fines and imprisonment.</P>
        <P>I am particularly pleased to have responsibility for the greyhound industry, which is responsible for sustaining 11,000 full and part-time jobs and providing an estimated &euro;500 million into local economies throughout the country.  The greyhound breeding industry has also been very successful; over 75% of greyhounds now running in the UK are Irish-bred.  There is considerable scope for further development of the industry, particularly if we can encourage tourists to enjoy a night at the dogs.  I want to work with all stakeholders to ensure the industry continues to develop and that its full potential is realised.</P>
        <P>The greyhound industry, like most other industries, has not been immune from the effects of the economic downturn, and I want to work to ensure the industry has a sustainable funding model into the future.  As Senators will be aware, the then Minister for Finance announced in budget 2011 that he would be making the necessary arrangements to ensure that all forms of betting, including remote betting &mdash; that is, telephone, internet and exchange betting &mdash; will be subject to betting tax, and provision has been made in the Finance Act to deal with the taxation issues.  The next step will be the publication by the Minister for Finance of legislation amending the Betting Act 1932 to deal with issues relating to the regulation of remote betting.</P>
        <P>Central to the success and reputation of the greyhound industry has been a long-standing and genuine concern for greyhound welfare.  This House has already debated and passed the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill and I acknowledge the constructive and positive nature of the debate during its passage through this House.  Just last week, the D&aacute;il passed Second Stage of the Bill, and I look forward to further constructive debate during the remaining Stages.  I appreciate the concerns of those who advocate the need for robust animal welfare legislation and I want to reassure them, and all those interested in this issue, that the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill is a rigorous piece of legislation and contains a number of provisions that are, in fact, more onerous than those contained in the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010.</P>
        <P>With 17 racing tracks throughout the country and greyhound owners, breeders and trainers in every county, the economic benefit of the industry is well spread throughout the country, with employment quite often being provided in rural areas where alternative employment opportunities are at best in short supply.  It is important, therefore, that the industry is consolidated, and this is my firm ambition and intention.  When I said I wanted to work with all stakeholders, that includes Members of the House, all of whom, as legislators, are stakeholders in this industry.  I invite them to contribute fully to the debate on the future direction of the greyhound industry in whatever way they consider appropriate.</P><Col N="221"/>
        <P>In recent months, there has been an increasing and welcome public acknowledgement of the importance of agriculture and the agrifood sector and the critical role it will play in the country&rsquo;s economic recovery.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and I are leading a team in our Department that wants to develop and grow the sector, ensure it becomes a core economic Department and that its vitality is fully recognised.  What I have detected from my engagement throughout the particular sectors is a tremendous energy, enthusiasm and positivity.  I want to harness that to ensure it is properly focused.</P>
        <P>I welcome this debate and appreciate the invitation to attend the Seanad this evening to discuss the particular areas for which I have ministerial responsibility.  When agriculture and the agrifood sector is discussed, much of the debate tends to focus on the large dairy and livestock sectors.  This is entirely understandable, given the enormous economic contribution they make both nationally and locally in rural communities.  This debate also includes three other areas, although perhaps less prominent, which are no less important.  Horticulture, forestry and the greyhound industries are, directly and indirectly, responsible for sustaining more than 40,000 full-time and part-time jobs.  Between them, they are worth &euro;2.5 billion to the economy.</P>
        <P>That is to say nothing of the absolutely essential role that food safety plays in underpinning the entire agrifood sector, which supports 185,000 jobs and has an annual output value of some &euro;22 billion.  Due to the extent to which the sector is embedded in the economy, its economic footprint is even larger than these figures suggest.  The Taoiseach said recently, &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s success depends on our ability to develop and grow in areas where we have real and tangible competitive advantages.  The food industry is one such area.&rdquo;  I want to work with the industry and other policymakers to ensure we build on and improve those competitive advantages.  I share the commitment of the Taoiseach and the Government to work with the industry, helping it to meet the ambitious goals that it has set for itself.</P>
        <P>I have spent the past several months engaging actively and constructively with the stakeholders in those sectors for which I have responsibility.  I have some clear ideas about the direction in which I would like those sectors to go.  I want to raise their profile and emphasise the critical role those less prominent sectors have to play in developing and growing the wider agrifood industry.  That said, I accept that I do not have a monopoly on wisdom and I look forward to engaging with Members, as key policymakers, in this debate.</P>
        <P>It is important to get across the importance of our food sector.  We must encourage young people to take up courses in horticulture and other agrifood areas because it is the one sector with huge job potential.  We must also encourage people to buy local food produce.  It must be remembered that the conditions in this industry &ndash; be it in processing, picking or growing &ndash; are not what they were 40 years ago.  I would be proud to work in many of the food processing factories I have visited recently.  We are not all going to be Einsteins so we must divert our young people to take up horticultural and other agrifood courses.</P>
        <P>Forestry development must also go hand in hand with other agricultural sectors.  At a recent Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations meeting in Rome, it was stated that if a country wanted to develop its beef or dairy sector, it would need to develop its forestry to assist the environment.</P>
        <P>I hope Members will be as critical as they can in this debate.  There is no doubt that our young people will depend on the agriculture and food production industries to grow to provide employment.  This is one area of job creation that will help us get out of this economic mess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>It was such a pleasure to listen to the Minister of State speaking passionately about his great love for the agrifood industry.  His speech was fantastic.  I agree <Col N="222"/>more people are realising the importance of the agrifood industry, our largest indigenous industry.  We have had mega-successes in multinational exports, so the agrifood sector provides a wonderful opportunity.  I wish the Minister of State the best of luck in his work.  I know he will be a huge success.  I must also thank him for visiting Lir Chocolates recently to see how a food business which started in a kitchen has grown to employ 250 people.</P>
        <P>The agrifood sector touches every parish and town, providing employment for up to 185,000 people.  With the rising demand for food worldwide, the potential for this industry makes it the most exciting indigenous industry we have.  We have marketed Irish food as green and natural.  However, if something goes wrong in the food chain, it can be a disaster.</P>
        <P>The recent outbreak of food borne diseases associated with fresh produce in Germany demonstrated the vulnerability of the European food chain to food scares.  Since the outbreak began in May, 4,300 people have become sick, with 897 seriously ill with kidney failure and 50 fatalities, making this the most severe outbreak that has occurred in the European Union.  While most of the cases occurred in Germany, there was a separate outbreak involving 14 cases in France and another associated with people travelling to Germany.</P>
        <P>Having been involved in food production for 16 years, I know the importance of food safety.  Ireland was one of the first countries to establish a safety authority for food.  We are fortunate to have the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, run by Mr. Alan Reilly.</P>
        <P>The German food safety sector did not handle itself very well, however, and caused much panic across Europe.  The outbreak caused a serious disruption in food trade across the EU with a loss of consumer confidence in the safety of salad vegetables.  The collapse of the Spanish cucumber industry has led to farmers seeking &euro;220 million in compensation while the Dutch vegetable sector suffered losses of &euro;10 million per week at the height of the crisis.  The crisis also led to countries closing their borders to imports of fresh produce from the EU with further economic losses.</P>
        <P>The initial investigation in Germany into the cause of the outbreak pointed to salad vegetables with tomatoes, lettuce and cucumber being the likely sources.  Subsequently, the German authorities pointed to Spanish cucumbers being the most likely source of the contamination.  They were, however, wrong.  Being a food producer myself, I found watching the vivid pictures of Spanish cucumber producers disposing of their cucumbers moving and stressful.  Following weeks of investigation involving staff from German state and federal Ministries with assistance from experts from the European Safety Authority, beansprout seeds from a farm in northern Germany were identified as the most likely cause of the outbreak.  The most recent information announced by the European Food Safety Authority &mdash; it was issued earlier today &mdash; is that organic fenugreek seeds imported from Egypt are the most likely source of the outbreak.  The European Union is planning to introduce legislation to ban the import of certain seeds and beans from Egypt.  I am aware from experience that when one imports goods, one is at the mercy of those from whom one purchased those goods and one must hope that they operate to the correct standards.  The Irish multiples provide great leadership in this area and demand that the companies with which they deal operate to world-class standards.</P>
        <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has dealt with over 100 alerts which were issued through the European rapid alert system in respect of certain foods and feeds and which were relevant to this outbreak.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland also keeps consumers and the food industry informed by providing up-to-date news on its website.  On Saturday, 25 June last, the authority, as a precautionary measure, advised Irish consumers not to eat beansprouts.  It also advised caterers not to serve raw beansprouts.  This advice was issued to protect consumers because some of the implicated seeds could have been on sale in Ireland.  Many other European <Col N="223"/>countries have followed the Irish example and issued similar advice.  This highlights the fact that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has an excellent reputation internationally.</P>
        <P>There are lessons to be learned from the outbreak of E. coli in Germany.  For example, many state and federal agencies were involved in the investigation relating to the outbreak and co-ordination between all players could have been much better.  There appeared to be no co-ordination at all, particularly in the context of communication.  Traceability is a major issue in Ireland and great attention is paid to it.  The investigation relating to tracing the source of the relevant seeds was lengthy because of the number of intermediaries involved in the seed trade.  EU law requires food business operations to maintain systems of traceability via a one step back and one step forward approach.  In the instance under discussion, connecting and verifying all the links between operators took time.  There is also a need for strong, supportive scientific evidence to form the basis of management decisions when identifying the food involved in the source of an outbreak.</P>
        <P>The Irish agrifood sector is central to the Government&rsquo;s plans for economic recovery and is seen as the flagship for growth.  It is dependent on its international reputation for excellence in safety and quality.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, as the independent science-based regulator, is central to ensuring consumer confidence in Irish-produced foods, both at home and abroad.  Ireland requires a high-profile, independent, science-based food regulatory authority to demonstrate to trading partners that we are investing in our food safety control infrastructure and that the interests of the consumer are paramount.  Maintaining confidence in the safety of Irish food will be central to achieving the ambitious targets set by the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, who valiantly pressed forward with the Food Harvest 2020 document.</P>
        <P>We have been presented with a wonderful opportunity as a result of the worldwide demand for food.  I reiterate the importance of Bord Bia&rsquo;s promotion of brand Ireland.  I am delighted to be part of it.  I know the Minister of State will be a major success in the position he holds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am delighted he could come before the House to discuss the extremely important issue of food safety.  I welcome his assertion that the Government is going to promote agriculture into the future.  Earlier today I read an EU report in which Ireland was commended for the way in which it carries out its business.  Problems were identified in a number of countries but thankfully those who compiled the report were very happy with the way we operate.  That is good news.</P>
        <P>Food safety is crucially important.  In light of the increase in the numbers of young people either returning to the land or attending agricultural colleges, we must ensure that our standards remain high.  In the past we often complained that certain regulations were too rigorous.  However, I have come to realise the importance of good regulations.  As the Minister of State indicated, we export a great deal of what we produce to countries across Europe.  If we do not have stringent regulations in place, we will lose these export markets.  In view of the fact that the global population is increasing, a number of excellent opportunities exist for Ireland.  It must be remembered that there are approximately 240,000 farm families in this country and that they all derive incomes from the land.  In addition, there are upwards of 200,000 people employed in agriculture.</P>
        <P>Traceability is often viewed as something which gives rise to a great deal of work for farmers.  However, when farmers do what is necessary work and when they obtain a good price for their products, then they do not object to doing this work.  As soon as a calf is born, a farmer must tag it within seven days.  In addition, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food must be notified of the birth within 27 days in order that the animal can be registered.  In my opinion, the census relating to our livestock is even better than that which is carried out in respect of <Col N="224"/>the human population.  The recent census of population was out by 100,000 but that would not happen in agriculture because the regulations which apply at farm level are so tight.  We know, from month to month, the exact number of animals that are alive at any one time.  It is also possible to know the number of animals that are processed through meat factories, etc.  If a difficulty arises, it can be detected and dealt with very quickly by means of our laboratory systems.  As a result, there is no threat to our exports into the future.  That is an extremely positive development.</P>
        <P>The position is the same in respect of sheep.  From this year, electronic tagging will apply in respect of the breeding ewe flock.  This will prove to be extremely worthwhile, particularly as we export a great deal of sheep meat.  It is good, therefore, the relevant regulations are in place.  Such regulations also apply in respect of pigs and poultry.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to animal welfare.  As farmers, we take pride in looking after our animals in the best way possible.  Indeed, we produce only the best.  We are always seeking to upgrade the quality of our animals and, in that context, we are very careful with regard to the meal and feed we use, the way in which we administer antibiotics, etc.  We keep records in respect of what we do.  Many people may not be aware that inspectors from the Department visit farms and check the amount of antibiotics, feedstuffs, etc., that are on hand at any one time.  In the overall context, this is good for the industry.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We work closely with the dairy and veterinary research laboratories and with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  It is important for farmers and ordinary people to know that if a mistake is made or if an individual farmer tries to do something that is not right, he or she can be penalised and his or her single farm payment cut.  If he or she is involved in the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, or the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, he or she also runs the risk of having his or her payment cut.  These are serious penalties and, as a result, farmers are always extremely cautious with regard to how they operate.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland also works closely with the HSE and other health authorities.  Again, if a difficulty arises, it can be detected and dealt with.  Tight regulations apply in respect of meat factories.  Veterinary inspectors visit these facilities and ensure that everything is working as it should be and that the relevant standards are being met.  That which I have outlined is extremely positive in the context of the future of farming in Ireland.  People across Europe and elsewhere can rest assured that farmers in this country produce to the highest standards.</P>
        <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland provides officials who help to man border inspection posts.  Everyone is aware of the important role played by such posts during the outbreak of foot and mouth disease a number of years ago.</P>
     
        <P>We were all very much involved in that and called at the time for an all-Ireland animal health policy, something we should consider for the future.  An all-Ireland policy would ensure that Ireland, North and South, could deal with the problems we have on the island without reference to the Border or having to man the Border in the event of a problem.  If the ports in Northern Ireland were all that had to be manned, the problem would be much easier to manage.  This would unite us all even further and unite all involved in farming on the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Food labelling is an important concern and it is crucial we have country of origin labelling on imported lamb, in particular, but also on pork and chicken.  We have seen chicken  brought in from places such as Thailand and the Middle East and then, once an additional process has been carried out on it, such as adding bread crumbs to it, it is labelled as Irish.  That is unacceptable, particularly when we already have a good chicken and pork industry here.  We <Col N="225"/>need tighter labelling in this area.  This would create more jobs, which is what it is all about.  We must look at whatever will create jobs in Ireland so as to get our young people back working.</P>
        <P>I was happy to hear the Minister of State mention organic production because some very poor land in County Leitrim is the home of The Organic Centre.  This centre puts a number of students through its hands each year and trains them in organic production, mainly in the horticulture area.  I look forward to working closely with the Minister and Minister of State in the future.  It is important we keep adequate people in the sector to man the excellent industry we have and to keep producing the top-quality food we have been producing over the years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  His passion and enthusiasm for this sector is clear and we are all grateful for that.</P>
        <P>Before addressing the main issues, I suggest that one of the issues with regard to people wishing to get into the food industry at a micro level or on a small scale, with a view to expanding later, is the difficulty in finding a suitable premises.  For example, kitchens that conform to health and safety regulations are not readily available to the many people trying to get in at the micro level.  Perhaps that is something we should address.</P>
        <P>Another issue that has come to my attention recently is that there seems to be a shortage of people trained to work in the forestry sector.  While we may be able to plant the trees, there is a dearth of trained workers to manage the sector.  Perhaps we should proactively seek people for training in that area so that the industry can develop.</P>
        <P>It is heartening to hear that the smaller sections of our food industry are being so well promoted, and I support the Minister of State on that.  Being from Sligo, I am pleased to stand next to my neighbour from Leitrim.  Perhaps together, we can enliven debate in the Seanad on agriculture and agribusiness.</P>
        <P>I want to focus my remarks on the idea that we are now in the business of an industry, the food industry.  I remember when training to be a food scientist I worked for a while in a factory where our first job in the morning was to pick the flies out of the cheese vat.  This job was particularly difficult because the cheese was soft curd and the flies sank into it.  It was a type of paddling exercise trying to pick out the flies.  That was before the days of good health and safety regulations but it is a reminder of the constant challenges that face the food industry.  I have never forgotten that job and the image of the flies has remained with me.  I was not very good at picking them out.</P>
        <P>We now eat food produced in factories by an industry and no longer eat the potatoes taken directly from the ground into the house.  Therefore, we must recognise that with the industry come all the dangers of the length of the food processing chain.  We talk about people wanting to eat local food and food from Ireland, which is good, but we must remember that many of our ingredients come from all over the world.</P>
        <P>We must recognise that the food safety area is now an industry in itself.  While I commend the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on encouraging people who do not have high points in their leaving certificate to come into the industry at the agricultural level, we should also support involvement in the food safety industry.  We should work towards encouraging people towards jobs in what is a technical and difficult sector to get right.</P>
        <P>I would like to draw attention to a story or problem that unfolded over four years in Europe as a result of the importation of a product called &ldquo;guar gum&rdquo;.  This is not something one chews in order to feel better but is a common product used for thickening products such as ketchup and soup.  In 2007 the Swiss authorities discovered that certain batches of the gum imported from India were completely contaminated with dioxins.  They were very concerned by this because once the gum is added to the many different foods, it is very difficult to trace the <Col N="226"/>source of the problem.  They went to India and carried out investigations and discovered that the Indian authorities had already carried out an investigation which they could not stand over because it was such a poor one.  The Swiss then insisted that any guar gum coming from the place in India would require papers which were signed off officially demonstrating the gum production was properly controlled.  However, when they returned to India again in 2009, they discovered there were still serious deficiencies in the production of the gum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While we rightly pride ourselves on traceability here, which is second to none, our dilemma arises with the challenge that faces us in the global world, where common products in our food, like guar gum, pose their own dilemmas.  Therefore, we must recognise that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has an enormous task, particularly when we consider the difficult issues it must face in terms of the safety of food.  It must consider a diverse range of issues, such as whether food contains heavy metals, nutrient deficiencies, the occurrence of bacteria, the use of trans fatty acids, monosodium glutamate, irradiated water use for washing vegetables, adding vitamins to milk and in what proportions and the age old issues of additives, thickeners and preservatives.  If we are to invest in our agrifood business, which is what we want to do because it is an industry where jobs are being created, we must ensure the capacity of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is maximised and that it does not lag behind.  It must battle constantly to keep up with the challenges it faces as those in the technology field move ahead.</P>
        <P>I remember being addressed in University College Cork by a colleague who had graduated some years previously.  He was working in America and waxed lyrical about the wonders of strawberry milk and strawberry butter and milk that was not a dairy product.  Back then &mdash; it was the last century &mdash; that seemed very strange to us, but the technology had already leapt ahead.  My concern is that while we are busy investing in the food industry, we should not forget the importance of safety.  We have already seen the problem here with dioxins in pork. Perhaps we need to invest more or perhaps the Department should liaise more with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which is doing a very good job.  People have come to rely on the authority.</P>
        <P>The issue of food safety is a relatively new phenomenon and we used not have problems like guar gum or overheated breadcrumbs on a pork product that ended up poisoning people.  We must not allow a gap to occur between the production of food &mdash; which we are very good at &mdash; and the safeguarding of that food.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would also like to draw attention to the sticky issue of food labelling.  I realise the issue is not quite as simple as putting a label on it and saying it is Irish because that is what people want.  I understand there are difficulties at European level and that the whole area of labelling is complex.   We know that the voluntary task force in the UK put together the pig labelling system &mdash; I have no doubt that the Minister of State is perfectly aware of this.  They decided in the absence of an European ruling on the source of products that they would go ahead and put a voluntary code in place and encourage all the producers and retailers to come together to work on the system.  I know the IFA has been pressing for this here.  I ask the Minister of State to yet again, I am sure he has had dialogue with the IFA, open that dialogue or to give us an update as to where the proposed system is at.  We are waiting for the European Union to catch up and whether we get mandatory labelling for country of origin remains to be seen.  There is clearly an argument as to whether we are allowed to say where products come from, whether the UK, Ireland or France because of the rules of competition.  I appreciate that this a difficult area.  As Senator Michael Comiskey has said, substantive transformation is causing headache not just to producers but to consumers also.  It is vitally important that we address this in the coming years.</P><Col N="227"/>
        <P>May I draw attention to a successful campaign on food labelling that has been announced today in Europe relating to palm oil.  This again underlines the variety of ways that food labelling can operate.  It can operate for nutritional or for safety reasons, as well as for country of origin.  Those who were following the palm oil debate are aware of the environmental damage that has been caused by the proliferation of palm oil.  It is a major environmental issue.  Today the European Parliament has finally decided that it is obligatory to label palm oil as &lsquo;palm oil&rsquo; and not under the guise of vegetable oil.  Consumers will now be able to see for themselves that the product has palm oil in it and if they then do not wish to buy it, they have the knowledge which gives them some control.  We should consider the value of labelling together with the value of food safety.  I urge that we grow an industry around food labelling and safety and create more jobs from it as a good companion to the wonderful work that farmers are already doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is traditional to welcome a Minister on his first visit to the House and I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Shane McEntee.  I am in bad humour tonight because we guillotined a Bill in the House in order to discuss food safety.  In the past 18 years that I have been in this House we seldom guillotined a Bill, but at 6.45 p.m. we guillotined a Bill on civil law in order to discuss food safety.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has told the House what he does and has spoken about many topics, greyhound racing, forestry, betting taxes, but I do not think he mentioned the consumer once, but perhaps he did, but I did not see it.  I am quite concerned.  I was willing to put up with a guillotine on the previous Bill because we were going to discuss the important subject of how we are to achieve food safety.  Yes, the Minister of State touched on it, but I hardly saw it.</P>
        <P>I am exercised by the topic of a ministry for food and agriculture.  Back in 1994, I was on the committee that established Bord Bia.  However I had a minority report, which was to state that Bord Bia should be established but it should be in any Department but the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  I believe there is a clash between the interests of agriculture production and food.  There is a significant opportunity for food in Ireland, but that should not be mixed up with agriculture.  It could well be that we use Irish agricultural products to produce our food, but if we are to create a food business and succeed in a food business we should ensure it is not being driven by agriculture alone.  There should be two different hats.  Today, one of the few times that the Minister of State spoke about the retail trade, what did he say?  Let me quote:</P>
        <P LI="1">I agree entirely with the conclusion and recommendations of the action group with regard to creating a more level playing field in the retail sector.  I have written to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to emphasise the importance of greater statutory oversight on retail multiples because of their negative impact on the industry, and I have asked him to give serious consideration to the issues raised by the action group in this regard. </P>
<P FLI="0">The action group comprises farmers who want to control the nasty supermarkets.</P>
        <P>I believe the supermarket business has been achieving major success in bringing good food to the Irish people in years past, whether it is from Ireland or not.  I believe there is a clash between farmers on the one side and the consumers on the other.  Farmers must be driven by the consumer.  I remember being a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food when the then European Commissioner for Agriculture, Herr Franz Fischler, addressed the committee for 20 minutes and never mentioned the consumer once in his speech.</P><Col N="228"/>
        <P>We need a discussion on food safety.  The Government plans to ban the sale of raw milk in Ireland.  Legislation has been drafted without public consultation and it could be become law in autumn 2011.  This statement was made by the slow food group.  We would welcome and encourage regulations on the sale of raw milk as with any other food product, regulation is necessary and correct.  At present the sale of raw milk is legal because of a 2007 EU directive, four years later the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has not introduced guidelines or imposed regulations on the sale of raw milk, but I gather the intention is to ban the sale of raw milk.  With the volume of raw milk that is used in cheese and other products, it is possible to have regulations.  Sheridans Cheesemongers, a very well-know cheese producer states they have been selling raw milk from David Tiernan&rsquo;s farm in Dunleer, County Louth in their shops since November 2010 and have had a fantastic response from customers.  They are also aware of two other producers in Ireland selling raw milk.  Darina Allen has written a seven-page letter, in which she suggests the establishment of a register of licensed producers who undertake an agreed greater than normal surveillance of herd health and milk quality.  Best practice in other jurisdictions can be used as a model for such a protocol which with mandatory labelling for instance stating &lsquo;may contain pathogens&rsquo;.  They have regulations in Britain.  They have not banned the sale of raw milk but have regulations so that they control it.  We could ensure that we control it in that way.  I believe that is what we should be discussing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State referred to technology and I wish to comment further on that matter.  There are major opportunities in science.  There are 6 billion people in the world and it is estimated that the population will grow to 9 billion by 2050.  How will we feed the world unless we use modern science?  Modern science can do it.  We have practically banned genetically modified organisms in Ireland.  We should be the ones who are saying at least, lets investigate it, let us see what we can do.  The developments in science are wonderful.  One of my heroes was a man called Norman Borlaug, who died last year at the age of 95 years.  He won the Nobel prize in 1970 for creating a change in wheat and maize products that saved the lives of thousands of people.  He was able to create and save it.  We are not moving in the direction of doing it.  We are very fortunate to have the Institute of Food and Health in UCD and they have a very impressive programme.  They have a very strong link with the China Agricultural University, CAU, and have an exchange programme and people come to Ireland and some have gone over to that university  There is a very strong link between the exchange and what we can achieve.  </P>
<P Just="Left">Let me tell a story.  In 1989, I was on a customer panel in one of our supermarkets and a customer told me they had been talking about the advertisements on the radio about the product for cattle with the slogan &ldquo;it is a queer name but it is great stuff&rdquo;, an injection for cattle. They were worried about the meat they were eating and asked me to put their minds at rest.  We put a traceability scheme in place and later when we had it established, we were able to show a photograph of the farmer whose meat was being supplied in the supermarkets that day and for the week.  Four years later, on 26 March 1996, when the House of Commons announced a link between CJD, the human form of mad cow disease, the sale of beef dropped dramatically almost everywhere.  At the time Bord Bia told us we were one of the few companies where sales jumped because we were one of the few who had achieved a traceability system, although it was not fool-proof.</P>
        <P>Since then, Trinity College Dublin developed a new scheme, Identigen, which is not paper based, but is able to trace a sliver from each beast as it is killed.  It means one can trace back not just to the farm but to the actual animal and every single beast.  In that case it is cattle but the scheme is now capable of being applied to other animals.  It is a Trinity College Dublin <Col N="229"/>invention and it is now being sold in the US.  It manages to establish traceability that is not based on paper, which can be fiddled with on that basis.</P>
        <P>There are huge opportunities to get things done.  It will not work unless we recognise that we need somebody to protect consumers, that is, somebody whose job it is to make sure that people who buy Irish food, whether in Ireland or exported, that they are able to get a product they know is way ahead of anything else.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The pigmeat scandal in recent years arose not because of bad husbandry but from feed.  It damaged the pigmeat business over one weekend and did huge harm.  That is where the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is working very hard and is doing a very good job.  Let us make sure that continues to happen.  If we are to succeed, we must ensure that what happened never happens again.  What happened to the Spanish cucumber growers and the beansprout growers in France and northern Germany can happen so easily to us here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have got to ensure that somebody is wearing the hat of protecting Irish consumers and the Irish food industry.  I urge the Minister to concentrate his attention on ensuring that happens rather than necessarily blaming the big supermarkets because the farmers have told him they are at fault.  There will always be a blame game between the two.  There will have to be some way of  protecting the Irish consumers by ensuring they are getting the very best food.  I know the Minister&rsquo;s heart is in the right place.  If I am cross today, it is not just because of the previous Bill but because of this aspect also.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  I disagree with Senator Quinn that we must be prepared to promote all new scientific developments in regard to food production.  Napoleon said an army marches on its stomach.</P>
        <P>Food safety is one of the most important issues in the world today.  The world has to produce 70% more food from its land by 2050 so the challenges for food, fuel and fibre safety and security will be enormous.  We in Ireland must set up the best global food safety scheme because food safety cannot be looked at in isolation.  We must be at the forefront of the mind of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when policy is being formulated in discussions around CAP reform and trade agreements with non-EU countries, particularly the South American states.</P>
        <P>Let us look at the recent food scares &mdash; the baby food in China, the bean sprouts in Germany and in Ireland the pig feed issue in Wexford, a problem which we dealt with immediately.  A system must be in place to enable us to deal with such problems immediately.  In this regard food production in Ireland must be the safest in the world.  We must strongly promote our excellent record when marketing our products abroad.</P>
        <P>Currently, we are producing enough food to feed 36 million people.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Simon Coveney, has set a goal of producing enough food for 50 million people into the future.  The Minister has been very proactive since assuming his <Col N="230"/>role and has spoken frequently of his desire to promote the Irish agrifood industry and to increase Irish exports.  He announced recently that our agrifood exports grew by 13% in the first five months of this year and predicted a growth of more than &euro;600 million for a second consecutive year.  While some industries have grown rapidly and then imploded, Irish agrifood has remained a constant reliable pillar of our economy since the foundation of the State and that is what we need to continue.  People will always want to buy high quality food and the ability to produce excellent produce, using the highest standards of production values, is a core strength of Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A significant step in linking our country with top quality food was taken in May when Queen Elizabeth II visited the English market in Cork.  Viewers in the UK and around the world may have been surprised to see the quality of the produce that the Queen viewed.  Of course, Cork&rsquo;s status as a &ldquo;foodie&rdquo; location has been well known in Ireland for many years and now a global audience is aware of it.  The whole island will benefit from these images of the Queen admiring the produce that is available in Cork.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Food Harvest 2020 report, which contains a programme to increase exports, is already ahead of its targets in some areas.  Its targets have included an increase of 20% in the value of beef output in nine years but this target was upgraded to 40%.  I urge the Minister and the Minister of State to ensure that the strongest best practice framework is in place to protect the integrity and reputation of Ministers of the member states farming interests.  The E. coli outbreak was handled very badly and all member states must take a lesson from the incident.  I am confident that the Minister and Minister of State will ensure protocols are in place to protect Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as being at the forefront of food safety.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Neill.  I will speak quickly but I have something important to say on the food legislation.  Senator Feargal Quinn spoke about one type of technology, the GM.  I will speak about another type of technology that is not mentioned in the report, that is, nanotechnology and its application in the food sector and particularly for the consumer.</P>
        <P>Nanotechnology is the science of engineering materials at the Nanoscale.  It is viewed by the food industry as a means of enhancing food safety and nutrient bioavailability with some examples already available on the market, albeit not in Ireland but it is coming fast.  In 2008 the Food Safety Authority of Ireland carried out a report on nanotechnology and its potential future applications in Ireland and food packaging.  It made a series of recommendations on nanotechnology to ensure that consumer safety is protected in regard to development in this area.  The report identifies potential benefits for the consumer and manufacturers from nanotechnology which excludes extending the shelf life of products as well as the possible effects of the food chain and the recognised gaps in our knowledge base on this issue.  There is therefore, as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has said, a need to ensure that regulatory or legislative controls are adequate to safeguard human health.</P>
        <P>Nanotechnology is expected to offer immense potential for future product development.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland further states that, while there are no foods currently on the Irish market that incorporate nanotechnology, policies should be devised now in advance of their arrival.  They are coming in on the Internet but we do not have any legislation in that area.  The report, which was compiled by our own food safety authority, recommends legislation on an EU scale.</P>
        <P>We should look at what is best for Ireland and welcome with open arms the new technology that will benefit the country.  It is referred to in some areas as the intelligence of the good.  A <Col N="231"/>role in the development of intelligent food packaging will provide a greater degree of traceability of products.  This is where nanotechnology comes in.</P>
        <P>All of those developments are in place and we should be legislating or preparing to legislate for them.  For example, nanostructured metal films and coatings can strengthen bottles and other plastic wrappings materials and the incorporation of nanocensors into food packaging material will allow for the detection of contaminants such as harmful bacteria in food, which many speakers have mentioned, and their surroundings in the environment.  As it affects the environment, we could trace the packaging through nanotechnology.  I ask the Minister to do something on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin by outlining a definition of what food safety means.  The international agreed definition of it is the concept that food will not cause harm to the consumer when it is prepared or eaten according to its intended use.  Food safety is of critical importance.  All the talk in this country about our economic regeneration is around the Food Harvest 2020 report and what this country can do to meet the increasing demand for food globally.  If we are to fulfil our potential, the safety of the food we produce is crucial to satisfying international demand.  From a food safety point of view, Ireland is in a very strong position, particularly in respect of the commodity products we produce and export.  Meat, dairy and fish products were worth &euro;8 billion and we also produce and export drinks.  Traceability of all produce in this country is first class, our processing facilities are of a very high standard, staff hygiene training standards are excellent and product processing and testing regimes are strictly enforced by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>The FSAI does very good work.  There has been some criticism of the FSAI due to its handling of the pork dioxin recall, which cost approximately &euro;400 million.  Perhaps the authority jumped in too soon but they are damned if they do and likewise if they do not.  Overall, the manner in which it was handled won acclaim for the FSAI.  We must pay tribute to the staff for the work they do.</P>
        <P>My background is as a food technologist employed in the food safety sector.  What frightens me most about food safety in Ireland is our exposure if a German or Spanish cucumber issue emerges in Ireland and affects our food exports.  What would be the knock-on effects if it affected our beef sector and the Irish economy?  A comment made recently by an EU food safety expert that &ldquo;food in Europe has never been safer&rdquo;, is open to question when one considers the German cucumber incident.</P>
        <P>We can be fickle when we think back to ten years ago and a rogue trader or importer caused the foot and mouth outbreak in the Cooley Peninsula.  We are open to exposure and one such incident could bring down the deck of cards and cause major problems for the implementation of what we are trying to achieve in the Food Harvest 2020 report and to our economic recovery.</P>
        <P>This country has incredibly high standards for food premises, which are rigidly enforced.  Some say enforcement is too rigid but these standards tend to put barriers in front of smaller producers in a regional setting.  The criteria may be too stringent on a region to region basis.  The Department should set up a forum to assist those who want to establish food businesses.  There should be a pathway for those people rather than barriers.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food spoke about breaking down barriers and how civil servants dealing with food safety will make it easier for these people.  The Minister of State might reflect on these comments and respond to the comments of the Minister.</P>
        <P>The new term in the global context is food defence, which is an American term that refers to defending the problem before it begins.  We spoke about the Food Harvest 2020 report, the objectives and the increase in the global demand for food, of 50% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. <Col N="232"/> The demand this will place on the industry, the demands placed on food safety and the additional demand on the Department and the FSAI are the challenges we must meet as a country.  We must ensure there is no compromise on the safety of additional production.  Otherwise, we leave ourselves vulnerable.  Senator Reilly may address food labelling and I would love to discuss it in detail.  It is a massive area and, if we run out of time, we could have another discussion on it.  It is an important aspect of economic growth and Food Harvest 2020.  Labelling is crucial.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe on the British model.  We should examine the model of being in isolation to Europe, jumping the gun prior to getting formal approval from Europe.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank all Senators for facilitating me in contributing to this debate.  I welcome the Minister of State.  The legislative proposals in the European Parliament this week mean we need a debate on food labelling at another stage.  It is important to have a debate on food labelling when experts from across Europe are gathering in Dublin for the Society for Applied Microbiology conference.  We all take for granted that the food we eat is safe and we trust that the systems will protect us from disease.  However, recent scares from BSE, pork dioxins and the E. coli outbreak tell us that we must remain vigilant.  These diseases have a health and economic impact.  Prompt detection and identifying the sources is imperative if public health interventions are to be effective.  This is not a sensationalist scare story but a real issue and it has an impact on our communities and our economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mary White outlined the drastic and devastating effect of the E. coli outbreak in Europe.  It has killed 51 people so far, with 49 deaths in Germany, one in the US and one in Sweden.  More than 4,000 people in Germany have fallen sick since the outbreak, including 851 people with serious complications that could lead to kidney failure.  The same bacteria has been responsible for smaller outbreaks in France.  It was initially blamed on cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce and beansprouts.  The source has finally been identified as Egyptian fenugreek seeds.  The occurrence of a number of high-profile outbreaks of serious illness has focused more attention on this important issue.  In respect of the socioeconomic impact of foodborne illnesses, the costs to be calculated include treatment costs, product recall costs and, for the food industry, the effect of the loss of public confidence in businesses in the food and tourism industries and disruption to hospital services.  From the product recall point of view, we must only look at the pork dioxin scare and the cost of this to the Irish economy, estimated at over &euro;180 million.</P>
        <P>Senator Comiskey referred to an all-Ireland approach, on which I want to focus.  <i>safe</i>food, the food safety promotion board, has a statutory function to develop a strategy for the effective delivery of a specialised enteric laboratory service for the island of Ireland.  <i>safe</i>food was established in 1999 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  The North-South Ministerial Council gave it a role of conducting a cost benefit analysis of different ways of meeting Ireland&rsquo;s need for an enteric reference laboratory service.  This would provide definitive identification of the cause of enteric illnesses.  It is essential for outbreak recognition and the identification of emerging threats.  Currently, much testing relating to food safety in Ireland, north and south of the Border, is conducted by the laboratory of enteric pathogens in Colindale, London.  This is an internationally renowned centre of excellence.  However, if there was <i>force majeure</i> in the jurisdiction of England, Scotland or Wales, it could result in a massive disruption to the service to the island of Ireland.  Should a major foodborne disease break out across Britain and Ireland, Ireland will fall to the bottom of the list in terms of testing.  Current turnaround times for samples submitted to Britain from the Republic of Ireland are longer than desirable, for the North they remain just about acceptable.  However, in a time of crisis this will not be sustainable.  This matter was agreed previously through the North-South Ministerial Council and would deliver substantial benefits to both jurisdictions.  For that reason, I ask the Minister of State and his colleagues in the Departments of health, both North and South, if he will facilitate <Col N="233"/>the costing report for an islandwide enteric reference centre on the island.  Such a report would cost only &euro;40,000 and provision for it has been made already in the <i>safe</i>food budget.  All that is required from the Government is to expedite this process for the agreement of both Departments.  This service for the island of Ireland would enhance public health protection by ensuring the rapid identification of the causes of foodborne disease, facilitating traceback to the sources of infection and allowing the sharing of comprehensive data on these organisms.  It would mean that should a food scare break out in this country we would not have the Cluedo theatrics we saw with the E. coli scare in Europe, concerning the source of the outbreak.</P>
        <P>I reiterate what I stated in this House, including last week, namely, we should not have to wait for a food crisis to discuss these important issues.  The benefits of acting would be enormous.  We would see the centralisation of expertise which would help the development of a high quality reference service and, as a dedicated research centre with the critical mass of scientists, a laboratory could rapidly establish a culture of excellence and professionalism and give staff improved career development opportunities.  This is worth pursuing and I ask the Minister of State to consider it in a serious way within his Department and the Department of Health.  I ask him to assure us this issue will be expedited and confirm when a report will be commissioned and concluded.</P>

	<P>That could take two hours.  I thank everybody for making a contribution.  I am probably not in a position to tell certain speakers what will happen regarding matters they raised and will return to them.</P>
        <P>I refer to the first issue, namely, what happened in Germany.  If we had been as quick as the Germans were to blame others for their cucumbers we would now be closed down as a country.  The first thing I learned about traceability in regard to a food problem when I went into my Department &mdash; an eye-opener when one is not used to it &mdash; is that within two seconds, or one telephone call, everybody is involved in tracing what went wrong and making a decision concerning our food industry.  All those people, from the veterinary end and other areas, are available and this is something of which we should be very proud.  We have the best people in the world &mdash; that is not to tempt fate.   The Germans blamed somebody else but one should never tempt fate.  In this industry we know that what can go wrong will go wrong and we have had some such instances.  We should always work and progress the latest and most up-to-date technology and scientific information if we are to grow the industry.  I have seen this in Monaghan Mushrooms, CNP, which has 62% of the market.  All the growers were going out of business but decided to form a PO within the industry.  That should be the model for everybody.</P>
        <P>We have an obligation.  Senators may ask what the greyhound industry has to do with food safety and Senator Quinn made a fair comment in one regard.  A person might ask me what forestry has to do with food safety in this country.  However, we must grow our industry.  For the past three or four years I have been told that cow numbers or beef numbers could not be increased because of environmental issues.  The poor old cow is blamed for everything.   However, now one has been educated to realise that if we grow our forests in conjunction with our beef and dairy industries the whole lot works hand in hand.  It is the same in the greyhound industry although it may not be related to food safety.  I have visited most of the 16 or 17 tracks.  Those where food is not served have poor attendances.  Last Saturday I was invited to the track in Limerick, a place to which one could bring anybody in the world.  It is not only about seeing dogs, or eating, but about getting the best food that one might find anywhere.  There were 300 or 400 people sitting down, hen parties, and so on.  It is all related, as is the growth in the industry.</P><Col N="234"/>
        <P>Many points have been made, including the issue of young people who want to get into the industry and the training centres, as Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe rightly noted.  A large number of big restaurants have closed down, including a couple in my own county where we already promoted the notion of one person using these premises for two days, followed by another person for another two days.  They use the facility to learn how to cook properly and prepare meals, or whatever.  We cannot allow anything stop growth in jobs.  In my portfolio this comes at the lower end, the least recognised areas, whether in horticulture or forestry.  They must be protected first.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn may be annoyed about this but I could become twice as annoyed at what I have discovered.  This will be addressed.  Twenty years ago there were 2,000 vegetable growers in the country.  Ten years ago there were 1,000.  Now there are 200.  If we do not start protecting them by getting their produce on the shelves in an orderly fashion they, too, will go.  I realise how important the big supermarkets are in the provision of food and everything else.  However, the most hurtful thing I experienced in the past three or four months was sitting down with people in the horticulture and processing business and seeing they were afraid.  They were afraid that I would speak about what was happening to them and how they are being treated.  As a person who comes from an agricultural background I know this should not be allowed and have started a process to ensure it will not.  This is not about getting into a row with supermarkets.  I will act in a proper fashion.  If we allow matters to continue the way they are going we will not have a vegetable or a tomato growing in this country.  There will be no horticulture industry.  All I ask for, ultimately, is that if there is a shelf in a supermarket it will have Irish-grown produce and non-Irish produce.  That is not to ask too much.</P>
        <P>Labelling is a massive issue in this country and the debate on this will become stronger.  Nobody questions Irish beef because it is the bigger end of the industry.  Irish beef and milk products will sell anywhere but it is the small industries in our agriculture sector that are attacked.  It is very annoying to sit down with a farmer who says &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say you were talking to me&rdquo;.  That is wrong.  The mushroom industry got that right.   Those processors were out of business two or three years ago but they got together and formed a PO.  They now have something the world wants, from a technology point of view as well as product, and have 62% of the market.  We can do the same with all aspects of our smaller industries in the horticultural and food ends of the business.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn was annoyed but I get twice as annoyed, as a person who has gone around the country.  Perhaps he will say I am farm oriented.  However, the multinationals need us as much as we need them.  I predict that in two years&rsquo; time we will not have a single person in horticulture if we do not establish proper and fair labelling for food on the shelf.  If materials are added to or taken away from the product let this be stated, but let one issue not hide another behind it.  That is at the heart of all this.  My portfolio is about protecting the 33,000 jobs involved in the three areas in question but it also concerns growing.  We must work together.  Many issues were discussed in the Chamber by Senators, including that of raw milk whereto names of different people were dropped.  Ireland is an exporting country.  If there is any doubt about a process or any risk involved, one does not take the action in question, for health reasons.     Those who grew up in farming communities in the 1970s and 1980s knew there were consequences from drinking raw milk.  I know it.  If there is a doubt about it, an exporting country like ours should not do it unless we know it is 100% safe.</P>
        <P>Regarding the forestry industry, it goes hand in hand with this area and it has to do with energy costs and so on.  The more we use our forests for wood pellet production or whatever the better and when the refit tariff comes in we will have cheaper energy costs.  All of that helps to bring down the cost of food production.</P><Col N="235"/>
        <P>I would spend hours debating this issue.  We could have the Minister for Health and others here to discuss health and safety but everything to do with agriculture has a health and safety aspect to it.</P>
        <P>We have the best regulations in the world in regard to safety and traceability.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is an independent body.  I met its representatives for the first time last week and I know they will put the consumer first.  They will make a decision based on the consumer and once that is done, we will deal with everything else.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a growing industry and we will make it grow.  The contributions of all Members will help that materialise but we must be in a position whereby the people who grow the food adhere to the best regulations in the world.  It is important that we market the industry, be it at greyhound tracks or wherever.  Almost every Senator and Deputy has a rural or food producing connection.  We must get out and sell what is good.  The jobs are being created on the ground.  I would like to see more Irish people getting involved in horticulture where there are good jobs available.  When those jobs are advertised, people should apply for them.</P>
        <P>There are many issues I did not address individually but I will refer to my notes and get back to the Senator in regard to the question she raised.  I may meet the Senator for perhaps half an hour to discuss it.  I have not been briefed on the point the Senator was making and I would like to hear it again with a view to acting on it.  I thank the Members.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House at this late hour.  The Minister will be aware of the story of the liver transplant that did not happen at the weekend.  We had the media to rely on for the story over the weekend.  I would be grateful if the Minister would give the House an outline of what happened.  It appears now, although I cannot confirm it, that the girl&rsquo;s father has concluded that in future he will have his own private arrangement in place.  I am sure it would be difficult for him to have trust in a future situation.</P>
        <P>It is fair to say that a liver transplant is one of the most difficult transplants that can be done.  Livers are not easily sustained.  There are other organs that in transplant can more readily be organised to do that.  For this girl in particular this is not just a communication breakdown.  We are talking about her life, and the quality of her life is already poor.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that an enormous amount of goodwill has gone into this area over the years.  People have spoken out about the way they have been helped by all the people involved in the medical fields, the Irish Coast Guard and so on.  I pay tribute to the work that has been done.  However, for this girl that is not sufficient.</P>
        <P>I would be grateful if the Minister of State would give the House an outline of what happened.  Specifically, was either the Government jet or another jet made available at any point?  Was it turned down and, if so, why did that happen?  Why was Northern Ireland not an option <Col N="236"/>in this train of events?  The family happened to live close to the Border and given that this girl was on a list for a long time, somebody might have noted the geographical location of her home.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  I thank the Senator for raising it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister announced yesterday that an inquiry is to be set up into the events relating to the case of a 14 year old girl from Leitrim who lost an opportunity for a liver transplant due a failure in patient transportation facilities. The Minister has been in contact with the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, which has undertaken to co-ordinate an inquiry into the events and circumstances surrounding the failure by the Health Service Executive's patient transport services to transfer the teenager to London in time for the operation.</P>
        
        <P>HIQA will work with all of the relevant agencies involved.  It will clarify the facts that led to this situation and will report to the Minister, Deputy Reilly, with recommendations on how best to operate transport arrangements to ensure such a failure does not occur in future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister expressed his deep concern and sympathy to the family over the traumatic events that have led to this lost opportunity.  The Minister would also like to assure the family that the purpose of the HIQA inquiry is to ensure that their family and others in a similar predicament do not face such a heartbreaking outcome in future. It would not be appropriate to get into the detail of the matter until there is a full understanding of the sequence of events, which HIQA will seek to establish.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">An air ambulance service is currently provided by the Air Corps through a service level agreement between the Department of Health and the Department of Defence.  The Air Corps service provides for the following: inter-hospital transfer of patients with spinal or other serious injury or illness; neonates requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland; patients requiring specialised emergency treatment in the UK; organ retrieval teams within Ireland; and paediatric patients requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland. In this particular case the normal stand-by Air Corps helicopter was unavailable as it had been called to another emergency.</P>
        
        <P>There was a short window of time in which the transplantation of the liver could have taken place.  The confusion in arranging transport for the teenager in response to the call that the liver had become available led to a delay.  This resulted in the transplant coordinator in London deciding that the young girl would not arrive in time for the transplant to take place and subsequently the operation was cancelled.</P>
        <P>The HSE national ambulance service has a maritime and aviation operation manual, which is reviewed on an annual basis.  This deals with all types of missions in respect of aero-medical transport of patients to the HSE from the Air Corps and the Irish Coast Guard.</P>
        <P>Since January 2011 to date, 41 air ambulance missions assisting liver transplant patients, neonatal patients, serious illness patients and spinal injury patients have been enacted, both nationally and internationally.  The Irish Coast Guard has facilitated the HSE with the transport of a transplant patient in the past few months, and has assisted the national ambulance services on approximately 15 other occasions.</P>
        <P>The Minister awaits the outcome of the HIQA review in order to address any deficiencies in the current air ambulance service to avoid a similar occurrence in the future.</P>

This may cause a difficulty further down the line.  My specific question is when will the report be available.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take this matter in respect of which I am representing the deaf community.  In Ireland, apart from English and Irish perhaps the most significant other language is Irish sign language.  The Irish deaf community regards Irish sign language as its primary language.  It is the language of the deaf community and the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; in its name has nothing to do with an teanga Gaeilge.  Irish sign language has no official status in Irish legislation and this affects all aspects of a deaf person&rsquo;s life.  There is a lack of Irish sign language translated material and a total lack of general understanding of why Irish sign language is so important to the deaf community.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The programme for Government states it will examine various mechanisms to promote the recognition of Irish sign language.  What type of mechanism does the Government intend to examine?  In what timeframe does it expect to complete the examination?  When does the Minister responsible expect to be in a position to meet and consult the Irish Deaf Society?  Irish sign language, along with British sign language, is recognised in Northern Ireland and in 2004 was formally recognised under the Good Friday agreement.  Recognition of native sign language is being progressed quickly in other European countries such as Hungary, Iceland and, closer to home, Scotland.  The Irish deaf community has approximately 5,000 members who use Irish sign language with approximately 40,000 people supporting them.  It would not cost the earth to make the lives of these 5,000 people better.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 1998, the European Parliament passed a resolution on sign language and in 2010 the Brussels declaration on sign language in the European union was signed.  Will the Government examine these to see how we can advance Irish sign language?  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has been ratified but not signed into law in Ireland.  When will this happen?  It contains four articles specifically relating to the deaf community on accessibility, expression, education and participation in education.  The European Parliament initiatives on sign language are welcome but in Ireland we must look to countries such as Hungary which recently passed legislation and Iceland.  Recently I was excited to read in a newspaper that ISL had been recognised but it was referring to Icelandic sign language and not Ireland.  I ask the Minister for Education and Skills to follow Iceland&rsquo;s example and get Irish sign language recognised.</P>
        <P>Reference to equality in education usually relates to third level.  However, for deaf people who seldom have people to speak for them, we need to include preschool and primary school in the discussion.  I was part of a small group which established the model school for the deaf which was a pilot project for three years and has ceased.  It can be resurrected.  Will the Minister for Education and Skills examine initiatives such as these?  People in the deaf community who do things for themselves should be helped and Irish sign language should be supported.  Deaf children do not have access to Irish sign language in schools and because of this they do not have access to a full curriculum or reach satisfactory levels of education.  This is according to deaf people themselves.  We must do something for them and advance this issue in the House.</P><Col N="238"/>
        <P Just="Left">A second requirement for equalising opportunity is to enable deaf students to do their examinations through Irish sign language.  If our society is really interested in the deaf community and abolishing discrimination will the Minister for Education and Skills please consider what I have said?</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to clarify the position on Irish sign language, ISL.  First, I wish to clarify for the Senator that section 2 of the Official Languages Act 2003 states that the official languages of the State are the Irish language, being the national language and the first official language and the English language, being a second official language as specified in Article 8 of the Constitution.</P>
        <P>Irish sign language has formal recognition in the Education Act 1998.  Under the Act, it is a function of the Minister for Education and Skills to ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person.  This includes provision for students learning through ISL.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives which seek to promote, develop and implement ISL in order that it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system are in place.  These include funding for an ISL weekly home tuition service whereby deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf preschool children and deaf schoolgoing pupils to provide training in ISL for the deaf pupils, their siblings and parents.</P>
        <P>Funding is also made available through the special education support service to enable individual teachers and whole school staff, including staff in special schools for the deaf, to undertake courses in Irish sign language which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers.  In addition, the visiting teacher service for children and young people with a hearing impairment is provided by the Department of Education and Skills from the time of referral through to third level education.  The visiting teacher service provides advice and support to ensure the needs of children and young people with hearing impairment are met.  This service is available at preschool, primary and post-primary levels.</P>
        <P>The Senator may be aware that assessment, rehabilitation and information services for children with a hearing impairment and their families are funded by the HSE, either directly or indirectly.  Services provided include communication therapy and lip-reading classes as well as sign language classes.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Skills, through the Higher Education Authority, HEA, has established and funds a centre for deaf studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL and English interpreters and deaf tutors in deaf studies.  The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bilingualism and sociolinguistics of sign language.  The course is delivered in seminar sessions and group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design.  The HEA has allocated &euro;387,000 in core funding to the centre in the current academic year.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Senator that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has commissioned an external high-level review of the issues surrounding deaf education.  This review will focus on models of provision with reference to evidenced-based outcomes and the implications of adopting various approaches.  I know the Minister for Education and Skills looks forward to receiving the policy advice from the NCSE in this regard.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State is having an easy evening because I have no intention of speaking for four minutes when discussing this issue which is, perhaps, somewhat parochial.  A school in a village called Kealkill, approximately six miles from Bantry, has experienced many difficulties with prefabricated buildings falling down, etc.  The local community, school principal and board of management have shown great community spirit by raising money to purchase additional land for a playground.  The problem the school now has is that it is using a prefabricated structure as a classroom.  While I do not usually raise matters of a parochial nature on the Adjournment, I have strong feelings about this remote, rural school.  I ask that the Department, in lieu of renting a prefabricated structure for a long period, consider having a small extension carried out to facilitate the classroom in question.</P>

	<P>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in schools building projects and the position regarding Kealkill national school in Bantry, County Cork.</P>
        <P>The current staffing level at Kealkill national school is a principal and two mainstream teachers.  The school, which also has the services of one learning support-resource teacher, is located in a permanent school building with additional temporary accommodation consisting of one mainstream classroom and one resource room.  Its enrolment was 76 pupils at September 2010 as against 64 enrolments in 2006.  It is not experiencing the rapid increase in enrolments which has occurred in other schools around the county.</P>
        <P>The Department has allocated grants under the summer works scheme to the school to assist it in maintaining the existing school building.  In 2005, a grant was approved for ceiling repairs, and in 2008 it received a grant for fencing and in 2010 a further grant was approved for roofing repairs.  The Department is not in receipt of any current application for capital funding from the school.  Should there be a need for additional accommodation at the school, it is open to the school authorities to submit an application form which can be found on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P><Col N="240"/>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, all applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based in particular on the demographics of an area, condition of school buildings, site capacity and so forth, leading to an appropriate accommodation solution.  The progression of all such assessed large-scale building projects then falls for consideration in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multiannual school building and modernisation programme, having regard to competing demands and available capital funding.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator again for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding Kealkill national school in Bantry, County Cork.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  When I went through details of foreign languages being offered in the education system, with particular reference to what I consider to be minority languages, I was surprised to learn that Mandarin Chinese does not feature on the school curriculum.  To put the issue in context, in the junior certificate uptake last year, five schools provided Hebrew studies for 165 pupils, while Hebrew studies was provided in four schools for 104 pupils in the leaving certificate.  Arabic is being provided by ten schools for ten pupils and in 2010 three schools provided ancient Greek for 20 pupils.  While I do not have anything against the classics and I was fascinated by the number of pupils taking Hebrew studies at junior and leaving certificate levels, based on a number of comments made to me and research I have carried out and the growing cultural and trade links with China, it is self-evident that the Department should give consideration to offering Mandarin Chinese as a curriculum subject.</P>
        <P>The most recent trade figures show that Ireland trebled its exports to China between March 2010 and March 2011.  I understand that while the Chinese embassy website has an education section, the material supplied does not refer to learning Mandarin.  I pay tribute to the UCD Confucius Institute for Ireland which has been actively developing and promoting the subject of Chinese and culture for post-primary schools with the result that in the academic year 2011-12 Chinese language and culture will be officially taught in Irish post-primary schools nationally, first as a transition year unit with the aim of expanding to become a full curricular subject.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for providing me with much background information, including a copy of an article which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  The piece was written by Dr. Liming Wang, co-author of the book, <i>Doing Business in China: The Irish Experience</i>.  The article notes that China achieved GDP growth of 10.3% in 2010 in the middle of a world recession, has overtaken Germany as the world&rsquo;s largest exporter and is the second largest economy in the world after the United States.  Already, 50 million people around the globe are learning Chinese, with schools showing an ever increasing interest in the subject.  However, according to research published in the aforementioned book, lack of language competence and ignorance of Chinese culture inhibits trade synergies between the two sides.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Dr. Wang notes that a national survey of post-primary schools conducted by the UCDConfucius Institute for Ireland found that Irish schools would like to have Mandarin on the curriculum.  Thus far, a national syllabus has not been agreed and courses vary in nature according to the needs and objectives of each school.  According to Dr. Wang, the &ldquo;absence of a formal Irish syllabus or examination course limits the recognition students can gain for their learning&rdquo;.  He adds &ldquo;The growth of the Chinese economy and the enormous business potential <Col N="241"/>to Ireland is far greater than that provided by countries such as France and Germany, whose languages are currently promoted by the post-primary Languages Initiative.&rdquo;  Chinese, he wrote, is arguably &ldquo;more important than even the current &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; languages of French and German&rdquo;.  I add a caveat to the extent that Germany ranks among our largest three trading partners.  Dr. Wang believes the cost of not including Mandarin in an admittedly crowded curriculum would be much greater than the cost of not meeting this challenge and he notes that Mandarin is already a curriculum language in many countries, including the United Kingdom, where its popularity is steadily growing.  I agree with his conclusion that if Ireland does not act quickly, it will be left behind.</P>

	<P>I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue.</P>
        <P>A range of foreign languages is available on the curriculum in schools &mdash; French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese and Arabic &mdash; at post-primary level.  A post-primary languages initiative has been in place since 2000 with the objective of diversifying language provision in schools, focusing particularly on Spanish, Italian, Japanese and Russian.  Some 81% of second level pupils study three languages, Irish, English and a continental language, to completion of upper second level and more than 70% of schools offer two foreign languages or more.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the demand for expansion of the range of languages on offer in post-primary schools, particularly in regard to Mandarin Chinese and Polish.  However, the fact remains that continued reductions in public expenditure will be essential over the coming years, allied with further reductions in public sector numbers.  Of necessity, this must constrain the degree to which additional subjects can be accommodated in our schools.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the importance of Chinese language learning in promoting trade and development between Ireland and China as part of the Asia strategy.  The core issue is what model of language provision best serves the strategic needs of business and industry in furthering trade and development with China and how scarce resources should be prioritised.</P>
        <P>While there are many cultural advantages to widening access to language learning generally in schools, provision of a limited number of hours tuition in the context of the school curriculum would not necessarily equip students with the language skills needed to do business with or in China, nor would it be targeted at a population with this specific need in mind.  A more targeted and intensive provision can be provided in further or higher education.  Postgraduate and honours degree level programmes in Chinese are offered in University College Cork and honours degree level programmes are provided in University College Dublin and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  In addition, a post-leaving certificate course in Chinese with business studies is offered in Ballsbridge College of Further Education and a further 15 higher and further education colleges offer part-time evening courses in Chinese at modest cost.  The Institutes for Chinese Studies in UCD and UCC both offer tuition on an outreach basis to schools in their locality, in partnership with the Confucius Institutes.  The Department will continue to work closely with the colleges and the Confucius Institutes to support and progress this initiative.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In higher education in the 2009 to 2010 period, a total of 5,200 students were enrolled on programmes with a foreign language component, an overall increase of 16% since 2007.  The institutes of technology, or IoT, languages strategy network is adopting a proactive approach to language learning and training, fostering inter-institutional collaboration for languages in the sector.  The Erasmus study abroad programme has seen an increase in the number of students who have taken a study visit or placement abroad.</P><Col N="242"/>
        <P>The Department and its agencies will continue to engage with industry to ensure that education responds in so far as it is possible to the emerging needs of enterprise in this area.  The issue of additional languages in second level schools will be revisited when the budgetary situation improves.  I again thank the Senator for raising this matter.</P>

	<P>I am grateful to the Minister for elaborating on the issue I raised.  In the continuing review and monitoring of language availability in our schools, I notice Russian is given a priority.  However, the burgeoning trade between Ireland and China would suggest, in respect of how other countries are approaching this issue, that there is a need for the Department to monitor how it is developing in terms of the application of Russian, how many students are taking Russian and what impact it is having commercially and to weigh that up against the importance of the Chinese economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I will convey the Senator&rsquo;s views to the Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  In the last 12 months there have been increasing trade opportunities with Russia, particularly within the agricultural sector, so we might need to continue focusing on that language.  However, I agree with the Senator that we should have an ongoing rolling review of foreign language provision in second level schools to ensure that it best meets the needs of students and of industry and trade in opening new markets in coming years.</P>
