	<P>I have notice from Senator John Kelly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter: </P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to discuss the situation of the dismissed fire fighters in Roscommon County Council.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to outline the role of public health nurses in the new child and family agency and the way its service will be integrated to ensure we provide a seamless service for children and families.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Kelly and Healy Eames as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Nurses and Midwives Bill 2010 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at noon and conclude not later than 2 p.m., if not previously concluded.  There will be a sos between 2 p.m. and 2.30 p.m.  No. 2, Water Services (Amendment) Bill &mdash; Committee Stage, will be taken at 2.30 p.m. and the business is to be interrupted at 5 p.m. for Private Members&rsquo; business and resumed at 7 p.m., if not previously concluded.  No. 14, motion No. 6, Private Members&rsquo; business, will commence at 5 p.m. and conclude not later than 7 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I commend the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, for his decision yesterday to hold an independent inquiry into the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme on Irish missionaries abroad, in light of the judgment in favour of Fr. Kevin Reynolds.  It is an important step forward that there is an independent investigation into the matter.  I commend the Minister and the Government on taking this welcomed step.  The inquiry will carry out its function outside this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Every day the media reports on proposals for the budget.  Today we read the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, proposes to introduce a &euro;50 charge on medical card holders and a trebling of the prescription fee.  These proposed changes were raised at the Fine Gael and <Col N="624"/>Labour Party parliamentary party meetings.  We can raise such matters with the Leader, but the problem is that we are not getting a proper debate on the budget proposals.  Our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues have asked three times, and we have supported them, to allow a half day pre-budget debate in order that the Opposition parties raise the issues that are being raised by various groups, representative of the elderly and those with disabilities as well as others.  I ask the Leader to set aside a half day next week for this pre-budget debate.  I know the Minister for Finance will be exceptionally busy and I am not necessarily expecting him or the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to come to the House.  However, there are other Ministers, for example, the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, is effectively without a portfolio as NewERA is not up and running, who could come to this House.  If the Leader has the option only of a full day sitting on Monday, I do not mind as this House should have an opportunity to discuss and debate the pre-budget submissions.    If we do not, I will raise these issues and call for votes on them each morning.</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has tabled 75 amendments while the Sinn F&eacute;in Party has tabled 24 amendments to the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2010.  Committee Stage should not have to conclude today.  I see the Leader has allowed time after Private Members&rsquo; business, which is fine.  However, Report and Final Stages will be taken tomorrow.  That is not the way to do business.  This is not emergency legislation.  We have no difficulty in facilitating the Government in introducing emergency legislation, having done so in the past.  There is no need to finish Committee Stage of the Water Services (Amendment) Bill today, however.</P>
        <P>While I commend the Leader and the other members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for organising a public consultation in the Chamber tomorrow afternoon, it will only be for two hours.  People will be attending from across the country on this matter but we are only providing two hours on it because Report and Final Stages of the Water Services (Amendment) Bill will be taken tomorrow afternoon at 5 o&rsquo;clock.</P>
        <P>I propose the Leader allows Committee Stage run and the House to sit on Friday and Monday to deal with these amendments properly.  At the same time, we should not restrict the time given for tomorrow&rsquo;s public consultation &mdash; one of the most important departures the Seanad has taken in how it does its business in several years &mdash; with the advocacy groups for the elderly.</P>
        <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that no guillotine be allowed on Committee Stage of the Water Services (Amendment) Bill, that the House sits on Friday, and if necessary on Monday, to deal with all Committee Stage amendments and to deal with Report and Final Stages next Tuesday, thereby ensuring our citizens attending the House tomorrow will have sufficient time to put their cases and views on the elderly and there will be a proper discussion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien in welcoming yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, of an inquiry in the Fr. Reynolds case.  It is good that all Members acknowledge that such an inquiry needed to be established.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s call for a pre-budget debate, there was one yesterday with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, on the capital infrastructure programme.  The Minister, however, was not treated with the greatest respect by the other side of the House with interruptions during his opening statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I was here and did not interrupt him once.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="625"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, we all disagree across the floor of the House and we, when in opposition, had disagreements with Fianna F&aacute;il Party Ministers.  However, we do try to treat people with respect.  In my time here, the Seanad has had a positive tradition of treating people with courtesy and respect when they are making points with which others may not agree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is a sensitive soul.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Here is another example of disagreeing respectfully.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with Senator Bacik on this.  The Minister was treated with respect yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Bacik to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>While I believe we should have pre-budget debates, some of which have already been facilitated such as yesterday with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and last week with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, they must be conducted with a modicum of courtesy, even when there is disagreement as there should be.</P>
        <P>Regarding this morning&rsquo;s headline on a proposed charge on medical cards, I must point out to Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien that no decision has yet been made in this regard.  It was also somewhat premature of Members on the Fianna F&aacute;il Party side to accuse Labour Party Members of U-turns on third level fees last week.  The Labour Party made commitments on retaining the abolition of third level fees and holding a line on social welfare rate cuts.  They remain Labour Party policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>What about child benefit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, said last week, it is important to acknowledge that other areas need to be examined.  When she suggested creative reforms that will save the Exchequer money, such as the reform of sick pay arrangements which many employers may welcome because it will give them more control over absence due to sickness, it is important both sides of the House listen with courtesy and respect.  Reforms such as this must be dealt with in a creative manner.  It is not good enough, especially for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, to oppose every single measure the Government proposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why interruptions occur.  We are not opposing every single measure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not make false promises.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Go on, let Senator Bacik have her run today.  I missed her during the week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Members opposite should remember the word &ldquo;amnesia&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The people will remember the Government&rsquo;s promises.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il does not know the meaning of the word &ldquo;amnesia&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, also seems not to know the meaning of the word.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="626"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Bacik to continue, without interruption.  Does she have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader organise a debate on foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East?  I welcome the release last week of Dr. Rafah Nached in Syria.  I had called for it in this House and circulated a cross-party motion on it.  I will circulate an updated motion to take account of her release and the ongoing appalling oppression in Syria.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonnCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Eamonn Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Later in Private Members&rsquo; business, the Independent Senators will present a motion on child health issues.  Yesterday, Members attended a briefing in the audio-visual room by Professor Donal O&rsquo;Shea, University College Dublin, and Professor Niall Mynagh, Dublin City University, on childhood obesity levels and learned of the shocking statistics concerning the long-term health implications of these.  This Private Members&rsquo; debate is important to every Member.  I seek the support of fellow Senators to be present this afternoon for Private Members&rsquo; business and ensure a robust debate.  Will the Leader confirm if the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, will attend this debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Senator Eamonn Coghlan and the other Taoiseach-nominated Senators for bringing forward this important issue on Private Members&rsquo; time.  I certainly intend to attend and participate in the debate.  It is an issue in which the Seanad can play a role in heightening public awareness of a growing issue of concern.  Very often people can get lost in technicalities.  The issues involved in childhood obesity and health are stark, however.</P>
        <P>I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, of an inquiry into &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; and the important issue which arose with the documentary programme on which many Senators have spoken.  It is important the terms of reference of this investigation are sufficiently broad, so it will not just examine the transactional narrative of who decided what, who checked out what and who authorised what, but also to understand the psychology behind the appalling defamation of and failure in the duty of care to Fr. Kevin Reynolds.</P>
        <P>I have already raised the issue as to whether there could be some kind of institutional bias against the clergy arising out of scandals and the fact an Am&aacute;rach report showed 42% of people believe 20% of the clergy are abusers when the correct figure is that between 3% and 4% have been accused of abuse.  When there is such a level of misinformation on an issue of such profound importance, one must ask about the media&rsquo;s role in it.  The media plays an enormous role in shaping public understandings of issues.  It is helpful this information is in the public domain when we consider what happened to Fr. Kevin Reynolds.  If there were any question that any sector in our society was seen as pariahs and not entitled to the same level of due care as everyone else, it must be explored.  We cannot conclude on that point but it is a fair question to ask.  I hope the compliance committee of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will be in a position to ask those questions in a fair but an intense manner to establish what went wrong in this case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister for Defence attend the House to explain the lack of delivery of legal services in the Defence Forces?  An average of 14 to 16 courts martial are held within the Defence Forces each year.  However, no courts martial have been held for over a year.  I am of the opinion, therefore, that a reshuffle is required within the legal services of the Defence Forces and I ask that the Minister appear before the House to discuss the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to bring the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government before the House to discuss the ongoing situation in respect of Priory Hall.  Members are aware that the residents of Priory <Col N="627"/>Hall have been living in unprecedented and cruel conditions in recent months.  Many of us have raised this matter in the House during the past month or so.  Some Members may have met the residents when they held a protest outside the gates of Leinster House yesterday.</P>
        <P>While Mr. Justice Kearns took a passionate approach to the residents in the High Court case, Dublin City Council has sought at every turn to absolve itself of any responsibility for catering for the needs of families with small children.  The council sought an eviction order so that it might kick the residents out of their homes but it did not have any plan regarding where they might go.  When the High Court found in favour of the residents and directed Dublin City Council to pay for their temporary accommodation, the council lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court.  Whatever about the legal reasoning employed by the council, this shows an incredible lack of humanity in the period leading up to Christmas.</P>
        <P>It appears the council is taking instruction from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in respect of this matter.  It also appears the council is relying on terms such as &ldquo;legal precedent&rdquo;, &ldquo;consulting the Minister and departmental officials&rdquo; and &ldquo;our hands are tied&rdquo;.  The residents have repeatedly sought a meeting with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government but he has refused all requests.  It is for these reasons that I decided to table my amendment and I ask Members on all sides to support it.  This is not a party political issue and I understand that Members on the other side of the House genuinely care about the residents and their plight.  The very least the residents of Priory Hall deserve is 20 minutes of the Minister&rsquo;s time in order that he might listen to their stories regarding what they have endured, outline in clear terms the instructions, if any, his Department has given to Dublin City Council and accept responsibility for the situation.</P>
        <P>Let us be clear in respect of this matter.  Priory Hall is but the first of many cases that will arise throughout the country.  Individual councils will be approaching the Department and seeking advice on how to deal with these cases.  It is time the Minister levelled with the residents and accepted that this is a national issue for which he has responsibility.  I ask all Members to support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>As the person who yesterday called for a public inquiry into the libelling of Fr. Kevin Reynolds, I welcome the decision taken by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, to hold an immediate inquiry.  I hope the inquiry will cover all aspects of the television programme which gave rise to this matter.  I also hope it will cover a complaint made to RTE by members of the family of a deceased missionary in respect of the treatment of their relative.  In view of the fact that the evidence presented in respect of Fr. Reynolds proved to be so untrue and inaccurate, all aspects of the programme must be investigated thoroughly in order to ensure that no person &mdash; regardless of whether he or she is dead of alive &mdash; has been treated wrongly by RTE.</P>
        <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, in respect of a new direction for the delivery of services to people who are experiencing homelessness.  The Minister&rsquo;s new approach will ensure that the money will follow the client and that the provision of funding will be linked directly to specific targets and outcomes.  This will allow service providers to focus&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Will the Leader make time available for the Minister to appear before the House to provide Members with clarification and further information in respect of his plans to ease the problem of homelessness?  I welcome the fact that the Minister plans to move away from heavy dependence on emergency accommodation in hostels and private bed and breakfast establishments.  We all want the homeless to be housed in permanent accom<Col N="628"/>modation of a type that is much more suitable to their needs.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement earlier this morning and I want him to follow through on it.  I would be interested in obtaining clarification in respect of this matter and also in having the Minister outline what are his targets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Power&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business in respect of the residents of Priory Hall.  Unfortunately, I will not be in a position to vote on the matter because I will be delivering to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government a message relating to the dog breeding&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seconding the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I would be very happy to second it, if that is agreeable.</P>
        <P>Mr. Kevin Cardiff is appearing before a committee of the European Parliament today.  I do not wish to impugn the reputation of Mr. Cardiff and all I know about him is already a matter of general knowledge.  However, questions have been raised at the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of certain matters, particularly the &euro;3.6 billion that went missing and the advice given to Ministers in the lead up to the events which gave rise to our current and disastrous financial situation.  Will the Leader confirm whether it is true that Members of the European Parliament who belong to Government parties and who expressed particular views have been instructed to abstain or withdraw from the hearing relating to Mr. Cardiff?  If it is true that they have been so instructed, that will be an extremely serious development.  Those to whom I refer were elected not to represent specific Government policies.  Rather, they were elected to represent the people of Ireland in the European Parliament.  If they do not ask the questions they should ask, they will be in dereliction of their duties.  It would appear very bad if questions had arisen about a person and if the Government decided to foist that individual on Europe.  This matter relates to our financial standing and to our reputation.  I look forward to a reply from the Leader on that matter.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Senator Michael Mullins referred to the appalling case relating to Fr. Kevin Reynolds, a matter I have raised on previous occasions.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has spoken of the necessity of holding an inquiry independent of RTE.  The latter has established its own inquiry.  I agree with the Minister because there is a very important principle at issue here.  I wonder whether what is being done in this instance will be extended to other areas of the media.  I have been involved in debates on various items of legislation, including that under which the Press Council was established.  That council was not given any powers and it is not even compulsory for members of the media to joint it.  The council has no power to impose sanctions and is not independent of the newspaper industry.  Every newspaper has carried editorials regarding every other profession in which it has been stated that the only credible regulatory body is one that is independent.  As already stated, the body which regulates newspapers is not independent.  I would like the House to be provided with some information on that matter.</P>
        <P>During the passage of what became the Defamation Act 2009, the then Government promised a parallel Bill on privacy.  The Leader played an important role in arguing cogently in respect of this matter.  I remember that very well because he was one of a small number of people prepared to do so.  The privacy legislation to which I refer has not yet been forthcoming.  Is the Leader in a position to indicate when the Government will introduce such legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I commend the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, for the establishment of an independent inquiry into the libelling <Col N="629"/>of Fr. Kevin Reynolds.  I also commend Senator Mullins who yesterday requested that such an inquiry be set up.  It is to be hoped that the inquiry will deal, fairly and squarely, with all issues, including objectivity, impartiality and fairness.  However, like Senator Mullen, I am concerned with regard to the general level of misinformation that appears to obtain.  There is a grave danger that some of that misinformation may have taken hold in sections of the media, particularly RTE.  As Senator Norris indicated, a very grave error has been made.  I commend the Government, the Minister and everyone else involved in establishing the inquiry and I look forward to the emergence of its findings in a few months.</P>
        <P>In dealing with the pre-budget debates, which Senator O&rsquo;Brien rightly called for &mdash; in fairness, he touches on it here every day &mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in are in a sense shooting blind.  We are dealing with speculation to a large extent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why I am asking for a debate.</P>

	<P>Senator Coghlan is nearly out of time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to be objective about this.  I believe the Minister, Deputy Howlin, was treated discourteously here yesterday.  The Leader may have to revisit the issue of the restructure of statements followed by questions and answers, which we all think are valuable.  We must structure it properly.  With respect, the Chair comes into this.  The Cathaoirleach or whoever is in his place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is for the Leader this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, the Leader will deal with it but it concerns the Cathaoirleach also.  One needs a strict, firm Chairman in dealing with these question and answer situations such as we witnessed yesterday.  I raise it merely to seek the Leader&rsquo;s views.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, if there was any ill-treatment of the Minister yesterday, we will raise it at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because if there is a specific complaint, we would certainly be interested in hearing it.  Certainly, when I was present he was not treated disrespectfully.  If the Minister was treated disrespectfully at any stage of the debate from within my grouping, I will deal with that matter.  I would hope we might discuss the matter at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and maybe get some details and see how that can be rectified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I can give evidence for Senator O&rsquo;Brien.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I welcome the independent inquiry which has been established by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte. <Col N="630"/> I remind the Leader that a number of weeks ago Senators from all political parties sought a debate on media standards in this country following what had happened in Britain in terms of the <i>News of the World.</i>  Perhaps that is something that should be followed up here in this House.  I hope over the next number of weeks the Leader will provide space for it.</P>
        <P>I also, for the fifth time at this point, reiterate the call for the need to have a proper pre-budget debate.  While reference was made to members of the Opposition shooting in the dark, are we shooting in the dark, for example, when the Minister for Finance has confirmed that VAT will increase by 2%, which will devastate many retailers in the country?</P>

	<P>Yesterday the Minister for Health announced cuts in the health budget that will remove 1,000 hospital beds from the public service, 40 nursing homes are to close and a &euro;50 charge is to be imposed on those on medical cards.  This will be a &euro;50 charge on the less well-off in society.  It is a charge on sick persons.  It will present many who need treatment from getting it.  The Government promised to protect those on social welfare.  It is at pains to point out that the social welfare rates themselves will not be cut, but imposing a &euro;50 charge on those with medical cards is the same as taking money from the rates because it will impact on those on social welfare.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a wealth of information about what will be in the budget.  As I stated yesterday, it is madness that every day we wake up there is more information being presented and put into the public domain by Ministers about what is in the budget.  Parliamentarians in Germany were discussing what is in the budget, yet here in this House we are not being given the opportunity to do so.</P>

        <P>The final point I would make is about having courteous and respectful debates in this House.  We all should hold our hands up and say that yesterday was not one of the best debates we had but representatives of the Government parties and the Minister should also hold up their hands.  The Minister interrupted many speakers here yesterday.  That was part of the problem and the reason the debate yesterday was not what it should have been.</P>

We wonder why there might be speculation, which I cannot confirm, about a &euro;50 medical card charge on application.  The answer might lie <Col N="631"/>this morning in the fact that the EU will monitor us long after 2013 when we might get back into the markets.  Such is the level of intrusive EU and IMF scrutiny to which we will be subject.  Whenever I try to resolve a problem, I go back to first principles.  I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for subjecting us and generations of Irish people to such intensive EU scrutiny.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On an equally important matter, I wonder can we do something about companies such as Aviva, which today finally confirmed that all its promises have come to nought and the workers in all branches will be let go by June.  There is a call centre being maintained in Galway.  That is about it.  The Leader might discuss with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, whether there is a code of conduct or a code of decency that we could require of companies in order that such companies would not string their workers out and  there would be some responsibility to workers.  We are in a recession and this may be coming down the line with other companies and other workers.  It is not good enough that false hope is being dangled to workers.  Meanwhile, families are hanging on.  Families cannot plan in the absence of accurate information.  If the Leader could look at that, we would be doing a decent act for many.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader if tomorrow he would consider marking the start of the 16 days of action opposing violence against women, which is organised by Women&rsquo;s Aid nationally but which is also an international campaign.  It would be important at some stage that Members would have an opportunity tomorrow to mark this event.  It is an important issue.</P>
        <P>I will not propose a vote on the amendment to the Order of Business provided the Leader gives me an undertaking that he will allow time to discuss statutory instruments, SI 527 of 2011, the Road Traffic (Bus Lanes) (Exemption) Regulations 2011, merely to make the point that this is a major decision by the Government.  It was opposed by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  It was a majority decision by the Cabinet that will allow non-Garda drivers drive Cabinet Ministers in the bus lanes, and also Ministers of State who regularly attend Cabinet meetings &mdash; that could be a broad brush &mdash; and the Ceann Comhairle, but not, strangely enough, the Cathaoirleach.  The Cathaoirleach is not exempt, in case he thinks he is.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="633"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>On a more important matter than bus lanes, I believe the Fr. Kevin Reynolds issue was discussed for 20 minutes at Cabinet yesterday, which indicates how seriously the Government is taking this matter.  I commend the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Cabinet for referring the issue to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and I look forward to a full, comprehensive investigation into the processes used and the editorial decisions regarding the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme.</P>
        <P>With regard to the upcoming budget, I agree with the principle adopted in many other European countries whereby budgets are discussed before budget day, there is robust and detailed debate on the various budget submissions and each issue is gone through in detail and the Budget Statement is effectively a summing up of a period of parliamentary consideration on the budget.  For budget 2012 and beyond, I urge the Leader to try and ensure that the Government adopts a different model for debating the budget and to ensure that both the D&aacute;il and Seanad have a greater role in the process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to make a point with regard to health cuts.  I hope the Minister for Health is also looking at cutting payments to consultants, who are paid six figure sums.  I sincerely hope he is looking at renegotiating GP contracts.  Some GPs in certain parts of the country earn almost &euro;1 million a year from the State, whereas GPs in England only earn up to between &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000.  We need to start with cuts at the top.  If we do that and do a deal with those at the top, the people on lower pay will be prepared to share the burden.  However, when they see bankers, consultants and other people still earning mega bucks, even though the country is effectively run from abroad, that is a concern.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the economics of health and to examine how this House can play its part in returning to basics and basic health economics.  What has happened is that we have a two-tier process.  There is a gold-plated tier at the top, who are becoming multimillionaires in the health area, while the people at the bottom are suffering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to bring to the attention of the Members a very sad article written under the pseudonym of Annie Shipsey in the <i>Village</i> magazine about the problem with regard to special needs assistants.  The article was entitled Thank you Mr. Timothy Geithner and I recommend that everybody in the Oireachtas read it.  As a result of this article, I have been asked to put a few specific questions to the Minister for Education and Skills and I would be very grateful if the Leader would convey these questions to him.  The questions are as follows.  How many special needs assistants are employed by the Department?  How many special needs assistant whole-time equivalents are being used by our schools?  How many special education teaching hours have been allocated, but go unused by our schools?   I ask the Leader to note that I do not ask what resources have been allocated, because we know those figures, but what resources are applied, because there appears to be a disconnect between what has been allocated officially and what has been applied.  There is a suspicion in some quarters that this a form of stealth cutback.  May I have clarification in this regard?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to mention with respect the awful injustice perpetrated on Fr. Reynolds.  As I mentioned yesterday, one of our first priorities, not just in RTE but across the entire public service, except in cases where there is a personal issue, should be to ensure that gag orders cannot be applied when the State makes any kind of a settlement with anyone injured by the State.  Time after time in the health service, I have seen gag orders applied, a quiet payment being made and the people in authority who made the error getting away with it.  The question we must ask as we go forward to investigate what happened in this case is whether as a country we have suffered from having too much or too little investigative journalism.  The answer is pretty obvious.  In the past ten to 20 years, we have had a complete shortage of appropriate, terrier-like investigative journalism of the kind which might have uncovered problems here <Col N="634"/>before they became insoluble.  We must not try to turn the press, the watchdogs of the people, into poodles.</P>
        <P>With regard to proposed amendments to the Order of Business, I would take suggestions on the Order of Business much more seriously if I felt that Members were using the time we spend in this House more productively if they were not getting involved in endless procedural wranglings.  If we had a little more discipline and tried to pretend this was not a kindergarten food fight between two spoiled children most of the time, we would get through the Order of Business within the allocated time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I commend Senator Conway for his comments on how the Minister for Health should try to bring some degree of control to spending within his Department.  Senator Conway has raised some of the difficult but fundamental questions that need to be addressed.  I also agree with him with regard to his aspiration that the budgetary process and debate will be more open and commence earlier.  This is something members of the Fine Gael Party have advocated for a number of years.  It would be useful, particularly at a time of economic distress, to have a long run-in and lengthy opportunity to debate the spending and taxation options.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I join my colleagues in commending the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Government with regard to the decision to launch the public inquiry into the Fr. Reynolds matter and the situation at RTE.  In that regard, I hope we will have some time in the next few months to have a debate on the topic of tolerance.  One of the issues touched on by Senator Michael Mullins and others, is the question of the possible intolerance which now applies to people of religious faith in this country.  The issue of tolerance and how society is becoming more intolerant and negative towards religion and the hundreds of thousands of people here who practise their religion regularly needs ventilation and debate.  There are major issues now in education, the health service and across the political spectrum, where people of religious views are being challenged and we need a debate on tolerance and respect for religion in this State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on the role being played by the Revenue Commissioners.  There was discussion last week on the Order of Business with regard to the Revenue Commissioners exerting undue pressure on businesses, farmers and the farming community to pay taxes when they did not have the money to do so and the Revenue Commissioners showing little or no flexibility in that regard.  This was causing businesses to close and damaging the prospects of new employment being created.  I also question the role being played by the customs section of the Revenue Commissioners with regard to a number of cases in my constituency.  One of these concerned a person from Donegal with a registered business in the North of Ireland who spends most of his time in the North and whose vehicle was seized recently.  Instead of engaging with the individual the Revenue officers contacted the finance HP company which is located in the United Kingdom and told it the vehicle had been seized.  That HP company now wants the vehicle returned.  This gentleman stands to lose approximately &euro;15,000 or &euro;16,000 and his business, which employs eight people just across the Border from Donegal, is now under serious threat.  That should not be allowed continue.  At the very least that man should have been allowed an exemption under SI 60/1993 which is referred to in section 135(<i>a</i>) of the Finance Act.  I fail to understand the reason the Revenue Commissioners would victimise an individual in such a manner.  This morning I e-mailed the Minister for Finance and officials in that Department but we need an urgent debate on the role played by the Revenue Commissioners because they are hounding people.  It is not fair.</P><Col N="635"/>
        <P>I support the amendment to the Order of Business on the taking of the Water Services (Amendment) Bill today.  I hope the Leader might agree to the sensible proposal from Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien because the large volume of amendments submitted by Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il cannot be discussed in their entirety in two and a half hours.  I hope the Leader of the House will allow us debate the Bill until midnight tonight and resume it on Friday because if debate on that issue is stifled in the same manner it was stifled last week it will undermine the status of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and hold this House in contempt.</P>

	<P>I was present for the entire debate in the Chamber yesterday referred to by other speakers earlier.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, was treated with a level of disrespect.  When we invite Ministers to the House for statements the least we could do is treat them with the respect they deserve, and everyone here deserves that respect.  Some of the Opposition spokespersons constantly heckled the Minister, certainly towards the latter part of the debate.  It is disingenuous for some Opposition spokespersons to say the Minister acted with anything less than impeccable decorum when he was here.  The person who made that statement should be grateful to the Minister because he corrected one of the Opposition speakers yesterday who introduced a topic that was not being discussed.  That might be the reason the offence is being taken.  I support Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s suggestion that we re-examine our procedures, particularly in regard to statements.  Such debates are valuable but as they stand currently it leaves it open for what is called abuse of our positions where people are more interested in scoring petty points against invited guests to this House than making a meaningful contribution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>In my publication A New Approach to Ageing and Ageism I highlight that the greatest achievement of the 20th century was the increase in longevity.  The contribution to that is a higher standard of living for everyone, the availability of drugs etc., an awareness of diseases and the need for people to mind their health.  Today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> reports on the result of a fascinating survey which highlighted that cancer survival rates are six times better than those of a generation ago.  As this Seanad has one of the leading cancer consultants in the world in our presence it would be very interesting for him to bring us up to date on the area.  For instance, a woman with breast cancer today can live ten years longer now.  Those with colon cancer can live ten years longer and those with non-Hodgkin lymphoma can live ten years longer also but survival rates for those with lung, brain and pancreatic cancers can be weeks rather than years.</P>
        <P>The Leader, Senator Cummins, has been most innovative to date and I suggest it would be unique to have one of our own Members make a professional presentation to the House on the advances in cancer treatment and where the money and research should be going in the future.  It is a good idea.  We are all aware that Senator Crown has saved the lives of many people suffering from cancer and it is my pleasure to make that suggestion to the Leader.</P>

We should give as much time as possible to the septic tank debate.  It is a major issue not just in rural Ireland; it will affect some urban areas as well.  It is not just an urban-rural question and therefore it is important that as much time as possible should be given to debate all the amendments tabled.</P>
        <P>I raise the issue of Aviva Insurance.  I ask that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, be invited to the House to discuss the negotiations that are ongoing with Aviva regarding its proposal to close down all of its outlets in the Republic.  It is a huge blow.  There is a base in Galway and there is talk of having a call centre based there but it does not bode well for Ireland.  I would also like to know how it relates into the issue of upward only rent reviews.  Is it one of the major issues impacting Aviva&rsquo;s decision and, if so, what does the Government intend to do to tackle that issue?  It appears to be dragging its heels on it.  What are the plans for job creation?  Many jobs are still being lost but where are the jobs to be created?</P>
        <P>We need a debate on the budgetary issues referred to by previous speakers.  We are discussing issues such as septic tanks, the household charge, etc., in this House.  They are all measures that will hit the low income families but the well is dry.  Those families cannot afford to pay any more.  When will we have a decent debate on taxing the wealthy in this society as mentioned by Senator Conway?  They are the wealthy elite in the golden circles in this economy who can afford to share more of the burden.  We need a serious debate and that should happen pre-budget to ensure the positive contributions we make can be taken on board in the pre-budget period and also in the Estimates.

I <Col N="637"/>also understand eight nominations will come before the committee in question today, of which six will be approved and two referred for further examination.</P>
        <P>Is it possible to increase the number of new Bills commencing in the House?  In recent weeks, a Bill was published to address the cash for gold business where stolen items are being exchanged for cash and melted down before the Garda are informed.  In recent days, a Garda superintendent informed me of a case involving two young lads who left secondary school at lunchtime, removed a copper cylinder from a vacant house and traded it in for &euro;50 from a scrap metal merchant the same evening.  When the garda&iacute; went to secure evidence, the copper cylinder had unfortunately been melted into a small block and they were unable to secure much evidence.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is anxious to have the legislation enacted at an early date.  Could the Bill be commenced in this House if it has not already been commenced in the D&aacute;il?</P>

	<P>I will speak briefly about rumours that a &euro;50 charge may be introduced for the issuing of medical cards.  I informed the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, that if he were considering this option, he should first examine general practitioner contracts and bear in mind that GPs are well paid for patients they accept on their panel who may be an elderly person who attends the GP clinic daily or someone else who never visits the doctor.  The Minister should ensure that persons who apply for a medical card are not charged &euro;50 by a general practitioner to stamp a form indicating that the applicant has been accepted as a patient.  GPs must stop charging &euro;50 every time a person needs a letter stating he or she has a back ache in order that he or she will have a better case for obtaining a medical card or having a medical card renewed.  They must also stop charging medical card holders, including elderly people, &euro;20 to take bloods.</P>
        <P>To use the Minister&rsquo;s words, they should take the shoe box off the desk in order that elderly people who have medical cards no longer believe that by giving the doctor an extra &euro;30, &euro;40 or &euro;50 they will get a better service.  If these steps are taken, I would not have a problem with proceeding with the proposal to charge &euro;50 for a medical card.  At least the doctor would not get this sum for stamping the card in the first instance.  I ask the Leader to request that the Minister meet the conditions I have outlined before pursuing the proposed &euro;50 charge.  In doing so, he would save patients money.</P>

	<P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and many other speakers welcomed the announcement by the Minister of a public inquiry into the treatment of Fr. Reynolds by RTE.  The decision is to be welcomed by everyone and I hope the inquiry will be full and comprehensive and deal with all the matters arising.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The public consultation committee laid down times for those attending proceedings and its timetable will be adhered to.  It was agreed by the public consultation committee that proceedings would conclude at 5 p.m.  On Tuesday next, the House will hear a presentation by some experts in the field and people involved with older people.  We are, therefore, giving more than adequate time to this matter, although we will give more, if necessary.</P>
        <P>On the call by a number of Senators for a pre-budget debate, I have tried to secure a Minister for such a debate but it is difficult at this point with the budget looming.  I have, however, secured the services of the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, who will come before the House for not longer than one and a half hours.  He has cancelled several appointments in his diary to come to the House.  I will accede to requests by Senators in this matter and the debate will be arranged for next week as there would not be any point holding it the following week.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s claim that we are confining the debate on the Bill to two and a half hours is incorrect.  If the Senator had listened to my announcement on the Order of Business, he would have heard that the debate will resume after Private Members&rsquo; time.  The House will sit for as long as we can keep the Minister in the House after 7 p.m.  I do not have any intention of guillotining the debate on Committee Stage.  A significant number of amendments have been tabled and we will deal with them.  I assure the Senator the debate on the  Bill was not guillotined on Second Stage.</P>

        <P Just="Left">On Senator Bacik&rsquo;s contribution, we all welcome the release of Dr. Rafah Nached in Syria.  I will continue to endeavour to have the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade come before the House to debate foreign affairs issues.</P>
        <P>On Senator Eamonn Coghlan&rsquo;s contribution, it is my understanding that the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, will be present for at least part of the debate in Private Members&rsquo; time.  I am sure we will have a good and robust debate on the very important issue raised in the motion.  I compliment Senator Coghlan on tabling the motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Power raised the issue of Priory Hall.  The Government expressed sympathy with all those who have been caught up in the events at the complex.  Dublin City Council has been making good progress in addressing specific individual and family needs.  It has placed 37 families free of charge in apartments provided by the National Asset Management Agency close to Priory Hall and secured accommodation for five families courtesy of a voluntary housing association.  It has also agreed to give 57 residents in receipt of rent supplement deposits to secure private rented accommodation as an alternative to hotel accommodation.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, will be in the House for a long time in the next couple of days and I am sure he would be willing to have a chat with Senator Power on this issue if she wishes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mullins referred to services for homeless people, an issue which was also raised on the Order of Business yesterday.  We all welcome the proposals made by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, on this issue, which I hope will have the desired effect of helping homeless people on our streets.</P>
        <P>To respond to Senator Norris, I am not aware of any Government instruction to Members of the European Parliament regarding Mr. Cardiff&rsquo;s proposed appointment.  I will ascertain for the Senator if and when it is intended to introduce a privacy Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the question and answer session with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform yesterday.  The constant interruption of the Minister was disrespectful.  It will be difficult to get the Minister or any of his colleagues to come before the House if they are treated as he was yesterday.  Perhaps the reason for yesterday&rsquo;s behaviour was the decision to allow Senators two minutes to ask questions.  Some Senators used this time to make statements rather than ask questions.  We will have to review the position on question and answer sessions, as a number of Senators requested.</P>
        <P>We will deal with the pre-budget submission as Senator Cullinane requested.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Healy Eames and &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to Aviva and the introduction of a code of conduct for companies.  The way in which workers are treated is despicable.  In many ways, <Col N="639"/>Aviva gave some notice, whereas in my own city Talk Talk gave practically no notice.  Therefore, it is a matter that will have to be addressed by the Minister.  Perhaps in the new year we can have another debate on job creation and job initiative measures.  We have had a number of debates to date on the issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden said he did not use statutory instruments while he was Minister of State.  I did not think bus lanes were in being at that stage.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senators Martin Conway and John Kelly asked about renegotiating GP and consultant contracts and called for a debate on health in respect of medical cards.  We can have that debate in the context of the pre-budget submission next week.  Everything is on the table.  The country is in a deplorable state and many cuts will have be made in every Department, as I have said on numerous occasions.  That is just a fact of life.</P>      
        <P>Senator John Crown asked about special needs assistants.  I will try to get information for the Senator on that issue.  We agree with the point he made yesterday that gagging orders should not be applied in settlements where public bodies are concerned.  I agree with his assumption in that regard.</P>      
        <P>Senator Paul Bradford called for a debate on intolerance by the media towards people who are practising their religion.  It may be possible to arrange a debate on that issue in conjunction with a number of other issues in regard to the media.</P>
        <TimeSt down="3" idown="3">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to the role of the Revenue Commissioners.  In regard to the individual case he mentioned, perhaps he would submit it as an Adjournment matter.  While the Senator had issues with it, Customs and Excise should be complimented on its excellent work in the seizure of contraband goods and drugs and tackling diesel laundering in recent months.  It plays a very important role.  All the officers involved should be complimented and thanked by the House on their work in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White referred to advances in cancer care.  That is an issue about which the public should be informed.  I am sure Senator John Crown would enlighten us on that issue, whether in this House or in the audio-visual room, by making a presentation to us on the advances in cancer care and where we are going in that regard.  That would be welcomed by Members of both Houses.</P>

Senator D&rsquo;Arcy also pointed to the opportunities for Irish people in the new Libya.</P> <P>Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of cash for gold and cash for scrap.

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We raised the issue of excluding members of the European Parliament and the Houses of the Oireachtas from being on the board, which is generally acceptable, with the Miister for Health, but members of local authorities are also excluded.  If a midwife or nurse has been recommended and he or she is a member of a local authority he or she would not be allowed to sit on the board according to the Bill.  The Minister gave an undertaking in this House that he would amend the Bill and ensure it would not prohibit members of local authorities from being members of the board.  This type of approach has been taken by previous Governments.  The Civil Service seems to be focused on ensuring that when a person becomes <Col N="646"/>a member of a local authority he or she is not a qualified or proper person to serve on the board.  It is grossly unfair. Such persons would not have a right to be on boards.  We are talking about fully qualified nurses or midwives who are appointed to a board and who subsequently seek election to their local authority.  Such persons, by virtue of their being elected to serve the people of their area, as the Minister of State did in the past, are prohibited from serving on these boards.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, gave a specific commitment in this regard.  The same officials who are in attendance today were in the Chamber on that occasion.  The Minister clearly indicated that the relevant change would be made to the Bill, but I do not see any such amendment.  Therefore, I will oppose this section unless the Minister of State offers a commitment that the amendment will be made on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden is correct that the Minister made reference to an amendment in the D&aacute;il which would remove the provision relating to the exclusion of local authority members from sitting on these boards.  I join the Senator in seeking clarification in that regard.  While his recollection is more definite than mine, reference was certainly made to such a provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to clarify that a member of a local authority may be a member of the board.  This matter was dealt with, on foot of the commitment given by the Minister, by way of Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill before us today is marked &ldquo;As passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;.  I have not received any supplementary document setting out amendments made in the D&aacute;il.  This needs to be clarified.  I am working on the basis that this document includes the amendments made in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the document before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It does not include the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I collected my copy of the amended Bill from the Bills Office this morning.  As such, I presumed it was the most up to date and accurate version of the legislation.  However, what Senator Leyden is saying is correct.  The relevant provision, subsection 22(5)(<i>c</i>), on page 27, states that a member of a local authority is specifically excluded from sitting on a board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Minister of State is checking the document, I will take the opportunity to voice my opposition to the exclusion of Members of the Seanad from membership of the board, under subsection 22(5)(<i>a</i>).  This issue was raised in the context of our debate on the legislation introducing the Injuries Board.  A former Senator, Joe O&rsquo;Toole, was appointed vice chairman of that board by the former Minister for Health, Mary Harney.  There is no reason that a Member of this House would not be suitable to serve on such boards.  A qualified nurse or midwife who becomes a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann should not be precluded from membership under this legislation.  It is impractical and unfair.</P>
        <P>We have a very well qualified MEP, Ms Phil Prendergast, who is an excellent midwife.  In case of membership of the European Parliament, the exclusion contained in subsection 22(5) seems reasonable.  Likewise, exclusion of Members of the D&aacute;il is acceptable because the demands of that role are different to those of a Senator.  Senators, on the other hand, could fit very easily into this board and their service would be of great benefit to this House and to the Oireachtas.  Nevertheless, I am prepared to accept the exclusion of Oireachtas Members. <Col N="647"/> However, I will call for a vote on this section unless there is a satisfactory response from the Minister of State in regard to the exclusion of local authority members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with Senator Leyden&rsquo;s suggestion that Members of the Seanad should be entitled to sit on a board.  The logic I follow in this instance is the same as that which applied in respect of the removal of the dual mandate.  The same principle arises in this case.  However, I join the Senator in seeking clarification on the exclusion of local authority members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for the confusion on this matter.  I was not party to the earlier debate and am only now catching up with it.  There was discussion on whether employees of the board could be members of a local authority.  I accept Senator Leyden&rsquo;s point in regard to members of the board.  I see no difficulty in that respect other than procedural difficulties, in that we do not want any further delays.  If the Senator will bear with me, we will check with the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel whether it is possible to delete the line in question.  I accept there was a commitment given in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy Reilly, specifically stated that this provision was amended in the D&aacute;il.  However, the document I have, which I assumed was the most up-to-date version, does not include that amendment.  It is not a particularly contentious matter but it has been raised before.  The former Minister for State, John Curran, agreed that councillors could be members of a board in the context of the provisions of the Charities Act 2009.  I hope all Departments, in framing legislation, will abandon what is a grossly unfair exclusion of those who serve people well in their local communities.  As I said, I will oppose the section in the absence of an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

        <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This was discussed previously with the Minister and he said he was not ageist.  I do not know whether it has been amended anywhere else.  The reason for choosing 68 years is that this is the outer limit for retirement in the EU-IMF-ECB agreement.  My colleague, Senator Crown, is against retirement in principle but I will not push it that far.  If it is Government policy to raise the retirement age, then I am seeking to have it included in the Bill.  Like Senators Gilroy and Leyden earlier, I think we had the broad agreement of the Minister when he said he was not ageist.  We put forward our views for consideration by the Minister of State but we seemed to have an element of agreement when it was before the House previously.</P>

It would seem to be a policy of the Government.  I respectfully suggest that this amendment be considered although I appreciate there is a time constraint on this Bill.  The argument has been very well made by Senator Barrett.  If the Minister has the power to extend the age of retirement to 68 years where a case is made, it would be a reasonable decision.  I know there is a move in this direction by Departments and it will become the norm in the future.  I would not wish to put this amendment to a vote and I ask for the Minister of State&rsquo;s views.</P>

I understand that judges are sitting beyond the age of 65 although I am open to correction in that matter.</P>

	<P>On amendments Nos. 15 and 16, it is important to draw a distinction between people who are employed pre-2004 and post-2004.  The requirement to retire at the age 65 relates to employees appointed before 1 April 2004.  This is a condition of the superannuation scheme to which these employees belong.  However, there is no upper age limit for retirement for employees of the board who are appointed on or after April 2004.  This is in line with the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  Subsection (3) provides that the Minister for Health may, by order, increase the age limit upwards from 65 years in exceptional circumstances.  This means that the Minister for Health can raise the age of retirement.  I consider this will give the maximum flexibility regarding retirement age and I urge Members to accept the provision in the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Opinions differ among Members as to the age of retirement.  As Senator Barrett said, at least one Member is opposed in principle to a retirement age being set.  My concern is the issue of choice.  I do not see that this amendment would compel a person to work until he or she was 68 although this is what might happen if there were to be changes in Government policy.  If a person wishes to continue to work up to the age of 68, then this amendment will provide an opportunity to do so.  The logic of this amendment is that a person should not be forced to retire at the age of 65.  In my view, this amendment is a reasonable request from the proposer that the age be extended to 68 years in order that a person who wishes to continue to work until the age of 68 years will have that choice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On a point of clarification, I am not opposed to retirement and I anticipate my own retirement enthusiastically when the appropriate time comes.  However, I am opposed to mandatory age-based retirement which makes no sense, either medically, economically or socially.  The current arbitrary retirement age of 65 was decided upon in a jurisdiction &mdash; Germany in 1870 &mdash; where at the time the average age of death at that time was about 48 years of age and where the average person who lived as far as 65 years lived an average of one to two years longer than that.  People are living vastly longer and are vastly healthier.  As my colleague, Senator Cullinane has said, the option of retirement should be maintained as a worker&rsquo;s right.  However, I do not agree with a mandate for people who are productive, who are working and contributing to society and paying tax, who do not want to stop work, who are in the whole of their health and who, at a time of unprecedented economic crisis, at a time when a terrible demographic shift is occurring as regards the ratio of workers to dependants, are being told they must become dependants.  This is insane and irrational.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I extend my good wishes to the Minister of State.  The President and two of her Cabinet colleagues, if they worked in the health service, would be well retired at this stage and two others of her Cabinet colleagues will, if this Oireachtas runs its natural course, reach retirement age during the term of the current Oireachtas.  This underlines how completely insane it is and to arbitrarily fix an age of retirement for people who have been appointed before and after 2004 makes no sense.  I may be speaking out of turn but there is a need for legislation to abolish the principle of mandatory age-based retirement across the public service.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="651"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister for State for clarification on this point.  Is it correct to say that the requirement to retire at the age of 65 is laid down in the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004?  Is it also correct to say that an appointment to this board would constitute an entirely new contract of employment which would avoid the possibility of the application of the 2004 Act?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>As some Senators have said, this is part of a wider debate which is probably required and which is not specific to a particular piece of legislation.  I agree with Senators that 75 is probably the new 65 at this stage because for a number of reasons, not least our health service, people are living longer and this is wonderful.  We need to rethink our treatment of the different phases in life.  Many people currently work well into their late 60s and even into their 70s.  In the future I predict that many people will work into their 70s and even beyond.  This is an important debate.  Our view of ageing and the different phases of life need to change accordingly.</P>
        <P>However, in respect of this Bill, people who were employed previously by An Bord Altranais and who change over to the new board retain their existing rights under the previous arrangements, meaning that those employed before 2005 are in a superannuation scheme which is based on a retirement at 65 years.  Their pension becomes payable from the age of 65 years.  Since 2004, however, under new arrangements, there is no age limit.</P>
        <P>A person can work until the age of 66, 68 or beyond.  There is no limit for people, post 2004.  It is important to point that out.</P>
        <P>There is also provision contained for particular circumstances, for example, where a person employed pre-2004 whose particular skills are required or where there are certain circumstances in which it would be in the public interest that the person should remain in his or her job.  The Minister can make an order to cater for those circumstances on an exceptional basis.  However, for those employed since 2004 there is no upper age limit.</P>

	<P>Is Senator Barrett pressing the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  However, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, introduced legislation concerning the Taxing Master which contained a proposal to reduce the relevant retirement age from 70 to 65.  The Minister accepted the view of the House and retained 70 as the age.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This still seems draconian although I accept what the Minister of State stated.  Subject to the section, an employee of the board, including the chief executive, shall cease to be an employee on attaining the age of 65 years.  As Senators Crown and Cullinane noted, this seems draconian and appears to contradict what the Government had agreed internationally, namely, there was a need in Ireland to raise the retirement age.  This was supported very strongly on medical grounds by Senator Crown.  As we negotiate such international agreements and consider these matters, my concern is that ageist elements still exist that would care to see a person out of a job on attaining the age of 65 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am very pleased we had the discussion.  It is always a pleasure to meet this Minister of State on that basis but my concern remains.  Why are there people in the public service who still think along these lines?  Perhaps more radical or revolutionary thinking will take place the next time round.  On that basis, however, I will not call for a vote or delay the House.  We have made our point and it has been noted.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">My amendment introduces a role for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as was done on several occasions by the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall.  We are <i>ad idem </i>as far as that is concerned.</P>
        <P>As to the amendment&rsquo;s other content, we were worried about allowing a body to borrow for current purposes, in particular given the current state of finances.  We deleted that reference and the amendment seeks that a body should balance its books and not run up a current budget deficit.  If a body borrows for capital purposes that should be subject to the conditions imposed by the two Ministers who are now involved in national finances.  We had in mind there should be proper appraisals and a proper cost benefit analysis, a matter we discussed in the House yesterday with the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  The purpose of the amendment is to protect the public finances, certainly those for current expenditure.  An organisation should stay within budget and not borrow for current purposes.  Capital projects should  enjoy the support of and meet the criteria set by the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Barrett for drawing attention to the fact that an amendment was required in order to include the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Government amendment addresses that point.</P>
        <P>We do not accept that the right to borrow would be restricted to capital reasons and there are a number of reasons for that.  For example, it may be necessary at some stage for the board to borrow for current expenditure.  A pertinent example would be if there were a large number of fitness to practise cases in any single year.  As drafted, the provision is a standard financial one.  It is important to bear in mind the board is a self-funding body.  Any borrowing undertaken must be serviced from its own moneys.  In those kinds of circumstances, therefore, the board would require the flexibility to be able to borrow for current expenditure.</P><Col N="653"/>
        <P>Amendment No. 19 includes the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to which the Senator drew our attention.  That is a very clear safeguard in regard to the practice of the board, namely, that it would be required to secure the permission or consent of both Ministers in the event of needing to borrow.</P>
        <P>I hope the Senator will accept we have met him halfway on this issue.  There are good grounds, however, for retaining the right for the board to borrow in those rare circumstances where it would need to do so for exceptional current purposes.</P>

However, I appreciate the points made by the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>We are moving towards an era where, to escape from bond markets, people within public finances are becoming almost Victorian, balancing books so they do not have to engage in borrowing.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  She was not in the House during the debate on Second Stage of this Bill when I let the Minister for Health know that my party had some concerns about indemnity.  We tabled this amendment which seeks, on page 38, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), lines 10 and 11, to delete the phrase &ldquo;who maintains adequate clinical indemnity insurance in accordance with the rules&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 40 is the most contentious and problematic section of the Bill.  My colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, tabled a similar amendment which was voted down by the Government.  We urge the Minister of State to reconsider this because if she does not, we will be forced to put the matter to a vote and we will vote against the Bill, which is unfortunate.  I agree with much that is contained in the Bill and supported changes to section 8 in regard to criteria and rules.  We support most of the content of the Bill but we have an issue about indemnity.  The problem with this section of the Bill, as it stands, is that it could severely curtail the ability of women to access midwife-led childbirth.  I want to make it clear that we are keen to ensure childbirth is safe.  We accept it is essential that those who provide care and assistance to women during childbirth are properly qualified and registered and are accountable.We also accept that indemnity is necessary and vital and we have argued in favour of it. We have also argued that it should not be a statutory requirement, as it is in this Bill.  It would be better to make indemnity a requirement of service level agreements such as the current memorandum of understanding that governs the services provided by self-employedmidwives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In our view and in the view of many midwives and some organisations that advocate for midwives, section 41, as drafted, could pave the way for the criminalisation of autonomous midwifery practice.  It provides for the imposition of terms of imprisonment of up to ten years for midwives who break the extremely restrictive rules that underpin indemnity.  It has been noted that the threat of such penalties has not been imposed on doctors, for whom insurance is not legally compellable.  It does not serve the public interest to make midwifery indemnity a statutory requirement.  Section 41, as drafted, would enable the insurer &mdash; the State, in this case &mdash; to dictate the terms and conditions of childbirth for maternity service users.  This is because of what has been described by the community midwives association as the &ldquo;inflexible&rdquo; conditions attaching to this insurance.  One of the organisations that advocates on behalf of midwives is arguing that this Bill could ensure that inflexible conditions are attached to this insurance, which is unobtainable after a mother has turned 40 and once obtained is capable of lapsing at any moment during labour.  The section, as drafted, restricts self-employed midwives from accepting various categories of mothers as clients.  It further obliges self-employed midwives to abandon their clients in mid-labour if they exhibit some change in their condition that is prohibited by the terms and conditions of their indemnity.  Some Senators on the other side of the House are shaking their heads, but what I have said is an absolute fact.</P>

	<P>Making indemnity a statutory requirement threatens women&rsquo;s safety in childbirth.  Section 41, as drafted, obliges a mother whose midwife&rsquo;s insurance has just lapsed to choose one of two alternatives &mdash; to give birth at home without professional attendants, or to face unwanted medical treatment in a hospital.  Women who do not fit the indemnity criteria are already opting to give birth at home without professional attendants.  As I said on Second Stage when we flagged the problems we have with this, the community midwives organisation has lobbied all Senators and Deputies on this matter.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, has tabled a similar motion in the D&aacute;il.  We have genuine concerns.  We accept that midwifery has to be practised to the highest standard.  We have no difficulty with the principle of indemnity.  The way it is being presented in the Bill is a cause of concern, as is the way it will work out.  For those reasons, we will not support the Bill if our amendment is not accepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>As far as I know, this Bill was published by the last Government.  If I am to be consistent, I will not support this amendment.  This is the area of highest risk.  There has to be proper indemnity cover.  It is far too risky to allow anyone not to have that cover.  That is why efforts are being made to maintain this provision in the Bill.  Individuals can make claims when things go wrong, which can happen.  It is a safeguard for the midwives as well.  I do not see any reason to change this section of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Leyden on this matter.  As a member of the legal profession, I do not agree with the amendment.  A big issue can arise if one has a home delivery but it does not work out, unfortunately, and one is admitted to hospital.  The hospital will have insurance cover, but the midwife might not have cover.  If litigation ensues in such circumstances, there will be a big legal argument at the outset about where responsibility lies and where the procedure went wrong.  In the first five or ten days of such a legal case, questions will be asked about whether there is insurance cover.  That is why it is essential that professional indemnity cover is extended to everyone involved in this area.  That is why I do not support this amendment.  The Minister, like the previous Minister, is right in this regard.  I will not support this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be slow to support this amendment.  When we discussed this Bill on Second Stage a few weeks ago, Senators mentioned that there has been confusion and concern among the professional bodies and representative organisations.  The Minister clarified the matter at that time.  We cannot tolerate or accept anyone who does not work within best international practice, or who works without indemnity.  This is what section 40 aims to achieve.  Section 41 covers circumstances in which a deterioration in the health status of a woman in labour requires the midwife to stop working.  If the health of a woman in childbirth deteriorates, the midwife moves from a birthing situation to a first aid situation.  That is clearly covered under section 41.  If one considers this matter in the context of section 40 alone, one can see where concern can arise.  However, one needs to consider the whole Bill and the rules which will describe the conditions attaching to the framework of indemnity offered by the State in this area.  The whole approach addresses the concerns that have been raised.  The representative bodies have moved to accept this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Cullinane has played a useful role in drawing attention to this problem, which was also discussed on Second Stage.  At the end of 2010, some &euro;786 million in clinical claims were outstanding.  Anything we can do to improve safety in this area is absolutely crucial.  We have had great success in reducing the number of road accident fatalities from over 600 some years ago to between 170 and 180 this year.  That required a great deal of effort.  Senator Cullinane has drawn our attention to the risks involved.  A report drawn up by the State Claims Agency has set out the substantial costs associated with this area.  As the <Col N="656"/>Minister said the last day, it is not just a matter of money.  We should bear in mind the pain, suffering and injuries in this regard.  We need to address this serious problem.  I disagree with my colleague.  I think more qualifications and protections are needed.  The huge level of claims is a problem facing the health service in general.  It is useful to discuss it here.  I had not heard any previous reference to the danger to the health service of such a massive number of claims.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>My party is in favour of increasing safety.  I do not want anybody to be confused about our amendment.  We are in favour of increasing the welfare and safety of patients, including people who are giving birth.  We are talking about the potential risks we see.  Those risks have been highlighted by organisations that advocate on behalf on midwives.  Our argument is that making indemnity a statutory requirement could present risks.  That is the problem.  I have given examples of the difficulties we see.  I will give some more examples.  Section 41, as drafted, prohibits attendance by uninsured midwives, even in cases of sudden or urgent necessity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>At a time when we are closing a number of accident and emergency wards and maternity units across the country, it does not make sense to prohibit emergency care by retired midwives, for example.  According to our interpretation of the Bill, that is exactly what will happen.  Section 41, as drafted, significantly narrows the terms and conditions in which midwifery can be practised.  We believe the existing memorandum of understanding is anti-competitive because it significantly restricts the client base of self-employed midwives.  This, in turn, restricts women&rsquo;s access to the services of such midwives.  Self-employed midwives are, and seek to be, insured.  They all want to be insured.  Other people in the sector agree with the community midwives that safeguarding mothers against uninsured practitioners is easily achieved within a birth community that is relatively small and tight-knit.  The effect of section 40 of the Bill, as drafted, would be to deny women choice in maternity care.  In our view, this is not in the public interest.  Hospital maternity services are at risk all over Ireland.  Plans are advanced to close some of the countries maternity units.  Community services must be developed to take the place of those services and the Bill as it stands restricts that possibility.  </P>
        <P>An issue also arises concerning women who live in non-urban areas who have childbirth needs that must be addressed.  Some face journeys of two hours in labour to access inpatient care, often ending with a medical induction or an elective caesarian.  In effectively stifling midwives&rsquo; rights to offer services in the community, section 40, as drafted, denies women the right to access community care from midwives.</P>
        <P>One of the problems is that self-employed midwives have been unable to access insurance in the private market in recent years.  The only indemnity currently available to them comes from the State, and that is based on a narrow Health Service Executive home birth service.  Section 40 as drafted prevents midwives from providing various services in the community such as post-natal care.  Post-natal care levels in Ireland are among the lowest in Europe.  Section 40, unless amended, will deny large numbers of women the freedom to give birth at home and could lead to a rise in the number of unattended births.  Mothers who do not fit the State&rsquo;s terms and conditions are already opting to give birth at home unattended.  That is happening.  No mother should have to give birth at home without professional assistance.  Section 40, as drafted, locks in an insurance package based on a HSE contract that ensures that indemnity can lapse from moment to moment depending on the progress of a woman&rsquo;s labour.</P>
        <P>We have many concerns about this Bill and I ask the Minister to take on board those concerns in good faith.  Senator Gilroy said that some of those concerns were raised on Second <Col N="657"/>Stage and claimed that they are dealt with in section 41.  I do not believe they are, neither does the organisation which advocates on behalf of midwives.  We have real concerns.</P>
        <P>I will listen to what the Minister has to say but if she does not accept our amendment because of all the risks I have outlined we have no choice but to vote against this section because we have real concerns in terms of what is coming down the tracks, so to speak, for many local and regional hospitals.  Many of those maternity units have been downgraded, and some of them closed, across the country.  We all want the highest standards and to make sure that women are protected but there are inherent risks in what we are doing here that could limit the possibility of some women giving birth at home, which is their choice.  That is our difficulty with the Bill and unless the amendment is accepted we will not be in a position to support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>In amendment No. 22 Senator Cullinane proposes to remove the provision that a registered midwife must have adequate clinical indemnity insurance to attend a woman in childbirth for reward.  There is clearly a need to ensure that midwives have adequate insurance lest a case of negligence is taken.  As court cases in regard to birth where negligence is proven often result in very high damages being awarded this is an important issue to which we must give careful consideration.  Unless there is that kind of assurance in regard to safety there is the potential for adding to the distress of parents if a case of negligence was proven and the midwife involved was not insured.</P>
        <P>If we were here discussing a Bill to provide for a higher level of regulation in respect of the nursing and midwifery profession and we did not include these provisions on ensuring high standards in regard to safety issues, Senator Cullinane would be criticising the Government for not doing so, and he would be right to do that.  If we are, as we are in this case, regulating for high professional standards in the nursing and midwifery profession it is essential that we insist on a situation whereby people working in this area have full indemnity in regard to potential cases that would be taken.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane referred to the fact that medical practitioners are not required to have legal indemnity.  That is the case but it is wrong that that position has been allowed to continue for so long.  That is the reason the Government has given a clear commitment to address this issue.  Legislation is being prepared and we are hopeful it will be ready for debate early in the new year.  It is an area where there is a gap in terms of safety of medical services and we are currently working on that.</P>
        <P>To facilitate self-employed midwives obtaining insurance an arrangement has been put in place to allow self-employed community midwives access the State&rsquo;s clinical indemnity scheme via the HSE.  A self-employed community midwife who signs up to the memorandum of understanding, MOU, with the HSE and abides by its terms is covered by the State&rsquo;s clinical indemnity scheme.  The MOU is constructed on the basis of appropriate forms of governance, clinical supervision, clinical care pathways, performance management and audit frameworks being in place, in other words, best practice in regard to home deliveries.  Part of the MOU outlines conditions and factors which indicate increased risk.  Home births are suitable for low risk, healthy women.  There is a need to ensure that where the State is providing clinical indemnity a midwife adheres to the standards set by the HSE.</P>
        <P>I would like to inform Senators that a national steering committee on home birth has been established by the HSE to review the implications of the MOU between the HSE and self-employed community midwives on the provision of a safe, evidence-based home birth service for low-risk, healthy women.  The committee consists of representatives from a wide range of stakeholders including a representative of self-employed community midwives and patient groups.  The Department of Health is also represented on the committee.  The inclusive nature of this committee will undoubtedly facilitate discussion on the key areas of concern and inform <Col N="658"/>future guidelines and developments.  On that basis I appeal to Senator Cullinane to consider withdrawing the amendment because the State cannot possibly support that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the amendment being pressed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment is designed to reduce the risk posed by the current arrangements.  We believe these HSE terms and conditions are operated in such a way as to prevent midwives exercising their clinical judgment and what we see as their duty of care to mothers and babies.  For example, self-employed midwives who feel ethically bound to continue to assist a home birth mother whose labour does not conform to insurance rules now face jail under this Bill.  That is a recipe for unsafe care.</P>
        <P>We must examine the facts in this regard because awards against midwives in the community have been few and far between.  In the past 30 years, payouts in respect of self-employed midwives have amounted to less than &euro;250,000 in total.  By criminalising midwives who practise outside the State&rsquo;s onerous terms and conditions section 40, as drafted, denies women the right to opt for a gynaecological service that is low tech and drug free.  That is a right that has been recognised and accepted by the European Court of Human Rights.  Section 40 even prevents midwives offering services such as breast-feeding advice in the community which amounts to cutting women off from their services.  Community midwives&rsquo; clients&rsquo; breast-feeding rates are among the highest in the European Union while national rates are among the lowest.  Midwifery-based care leads to better health outcomes for mother and baby and greater client satisfaction it also reduces costs and making midwives the main care givers in the majority of births could save millions of euro.</P>
        <P>I have repeated the reasons we are opposed to this section.  The Minister should not presume what any individual may or may not say in any circumstance or in the context of any Bill.  I have put on the record our view that there must be indemnity, support and an increased duty of care for the patient, the child and the midwife but I repeat that making indemnity a statutory requirement is the problem.  I mentioned the service level agreements which we believe is a better way to proceed rather than the statutory requirement.</P>
        <P>I assume the Minister and the Government have made up their minds that they are not accepting the amendment and on that basis I will press it and call for a vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to make it clear that I support the principle of choice in regard to childbirth.  However, home births can only take place in safe circumstances and it would be extremely remiss of the State to preside over a situation where we did not insist on having that indemnity. I presume the Senator supports the State playing that role and insisting that practising midwives are adequately covered.  This provision provides the safeguard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is either a legal requirement or it is not.  The State would be remiss in not insisting on provision of indemnity as a legal requirement.  The women who want to have home births, who want to have community midwives assisting them in those births need to be given assurances as to the quality of care being provided and, in the unlikely event that something goes wrong, that there will be adequate cover.  We cannot preside over a situation where those kinds of safeguards are not in place.</P>
        <P>The second point is that up to 2008, cover was provided by the INMO but this cover was withdrawn in 2008.  The HSE is setting out standards of safety requiring practitioners to have <Col N="659"/>clinical indemnity and providing a scheme of indemnity with certain conditions.  If we were to do otherwise, it would mean giving open-ended cover.  The HSE developed this scheme in order to facilitate community midwives in doing their very important work and to ensure safeguards were in place but this is not an open-ended scheme and it has to set down conditions.  The assessment of the level of risk is clearly an important element of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Community midwives are not required to avail of the State scheme; they are free to arrange their own clinical indemnity.  However, in a high-risk or a potentially high-risk situation, they would find it exceptionally difficult to achieve that indemnity cover if it were possible at all.  The HSE is acting with all reasonableness in this situation and also responsibly.  It has to set down conditions under which a view is taken as to what constitutes safe circumstances and what circumstances pose too great a risk for the mother and the child concerned.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane referred to the work done by community midwives such as encouraging higher levels of breast-feeding and I agree this is very important work which is highly valued.  I wish to be clear that the question of indemnity only arises for the actual birth and it does not apply to any other services involved either before or after birth.  I hope the Senator would accept our bona fides in this regard.  We want to ensure highest standards and the safest possible circumstances for women who choose to have home births.  We support that right of choice but we must also be reasonable and responsible in terms of identifying potential risk.  This is the Government approach and I hope the Senator might reconsider.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This is to include, in the references to education and training of nurses, the bodies which carry out that education and training and thereby involving those who provide that education and seeking their views.  Put in contemporary terms, a gap should not develop between Ministers and involved bodies  In the House I have been concerned about the attempt of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to get responses on the teaching of mathematics in schools.</P>
        <P>According to a newspaper report, some 40% of those involved have not responded.  It is a good idea that there should be contact between the Minister for Education and Skills and those providing education in the field.  The other aspect of the involvement of those bodies is that it would allow any improvements that may be desired by the Minister, the universities or the institutes of technology to be made on a formal basis.  I am mindful that when an issue arose previously with regard to the care of the elderly, there was some debate on whether it had been discussed in a lift in the Gresham Hotel.  These matters are important.  It is important that those who provide the education have a link with the Minister for Education and Skills and the board.  That is the spirit in which the amendment has been proposed.</P>

	<P>Senator Barrett&rsquo;s amendment would place an obligation on the Minister for Health to consult the relevant academic deans, the governing authorities of third level educational establishments and the Minister for Education and Skills.  It is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills to decide on who he or she should consult within the education sector.  It would not be appropriate for the Minister for Health to specify this in primary legislation.  I am sorry I cannot accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity.  I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s point and her bona fides.  There is a danger that people can form uninformed views or prejudices about what is right or wrong with an educational course.  It would be a good idea to go into an institution and consult those who provide education there about their ideas.  One could get valuable international contacts as a result.  I presume those who carry on these tasks in universities and institutes of technology attend international conferences, etc.  If we were talking about the training of economists, we would find it strange if it were the case that only Ministers were involved in deciding what should be done.  These institutions have existed for hundreds of years.  The medical school in Trinity College is 300 years old this year.  In the past, there has always been a difficulty within medical education in deciphering where the role of the Minister for Health ends and the role of the Minister for Education and Skills begins, and <i>vice versa</i>.  It would be a good idea to involve the governing authorities.  I am disappointed it has not received a favourable response.  It seems anomalous and strange that Ministers should have responsibility for highly technical academic areas.  I have made my point.  Perhaps I will raise it with the Minister for Education and Skills when he is in the House.  It would be very strange not to avail of all the expertise everywhere.  The word &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; has been somewhat devalued in an economic sense, but in this sense it should involve consulting those who had these students in their care for four years and brought them to international standards.  It could be a learning process for all parties.  I will not press the amendment.  I regret that the Minister of State is not accepting it.</P>

	<P>I accept the principle of where the Senator is coming from.  Any Minister for Education and Skills would be foolish not to consult those who are involved in providing medical training and education.  My point is that the acceptance of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment, which would impose an obligation on the Minister for Health, would make the legislation too prescriptive.  We are providing that the Minister for Health should consult the Minister for Education and Skills.  He or she would be expected to consult all the various interests.  There is nothing to preclude those interests from relaying their views to the Minister for Health, through the Minister for Education and Skills or otherwise.  It is not appropriate to be prescriptive to the extent of naming people in primary legislation.</P>

	<P>We will accept the Leader&rsquo;s proposals, if they are acceptable to the Government side, that every amendment in this Bill would be debated in its entirety, that every Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann would be allowed speak on the issue if they so wish, that the Bill will not be guillotined in this House, and that democracy will not be stifled here this week as it was last week.  That may not be relevant to the section but it is important to point it out at this stage.</P><Col N="666"/>
        <P>It alarms me that when one rings the Office of the Government Chief Whip one finds out the Bill is scheduled on the Order Paper for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for Second Stage next Tuesday.  That is assuming the Bill goes through the Seanad this week.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>He has not said anything relevant yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>It was my first opportunity to speak on Committee Stage and I wanted to point that out at the outset.</P>
        <P>What is relevant to section 3, however, is the issue of the inspectors being appointed under the legislation.  We have tabled a number of amendments to section 3 on the role and the work of inspectors as outlined in the legislation and I hope they will be considered because it would protect people in their homes.</P>
        <P>Section 3 refers to an inspector appointed by the agency.  That is alarming because we are dealing with private citizens who are not responsible to any public agency but because they complete an application form to apply to become inspectors, having paid the registration fee of &euro;1,000, they will become inspectors of septic tanks throughout the country.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>According to the Bill those people must comply with certain conditions which include a minimum qualification to be held &mdash; I would like clarification on what is a minimum qualification &mdash; and training to be completed.  I understand the Environmental Protection Agency runs a training course for inspectors but the Minister might outline to the House the exact content of that training programme and whether he believes there are competent people within the local authority structure or the Environmental Protection Agency who could carry out this work without having to employ what is effectively an army of private inspectors who will have no public accountability. The Bill states that indemnity insurance is required and any other requirements.  The Minister might outline how wide or varied those requirements would be.</P>
        <P>The powers of inspection the inspector would have under the Bill not only alarms me and those on this side of the House but also people up and down the country.  I have attended at least six public meetings in my constituency on the issue of septic tank charges.  Almost 1,000 ordinary people living in rural areas attended those meetings and all of them disagree with the Minister&rsquo;s Bill because they have been educated on what it contains.  These are ordinary people living in rural communities &mdash; farmers, housewives, public servants, people working in the private sector and those who do not have jobs.  The Irish Farmers Association, and I am delighted the chairman of the environment committee is present in the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator, I want to steer you away from making a Second Stage speech.  I ask you to address the specifics.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="667"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>It is relevant to the section because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, the latter part of the Senator&rsquo;s contribution was not relevant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;it relates to the powers of inspectors.  Regarding the private inspectors to be appointed by the Environmental Protection Agency having paid the fee and obtained the insurance standard, we do not know the level of qualification they must have, the number of inspectors to be appointed or who will pay for them.  The Bill does not outline who is paying for them or how much each inspection will cost.  What is outlined, however, are the powers of the inspector and those powers include: entering and inspecting any premises served by a wastewater treatment system; the examination of any wastewater treatment system; the monitoring of any domestic wastewater stored in or discharged from a wastewater treatment system; and the taking of samples.  These private inspectors also have the power to take photographs of any element of the wastewater treatment system and request that any part of the premises be left undisturbed during the course of an inspection.</P>
        <P>The inspectors also have the power, under another section but it is relevant to this section, to carry out excavations.  Does that mean they can come onto a site with a bulldozer or a JCB and carry out excavations on somebody&rsquo;s private land or lawn?  They have the power to carry out surveys and examinations of subsoil and to obtain information and inspect records pertaining to the maintenance, servicing and operation of wastewater treatment systems but the Bill does not outline what are those maintenance, servicing and operation standards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill states also that an inspector cannot enter a premises without the prior consent of the occupier but what is even more alarming is that if, for example, somebody in the west is notified that an inspector will call to inspect their wastewater treatment system it will be an offence under the legislation for that person to: prevent the inspector entering their premises; obstruct or impede the inspector in carrying out their duties; or provide false or misleading information on a wastewater treatment system for an inspector, the Environmental Protection Agency or the water services authority.  The Minister can imagine an elderly person living in a rural part of Ireland who has a septic tank and a so-called inspector representing the Environmental Protection Agency knocks on the door.  That inspector may have a card but one must imagine all the crime being committed by people calling to people&rsquo;s homes in rural Ireland.  The private inspector calls to carry out an inspection of the wastewater treatment system attached to the dwelling house.  If that elderly person obstructs or tells the inspector he or she does not want the inspector to carry out those inspections, having received the written notification prior to the call from the water service authority, he or she will face sanctions.  Under the provisions of the Bill it is an offence to impede, obstruct or not to allow the private inspector to carry out his duties.   In that case, that person can be taken to court by the water service authority and face class A fines of up to &euro;5,000.  What will happen is that people will be criminalised because they are afraid to allow the private inspectors into their houses.  Without being alarmist on this issue, the Minister needs to go back to the drawing board in respect of the inspectors and the manner in which they carry out their functions and the sweeping powers being given to these private inspectors.</P>
        <P>Is it that the Minister does not have faith in local authority staff who are employed under the water section of local authorities, or the Environmental Protection Agency staff that they cannot carry out those functions?  At least those staff are responsible to local authorities, local authority members and to the Houses of the Oireachtas, by extension, and they are also public servants.  We are going down the wrong road if we are to have an army of private inspectors, up and down the country, carrying out these inspections.  It is a wrong way to go.  I will deal with the advisory notice and so on when debating different parts of the Bill.</P><Col N="668"/>
        <P>We oppose this section and are tabling amendments to following sections.  I appeal to the Minister to have faith in the public sector staff employed in local authorities, in the Environmental Protection Agency and in his own Department.  His argument may be that he does not have the numbers &mdash; I accept that argument &mdash; but if not he needs to go back the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and seek a derogation under the moratorium to employ additional people who would be responsible to local authorities, councillors around the country and the Environmental Protection Agency.  I attended a public meeting earlier in the week where a councillor from the Minister&rsquo;s party and a councillor from the Labour Party were opposed to the army of inspectors being private inspectors also.  It is worth pointing out that there is massive disquiet.</P>
        <P>At one of the public meetings I attended in Donegal a pensioner in his 80s, who lives with his wife, was present.  They live in a remote area where the nearest house is three quarters of a mile away.  Their big fear is an inspector calling, even though they would have received written notification.  Some people in rural parts may find it difficult to read the notifications they receive.  The Minister should go back to the drawing board on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>Without reiterating what my esteemed colleague has said on this important issue I am concerned about section 3 which provides for the appointment of authorised persons or inspectors.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked how they will be recruited, whether they will be independent of the local authority and will training be provided.  The reason I am concerned is that we have had unhappy experiences with private operators in the clamping system and in other areas.  I fear inspectors will be appointed who may not have the technical expertise or knowledge of dealing with inspections of septic tanks and wastewater treatment plants.  It is perceived in the old council electoral area that I represented, a peninsular area as the Minister will be aware, having visited the area recently to perform official opening ceremonies in Bantry and elsewhere, that approximately half of all septic tanks pre-1990 would not pass an inspection.  If that is the case and is replicated around the country the Minister will need a substantial number of inspectors with appropriate qualifications.  Apart from their expertise and how they are trained they must have the capacity to deal with the public.</P>
        <P>I recall dealing with inspectors appointed by the south western regional fisheries board, some of whom were painters.  It was a case that anybody could apply even though they had no knowledge whatsoever of a salmon or of fishing.  I am worried that people will be recruited to carry out this work and may be appointed as inspectors, without having the necessary expertise, and may not have the capacity to deal with those in isolated rural areas.  People are afraid of inspectors of any description, including those seeking television licences.  Even in this day and age many people hide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If an inspector is calling who is likely to find the septic tank at the bottom of a garden out of order, we must be sure he knows his job and is in a position to negotiate with the houseowner or landowner in question.  I am also concerned that it will be an offence for a person to prevent an inspector from entering a premises to issue a warrant authorising that person, accompanied by another authorised person or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as specified in the warrant, to enter the premises.  In this regard, why is it necessary to issue warrants?  Will a prior notice of inspection be served on the landowner?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is sensible.  If a person has an issue with the inspection of a property &mdash; most people guard their houses as if they were guarding their castle &mdash; the person <Col N="669"/>may be accompanied by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as specified in the warrant.  The section is being amended to allow an authorised person to be accompanied by an inspector appointed by the EPA for the purposes of the Bill.  A situation could arise where a person for good reasons or, through ignorance of the law, does not co-operate with an inspection and, if I understand this correctly, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, along with the inspector accompanied by an inspector appointed by the EPA, may arrive and force their way onto the premises and carry out an inspection against the will of the owner.  If that does not work out properly, the owner of the property may end up in court.  I am deeply concerned as to how this section will apply in practice.</P>
        <P>I also believe that every septic tank will be inspected.  I concur with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s statement that there should be somebody from within the local authority to ensure that there is accountability at local level.  I heard the Minister state recently that he has great respect for local councils when rumours were circulating that they might be abolished.  Local authorities must have control over these inspectors.  They should also have responsibility so that if an issue arises, the local representative can, through the local authority or the local director of services or management, make a case to defend the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I have a number of concerns and some of them cut across other sections, I will make more points later.  I hope that the Minister recognises that these concerns are made in good faith.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>While this is not one of the more important sections of the Bill, there are still issues like aptitude, attitude and attributes that arise in respect of the people appointed.  Effectively, they are all-powerful positions.  Ultimately, their opinions cannot be challenged in the normal way.  I know we will come to the section dealing with the restrictions on what can be appealed to the courts, but I understand there are only two grounds on which a case can be taken.  First, the appellant is not the person on whom the notice should have been served.  Second, there is some substantive or procedural illegality.  What is not challengeable is the opinion of the inspectors themselves.  Therefore, if we do not have people with the attitude and impartiality required to administer this properly, we will run into difficulties.  By extending it beyond those in the public service, we are running into issues such as people who may have had previous difficulties with the person whose septic tank they are inspecting.</P>
        <P>There are serious issues pertaining to this and opinions should be challengeable.  It strikes me as very odd that if a person is being inspected, he cannot get his own expert to make a professional evaluation that would have some status.  Such an evaluation cannot even be used a foundation for a legal challenge.  That is highly questionable.  If this is the case, it puts a lot of emphasis on recruitment and the people who will be involved in these inspections.</P>

	<P>Listening to some of the comments, I think the Senator has bypassed some of the Bill without reading it, because what he is asking is for measures to be prescribed in primary legislation that are more suitable for regulations.  On the appointment of inspectors, the inspector is a holder of prescribed professional or technical qualifications.  One of the Senators &mdash; I think it was Senator Walsh &mdash; mentioned attitude, aptitude and suitability.  In the name of goodness, who would expect that to be in primary legislation?  That is for regulations.  In addition, it is stated that the person must have completed a satisfactory training course&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I was just listening to the discussion on the last Bill and the Minister who was here before Deputy Hogan said that something was not suitable for primary legislation.  I ask the Opposition to consider what is suitable for primary legislation.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to correct me if I am wrong, but there is nothing in the Bill that says one cannot have an inspection carried out voluntarily.  However, we all know &mdash; we said it ourselves when we were members of local authorities &mdash; that if one asks a consultant to carry out a report, the answers will depend on how the questions are put.  That is why it is important to have the legislation.  I remind the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators that the last Fianna F&aacute;il Government stated it would introduce a scheme for licensing and inspection of septic tanks and wastewater treatment.  Did they expect angels with wings to fly over a house and inspect it?  How do they expect an inspector to get in if he or she is not allowed?  I ask them to come up with some suggestions for getting around that one.</P>
        <P>I remind Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, who is from a fisheries area in Donegal, that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine carries out many inspections of boats.</P>

	<P>In welcoming the Minister to the House, I will say that he is fortunate to have Senator Keane as a spokesperson here in the Seanad, because she normally answers all his questions for him and does not give him the opportunity to give us the official version.  No matter what we happen to be talking about, that seems to be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think the official version will matter today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that this legislation is being rushed.  As my colleague Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has already indicated, we have submitted 75 amendments to the Bill, and the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators, I understand, have submitted another 22.  That is a total of 97 amendments, which warrants time for each and every one of them.  I hope this Committee Stage will not be guillotined.  As my colleague Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned both as Gaeilge and in English, the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Kehoe, has listed Second Stage of this <Col N="673"/>Bill for discussion next Tuesday in the D&aacute;il, which is treating this House with contempt, if the Acting Chairman does not mind my saying so.  I have the height of respect for the Leader of this House, who is an honourable man, and I believe he is being put under undue pressure to get the Bill passed in the House, which is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>To clear up one other thing, Deputy Kehoe&rsquo;s statement in the Lower House this morning that we had no other speakers offering during Second Stage of this Bill last week was notcorrect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>

	<P>There was some confusion with regard to how the Acting Chairman interpreted the situation.  I put it on the record of the House last week that we did not accept that there was nobody offering to speak.  I was to be the last speaker, with three colleagues speaking before me, and two of them were present and willing and able to speak.  I want to set the record straight.  Maybe somebody would be good enough to put Deputy Kehoe right on this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We are on section 3, Senator.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Section 3 is part of the Bill and I am discussing the Bill, Acting Chairman, with respect.  I am just putting the record straight and asking that others put the record of the other House straight also.</P>
        <P>With regard to the inspectorate, if Senator Keane does not mind, maybe the Minister would answer the question of what qualifications are necessary to allow somebody to act as an inspector.  Can he clarify the exact cost of becoming an inspector?  There is a bit of confusion in this regard.  I understand it will cost &euro;1,000 to register as an inspector, but how often does an inspector have to register?  Is it only once, or will he or she need to register every five years, every six years or whatever?  I ask the Minister to clarify that.  I further understand that training, insurance and so on will cost another &euro;3,000 to &euro;3,500, giving a total of perhaps &euro;4,500 to qualify initially as an inspector, with another fee every time he or she re-registers.  I ask the Minister to clarify how often inspectors must register.  Is one registration sufficient and what basic qualifications are needed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Wilson thinking of applying?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>Not at the moment.  If the manner in which business is dealt with in this House is anything to go by, I would not have time to do anything else.  It appears we will be here until the early hours of tomorrow morning if the Government insists on pushing through this legislation.  Fianna F&aacute;il is determined that each and every one of the amendments will be dealt with and that each section will be dealt with appropriately.  Perhaps when the Minister responds to questions he will explain why it is necessary to rush this legislation.  It could take a further two days in the House, be it next Friday or Monday, or Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of next week.  Any of these days could be used to finish the Bill without having to keep everyone here until the early hours but if that is what is needed then, unfortunately, that is the way it will be.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill, O&rsquo;Donovan and &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to the matter of prior notice.  Will the Minister elaborate on what is meant by this?  Does someone get a telephone call in the morning explaining an inspector will be there in the afternoon or is there a seven day or 14 day notice?  What notice is given?  The powers to be vested in an inspector are <Col N="674"/>draconian.  Those of us brought up in the countryside were taught to believe that the only people who could enter one&rsquo;s premises without a warrant were officials from the Customs Service and that even the Garda had to have a warrant to enter one&rsquo;s premises.  If the power is to be given to an inspector of septic tanks that is not available to the Garda then we have serious questions to answer.</P>
        <P>We have tabled amendments and perhaps the Minister can offer a comment on this point.  In Northern Ireland everyone is entitled to one free de-sludging per year.  As a minimum, this should be offered to people in rural Ireland who do not have access to sewerage works as those in towns and cities.  Senator Keane alluded to the regulations.  What is the problem with our examining those regulations in conjunction with this legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is welcome.  I stated previously that Fianna F&aacute;il is totally opposed to this Bill being rushed through.  We understand that our water must be up to the highest standards for human health and for the pharmaceutical industry here.  However, let us focus on the inspector issue.  Each inspector must pay a registration fee of &euro;1,000 and must pay the same fee each time they re-register.  This money is to cover the costs of the Environmental Protection Agency largely in the preparation and control of the national inspection plan.  It is unclear how often the inspectors must re-register or how many inspectors will be allowed on the register.  Therefore, it is not clear how much revenue will accrue to the EPA.  How much will this process cost someone who wishes to be an inspector?  If one must pay a registration fee of &euro;1,000 and carry professional indemnity insurance amounting to approximately &euro;1,500 as well as attend a certified training course estimated to cost &euro;2,500, then it will cost at least &euro;5,000 to become an inspector and between &euro;1,000 and &euro;2,500 annually to renew the registration.  This is a considerable burden and one would need to be confident that the investment of time and money would reap a reward for the inspector.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the Bill gives no detail on how the inspectors are to be engaged by the EPA or local authorities for individual inspections.  Once an inspector is on the register, will they be required to quote fees for individual assignments?  How will such fees be determined?  Some inspections may be purely visual while other may require opening up works or laboratory testing of samples.  If inspectors are on the register will they be guaranteed a certain minimum amount of work?  Will they get a return on their investment given the cost of becoming an inspector?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman.  I can see that he was trying hard.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill should note that I dislike hypocrisy and if he wishes to be valid in respect of the arguments he makes he should examine the precedent he and his party created under the legislation I have outlined.  The Senators have nothing to worry about now since they have voted through similar legislation in the past.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reason for the rush with this legislation is that the Government was brought back to the Court of Justice of the European Union last July and is being charged &euro;26,000 per day for non-compliance with a court judgment relating to contamination of ground-water by septic tanks.  Ireland was originally brought to court in 2009 when this judgment was issued and the previous Government did nothing about it.  This is why we are subject to a &euro;2.7 million lump sum fine and this is why &euro;26,000 per day since July is overhanging the Government decision to ensure we introduce this legislation.  This is the reason we must rush it.  We are saving the taxpayer money and we are protecting groundwater, public health, the environment and job opportunities.  The regular registration of inspectors will cost up to &euro;1,000.  Inspections are a matter for the local authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I expect that 95% of the staff dealing with this will be local authority people and this is the way I want it.  However, an employment moratorium is in place at the moment which was brought in by my predecessors in government and compounded by the Government and we must deal with this situation.  We are in an EU-IMF programme.  If they wish to introduce <Col N="676"/>other inspectors, local authorities have the opportunity to do so.  This option will be in place and such people will be able to register for up to &euro;1,000.  I assure Senators there is aconsiderable level of interest from people wishing to become inspectors on the panel and who wish to get involved.  However, unfortunately, we will not be able to get them involvedbecause local authorities will be doing most of the work.  I realise Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to a meeting in Ros a&rsquo; Mh&iacute;l at which Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to the 2008 regulations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is no such thing as the 2008 EPA regulations dealing with planning matters, although that is what he referred to.  This work will involve planning exemptions so that if one received planning permission in 1967, 1975 or 2010, one need not apply for planning permission.  We simply wish to know whether the system of septic tanks in the country is working and, if it is not working, we must carry out some work with it.  This is a risk-based assessment to protect groundwater in high risk areas well known to the local authorities.  These inspections are taking place at the moment under the 2007 Act.  People in Donegal are already subject to inspections in areas of high risk.</P>

	<P>They are.  The Senator obviously does not know what is going on in the environment section in Donegal County Council.  Whether one is on a river, stream, lake or an area of high risk, one is currently subject to inspection under the powers introduced by the previous Government in 2007.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>A training programme will be put in place by the EPA and local authorities to train people who will conduct inspections.  One does not send out people who do not know what they are doing.  I am sure we do not do that under any legislation.  The Senator should respect the fact that, under regulations, we are in a position to develop the necessary training and expertise to do the job, otherwise we will be in contempt of our legislation.  I do not think any state would try to do that.</P>
        <P>In regard to the offences under the legislation, the principal 2007 Act refers to a fine of &euro;15 million and five years in prison for not complying with proper standards on the contamination of water.  That is very draconian.  We will amend the Act on the assessment of groundwater in the context of septic tanks to &euro;5,000 with term of imprisonment. I rest my case.</P>

	<P>The Minister has outlined the issues on section 3.  The Bill is creating great concern in rural areas.  The cost of once off registration is &euro;50 and is another expense.  We have had massive investment in sewerage and water schemes but no contributions were made.  I live in a very rural area.  We have septic tanks.  </P>

	<P Just="Left">I have paid my fee and have my certificate to practise but I am not practising because I am too busy in the Seanad.  The Leader will not have much time today because of all the votes.</P>
        <P>I am familiar with septic tanks because I designed many houses.  Septic tanks are an imperfect science.  They were built during difficult times and if the environment was right they worked very well.  In some areas they did not work well.  It is a question of separating wastewater coming from baths and taps into a septic tank.  In the majority of areas they operate very effectively.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I accept the greatest difficulties we have are close to sources of water servicing towns and villages.  It is obvious those situations would have to be examined.  The Minister said he could not anticipate what funds would be available in four or five years time.  He said he would be very well disposed to funds being made available if a large bill was imposed on a small minority of people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am very conscious of protecting the water supply on my farm.  We do not have a pump but we have facilities for water extraction.  I understand Ballygowan has frozen all the land surrounding its well in County Limerick for safety purposes.  A small operation was built quite close to septic tanks and extracted water for sale.  It can be risky.  The charge is causing concern and people are very worried.</P>
        <P>The charge has come about because of a European directive which did not get enoughdebate in this House.  There is not enough scrutiny of European legislation.  It has created a problem with bogs.  I accept the Minister has responsibility for this area.  He transferred responsibility to the county councils.  He said he does not see many inspectors beingappointed.</P>
        <TimeSt down="3" idown="3">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As former county councillor I have a lot of faith in local engineers, sanitary engineers and other qualified technicians who are in a position to examine septic tanks.  The number of planning permissions has reduced dramatically.  The Minister can see that in his Department.  He can get a report in the morning from Kilkenny and compare the numbers for 2011 to 2008 or 2007.  A number of staff are now underutilised and would be well qualified to carry out inspections when required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not think every septic tank can be inspected but inspections can be carried out if needed.  If trained personnel are not available inspectors could be employed.  Inspections should be carried out within each local authority because there is a surplus of qualified people.  I would appreciate if the Minister considered that suggestion.</P>
      
        <P>Councillors in Roscommon approached me about the Minister&rsquo;s comments on Second Stage that he would exempt any septic tank which had to be upgraded from planning permission, which is welcome.  We need to make sure this is not tied down with bureaucracy and makes things more difficult for those who are affected.  We would prefer if the Bill was not required but it is.  I have confidence, from dealing with my local authority over the years, that inspectors <Col N="678"/>will be able to operate.  They would have a different role to play than local authority staff who know their areas very well.</P>
        <P>If there are two septic tanks in an area one registration should be enough.  I hope my colleague will include that in his amendment to the Bill.  The situation is like that of the water troughs years ago.  There are some exceptional circumstances where two septic tanks have been connected to one property, such as a granny flat.  My point will save a lot of bureaucracy.  A septic tank may have been upgraded and the old one left in place.</P>
        <P>A person should not be prosecuted because he or she did not register two septic tanks, especially where a house is being extended to accommodate a granny flat.  In many cases I recommended such families install a second septic tank to take the pressure off the first.  Adequate property around the house is needed for such situations.  Most houses have only one septic tank.</P>
        <P>Some of the septic tanks installed today are far better than those in the past and are made from PVC and have different chambers.  They are more effective than the older ones.  People installing septic tanks are now are very conscious of the prevailing situation.  We should strive to make the best of this Bill.  My colleague is doing his best to pass amendments which would benefit our constituents.</P>
        <P>We have constituents in rural Ireland and this will become a major issue in the 2014 elections.  It will be like the land tax proposed by Fine Gael in 1979.  It did not go down well then.  This is a tax on rural Ireland.</P>

	<P>I apologise for not mentioning prior notice.  It is a very valid point and I am prepared to consider it, in terms of an amendment on ten working days to give advance notice to people.</P>
        <P>There are various scenarios in which notice should be given.  It is appropriate to include that in the primary legislation rather than by way of regulations.  Ten working days, which is two weeks, is a reasonable notice period.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Leyden for his constructive view on the legislation.  I would prefer not to have to bring forward these provisions, but we are obliged to do so on account of the State losing a case at the European Court of Justice.  It falls to me to deal with the matter and I intend to do so as constructively and pragmatically as possible.</P>

        <P>In the regulations, I have allowed for the fact that local authority staff will administer the scheme and the local authorities will be in charge of it.  In this section, I am including a provision which will allow local authorities to take on additional staff if necessary.  Not all of them will have to do so.  This provision takes account of the Senator&rsquo;s point that some local authorities may have surplus staff.  Not every local authority is the same.  Under these provisions, county councils will use existing staff in the first instance, and it is in their interest to do that.  However, where they require additional staff, they will be in a position to hire them.  There are large numbers of qualified people interested in doing this work because, unfortunately, they are not busy on other fronts.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a reasonable proposal.</P>
        <P>In regard to investment in rural areas, I am sure the Senator has heard of group water schemes and group sewerage schemes.  They did not come about by accident; there was significant support from the State.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Successive Governments, including Fianna F&aacute;il Party Governments, have invested an enormous sum, amounting to some &euro;500 million, in these schemes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I brought the first such scheme to my home village of Castlecoote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Senator is now saying flies in the face of his earlier claim that rural communities have not been assisted by the State in improving their water quality.  Some &euro;500 million has been invested in the last ten years and group water and sewerage schemes continue to receive an annual subsidy from the State.  There is currently an anomaly whereby group water schemes receive grant assistance of &euro;2,000 per household, in my area, while the corresponding figure for group sewerage schemes is &euro;6,000.  We may consider rebalancing that for a period in order to help people in ribbon development areas to come together and have one communal tank.  That would deal with those exceptional cases where there are problems.  It is a reasonable approach and I am prepared to consider it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to address several points which I raised.  I try my best to speak Irish in the House as much as possible and I appreciate that some of my points may <Col N="680"/>have been lost in translation.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments regarding prior notice.  One of the issues I raised was the situation of people with holiday homes, who may not be in them for weeks or months in a given year.  Such home owners might argue that they were not given prior notice because they do not reside on a full-time basis in the properties in question.  That issue must be addressed.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned allowing scope for local authorities to take on additional staff.  I disagree with Senator Leyden on this point.  He seems to be of the view that there are local authority staff hanging around the place with little to do.  I very much doubt there is a great deal of slack.  Does the Minister&rsquo;s undertaking in respect of staff mean the moratorium on public sector recruitment will be lifted or will there be a special dispensation for this specific purpose?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Additional staff will come from outside and will have to register with the inspection panel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard on Radi&oacute; na Gaeltachta that Kerry County Council recently privatised its refuse collection service.  Many county councils are pushing for privatisation, which I do not support.</P>

	<P>I appreciate that, but if it is left to the local authorities I am concerned they may go that route.</P>
        <P>On the planning exemption, will some new mechanism have to be put in place?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister clarify the situation in regard to the right to appeal prior notice?</P>
        <P>I also asked about the cost of inspectors.  Has a cost-benefit analysis been done in this regard?  How many inspectors will be needed throughout the State and what are the budgetary implications of that?  How much is the scheme expected to take in?</P>
        <P>There must be greater clarity in regard to which regulations will be covered and how far back we can go.  For example, if a person had a house built five years ago, were the regulations in place at that time good enough or will he or she be obliged to upgrade the tank?  It is important to put people&rsquo;s minds at ease by indicating that if they complied with the regulations in, say, 2005, they will generally be fine.  I accept that the Minister cannot give a blanket guarantee, but we should be able to reassure people who built homes in recent years that they will not have to replace their septic tanks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister is rowing back somewhat in regard to private inspectors and is now prepared to consider our suggestion regarding local authority staff.  I agree with most of the points made by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  I know something of this coming from a local authority background and talking to local authority members.  There have been massive staff reductions in every local authority in recent years, with contract staff, in particular, being let go.  Any county manager will say that staff are finding it difficult to cope with demand.  I appreciate what the Minister said in regard to the moratorium on recruitment.  There is scope in this regard in the four year fiscal agreement with the European Commission, <Col N="681"/>the EU and the IMF.  There is nothing in that agreement which binds us in regard to the moratorium.  If we are employing additional public servants in order to satisfy the requirements of an EU directive, surely a meeting should be arranged immediately with the European Commissioner and the EU and the IMF to discuss the matter.  If, as the Minister suggested but which I do not accept, it is the EU, the IMF and the Commission which are preventing recruitment, then the first logical step, given that we are aiming for compliance with the European directive, should be an urgent meeting with the troika officials and an urgent meeting with the European Commissioner.</P>
        <P>In regard to what the Minister said about the previous Government introducing private inspectors, he mentioned two items of legislation.  The Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 makes provision for private inspectors, but one cannot compare that legislation with legislation on septic tanks.  One cannot compare protection of dogs &mdash; living, breathing animals &mdash; to septic tanks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but with respect, I have already stated that this is a matter primarily for local authorities.  Some of them will not be in a position to have the necessary staff to deal with this work themselves but if they have the staff, this is the way they should go.  This is erring on the side of allowing local authorities to be in charge of the scheme with EPA guidelines.  This is what they do in the planning process.  I want to see this extended to this issue where fewer than 20% of the people will be inspected.</P>
        <P>As regards allowing private inspectors onto premises this only applies to a small number of people in the Dog Breeding Establishments Act.  At present, a property cannot be sold or rented without a BER certificate  There are approximately 250,000 to 300,000 rental properties in the country so this flies in the face of what the Senator has stated.  The principal position he has taken is that the Dog Breeding Establishments Act is small beer.  Already, under the rental properties scheme, private inspectors are inspecting houses and dwellings before being sold or rented under the BER scheme.  They are able to cope with the amount of work involved when dealing with such large numbers in the same way as they will be able to cope with this.  I regard local authority staff as being the people who will do 90% of this work and nobody should have anything to fear.</P>
        <P>In answer to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh&rsquo;s question about planning, I will repeat that all we want to find out is whether a septic tank, no matter when it was installed or by whom, is working.  It does not matter under which planning conditions the tank may have been installed, for instance, in 1967, 1975 or 2011.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay.  Amendment No. 2 relates to a matter that is similar to that we have previously discussed under section 3.  We are seeking to ensure that inspectors are appointed from within the staff of the agency or local authority, in accordance with section 70E of the Bill.  The Minister has said he appreciates that local authority staff are sufficiently competent to carry out this work.  He has also said he will seek, as far as possible, to ensure local authority staff carry out this work.  However, he does not seem to have the confidence to put that into the Bill.  No legal provision is being made in the Bill for local authority staff to play a role.  While I acknowledge what the Minister has said, it is regrettable that he is not backing up his words by including a provision of this nature in the legislation.  Perhaps it is a reflection of the lack of local authority staff.  The Minister does not seem to be willing to explore the possibility of increasing the number of local authority staff under the memorandum that was agreed with the Commission, the EU and the IMF.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about the role the inspectors will have when they visit one&rsquo;s property.  Many people are concerned about this.  We need to reflect on the role played by septic tanks on one&rsquo;s land.  As the Minister knows, percolation areas are attached to septic tank systems.  When an inspector comes to one&rsquo;s property, he or she will inspect one&rsquo;s septic tank and one&rsquo;s percolation area under the legislation on the basis of any regulations the Minister might sign regarding the maintenance, operation and servicing of septic tanks.  It is unwise and unjust to this House that we are being forced to introduce this legislation without knowing what the maintenance, servicing and operation standards will be.  We can only assume the Minister is <Col N="686"/>proposing to introduce the 2009-10 standards of the Environmental Protection Agency.  We could be wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is wrong again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister can clarify which standards will apply.  I have seen the current Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, which are available on the agency&rsquo;s current website.  One of the matters covered by the guidelines is the size of a percolation area.  The guidelines also specify the trench length that should be associated with a percolation area that feeds off a septic tank.  This is what the inspectors will inspect when they come out.  These are the guidelines the inspectors will be using, not according to Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill but according to the Environmental Protection Agency, which is mentioned in the legislation.  If there are eight people living in a house, under this legislation a trench with a minimum length of 144 m will be required.  If one has a four-bedroom house, with eight people living in it, one will have to install a trench of 144 m from the percolation area of one&rsquo;s septic tank.  The percolation area, the trench and the percolation pipes will have to be at least 2 m apart, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.  They will have to be at least 5 m from a surface water soakaway; at least 10 m from a water course or a stream; at least 10 m from an open drain; at least 50 m from a lake, foreshore or coastal area; at least 7 m from a house in the case of a septic tank and at least 10 m away from a house in the case of a percolation area; at least 3 m from the site boundary; at least 3 m from any trees on the site; at least 4 m from a road; and at least 4 m from any slope breaks or cuts on the site.  If the Minister had 144 m of pipes, and the percolation area and pipes had to be the distances I have mentioned away from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I am referring to the powers of the inspectors.  If the inspectors make their inspections on the basis of those Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, I presume they will tell many people with septic tanks that they do not meet the required standards.  They will be saying that on the basis of the Environmental Protection Agency guidelines.  A site of at least three quarters of an acre will be required in the case of a four-bedroom house, for example, according to the percolation requirements set out in the Environmental Protection Agency guidelines.  That is what I have been told by architects and site assessors, who are professional experts with indemnity insurance.  What will happen to people in four-bedroom houses that were built on sites of half or quarter of an acre?  What will become of those people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to point out that we are giving private inspectors the power to make determinations and judgments on the basis of the current Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, which presumably will be signed into regulation by the Minister.  If the Minister were to follow the 1996 Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, which are being adopted in Cavan and are acceptable to the European Commission and the European Court of Justice, we would be dealing with something entirely different.  The Minister needs to clarify for the purposes of the record which guidelines he is talking about signing into regulation at this stage.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister to specify whether the inspectors will be private, or public as we are proposing in our amendment.  We are suggesting that the inspectors should be employed from agency staff or local authority staff.  We need to know how many inspectors the Minister envisages will be required to inspect this country&rsquo;s 475,000 septic tanks.  I understand from what the Minister said earlier that just 20% of septic tanks will be inspected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have pointed that out to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill on a number of occasions.  He needs to stick to the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.  I accept the Chair&rsquo;s ruling on that.  The legislation proposes that a private pool of inspectors will be appointed by the agency.  What we propose is that those inspectors would be local authority staff, whether new or existing, or staff of the Environmental Protection Agency, whether new or existing.  There should be public scrutiny of, and a public link-up, with those inspectors.  If, as the Minister suggested, most of the inspectors will be local authority staff anyway, then he should agree to the amendment.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the point made about the inspectors because of what I said previously about our fear of privatisation of the inspection service.  It would be better if this was done by county councils or the agency.  It raises the question of accountability and who is responsible from a legal perspective.  I believe I mentioned that earlier.  Fracas might ensue as there is much heat in regard to this Bill.  People have said they will prevent anyone from doing an inspection.  If somebody is prevented from doing an inspection, where does that leave us legally?  I asked earlier about the Attorney General and the advice on that.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that because it is important in regard to the inspectors.  At least if the inspectors are part of the apparatus of the county councils or the agency, these issues might not arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, local authorities will appoint the inspectors and they will be responsible for those appointed.  Those inspectors will be answerable to the local authorities, so there is no difficulty legally.  It is standard practice.  All of what Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill read out were introduced under the Water Services Act 2007 and are in the 2009 EPA guidelines.  They relate to new build and not to this.</P>

The Bill provides that the Minister can make regulations in regard to the performance standards for the domestic waste water treatment system.  I will make regulations on that basis.  They will not deal with what is in existence and the EPA regulations.  They will be new regulations.  All we will ask the regulations and the inspections to do is to ensure the system there is working.  We must establish an inspection and monitoring system in order to comply with the ECJ judgment.  For the purpose of this legislation, the inspections will focus on the performance of the systems along the lines of the Cavan regulations.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that while there is a new Physical Education curriculum in place at primary school level since 1999, it is not being implemented in full in 65% of schools, 54% of those schools citing lack of facilities and 11% of those schools citing pressure of time due to competition with other subjects; (<i>Points for Life &mdash; Physical Fitness for a Healthy Life</i>) (November 2011);</P><Col N="691"/>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that while the status of Physical Education might be equal in law to other subjects, this is not matched in the reality of practice, (<i>Hardman, 2007, 9</i>) and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> proposes that the Government under the stewardship of the Minister for Health acts to develop effective and appropriate responses, cross-Departmental, to implement a continuously assessed physical fitness and health awareness programme and regular corresponding health checks to lessen the burden on our health service in the future and improve quality of life.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, whose presence in the House I consider a personal endorsement of the motion tabled by the Independent Senators.  I have moved the motion and I note the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  I wish to confirm acceptance of the change therein.</P>
        <P>I have a dream, a vision of a destination that I wish to reach with my fellow Senators and colleagues.  Our young people are dangerously on the cusp of becoming a lost generation.  We are facing a tsunami of inactivity and ill-health.  It is our collective responsibility to do something urgently about it right now and I hope that we will do it before it is too late.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>My generation was very fortunate to grow up in an environment where we went out to play sports, to run, to kick ball, to play chase and even to play a game of rounders.  We did it all for fun and we were naturally fit as a result.  Sadly aspects of society have changed for the worse.  In general we have lost our sense of adventure and understanding of the importance of proper physical activity.  Instead, we have inherited the Internet, the PlayStation, Nintendo, Facebook and so much more convenience at our fingertips that one does not have to leave the comforts of home to communicate, seek food or friends.  Our children&rsquo;s interpersonal skills and interactions with one another are diminishing.  We have entered a faster, more dynamic pace of life, full of distractions, convenience food and the car culture, which allows less time for what is really important &mdash; our health.  Life has changed due to a multitude of sad reasons.  Even shockingly, children cannot simply enjoy the pleasure of running around a school yard anymore because of insurance issues.  What is society coming to?  I believe that we must start to teach our children from a young age in a more effective, compulsory, structured and monitored physical fitness learning environment.  The public health checks in schools, which currently check eyesight and hearing, should also monitor physical fitness levels.</P>
        <P>The emphasis should be on the long-term results and we can start immediately to focus on the short and medium-term objectives, which I shall outline.  Through leadership, commitment and cross-departmental co-operation within government, Ireland can be the  role model for the health and well-being for the youth of the world in the not too distant future.  We need to believe we can and we need to have the vision and commitment to take positive action now.  If we collectively act in the Seanad today, we can save &ldquo;The  Lost Generation&rdquo; and create &ldquo;The New Generation&rdquo; of which Ireland will be proud.  We need to go back to the future to achieve this.</P><Col N="692"/>
        <P>Our education system has the most sophisticated, underutilised physical education programme implemented since the foundation of the State.  Our physical education system is too sophisticated, passive and broad to tackle the serious health problems we face as a nation.  It  needs to be simplified, interesting, challenging, rewarding and to be fun.  It needs specific goals based quality exercise rather than quantity and the results need evaluation on an ongoing basis just like other core subjects in numeracy and literacy skills on the school curriculum.  Children need to understand the reasons and the importance of good physical fitness and it should be a constant in their lives.</P>
        <P>Perhaps health and well-being is a more embracing and appropriate title than physical education.  It more accurately reflects the holistic approach to children&rsquo;s health and fitness that is required in the modern world.  Children need to learn and understand simple issues that affect their health such as cardiac disease, diabetes, smoking, drugs, cardiovascular benefits and a range of topics and activities.  Physical education is regarded as a fun subject and it is not taken seriously enough.  It should be regarded as a serious subject that is fun.  Currently, parents can even decide if their children should participate at the whim of a note to the teacher.  This would not happen with mathematics or Irish.</P>
        <P>The last research in this area was completed in 2010 and this was on top of all the previous research undertaken over many years.  I, therefore, undertook qualitative research throughout Ireland for the purpose of this document.  I surveyed 171 schools and had a number of meetings with other key people as outlined in the document.  I asked teachers where physical education comes on the list of priority subjects in school and they indicated it was near the bottom.  When I asked them where fitness rates on the overall scale of a child&rsquo;s well-being, the answer was at the top.  In spite of the evidence that increasing time allocated to physical education does not affect students academically, schools report feeling under pressure to prioritise examinable subjects.  One way of addressing the issue is to make it a subject which is continuously assessed.</P>
        <P>I wish to distinguish that this is not about sports participation; this is about learning, participating and understanding the value of fitness for life and, more important, gaining points for life as opposed to gaining points for college.  From my own experience, improving one&rsquo;s physical fitness is not rocket science.  It just requires a little common sense and discipline.  It also requires the utilisation of existing structures and not large budgets.  It needs bundles of determination, not cash.</P>
        <P>I will outline the recommendations I am proposing as a result of feedback from the genuinely committed principals and PE teachers on the ground.  The remainder of my recommendations can be found in the document I have circulated.  The goals are laid out in three phases &mdash; short, medium and long term &mdash; in order that immediate action can be taken .</P>
        <P>The short-term goals I wish to achieve include to establish a working  committee; secure cross-departmental co-operation; quality and monitored exercise programmes for 15 minutes every day; structured cardiovascular exercises, including speed walking, running, skipping or even using a hula hoop because of its cardiovascular benefits; and the introduction of a fitness diary or homework book for school children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My medium-term goals are the employment of fitness interns, where necessary, as classroom assistants under the JobBridge programme; a simplified physical fitness programme developing motor skills and agility, balance and co-ordination, ABCs; and physical fitness to be a core subject with parents having to attend parent-teacher meetings with physical fitness teachers.  That does not happen.  My long-term goals are to improve the health of our next generation, reduce the financial burden on the Department of Health and for Ireland to be a role model in health education in schools.</P><Col N="693"/>
        <P>I would like to my ask my fellow Senators to stand up for one moment, put their two hands by their sides, close their eyes and stand on one leg.  I thank them very much.  That simple exercise relates to motor skills.  Most people cannot do that for more than two or three seconds.  Can colleagues imagine the benefits of that motor skill if one could balance on one leg for 30 seconds with one&rsquo;s eyes closed?  Exercise provides the points for life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my pleasure to second the motion.  Unfortunately, given our economic circumstances, too often matters such as this are overlooked due to the avalanche of budgetary items dominating our lives and the media.  It is imperative that we do not allow this to continue as we will walk ourselves into a set of social crises which will be every bit as serious as the financial crisis we are experiencing.  Perhaps one difference from the economic problems we face is we can prevent many of social problems on the horizon without having to lean on our EU counterparts.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s motion affords us the opportunity to take proactive steps to tackle the looming obesity crisis and all of us could leave a valuable legacy for future generations.  A total of 30% of our children are either obese or overweight and the percentage is approximately double that in the United States.  I wish the Minister could have attended Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s excellent briefing in the AV room last night.  I went home motivated to start, not to mind start my children.  It is clear what we will run into over the next two generations.  What has happened in America is happening here.</P>
        <P>In the context of obesity, prevention is better than cure.  If obesity is allowed to take hold, it will do untold damage.  Unfortunately, drugs alone will not solve the problem.  What is required to halt the onset of this condition on a wide scale is a cultural transformation in respect of food and fitness.  We all must buy in to that transformation.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan is not only someone who is in a position to comment on this matter, he is also, in light of his expertise and sporting achievements, of which we are all so very proud, the perfect candidate to head up this transformation.  It is worth nothing that a teacher does not have to be an ex-Olympian, Senator Eamonn Coghlan or a physical education expert to motivate children to run, dance, skip, have some fun and work towards a life of health, well-being and great enjoyment.  The impressive document with which Members have been presented was designed to facilitate this debate.  However, I am of the view that it involves much more than that.  The document is an indicator on a map which relates to the route we must take in the context of how we teach physical education and fitness.  In addition, it will be key to the transformation to which I referred if we are to stop obesity in its tracks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I read Senator Eamonn Coghlan&rsquo;s report when preparing for this debate and I must admit that I was dismayed by some of the findings it contains.  In fact, it reinforced many of my views on the education system as it stands.  In the first instance, the system is completely geared towards the leaving certificate points race rather than being focused on preparing young people to lead happy and healthy lives.  The pressure relating to the points race has always been exerted.  However, I fear that this pressure will become even more pronounced in light of Ireland&rsquo;s economic position.  To use an analogy with which I am familiar, we must stop viewing schools as factories the function of which is to produce students who will continue on to third level.  We must return to the drawing board with the objective of producing well-rounded young adults who are equipped for life.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Physical education is a subject which provides us with a platform to redesign the focus of our education system.  While the subject, as currently formatted, gives rise to many positives, it is certainly under-utilised or, perhaps more accurately, ignored.  It is not an exam subject and I strongly recommend that this be changed as part of the ongoing review taking place within the Department of Education and Skills.  Furthermore, budgetary constraints cannot be allowed <Col N="694"/>to stop the reforms outlined in Senator Eamonn Coghlan&rsquo;s report on physical education because the stakes are much too high for them not to be implemented.  Ministers or officials who argue that we cannot move to make physical education an exam subject, with broader parameters which encompass aspects of healthy living or life skills, could leave themselves open to charges of being extremely lacking in vision.</P>
        <P>Senator Eamonn Coghlan clearly stated that he wants to deal with this matter in bite-sized chunks.  However, I do not believe that what is intended will cost a fortune.  There is no reason for it to cost very much because as the Senator stated, much of what is involved is mere common sense.  If we do not make the report&rsquo;s recommendations become reality, sooner rather than later, we will be faced with a health bill that will be ten times greater than the cost of implementing the changes to which I refer.  Sadly, people in Ireland are not great at being proactive.  That is evidenced by the events of recent years.  Let us get ahead of the curve for once.</P>
        <P>We have made a sustained effort to teach our children about the importance of recycling.  When Members go home at night, they will be informed by their children and grandchildren as to the bins into which different items of rubbish should be put.  They literally boss us around and this has worked.  Thanks to my 11 year old daughter, Molly, I recycle everything.  If we allow Senator Eamonn Coghlan to take his bite-sized chunks in respect of the fitness programme, perhaps we adults might also begin to profit.  When I finished discussing this matter with the Senator last evening, I was terrified and I have decided to begin either running, skipping or dancing this weekend.  Imagine the endless benefits we could reap for successive generations by teaching school-going children about the importance of diet, fitness and health.  I strongly encourage Members to support the motion.</P>

The amendment we have tabled to it relates to giving the Minister for Health the opportunity to exploring the options for developing effective and appropriate responses.  The amendment has been put forward because in 2005 the task force on obesity issued its report, which contained 93 recommendations.  In 2009, another report was critical of the fact that only partial implementation had been achieved in respect of these recommendations.  The Minister has established a special action group on obesity and it is important that he and it be given the opportunity to consider both the options available and the best way of putting in place a proactive programme for dealing with this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reports of the World Health Organization, WHO, on this matter indicate that physical inactivity is identified as the fourth leading risk factor in the context of global mortality.  Levels of physical inactivity are rising in many countries and this has major implications in the context of the spread of non-communicable diseases, NCDs, and the general health of the population worldwide.  The significance of physical activity on public health, the global mandates for the work carried out by the WHO in respect of the promotion of physical activity and NCD prevention and the limited existence of national guidelines on physical activity for health in low and middle-income countries make evident the need for the development of global recommendations that address the links between the frequency, duration, intensity, type and total amount of physical activity needed for the prevention of NCDs.</P>
        <P>The WHO&rsquo;s pamphlet &ldquo;Global Recommendations on Physical Activity for Health&rdquo; states:</P>
        <P LI="1">For children and young people, physical activity includes play, games, sports, transportation, chores, recreation, physical education, or planned exercise, in the context of family, school, and community activities.</P>
        <P LI="1">The recommendations to improve cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, bone health, and cardiovascular and metabolic health biomarkers are:</P>
        <P LI="2">1. Children and youth aged 5-17 should accumulate at least 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity daily.</P>
        <P LI="2">2. Amounts of physical activity greater than 60 minutes provide additional health benefits.</P>
        <P LI="2">3. Most of the daily physical activity should be aerobic. Vigorous-intensity activities should be incorporated, including those that strengthen muscle and bone, at least 3 times per week.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The benefits of being physically active outweigh the harms. Any existing risk can be reduced by a progressive increase in the activity level, especially in children and young people who are inactive.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The Government should lead a keep fit and healthy campaign for a sustained period because this will encourage people to be more health conscious.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers have already referred to the statistics relating to this matter.  The <i>safe</i>food report indicates that 61% of adults are overweight or obese, that 1.25 million people have high blood pressure, that 206,000 suffer from angina-heart attack, that 92,000 suffer from stroke and <Col N="696"/>that over 210,000 have diabetes.  A lack of activity contributes in some way to all of these medical conditions.  Obesity can give rise to gall stones, infertility, arthritis, asthma, heart disease, diabetes and hypertension.  All of these conditions are all connected to a lack of physical activity.</P>
        <P>On the RTE programme &ldquo;Operation Transformation&rdquo;, leaders from different age groups are chosen and are asked to follow a strict diet and programme of exercise for a specific period.  These individuals motivate people sitting at home to get out and exercise.  Perhaps a similar programme which would expose children and young people to the benefits of exercise and diet and which would be provided in an educational setting could be developed.</P>
        <P>The proposer of the motion has clearly done his research and has presented a comprehensive report.  What he has done shows how Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas can put forward extremely constructive proposals.  It also shows that not all proposals relating to health and education need to emanate from Government.  I welcome Senator Eamonn Coghlan&rsquo;s proposal, particularly as it represents the way forward in respect of political debate in the House.  The Senator has made a very constructive contribution and, in the context of framing Government policy, it is important that the Minister should give careful consideration to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no country which provides an ideal comparison but it is interesting nonetheless to consider the position which obtains elsewhere with regard to education.  For instance, I looked at one in Scotland which places specific emphasis on healthy living and food and ensuring that young people eat nutritional food, but also there is a proactive programme on exercise and physical activity.  We need to develop that within our educational programme, to be more proactive on it and to set out clear targets to achieve within five and ten year timescales.  That would be important in the future development of policy in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the proposer and the seconder.  I ask that the Minister take on board some of the proposals contained in the report.  I accept that he must do further research with his own group, but this is a constructive contribution and it should be given serious consideration.</P>

	<P>I would be interested to stay but, unfortunately, I have other business to attend to.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senators for proposing this motion, in particular, Senator Eamonn Coghlan, whose reputation needs no introduction.  I welcome a member of his family here today, his brother-in-law, Mr. Con Martin, who is from Skerries and the snooker player, Mr. Ken Doherty.</P>
        <P>I support this motion and as I stated, I thank the Senators for raising it.  It gives me the opportunity to speak on the issue, which is of immense importance, in which I have had an interest long before I came into politics and on which I had a motion before the World Medical Association on the role of the physician in the treatment of obesity and the area of exercise.</P>
        <P>In particular, I wish to state categorically that obesity is a major health problem of epidemic proportions that affects a significant proportion of the population and is, in fact, a ticking time bomb in terms of the health risks it poses, particularly in regard to diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and the significant burden it places on health spending and the areas that Senator Colm Burke mentioned as well.  A substantial part of the solution to the epidemic must lie with a deeper appreciation of the benefits of physical activity and a greater awareness of these benefits to be instilled in the general population, young and old alike.  I accept that teaching children at an early age the value of this when they are receptive to it is the place to begin.</P><Col N="697"/>
        <P>The term &ldquo;physical activity&rdquo; should not be mistaken with &ldquo;exercise&rdquo;.  Physical activity includes exercise as well as other activities which involve bodily movement and are done as part of playing, working, active transportation, house chores and recreational activities such as gardening.  Children and young people take part in various kinds of physical activity, for example, by playing games, participating in different sports and by active commuting.  However, a cause for concern is that their daily habits, which have changed in recent years, as Senator Eamonn Coghlan pointed out, due to new leisure patterns such as TV, Internet and video games, have contributed to increasing rates of childhood overweight and obesity.  It is far easier for parents to supervise a child sitting in a playroom playing the various computer games than if he or she were out in the street.  We all remember, certainly my generation does, that children would take off in the morning and if they did not come home for lunch, parents would not be overly alarmed whereas now if a child is missing for more than ten minutes, everyone is in a state of panic, although, unfortunately, probably with good reason.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to an integrated and cross-departmental approach to addressing this issue.  From the beginning of schooling, physical education forms part of the curriculum in primary and post-primary schools.  In addition, social personal and health education, which is mandatory for all students in primary schools and in junior cycle, specifically addresses the need for regular exercise, and examines food and nutrition issues and the need for a balanced diet.  This is supplemented by the emphasis at second level on balanced eating and exercise in subjects such as home economics and science.</P>
        <P>Physical activity, health and quality of life are closely interconnected.  Physical activity benefits every aspect of health and quite apart from the physical health benefits, it brings many other social and psychological benefits.  There is sufficient evidence to show that those who live a physically active life can gain a number of health benefits including improved self-image and self esteem, reduced anxiety and depression and increased enthusiasm and optimism.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Physical inactivity is now identified as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality.  It is estimated to be associated with 1 million deaths &mdash; approximately 10% of the total &mdash; per year in the WHO European region.  It is also one of the leading risk factors for health and is a proven risk factor for the development of many chronic illnesses and is the main cause for approximately 21% of breast and colon cancers, 27% of diabetes and 30% of ischaemic heart disease burden, according to the WHO in 2010.  The economic burden of chronic disease is considerable, not only for the health system, but also for families and society as a result of reduced income, early retirement, an increased reliance on social care and welfare support and diminished productivity and absenteeism.  The World Health Organization in Europe has estimated that a 10% to 15% increase in chronic diseases would reduce a country&rsquo;s GDP by an order of 1% over the next decade.</P>
        <P>On the cost of physical activity alone in economic terms, based on studies in Switzerland and the UK, physical inactivity is estimated to cost about &euro;150 to &euro;300 per citizen per year.  Even based on a conservative estimate of 10% of the population being inactive here, that would put the cost at between &euro;67.5 million and &euro;135 million.</P>
        <P>More than three quarters of the Irish population are not active enough for good health and are consequently at risk of developing health problems.  While physical activity is a key determinant of health, many of the other determinants such as education, income, gender and environment influence participation in physical activity.  Conversely, an inactive or sedentary lifestyle can influence the other determinants.</P>
        <P>As the best cure for ill health is prevention, it is important that healthy and active lifestyles are established as early as possible.  Children need to be encouraged to reduce the amount of time spent in sedentary activities such as TV and video viewing and playing computer games. <Col N="698"/> There is no one single solution to increasing physical activity.  An effective comprehensive approach will require multiple concurrent collaborative strategies to be implemented.  Increasing physical activity is a societal, not just an individual, problem.  Therefore, it demands a population-based, multi-sectoral, multidisciplinary, and culturally relevant approach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Schools are playing their part in promoting regular exercise and healthy lifestyles among students.  The state of the nation&rsquo;s children report 2010 ranks Ireland as first out of the 41 OECD countries surveyed in terms of the proportion of children who take regular physical exercise.  Children spend less than 25% of their waking hours in school, and it is important that the national strategy in this area should provide a strong focus on encouraging good nutrition and exercise outside of school time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although the task force on obesity recommended that every child should be enabled to achieve a minimum of 30 minutes physical activity every day in all educational settings by restructuring the school day, a range of evaluations have pointed to curriculum overload.  It will, therefore, be difficult to extend the length of time available for PE.  In addition, the Department of Education and Skills has recently asked all primary schools to spend additional time on literacy and mathematics as part of the national literacy and numeracy strategy.  To alter the length of the school day will involve major industrial relations issues and could significantly increase costs.  The length of the school year in hours at primary level is longer than the international norm, but we must address this issue.  I agree we must think outside the box.</P>
        <P>There are proposals for reform in junior cycle which provide that: physical education will remain an essential area of learning to be experienced by all students over the three year cycle; the existing range of subjects will be continued, including PE; schools will have the option of providing locally developed short courses of 100 hours duration, including in physical education; and there will be a cap of eight on the number of subjects which can be taken for qualification purposes.  The proposals are implicitly designed with a view to freeing time in schools for broader educational engagement by students.</P>
        <P>Due to the constraints of the current budgetary climate the scope for curriculum reform is limited and while the priorities in the period ahead are to strengthen achievement in literacy and numeracy, to implement reforms in mathematics, Irish and science, and to progress junior cycle reforms, the issue of exercise at school must be addressed also.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Education and Skills' 2009 lifeskills survey of 2,225 primary schools indicates that 86% to 95% of primary schools, depending on the class group, are delivering at least the recommended one hour per week of PE, and that activities are being provided across all six strands of the curriculum.  However, there is a dominance of games, dance and athletics, with the other strands receiving less attention.  The lifestyle skills survey also indicates that in addition to providing PE, some 78% of primary schools and 89% of post-primary schools promote sport outside of school time.  Furthermore 97% of primary schools promote healthy lunch policies.  Initiatives such as the national healthy eating week, food dudes, and the SPHE curriculum promote the importance of a balanced diet in schools.  Sport for all day, the active school flag award, and active school week all promote the key message that regular exercise is critical to health and well-being.  At this stage, 750 primary schools and 101 post-primary schools have registered their interest in the active school flag award, and 90 schools have been awarded the flag.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note the suggestion in Senator Eamonn Coghlan&rsquo;s report, Points for Life, to make PE a mandatory subject, and the comment that students are excluded from PE at the whim of a note to the teacher from parents.  It is the policy of the Department of Education and Skills that all students should be offered PE and that every effort should be made in schools to include all <Col N="699"/>students, including those with special needs.  I am also aware that schools make Trojan efforts in this regard.  Parents who seek to exclude their children from PE generally do so for medical or injury reasons or for reasons of conscience.  Schools are not in a position to refuse such requests.  Article 2 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights requires that the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions.  This is also a requirement under section 30 of the Education Act.  However, teachers should and do take the opportunity to educate parents on the value of exercise for their children.</P>
        <P>The provision of multipurpose rooms and outdoor play areas for primary schools forms part of new school building and major extension projects funded by the Department of Education and Skills.  At second level, it is the policy of the Department to provide a PE hall as part of new school building projects.  These issues are considered as part of the design brief for new schools and of major renovation or extension projects, subject to available resources and overall published criteria for prioritising projects.  The schools capital allocation for 2011 amounts to &euro;408 million, for both primary and post-primary schools.  These funds will be fully expended by the end of the year.  Furthermore, an additional sum of approximately &euro;28 million will be expended on the 2011-12 minor works grant to be issued to primary schools shortly.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s medium term infrastructure and capital investment framework, which was published recently, includes an allocation for education capital of just over &euro;2.2 billion over the five years of the plan.  This is an average annual allocation of just over &euro;440 million.  In addition to general purpose and PE halls included in major building projects, grants issued to schools specifically in respect of physical education in the amount of &euro;9.5 million in 2006-07 and &euro;16 million in 2010.</P>
        <P>The HSE fully supports the SPHE programme and is currently working with the SPHE co-ordinators on its implementation along with a health promoting school model which has been agreed with my Department and the Department of Education and Skills.  The HSE also supports the schools through a number of programmes, including action for life; be active after school activity; supporting all local sports partnerships; sponsorship of community games for post-primary schools; the soccer league for boys and girls; active school flag; and other various localised projects and programmes</P>
        <P Just="Left">Earlier this year, I established a special action group on obesity, comprising key stakeholders, including a representative from the Department of Education and Skills, to examine and progress a number of issues to address the problem of obesity.  I acknowledge that no single initiative will reverse the trend, but a combination of measures should make a difference.  For this reason the group is concentrating on a range of measures, including actions such as calorie posting in restaurants, nutritional labelling, restrictions on the marketing of food and drink to children, the improved detection and treatment of obesity, revised healthy eating guidelines and the promotion of physical activity.  The group will liaise with other Departments and organisations as required.  While there have been many initiatives and programmes introduced to help people make the healthy lifestyle choices which go hand in hand with good health, there is much more to be done.</P>
        <P>As I have often said, the first step to addressing any problem is to recognise it.  The HSE is considering opportunistic monitoring of overweight and obesity carried out on a routine basis during health checks.  Recently, algorithms for the treatment of overweight and obesity were developed.  These tools will make it easier for health care professionals to monitor and treat overweight and obese children at primary care level.  The adult algorithm is now available while the one for children is at the final stages of agreement and will be available shortly.  The whole <Col N="700"/>issue of overweight and obesity and physical activity and nutrition are intertwined and one cannot talk about one without referring to the others.</P>
        <P>There is ample evidence showing that in Ireland, like other developed countries, we have become increasingly sedentary in our daily lives.  We know from research that three out of every four Irish adults and four out of five Irish children do not meet the physical activity levels required for health and consequently are at risk of developing serious health problems due to inactivity.  It was for this reason that my Department and the HSE developed national physical activity guidelines in 2009.  These emphasise the importance of physical activity to overall health and well-being and set out the minimum levels recommended for different sectors of the population.  Children need 60 minutes of moderate activity a day.  As the Romans used to say, <i>mens sana in corpore sano, </i>a healthy mind in a healthy body.  It is well known that exercise produces endorphins in the system that make people feel better, feel well and less likely to suffer from depression.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A dedicated website &mdash; <i>getirelandactive.ie</i> &mdash; was also developed to become a one-stop-shop for physical activity information.  As the aim of the website is to encourage people to become more physically active by creating awareness of the opportunities for physical activity at local, regional and national levels, the main feature is a well-designed search facility that enables users to search for activities happening in each county.</P>
        <P>Increasing the physical activity levels of our population would save significant public money by reducing health care costs.  Participation in sport improves health, contributes to the economy, builds communities, establishes pride in Ireland at home and abroad, drives tourism and makes us feel good.  However, in Ireland, there are still major social and economic gradients between those who do and do not take part.  Sedentary behaviour refers to activities that do not involve participation in physical activity and it is a major underlying cause of death, disease and disability.</P>
        <P>Walking and cycling are two sustainable forms of transport that improve health and are carbon and cost neutral, yet only four out of ten children walk or cycle to or from school.  Adults and children who walk or cycle to school or to work are known to be more active, to use motorised transport less, to gain enhanced health benefits and to develop social capital.  Active commuting can help children clock up the required 60 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity they need.  It does not all have to be done at once.  It can be built up over the day by doing a number of short bouts of at least ten minutes of activity at a time.  Regular moderate intensity physical activity, such as walking, cycling, or participating in sports, has significant benefits for health.  For instance, it can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, colon and breast cancer, and depression.  Moreover, adequate levels of physical activity will decrease the risk of a hip or vertebral fracture and help control weight.  As anybody here who is a parent knows, the natural disposition of a child is to move and rather than suppress that, we should encourage it.</P>
        <P>In 2004, the 57th World Health Assembly endorsed Resolution WHA 57.17 &mdash; global strategy on diet, physical activity and health &mdash; and recommended that member states develop national physical activity action plans and policies to increase physical activity levels in their populations.  The evidence shows that successful approaches to physical inactivity are long term and involve many sectors and agencies.  National guidelines alone are insufficient to increase participation levels and work is now taking place on the development of a physical activity plan.  The aim of the plan is to give clear direction for the promotion of physical activity in Ireland.  A special group, chaired by the HSE, comprising Departments and key stakeholders is currently developing a national physical activity plan in order to provide strategic direction enabling an <Col N="701"/>increase in and maintenance of the proportion of the population in Ireland who are physically active.</P>
        <P>Research tells us that the consumption of energy rich, nutritionally poor food from the top of the food pyramid is high among the Irish population.  It is clear that people need to be made more aware of the importance of nutrition.  My Department has revised the healthy eating guidelines, including the food pyramid, and I will be making these available in the coming months.  They will help inform people about the food and drink choices required for health and set out in plain and simple language the food servings the Irish population need to consume to maintain health and well-being.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The World Health Organization recommends that no more than 10% of daily energy should come from added sugar.  They have serious concerns over the high and increasing consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks by children in many countries because of their link to obesity, and hence to diabetes, and I am currently considering measures to reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks in Ireland.  Among the measures I am considering is sending a memorandum to Government shortly regarding a sugar tax on sweetened drinks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Calorie posting on restaurant menu boards was one of the measures identified by the special action group on obesity as being able to contribute to addressing the problem of obesity.  I wrote to food establishments in Ireland last month inviting them to support me in introducing calorie posting in Ireland.  It is a simple concept and educates the general population on calorie content of food portions.  The calorie content per portion is displayed in the same colour and font as the price and beside the price on the menu board.  In that regard we should commend our own restaurant on displaying healthy options.</P>
        <P>Another important initiative under way is Your Health is Your Wealth: A Policy Framework for a Healthier Ireland 2012 &mdash; 2020.  The aim of the public health policy framework is to develop a high-level policy framework for public health to cover the period from 2012 to 2020.  Following extensive consultation, drafting has now commenced.  It will address the broad determinants of health and health inequalities through our health services, community and education settings.  It is anticipated that the review will identify a number of key lifestyle policy issues such as smoking, alcohol and obesity where further action is required.  It will identify practical ways to strengthen working between sectors to promote and protect the health and well-being of all sectors in our society.  It is the aim of this process to engage leaders and policy makers across government and society to recognise that improving the public&rsquo;s health is the responsibility of all sectors of society and not just the responsibility of the health service public health workforce.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All the initiatives being considered by the special action group on obesity will form part of the development of this public health policy framework to enhance the health and well-being of all the population.</P>
        <P>Being physically active is one is one of the most important steps one can take to improve one&rsquo;s health, whatever one&rsquo;s age or ability.  The evidence shows that successful approaches to physical inactivity are long-term and involve many sectors and agencies.  We must take a more holistic approach to promoting, maintaining and improving rates of active living.  By encouraging physical activity and active living from an early age, the population can reap the benefits into old age.  We must ensure that is made possible through supportive policies in health, education, environment, sport and transport, both at national and local levels.  I firmly believe that together we can ensure that people can lead more active and healthy lives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I am supportive of the motion put down by the Senators I once again thank them for raising such an important issue and giving me the opportunity to appraise the Seanad of the work being progressed in this area.  Neither I nor the Government wish to preside over a <Col N="702"/>situation where we are the first generation to outlive the generation behind us.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I heartily congratulate Senator Eamonn Coghlan on the introduction of this motion.  I assure everyone that Fianna F&aacute;il will be 100% behind Senator Coghlan.  I am delighted the Senator&rsquo;s family is present to witness his contribution to a debate in the important Upper House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>It was a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister in 2007 who was the first Minister in the world to introduce a full smoking ban in public workplaces.  I do not know whether many people are aware of what the then Minister did.  He had the support of the Cabinet behind him but he drove the issue personally and said it was critical for our health that we have a national campaign encouraging people to give up smoking.  I am sure there are many people here who joined in on that.  The Minister met a great deal of resistance from our own Fianna F&aacute;il people and from people throughout the country but he was on a mission to ban smoking in public areas and as I said was the first in the world to do that.  Ireland has been emulated by many countries throughout the world and are a great example in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is an opportunity now for the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, to lead the campaign to improve the physical health and, consequently, the mental health of our young people.  The Minister quoted the Romans when he said that a healthy body is a healthy mind.  In this case the Minister will get the Irish people behind him but he must get it on the radar, so to speak, that balanced nutrition and physical activity are critical for the physical and mental development of future generations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is estimated that currently 300,000 children in Ireland are either overweight or obese and, worryingly, our obesity rates do not appear to be slowing down.  Constant media coverage and Government initiatives like the obesity task force have resulted in an ever-increasing public awareness of the problem but the issue does not appear to be resolving.  What can we do in that regard?  From my participation in the previous Oireachtas I found it was very difficult to get the issue of obesity and physical activity on the radar.  There are many organisations passionately doing their best but we must have a national driver, either the Minister or Senator Eamonn Coghlan, to improve the physical and mental health of young Irish people.</P>
        <P>First, we need to understand obesity and its health implications.  People should be aware that many of the health risks associated with being overweight or obese are not visible, for example, too much fat in the blood and diabetes.  Second, we must make parents more aware of their child&rsquo;s weight and what an overweight child looks like.  One alarming statistic showed that one out of three parents of obese teenagers believes their child&rsquo;s weight is fine, and three out of four parents of overweight teenagers believe their child&rsquo;s weight is fine.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that in any surveys done the awareness of the importance of a balanced diet and physical activity is very much to do with the economic status of parents.  Until we introduced the smoking ban less well off people were not aware how destructive smoking was, and I am an ex-smoker.  I gave up smoking 20 years ago, although I put on four stone and have not got rid of it yet.  I am one of those people who say they will start exercising every day but I have not succeeded yet.  I find it difficult to come up the stairs outside the Chamber.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We know it is good for our health to watch our diet and to exercise.  We need to get onto the school curriculum that children should be commuting to school.  The Minister or Senator Eamonn Coghlan must get it into parents&rsquo; heads that 30 minutes of exercise a day is required to keep the health standard high because as I said this morning there are dramatic improvements in life expectancy for people with breast cancer, colon cancer and non-Hodgkin lym<Col N="703"/>phoma survival rates.  There is an improvement of ten years life expectancy for people who get those diseases.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fianna F&aacute;il is a very much maligned party in this House but one of our great achievements was to introduce the smoking ban; it was the first in the world to do it.  The Minister should tackle this issue.</P>
        
        <P>While doing a study on a new approach to ageing and ageism, I learned from speaking to consultant gerontologists that they all cycle to work which is amazing.  Professor Rose Anne Kenny in Trinity College Dublin and Professor Des O&rsquo;Neill cycle to work and carry their helmets to meetings.  They know it is important to be physically active as one gets older.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister the best of luck.  I am a fan of the Minister who made an excellent speech.  Having been involved in the previous Joint Committee on Health and Children, he knows his brief.  I look forward to Senator Eamonn Coghlan&rsquo;s proposals being delivered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  This is an important debate in which I have a particular interest.  I will not refer again to the statistics which have been presented.  Suffice to say that obesity is a major challenge for society in terms of obvious health impacts, healthy living, quality of life issues and even employment.  It is estimated that physical inactivity costs the economy approximately &euro;1.6 billion per annum.  We can only imagine what we could do if such a sum were available to us.</P>

        <P>The obvious health impacts of obesity are in cardiovascular and circulatory illnesses.  Heart disease is the leading cause of death among Irish adults and the country has the highest rate of ischaemic heart disease in Europe for men and the third highest rate for women.  A 15 year longitudinal study showed that rates of ischaemic heart disease increased until the mid-1970s before reaching a plateau and entering a period of steady decline.  Obesity rates, on the other hand, have increased in parallel with this decline.  While more work needs to be done to determine the relationship between obesity and ischaemic heart disease, it is clear that the change in obesity levels coincides with a period of rapid modernisation and associated trends such as a sedentary lifestyle and the proliferation of fast food and convenience food production.  It would be great if we could construct our public policy responses around this analysis but, unfortunately, matters are not so simple.  While there is no doubt something in this analysis, a great number of other issues have influenced rates of overweight and associated health conditions.</P>
        <P>It is startling to note that as many as 200,000 people may be walking around today with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes.  This is a major problem for the individuals concerned, as the Minister noted.  His colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, stated recently that the current generation of parents face the prospect of seeing their children die before them as a result of obesity related illness.  This is a terrible tragedy for a great number of people.</P>
        <P>Some 40% of common cancers are in related to being overweight.  The curtailment of life opportunities and potential due to weight related illnesses is immeasurable.  The problem also has societal implications, however, because aside from the personal costs of obesity, the economic cost is &euro;1.6 billion each year.  It is only when one starts speaking of money that policymakers seem to listen.  The increased burden on our health service is self-evident, as is the fact that we are storing up problems for the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To identify and quantify the problem is half the battle while the other half involves deciding what policy direction we will take to implement strategies to combat obesity.  A proper analysis of the problem is vital.  As such, we need to examine all aspects of modern living to establish where its root lies.  We can look in some unlikely and at first glance less than obvious places, <Col N="704"/>one of which is the planning system.  We have not allowed the proper development of footpaths and cycleways in the past ten years, a period in which one third of the housing stock was replaced.  We produced a car-based society in which the majority of children are driven to school.  As a result of poor planning by local authorities, it is dangerous to allow children to cycle to school, play in the streets and indulge in a range of informal recreational activities which we took for granted a few short years ago.</P>
        <P>The planning system allows sports grounds to be relocated from town centres, which were within easy walking distance for most of the population, to the countryside.  In many cases, the new locations are several miles outside the town centre in areas where land prices are more affordable.  It is bizarre that people need to be driven to places where they can exercise.</P>
        <P>We must examine the school curriculum to identify whether the objectives of physical education are being achieved.  While education and sports policy overlap in important ways and are likely to support each other, their core orientations are not the same.  Other policy areas also have an interest in physical activity.  However, in many cases policy goals do not coincide and in some cases they are contradictory.  We must examine physical activity facilities in schools, some of which do not even have the basic facilities required to meet the minimum targets.</P>
        <P>We need to examine particular groups and whether they achieve minimum standards.  We know that children between the ages of eight and 13 years are most likely to be active and physical activity declines during teenage years.  All available research shows that boys are more active than girls to engage in physical activity, probably owing to the types of sporting opportunities aimed at particular cohorts of the population.  Children are not given an opportunity to walk.  This trend may be a response to a perceived increase in crime, particularly in urban areas, despite evidence to suggest the crime rate is declining.</P>
        <P>I train a couple of soccer teams in Glanmire where I live.  It is noticeable that even very young children are not fit.  My club needs to concentrate on fitness in the pre-season, even in the case of very young children, which is remarkable.  This is worrying because the patterns of behaviour laid down in childhood influence future behaviour.  We can blame the rise of electronic goods and young people spending hours in front of television sets with console in hand.  However, the many factors I have cited cannot be viewed in isolation from another.</P>
        <P>We also need to consider how food is promoted and who is the target audience for advertisers.  Highly sweetened drinks and foods are advertised for the children&rsquo;s market and fast food that is high in calorific content is portrayed in ways that makes it appear cool.  We know there is a direct link between intake of carbohydrate containing food and low income households and that this link is price related.  This issue must also be considered.</P>
        <P>We must examine our cultural norms and ask ourselves if our relationship with food and body image is a healthy one.  Needless to say, we must examine our relationship with alcohol.  At 200 calories per drink, alcohol is a serious culprit in respect of overweight.  We need to consider the problem in all its complexity because the temptation to choose one or other from this eclectic mix is difficult to resist.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Senator Eamonn Coghlan for publishing his report.  It addresses important issues and is a serious piece of work which must be taken seriously.  I congratulate him on his hard work and diligence.  As the Senator noted, education is at the heart of solving this problem.  I will not steal from or plagiarise his speech.  If we are to achieve success in this area, we must do two things, namely, listen to the experts in the field, of whom Senator Eamonn Coghlan is one, and ensure that policy areas work together to achieve the maximum outcome.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="705"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator Eamonn Coghlan on a remarkable initiative.  I believe this is the first time this subject has been properly discussed in the Seanad and the Senator also achieved another unique first in getting all Senators present to stand on one leg with their eyes closed.  Perhaps this is appropriate because it appears to be the stance adopted by the current Government.</P>
        <P>I apologise for my absence during the Minister&rsquo;s speech which was, in its own dull way, a remarkable performance.  The only merit it appeared to have is that it was delivered with the same lack of interest that was obvious in the listeners.  I will give an example of the reason I say this.  The Minister stated: &ldquo;Adults and children who walk or cycle to school or to work are known to be more active, to use motorised transport less...&rdquo;.  Of course they use motorised transport less; they are walking.  This statement hardly has the same <i>&eacute;clat</i> as an announcement on the behaviour of the neutron in the hadron collider.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The lack of emphasis displayed by the Minister is certainly singularly appropriate, as is the degree of support he so ineffectively provides.  I use the word &ldquo;ineffectively&rdquo; because he copies every single paragraph except the last one, which is a classic technique I have seen in this House, one that was attacked by the Fine Gael and the Labour Party side when this side was in government.  I do not refer to Senator Gilroy because he was not here at the time and is absolutely guiltless &mdash; as innocent as an unshorn lamb.  The final paragraph of the amendment states it is proposed &ldquo;that the Government under the stewardship of the Minister for Health explores options for developing effective and appropriate responses, cross-departmental, to implement a continuously assessed physical fitness and health awareness programme and regular corresponding health checks to lessen the burden on our health service in the future and improve quality of life&rdquo;.   This is a case of kicking for touch because it means nothing will be done and more reports will be published.  Experts will be assembled and their writings will be pored over and nothing will be done.  Contained and buried in the Minister&rsquo;s speech is the reason, namely, that it may cost a certain amount of money in the short term, although in the long term it would have significant health benefits and save the Exchequer money.  For this reason, I will most certainly remain in the Chamber to vote with the original motion.  I usually attempt to be a peacemaker and try to bring the two sides together by securing a composite motion.  This time, however, it is important that we vote to support the motion in the names of Senators Eamonn Coghlan, Fiach Mac Conghail, Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell, Jillian van Turnhout and Katherine Zappone.  I will certainly commit myself to so doing.</P>
        <P>I welcome one or two things in the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  The first is the establishment of the special action group on obesity.  However, lest the Government claim originality on this, let me point out that a cross-party group from both Houses took part in &ldquo;Operation Transformation&rdquo; with the late Gerry Ryan.  I was involved in that group as the leader and our star performer was Senator Sheahan, who lost a considerable amount of weight through rigid discipline.  We actually won that event and we beat the large cab drivers from Galway and the large ladies from one of the suburbs of Dublin.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to use the word &ldquo;fat&rdquo;, although I would quite happily have used it about myself at that time.  I lost a mere two and a half stone.  It was done through discipline, but as we were all politicians, we decided to continue this by keeping our group together and make recommendations, precisely because we were a cross-party group.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We continued to meet as an all-party group and we came up with recommendations in concert with people who had been researchers on &ldquo;Operation Transformation&rdquo;.  We suggested nutritional labelling in restaurants, which we discovered had been tried in America where it was found there was not much income disadvantage, and restrictions on the marketing of food and drink to children.  I would like to see something like that reactivated because the Minister is talking about more experts and civil servants.  Practising politicians from all sides, on the <Col N="706"/>back of the excellent initiative of Senator Eamonn Coghlan and the independent Senators, should continue with this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report is very significant.  I compliment Senator Eamonn Coghlan on meeting so many groups from schools and universities to researchers and people teaching on the ground.  There is a reticence among some teachers to teach this if they are not trained.  We need more properly trained people.  I am also astonished that the Minister states that parents are allowed to opt out on the grounds of conscience.  I do not believe that for a minute.  What is the problem with conscience?  Is it that they might catch the glimpse of an ankle, male or female?  I simply do not understand that.  I would have thought that exercise was good.  The research from Dr. Karim Khan, which shows that physical inactivity kills more than smoking, obesity and diabetes combined, is the most single convincing argument in the entire report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I come from a very different era to most of those currently in the Seanad.  I was in school at a time when we had about half an hour of physical activity.  We just raised our arms and did a few things like that.  It was not taken seriously at all.  I agree with Senator Eamonn Coghlan and his supporters.  It should be compulsory.</P>
        <P>I was also pleased with another aspect of the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  He used a Latin phrase <i>&ldquo;mens sana in corpore sano</i>&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;a sane mind and a sound body&rdquo;.   I congratulate him on his courage because I have learned that it is politically toxic to make any reference whatever to the wisdom of the ages, classical languages or anything that shows intelligence above the moronic.</P>
        <P>This is a very good debate.  I congratulate those people involved in it.  I am sorry the Government has chosen to restrict it in the way it has.  I hope there will be a vote and I will be voting with the proposals of the motion.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is a great moment to have this debate in the Seanad and I would also like to compliment Senator Eamonn Coghlan.  Physical exercise is something we can all do and something we can all do cheaply.  It  is a major argument in favour of health outcomes.  It is good for our overall well being.  As the Minister for Health said himself, it aids in the release of endorphins, which make us feel better.  That definitely contributes to our overall well being and fights depression as well.</P>
        <P>I would like to quote some of the greats from the past:</P><Col N="707"/>
        <P LI="1">To keep the body in good health is a duty.  Otherwise we shall not be able to keep our minds strong and clear.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">It was the great Buddha himself who said that.  Here is another quote,  &ldquo;Those who do find time for exercise will have to find time for illness.&rdquo;  That is quite thought provoking and it came from Edward Smith-Stanley, who was three times Prime Minister of the UK in the 19th century.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand that Senator Eamonn Coghlan has accepted the Government amendment in principle, and I am delighted about that.  The only minor point on which we differ is the fact that the Minister has established a special action group on obesity and we are waiting to hear the outcome of that.  It will explore the options for developing effective and appropriate responses across Departments.  We must examine this across Departments such as the environment, education and health.  This issue crosses many different areas of responsibility.</P>
        <P>I would like to make three points.  There is a compelling argument for everyone to be more physically active, but since 1990, there has been an eightfold increase in teenage male obesity and a twofold increase in teenage female obesity.  An eightfold increase in obesity among young males over 20 years is really frightening.  Children in the lower end of the social class spectrum are more likely to suffer, due to an unhealthy lifestyle of fast food outlets, cheap manufactured food and very little exercise.  &ldquo;Growing Up in Ireland&rdquo; revealed two important facts.  Children from professional households are less likely to be overweight and obese, and children from unskilled households are more likely to suffer, and this figure is 29% for boys and 38% for girls.  Therefore, it is very important that we look at the lower socio-economic group here as a particular group at risk, as well as looking at all children generally.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak in favour of education.  I started my working life as a primary teacher and I loved physical education.  I took a particular interest across the whole school in physical education for a selfish reason.  I was so deeply interested in it, and so were the children.  We had basketball leagues and other leagues, and they all took to it.  The key to physical education in schools, where there are no trained physical education teachers, is to have interested teachers.  Teachers must be interested and there must be investment in their skills.  This will not be beaten for good models.  I have seen great enthusiasm and a desire to be involved when we have somebody who wants to lead this.</P>
        <P>Children naturally love activity, as the Minister pointed out.  They are naturally competitive.  If we told two kids to walk together around the perimeter of a school, they would probably get to the end of the bench before they would be running.  It is just in them to go for it.  We need to encourage them.  We need to make time for it and we need to have the right people promoting it.  There is absolutely no point forcing a teacher who has no interest in it or who does not feel good at it, because it will just die a death.  However, there needs to be investment.</P>
        <P>I am also in favour of physical education being an examinable subject at second level for two reasons.  First, many of our children are naturally talented in this area.  Physical intelligence is one of the multiple intelligences.  We should let the children who shine in that area experience success in examinations as a reward.  In addition, if PE were examinable, it could be an incentive for inactive children to be more active.  As we saw, 11% of teachers said that time pressure due to other exam-based subjects prevented them from using the programme, so if it was an examinable subject the addition of extra time would be an attraction.</P>
        <P>Health is not just linked to exercise, it is also linked to good nutrition.  For a long time I have argued for breakfast to be provided in schools.  Children who are physically active need to be fed, but breakfast in schools will not only help them in this regard, it will also help them to learn.  That would be a key societal change.  Not every child likes breakfast at breakfast time but by the time they get to school they could have an appetite.</P><Col N="708"/>
        <P Just="Left">There is a more I could say about supporting the Minister in terms of calorie counting and paying attention to the sugar and salt contents of food, but I will finish by saying, &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; to Senator Eamonn Coghlan.  He is leading the way and we are all prepared to follow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like other Senators, I commend the Independent group of Senators, especially Senator Eamonn Coghlan, for introducing this important motion.  I will start with a little story.  Earlier this year, in September, I got involved in boxing, for a white collar boxing tournament.  On the first night I found it very hard to get through the warm-ups without nearly collapsing, which is not something I am proud of.  When I did PE in school, as it was often centred around football or basketball &mdash; sports I had no interest in or natural affinity for &mdash; I often sat it out, either with a note from my mother or a conveniently forgotten tracksuit.  On that first night of boxing I felt the effects of having been completely sedentary during my adolescence and not having taken part in any physical activity.  Since that night I have started to increase my physical activity because I have found something I enjoy.  It is not football or basketball but boxing.  It combines all sorts of physical activity and I am really enjoying it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it political boxing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I use it as an opportunity to vent.  Physical activity should be a part of every young person&rsquo;s life in some guise or another.  Encouraging a person to find an activity he or she is interested in, whether it be a traditional sport, dancing or anything else, is an important part of our task in the future.  Physical activity is important, as the motion notes, in the overall well-being of children.  I share the concerns of health professionals and user groups about the increasing prevalence of obesity in young children and adults.</P>
        <P>While a lot of research has focused on the physical and health benefits of exercise, it is worth noting, as other Senators have, the growing body of work demonstrating that exercise promotes wellness and mental health.  Researchers at Duke University in the US who studied people suffering from depression for four months found that 60% of participants who exercised for 30 minutes three times a week overcame their depression without using any anti-depressant medication at all.  Physical activity can be viewed as a wellness activity that may actually prevent physical and emotional conditions.  It controls weight, combats health conditions and diseases, improves mood, boosts energy and promotes better sleep.</P>
        <P>While parents should do everything possible to ensure their children are not putting their health at risk through poor diet and lack of exercise, the State also has a responsibility in this regard, particularly in view of the significant impact the increase in obesity will have on our already overstretched health care system.  There are numerous barriers preventing children from adopting healthy lifestyles and the importance of having a balanced diet and regular exercise cannot be overstated in this day and age.  While the school curriculum has many positive aspects, there has been some difficulty with implementation.  A study on sport in schools funded by the Irish Sports Council found that 19% of primary and 12% of post-primary schoolchildren met the Department of Health physical activity recommendations.  As has been said already, girls were less likely than boys to meet the physical activity recommendations; I am a prime example of this.  The likelihood of meeting the physical activity recommendations decreased with increasing age.  One in four children were unfit, overweight or obese, or had elevated blood pressure.  Children who met the Department&rsquo;s physical activity recommendation of more than 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily had the best health profile of all.  That is why we need to work alongside teachers, education providers and health care professionals to help children develop physical skills and support a lifelong interest in sport and being active.</P><Col N="709"/>
        <P>Schools are a key setting for children to get their 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity.  Given the significant portion of their time that children spend in school, schools should undertake a combination of strategies and approaches to help children to be more physically active, including having infrastructure and policies that encourage and increase access to physical activity for all students, the maintenance of strong physical education programmes that engage students in moderate to vigorous physical activity, and the provision of a variety of activities and specific skills so that they can be physically active not just during PE class but throughout the day, even if it consists of standing up and raising their foot for 30 seconds during a class.</P>
        <P>However, many schools do not have the resources at their disposal, an issue we must consider.  On wet or icy days it may not be safe to take children outside, and many schools do not yet have sports halls or indoor sports facilities.  In 2008 John Carr of the INTO said that the failure by the Department to improve facilities for physical education opportunities in primary schools meant that many children were not even getting the minimum lesson time recommended in the curriculum.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">On paper, the time recommended for physical education in our schools is the lowest in Europe.  In practice it is far worse than that because in too many of our schools bad weather prevents physical education being taught.  This is because too many of our schools lack an indoor facility for PE.  In Ireland PE is weather dependent.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I thank Senator Eamonn Coghlan for introducing this motion and I look forward to supporting it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  I too commend Senator Eamonn Coghlan for his excellent briefing booklet on physical fitness and education.  He will have to run home tonight with all the praise he is getting here today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are all aware of the importance of a healthy lifestyle and physical fitness to improve our well-being and health, both physical and mental, and our hectic life schedules.  We all know how beneficial it is and how good we feel after physical exercise, be it swimming, running, playing soccer, playing football, kick-boxing or white collar boxing.  Everybody feels better after some kind of fitness activity.  It is vital that we ensure we give our young people the best possible opportunities in both primary and secondary school.  As has been mentioned, this is where subjects such as SPHE can tie in with the importance of PE and one can feed into the other.  Children can learn the importance of a good healthy lifestyle that will make them healthier in the future and help them avoid diseases such as diabetes and heart disease &mdash; which, as has already been pointed out, will save the State money in the long run.</P>
        <P>As a former secondary school teacher I am all too familiar with the difficult job that PE teachers often have, not through their own fault but because they must deal with situations &mdash; I have seen it umpteen times &mdash; such as students coming in with notes to excuse them from PE, sometimes genuinely written by parents and sometimes very well forged, with every excuse under the sun as to why the child cannot do PE.  I must agree that would never happen in an examination subject.  As a teacher of music, I cannot argue that the core subjects of Irish, English and mathematics were seen as the important subjects, whereas music, art and PE were what we called choice subjects.  Some liked PE, some liked art and some liked music.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Often I hear of if not the best then intelligent, well behaved, excellent students claiming they are unable to go to PE class because they must finish their Irish or French.  This is all wrong.  We should make PE compulsory, as the Senator pointed out.  Often the priority of PE in the school curriculum &mdash; I can speak for the curriculum at second level &mdash; is lesser than for examination subjects.  For example, many schools do not offer PE in fifth and sixth year, giving way instead to extra career guidance or religion classes.  This sends out the wrong message to parents and students, suggesting PE is not important.</P><Col N="710"/>
        <P>In some schools PE is timetabled haphazardly and this is a significant problem as well.  Sometimes PE is timetabled for either the class before what we call &ldquo;little break&rdquo; or &ldquo;big break&rdquo; or the class after break with lunch time in between.  This breaks the whole momentum of the class and, in addition, students may go to the canteen in between the two PE classes for curry chips or a curry butty, often the staple diet.  I have no wish to rehearse the issues other Senators have raised.</P>
        <P>PE is often regarded as a subject of lesser importance than examination subjects.  I admit to times when I sought students for extra classes and often they would attend during their PE class explaining that is was &ldquo;only PE class&rdquo;.  They should have more respect for the subject but it starts at the top.  When the schools respect it the teacher respects it and then it will feed down to the pupils.  Often, the PE hall is used as the examination hall in schools.  Sometimes in cases where examinations are staggered in large schools this can mean that the PE hall is out of action for up to one month at a time and students are sent to the study hall instead.  This is totally wrong &mdash; because the PE hall is out of action does not mean PE should be stopped altogether.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I meet schoolgoing children and children I have taught previously three or four times per week in my local gymnasium who undertake vigorous exercise regimes but they do not go to PE class in school.  This must be tackled.  I am unsure what the answer is or whether it is because the facilities are not in place.  It would not cost a great deal of money to have some type of exercise regime but I wonder why it is so prevalent.  Often I find that students who come to me from PE class are the most energised students.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Senator Eamonn Coghlan for introducing the motion, it contains many good proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I echo the ringing congratulations that Senator Eamonn Coghlan has justifiably garnered today not only for his research and report and for his initiative to bring this important motion before the House, but also for the wonderful photograph in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers of a historical moment, the running of a 4 x 1 mile relay race in aid of the great charity, GOAL.  I do not say as much frivolously or simply to bring it up, although Senator Eamonn Coghlan looked well in the picture, but to make the point that the reason the picture is in the newspapers is for a rather sad event, that is, the closure of the running track at Belfield with no immediate plan to replace it other than a vague notion that it might be replaced at some stage in the future by another facility at the part of the Belfield campus designated for sporting activities.  While we might be awash with the sentiment of the nice picture and the great cause, there was something sad about the demise of this historic track, the first of its kind in Ireland when it was built.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was reminded that I had a brave patient &mdash; I can mention her name because we spoke openly about her on many occasions &mdash; who, sadly, is no longer with us, named Ann Burns.  Ms Burns used to run a triathlon to raise funds for our charity every year.  One often hears of extraordinary profiles in courage and, by way of anecdote, the only time I saw Ann Burns cry because of her illness was the time I told her that I was not allowing her to take part in the running component of the triathlon one year because she had secondary cancer in her spine.  That was the only time I saw this brave woman break down and it reminds me of the courage and camaraderie that can come from sport.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This reminds me of something else relevant to what Senator Eamonn Coghlan is attempting to do today as well.  Ann Burns observed my then 125 kg girth and said to me that she was unsure whether I would save her life but that she was going to save mine and she would get me to start exercising.  I did so.  I used to go to that running track and I shed approximately 20 <Col N="711"/>kg as a result.  It is critical to have a culture that prevents people getting to that stage before they must do something about it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is the importance of obesity in this debate?  Others, including the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, have gone through the medical details and I will not reiterate these, other than to say that we are all aware of the dangers of diabetes, blood pressure and heart disease.  However, some people do not appreciate the case outlined by my friend and colleague in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, Dr. Donal O&rsquo;Shea, to the effect that the impact of obesity is approximately the same, as an Irish health burden, as the impact of smoking.  We are all aware of what smoking does but the impact of obesity in terms of the years of premature death and lives lost is now approximately the same.</P>
        <P>It is critical that we take this matter seriously.  Many people are unaware of the evidence in recent years showing that the same risk factors that predispose in the cases of heart disease and diabetes, etc., strongly predispose in the case of breast cancer and that were we to do one thing to reduce the incidence of and death from breast cancer 20 and 30 years from now it would be to prevent obesity.  This would probably have a greater impact than screening mammography, which has a very worthwhile impact.</P>
        <P>How do we go forward?  Previously in the House I brought up the subject of certain core curricular items which, I believe, should be part of everyone&rsquo;s education until they leave school and which they should not be allowed to forego until they reach their 18th birthday.  People will use some of these items to matriculate to college while others are items which, if they show a particular skill, they should have the opportunity to develop it.</P>
        <P>I would regard others as the basic survival skills of life.  Science is one of these.  We live in a universe governed by the rules of science and if we are to survive in it we must know how it works.  We have a rudimentary knowledge of science.  We know that we fall down and not up and we know that fire burns and that water drowns, but it is important to amplify this.  One critical part of science is human physiology and as with any science subject one of the most important aspects is the practical aspect.  This is why we must regard physical education proposals as not merely about exercise or health, but as a critical component of the survival skills that our education system should encourage people to carry through life.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should hold a vote on this matter for the reasons Senator Norris mentioned.  I am unsure exactly what the procedures are but I suspect we will not have a vote.  However, I believe we should do so not because I wish to cause dissent in the House but because of the shenanigans in this House in recent days whereby we have been called for multiple votes.  I heard the cuckoo going so often today that I began to think I was Jack Nicholson and that I was ready for Nurse Ratched to come in at one stage.  This is a critical issue and we should debate it and vote on it because this is not something on which we should give those in Government, God bless them, any wriggle-room.  We should tell them what we expect.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their time and I thank Senator Eamonn Coghlan for another wonderful advertisement for the Seanad in a two day period during which a documentary video could have been put together and used for the &ldquo;Abolish the Seanad campaign&rdquo; &mdash; I might have spoken for it myself.  Nevertheless, it is wonderful to see someone giving us an argument to the effect that the Seanad should perhaps survive and bring an expertise to the House other than that provided by full-time politicians.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch to the House.  Like all other speakers I congratulate our colleague, Senator Eamonn Coghlan, on this motion.  We are examining two issues: physical education and obesity.  I congratulate the Oireachtas Library and Research Service on the excellent document on obesity it put together.  It is disheartening to see that in spite of the fact that this is a problem in the entirety of the <Col N="712"/>developed world, it appears not one country to date has managed to roll back the tide of the widening girth of the human population.</P>
        <P>There is one aspect to this I would like to highlight, namely, the issue of stigma.  A number of studies have highlighted that prejudice against obese people seems to border on the socially acceptable in Ireland.  Moreover, obese children are more likely to suffer bullying, discrimination, low self-esteem and poor body image.  Like all previous speakers I am in favour of a robust PE programme in our schools.</P>
        <P>It is important to deal with the issue of bullying and the perception of obese people generally as being lazy and that, in some way, it is morally reprehensible to be obese.  It is a fact that obese children are far less likely to want to engage in physical activity and it can be deeply traumatic for an overweight child to have to undress in public, put on a swimsuit and get into a swimming pool.  If we are discussing PE in schools we need to be aware of the impact on overweight and obese children if we propose a programme that will involve a level of compulsion.</P>
        <P>A thought occurred to me when I listened to a number of other speakers, in terms of the issues we have around body image.  It is not something that happened yesterday or the day before.  I heard a story about the time &ldquo;Gandhi&rdquo; beat &ldquo;ET&rdquo; for the Oscars.  The reason given for &ldquo;Gandhi&rdquo; having won on that occasion was that he was moralistic, thin and tanned, just like the Academy thought itself to be.  The difficulties obese children have with their self-image and bullying is a caveat we need to consider.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of studies have correlated obesity with poverty.  The fact remains that a trolley can be filled in a supermarket in this country with foods that are high in sugar and fat far more cheaply than fruit and vegetables.  It is an unfortunate, sad fact.  A number of the proposals related to the taxation of foods with a high sugar content.  I note from the report many policy areas that have been examined relating to the treatment of obesity and the OECD findings, in particular, cite the most cost-effective interventions for obesity as being fiscal measures.  They consistently show better health gains for the less well-off, particularly if taxation measures are ring-fenced in terms of cheaper foods.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no one approach which works.  As the Minister of State indicated, we need to examine a number of measures.  I would not underestimate the importance of having an active physical regime at an early point in children&rsquo;s lives.  The statistics also show that people over the age of 35 in our society, namely, those who were allowed out to play as children, had an active playground life and were kicked out the door and told not to come home until lunch time, are now, <i>pro rata</i>, more obese than the rest of society.  There are some significant deeper issues we need to address.  I welcome the proposal but it is part of an overall approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Eamonn Coghlan and the Independent group for tabling this motion.  It is great for the House to have the benefit of his sporting expertise and that he is doing something worthwhile with it.  The report was excellent.  It was not just a stark reminder; it contained a lot of statistics which were quite frightening on the current position and where we are heading in terms of the obesity epidemic, as well as clear recommendations.  It is welcome.</P>
        <P>I largely agree with the motion.  PE should be given as much time and considered to be of equal value as other subjects in schools.  It is worrying to read in the report that does not happen.  In a recent survey of primary school children only 35% were timetabled with the recommended 60 minutes a week.  The problem is that the amount of time is recommended and not mandatory.  It is seen as discretionary or something that schools do after they have done everything else.  It should be mandatory.</P><Col N="713"/>
        <P>I accept what other speakers said about facilities in schools.  With respect, from 1997 to 2008 a massive amount of money was spent on sporting infrastructure all over the country to which schools should have access.  There are crazy situations where schools have no sports halls but are located beside excellent facilities in a GAA or football club which are not being used.  It is criminal and we could solve a lot of the issues we have if we ensured community facilities were properly available and used constantly.  Some sports clubs are great and have good partnerships with schools but it should be required rather than being at the discretion of those who are willing to make an exception and offer facilities to local schools.</P>
        <P>As other speakers have said, schools alone cannot fix the problem.  No matter what great work is done in a school children are only there for one third of their waking hours.  If they are dropped to school early, fed chips and allowed to sit in front of a PlayStation for the evening, whatever happens in school will not educate them about being aware of their nutritional and health needs.</P>
        <P>In fairness to parents, there is a lot of misinformation.  Sometimes understanding the nutritional content of food is confusing.  Some large multiples have introduced good systems such as traffic light labelling where they point out the fat, carbohydrate and salt content.  They also make a distinction between fat and saturated fat and try to help people to understand the difference between good and bad fats.</P>
        <P>A package with a red light on it makes it very easy for a person to identify that the food contains 40% of his or her salt intake for the day.  It is a clear way to help people understand labels compared to the traditional labels which require know-how to understand them and how they fit in with one&rsquo;s daily allowance.  Parents need to be equipped with the information they need.  We should consider introducing traffic light labelling.  In the past the dairy industry expressed concerns about the fact some of its foods can be seen as high-fat.  We can get around that with sophisticated labelling and educating people about good fats.</P>
        <P>As Members will be aware our party tabled legislation requiring large restaurant chains to advertise the calorie content of food.  It would be a positive step forward.  It is important to give people clear, understandable information in order that they can make smart food choices.</P>
        <P>It is also important that teachers in schools have the right training.  Recommendations were made to bring in specialist primary school teachers.  In an ideal world I would love that to happen but I do not see it as something that will be possible over the next few years.  I hope that, given the cross-sectoral brief of the Minister of State, she will talk to the Minister for Education and Skills about reviewing primary school teacher training.  Teachers have identified repeatedly in reports it is an area where they feel weak and are not confident in delivering the PE programme.</P>
        <P>It is something that should be examined in the review.  At second level, some qualified PE teachers are unemployed yet there are worrying incidents in terms of timetabling.  Perhaps some schools do not take PE seriously and see it as an add-on for a maths, geography or history teacher who teaches ten hours in a main subject and is asked to take a PE class.  It is a psyche we need to change.  Properly trained PE teachers should teach the subject.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am concerned about one element of the report referred to by Senator Eamonn Coghlan.  The data show that parents of children who are overweight, and the children themselves, do not have the awareness to realise their BMI is too high.  There is work to be done in raising awareness, but I am somewhat concerned by the notion of health checks in schools.  Consultations with Bodywhys and other organisations dealing with eating disorders may be necessary before embarking on any such strategy.  I agree that children need to be made aware if there is a problem with their weight, as do their parents, but we must be sensitive in how we address it in order to avoid creating other problems.</P><Col N="714"/>
        <P>I welcome this excellent report and the helpful debate we have had today.  I thank the Minister for taking Senators&rsquo; views on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Independent Senators for putting forward this motion.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan is to be commended for his exceptionally well presented report.  It is particularly welcome that a person such as he, an iconic sporting figure, should take the initiative in this regard.  We all enjoy watching the television footage of his sporting prowess.  People of a certain age like to recall where they were when a particular event occurred.  The memory of Ronnie Delaney winning gold at the Olympic Games more than 50 years ago has passed down from generation to generation.  There is something in our psyche which embraces the inspiration that arises from observing people being physically challenged in a competitive context.  All of that is important in its own right.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan is a role model in this regard and it is a pity we do not see him on television more often.  There are others who seem to be waiting at the door to have their say on various subjects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Eamonn Coghlan has gone to the trouble of researching and producing this important report.  It often seems that we spend every morning in this House wondering how we can circumvent the Cathaoirleach on the Order of Business and get the opportunity to make a topical point.  With this motion, the Independent Senators have chosen one of the most important subjects we could be discussing.  I entirely agree with Senator John Crown in this regard.  Unfortunately, because of the time of the evening, I would wager, if I were a betting man, that the debate will not feature on tonight&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  That is a great pity given the work that went into the report and the exceptional comments and contributions we have heard today, many of them based on experience.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the motion is directed at schools, the reality is that society itself has changed, as a result of which many of the things we took for granted no longer apply.  When I was a child one finished one&rsquo;s school day and immediately went across to the Christian Brothers&rsquo; playing field.  We were automatically involved in sport almost every day after school.  That is no longer the case, which is regrettable.  We must consider the purpose of this debate.  What do we expect to come out of it?  Is it a matter of expressing our views on something about which we feel strongly, letting them off into the ether and bringing them to the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention?  The Minister, Deputy James Reilly, spoke about the crowded school curriculum.  That is not sufficient justification for a lack of action on the issue.  The graph in the document in front of me clearly shows that obesity ranks among the greatest risks to health.  If it is a matter of life or death, we should revisit the curriculum in order to ascertain whether there has been an incorrect emphasis.</P>
        <P>In regard to societal norms and advertising, some Members will recall the various debates in this House on smoking, in which we all accepted that it is harmful to health.  In that case, there was also the question of secondary harm.  In recent years there have been significant restrictions on the advertising of tobacco products at point of sale.  We discussed the issue of alcohol misuse some weeks ago in this House, in the course of which advertising was again raised.  There is certainly an argument for a restriction on the advertisement of fast foods.  Whenever I am driving during a school break, I see young people standing about with bags of chips.  I am not criticising anybody&rsquo;s taste; that is not the issue.  The concern is that young people see those types of foods as part of a normal diet.  Some part of that message is coming from television advertising and so on.  If the statistics are as serious as they seem &mdash; they are jumping out at us from this report &mdash; we must get back to fundamentals.</P>
        
      
	<Col N="715"/><P Just="Left">Although I am aware that the Seanad is working against the clock, it would be very interesting to schedule a further debate in the near future in order to consider where we go from here.  We must reassess the information provided for us.  There is no doubt that it is not sufficient merely to talk about obesity, lack of exercise and so on.  This issue impacts on every Department.  We cannot blame the Government because it is a problem going back over the decades.  However, the matter has been brought forward for discussion by way of Private Members&rsquo; time.  We must avail of the opportunity in the near future, whether through Private Members&rsquo; business, statements or otherwise, to show respect for the work done in producing this report, express our appreciation of that and, above all, treat this matter with the seriousness it deserves.  If we do not approach the problem with sufficient conviction we will bediscussing it in years to time, the numbers dying prematurely will increase and we willhave lost an opportunity to take action in line with our responsibility as Members of thisHouse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonnCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Eamonn Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to know how to begin in responding to colleagues&rsquo; contributions.  I wonder whether it is the first time that everybody in the House is in agreement.  I particularly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement:</P>
        <P LI="1">We must take a more holistic approach to promoting, maintaining and improving rates of active living.  By encouraging physical activity and active living from an early age, the population can reap the benefits into old age.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">That is exactly what I am talking about.  The health budget forecast in countries throughout the world in the next 30 years is going in only one direction while the physical education budget may well go in the other direction.  The consequences are a cause for grave concern not only in Ireland, but internationally.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We face many hurdles in tackling this issue but, like the athlete who manages all the hurdles on the track, we will overcome them.  This is not about obesity, which was mentioned by almost every speaker.  Obesity is far too complex an issue, whereas what I am proposing here is simple.  Tackling obesity encompasses a range of issues, including diet, advertising campaigns, taxes on sugar and salt and so on.  Promoting physical exercise can make only a small contribution to reducing the obesity level; it cannot by itself eradicate the problem.  Nor is it just about physical activity.  People say to me that playing golf involves plenty of exercise.  They are kidding themselves.  One does not get any exercise walking 18 holes and most of those who play golf are overweight.  I am talking about physical fitness.  The young children who train in my club develop motor skills and cardiovascular conditioning.  After only three or four weeks they begin growing in confidence.  They turn into fine adults who are doctors, nurses, lawyers and professional people, both men and women.  I have seen how their confidence grows.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is about a cultural change, the change we have since the time I used to run one mile to and from school four times a day, accumulating X number of miles per week, and play Gaelic football and soccer.  That degree of physical activity among children has diminished in societies throughout the world.  It is about developing physical fitness in school.  We talk about children spending 25% of their time in school, time which is particularly important for those who are not driven to sports activities after school and are not properly fed by their parents.</P>
        <P>They will have to get this on the front line, where they will be taught how to be physically fit, where they will be lectured in nutrition and diet and all the various aspects which we have discussed in this debate.  These children will eventually become secondary school students, <Col N="716"/>college students and parents.  If we can catch them in infancy and they learn the importance of physical fitness and a healthy diet and nutrition, just as they learn to brush their teeth every morning and evening, we will see the results in the next ten, 15 and 20 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister alluded to the opt-out clause for those who, unfortunately, do not wish to engage in physical exercise because of their size.  A teacher in a Dublin secondary school said the children whose parents send in excuse notes are the same children who have no problem showing up at a discotheque wearing very short mini-skirts.  There is no such thing as opting out.</P>
        <P>Ladies and gentlemen of the Seanad, it is a case of changing a culture in order to change and save a generation.  I am prepared to take action and I will seek support from the Members of this House.  I will keep knocking on the door for as long as I am here.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 4</P>
        <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 4, to delete lines 28 and 29, and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;legislation made by the Oireachtas under section 70B;&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment relates to the advisory notice.  We propose a change in the Act by a regulation.  This notice will be a notification to water services authorities that a treatment system is causing or is likely to cause a risk to human health or to the environment.  The authority must issue an advisory notice within 21 days.  I assume the inspector would make a visit prior to the notice being issued.  The advisory notice would set out in detail the considerations for the particular treatment system and whether it posed a threat to human health or to the environment.  The notice will direct the owner to take the necessary remedial actions and will specify a timeframe for completion of those measures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill does not outline the timeframe.  For example, in France in 2007 a similar system was introduced to register septic tanks but the timeframe permitted for owners was four or five years during which they were to bring their septic tanks up to standard.  It may be unfair to make this comparison given that France is a more urbanised country and there are thousands of hectares of unoccupied land while our countryside is well populated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have an issue with the advisory notice and the timeframe.  These should be discussed by the Oireachtas prior to the enactment of the Bill.  It is wrong to criminalise people or to make non-compliance with the advisory notice an offence.  There are many reasons for non-compliance.  People will be unable to comply with the advisory notice if substantial works are required to upgrade septic tanks to the necessary standard.  According to the Department&rsquo;s own financial breakdown accompanying the Bill, a septic tank would cost approximately &euro;4,000 and more advanced work could increase the cost up to &euro;17,000 when installation of the system is taken into consideration.  How is it reasonable to expect someone to carry out such work without the assistance of a retrofitting grants scheme?</P>
        <P>The advisory notice and the work agenda is set out along with a timeframe for the work to be completed and it is to be compulsory for local authorities to issue the notice within 21 days <Col N="717"/>of a notification from the agency.  This needs to be discussed further.  Instead of signing the timeframe under regulation, the Minister should allow for a discussion in this House and more specific details about the advisory notice should be provided.  We will press a further amendment to provide that non-compliance with an advisory notice should not constitute an offence under the Bill, given that many people are struggling financially and they will not be able to meet the rigid specifications under this legislation.</P>

        <P>Amendment No. 4 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, line 37, after &ldquo;systems&rsquo;)&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;apart from county Cavan&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am suggesting an amendment to the proposed new section 70B(1), which provides that &ldquo;each water services authority shall establish and maintain a register of domestic waste water treatment systems situated within its functional area&rdquo;.  In general, we have no problem with that.  If the register system is to operate effectively, a system of registration will be needed at local level.  I will not go into the technical detail of the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the case of Commission of the European Communities <i>v.</i> Ireland, other than to say the court found that Ireland, with the exception of County Cavan, was not in compliance with the 1975 directive, as amended in 1991.  The judgment set out the various sections with which Ireland was failing to comply, namely, sections 4 and 8.</P>
        <P>The point we are trying to make is that the European Commission has recognised that Cavan County Council is complying with the directive as a result of a by-law it adopted in 2004.  The by-law was based on the 1996 guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Can the Minister clarify if the same guidelines will be adopted for this legislation?  As a result of the action taken by Cavan County Council in 2004, some 25% of septic tanks in the county were found not to meet the standard.  The average cost of upgrading the one in four tanks that did not meet the Cavan standards, which were based on the 1996 Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, was approximately &euro;2,500.  I guarantee the House that if we adopt the 2009-10 Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, significantly more than 25% of septic tanks will not meet the standard.  My learned colleague from County Cavan, Senator Wilson, will be able to speak in much more detail about the approach that was adopted in his county and was later found to meet the standards used by the European Court of Justice in its judgment.  Why should a county that meets the requirements of the judgment of the European Court of Justice, <Col N="719"/>and faces no fines as a result, be covered under this legislation?  Why should further financial burdens be placed on people who have upgraded their septic tanks since 2004?</P>
        <P>It is relevant to mention that when the European Court of Justice ruled on the case that was taken by the European Commission against Ireland, it pointed out that the introduction of a registration system is required.  That is what the Minister is trying to achieve in this section.  It also pointed out that a desludging programme would be relevant under Article 12 of the European directive.  Therefore, we are proposing that each septic tank should be eligible for free desludging each year, in line with Article 12 of the 1975 directive.  Such a programme should be put in place before we proceed further, even if it would have cost implications.  Some of our amendments were ruled out of order because of the cost implications associated with them.  It would be better to try to correct deficiencies in septic tanks by putting in place a desludging programme.  The Environmental Protection Agency recognises that septic tanks that are desludged on a periodic basis work more effectively.  They operate more effectively if the sludge is taken from the top of the tank.  Would that not be considered before legislation is passed to force people to bring tanks up to standard?</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister can advise the House whether he is willing to accept this amendment.  Can he clarify whether Cavan County Council is meeting the current standards as we speak?  Will the standards the Minister is proposing to introduce by regulation under this legislation be the same as those being applied by Cavan County Council?  Does the Minister intend to adopt the only other guidelines he can adopt, which are the 2009-10 Environmental Protection Agency guidelines?  Will every one of the 475,000 septic tanks in this country be dealt with retrospectively under those guidelines?  I am a little confused about whether this will be implemented retrospectively.  This Bill suggests that it will.  If that is the case, the implication is that every septic tank in the country will have to meet today&rsquo;s standards.  If I am correct, the ruling of the European Court of Justice means that water courses from all septic tanks should be kept clean from today onwards.  If that objective is to be achieved, then it would&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am referring to the services authority, the register of domestic wastewater treatment systems and whether Cavan met the directive&rsquo;s standards.  The 1996 guidelines set by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, would satisfy the European Court of Justice.  It actually referred to this arrangement in its ruling.  It would also be less of a financial burden on the taxpayer if a grants scheme were introduced to meet upgrade costs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Landy for that but he should reserve his judgment until after my contribution.</P>
        <P>As Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill stated, Cavan was exempted from the European Court of Justice ruling.  The court cited the example of Cavan County Council which introduced by-laws in 2004 on water pollution to implement a complete system of management of septic tanks and individual wastewater treatment systems, both old and new.  The by-laws include a requirement that every wastewater treatment system comply with the EPA manual on treatment systems for single houses and that inspections be carried out at least every seven years.  The Commission, in taking the case against Ireland, had conceded that these by-laws in Cavan had constituted <Col N="720"/>an adequate legal mechanism for complying with the directive and, therefore, excluded Cavan as part of the subject matter of the legal action.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be aware of these by-laws.  I will not go through them in detail, line by line, unless he wishes me to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Please do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cavan County Council by-laws state that it is prohibited to discharge any wastewater or effluent from any on-site wastewater treatment or disposal system to any ditch, stream, pond, lake, watercourse, drain, surface water or, where discharge exceeds five cu. m in any 24-hour period, into groundwater, other than in accordance with a valid discharge licence.  County Cavan has plenty of lakes and rivers and these by-laws have been very effective in protecting them.  As Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill outlined, initially 25% of septic tanks inspected failed.  The by-laws stated, &ldquo;A person who contravenes a provision of these by-laws shall be guilty of an offence pursuant to section 40 of the Local Government Act 1994&rdquo;, making them liable on summary conviction of a fine of up to &euro;1,270.  Under the 2010 Fines Act, this fine will become a class C fine.  Once that Act commences, the fine on summary conviction will be &euro;2,500.  That is half the maximum fine proposed by the Minister in this Bill.</P>
        <P>Why does the Minister not compel each local authority to introduce similar by-laws instead of introducing this legislation?  It would be a more sensible approach and achieve what is required under the ruling without the heavy-handed approach this Bill will visit on the 475,000 septic tank owners and 1.2 million people covered by it.</P>
        <P>While Cavan is unique in many respects and is one of the finest counties of the 32 and certainly of the 26 over which the Minister has jurisdiction, it is only fair the other 25 counties have the opportunity to introduce their own by-laws.  County Cavan has already proved this can be successfully done.  I respectfully request the Minister takes this amendment into consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know as much about County Cavan and its by-laws as Senator Wilson does, but it does sound peculiar that in this relatively recent decision of the European Court of Justice, Cavan was found not to be in breach of the directive.  Europe has given a gold star to Cavan for implementing its by-laws in 1994.  I envy the council and its public representatives for going down that road then.  Obviously, other councils should have done so.</P>
        <P>The kernel of this issue is which particular guidelines will be followed in the legislation.  Three sets of criteria can be applied to this Bill, the EPA guidelines from 2009 and 2004 and the Cavan County Council by-laws.  If the latter is a good benchmark for implementing the directive, why then in these difficult times should the Department go the extra mile to be best boys in the class rather than comply with the Cavan guidelines from 15 years ago?</P>
        <P>My main concern is we are somewhat in the dark as to which criteria will apply with this legislation.  The information I received from the EPA is that it will insist on the most modern, technical and up-to-date criteria available to it.  These will be far more stringent than the ones used successfully in Cavan.  They will also mean costly upgrades of septic tanks and wastewater systems for property owners.</P>
        <P>The criteria to be used must be declared now.  The criteria successfully used in Cavan, which comply with the EU directive, are a good benchmark and should be adopted by other local authorities.  Under the Minister&rsquo;s proposals, maximum fines stand at &euro;5,000 whereas under the Cavan by-laws, the maximum fine is &euro;2,500.  If the EPA criteria are used &mdash; I fear they will be <Col N="721"/>&mdash; then the bar will have been raised for over 400,000 septic tank owners and will be much higher than the one contained in the Cavan County Council by-laws.  It would be refreshing if the Minister declared his hand now and confirmed the 2009 EPA guidelines will be the template for this legislation.  The most recent EPA guidelines will be the template for the new proposals.  If that is the case, the bar will be considerably higher.  People are worried about how much this will cost and where the tanks will go, etc.  It is a valid argument.  Perhaps it is correct to go down that road and use the most efficient and up to date guidelines.</P>
        <P>Cavan County Council was given a clean bill of health under the EU directive.  Where do the remaining 25 counties stand?  Have their local authorities been neglectful in not going down the same road as Cavan County Council?  If so, why did they not do so?  I recall attending a meeting of county managers where progress was discussed.  Why did the other local authorities not follow what was done in County Cavan?  At the time, it was a brave move.  Several hundred beautiful lakes in Cavan were polluted and there was deep concern about damage to fish stocks and so on.  The local authority was steered to take action to protect the environment, which it did successfully.  Perhaps it is not appropriate to the amendment but why did the other local authorities not follow the lead of Cavan County Council?  It is not fair to say successive Governments neglected to force them to do so.  Councils can be proactive sometimes.</P>
        <P>Putting on my legal hat, local authorities will not be exempt from blame when the mud hits the fan down the road.  When reality has to be faced, some local authorities will have questions to answer because if they granted planning permission ten, 15 or 20 years ago and said the septic tank and the percolation system on the site were appropriate and met proper standards, they cannot come along and say the legislation has changed and the system has to be upgraded.  Local authorities are not exempt and if they are in difficulty, that will rebound on the Department.  That is why the Minister should reflect on where this will lead down the road because each householder has constitutional rights.  This is another diminution of rights.  Under the Constitution, landowners have immense powers to protect their property.  This rolls further in more ways than one and I will revisit this later.</P>
        <P>I have raised a number of issues.  Senators Wilson and &Oacute; Domhnaill have put their case on the amendment better than I have but there are questions about where we go and what guidelines should be followed in future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have now discovered a total lack of sincerity on their part about doing anything on this legislation.  They started out totally opposed to the Bill, inspections, charges and compliance with the European Court of Justice judgment and in favour of desludging as long as somebody else paid for it.  Senator Wilson did not outline what people are paying in Cavan for an inspection.  They pay &euro;200 every seven years to have inspections carried out to comply with the European Court of Justice judgment.  Why did he not tell us that?</P>

	<P>Under the by-laws in Cavan, it costs &euro;200 per household for every septic tank to be inspected every seven years and desludging is paid for by the homeowner.  Am I right or wrong?</P>

	<P>I am including County Cavan in the legislation because we need to know the location of the septic tanks and the Bill provides for a register of them.  According to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s amendment, it will cost householders &euro;4,000 on average to improve their septic tanks if they have a problem under the 1996 guidelines and there will be a &euro;200 inspection charge every seven years.</P>

Despite the bully boy tactics from the Minister and his officials on this Bill, we will continue to outline where it is flawed.  The legislation is draconian and there is no need for it.

It is obvious that the Cavan model should be consigned to one of the lakes in that county because it is absolutely disastrous for the people who live there.  In his expert description and analysis of the scheme, Senator Wilson neglected to mention the most important element, namely, the charge imposed on the people of Cavan.  Earlier, I described the Senator as an eminent expert.  When he spoke, we expected that he would provide us with full details of the scheme.  However, he did not do so.  As a result, his entire argument is flawed and it will be extremely difficult to sit here for another three or four hours and listen to the debate on later amendments.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Cavan model, the Senator referred to desludging being paid for by residents or those who own houses.  His colleague urged the Minister to introduce free desludging.  The Cavan model has been put forward as the greatest thing since sliced bread but the residents of that county have been asked to pay for their homes to be desludged.

        <P>The point I am trying to make is central to the Bill, which relates to the monitoring of domestic wastewater treatment systems.  Cavan has had a system in place in this regard since 2004 and the Commission&rsquo;s judgment recognises that fact.  Why, then, would Cavan be requested to re-register?  The fact that the Minister is including County Cavan would have one believe that this matter does not really relate to wastewater treatment and is more about collecting revenue for the State.  That is the point we are trying to make with the amendment.  What happens in Cavan is a matter for the county councillors there.</P>
        <P>Those who invested money in Cavan County Council to bring septic tanks up to the 1996 criteria will now be asked to start all that work again, possibly to meet higher standardsaccording to the RIAI, as attached with the legislation published by the Minister&rsquo;sDepartment.</P>
        <P>That is the point we are trying to make.  We are not being disingenuous.  We take exception to that because we are trying to be constructive on behalf of the 475,000 householders throughout the country who will be penalised as a result of this flawed and discriminatory legislation.  That is why we raise these issues.</P>

Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s amendment goes against that.  In case he has forgotten, it states &ldquo;apart from County Cavan&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>

        <P Just="Left">On the previous amendment, Fianna F&aacute;il Members spoke of the competency of persons engaged in inspections.  County Cavan is very weak in that regard.  Subsection (2) states:&rdquo;shall submit an assessment by a competent person [the text does not define competent person] <Col N="728"/>which assessment shall include capacity, water-tightness, construction soundness and general workings&rdquo;.

If they are under that illusion or persist so, the Senator will get a rude awakening in the coming years.  I refer to Cavan although I have no experience of it in regard to this area other than the judgment of Europe.

	<P Just="Left">The Minister, Deputy Hogan, is now the one caught because in that amendment we are proposing the de-sludging plan and the grants, which would resolve <Col N="731"/>all the issues throughout the country, including in County Cavan, but it has been ruled out of order.</P>

	<P>The Senator must speak to amendment No. 7.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 7 relates to most of 70B(3) in section 4.  Under the legislation as it is currently construed costs will be imposed on septic tank owners.  When they get the provisional notice from the local authority they will be forced to apply to the water services authority in whose function area the treatment system is situated to have the treatment system, which includes a septic tank, entered onto the register of domestic wastewater treatment systems which will be maintained by the local authority.  </P>
        <P>I refer to section 4(3)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>).  We are proposing that any information the local authority will provide will be at no cost to the septic tank owner or the householder because there is an array of hidden charges built in to this legislation that could result in substantial costs to the individuals who may need to seek information.  The Minister has acknowledged that he will make planning an exemption for the septic tank charges and he has not ruled out the possibility of ecological costs for persons who have a septic tank in a natural heritage area, NHA, a special protection area, or a special area of conservation, SAC.  I checked the costs with an ecologist in Donegal and they generally start at approximately &euro;750 for an ecological report.  If one is located in a wetlands area &mdash; under the Minister&rsquo;s directive signed on 8 September most of the west is now a wetland area &mdash; the cost could include an environmental impact assessment if the land is within certain a certain zone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is planning exempt.  It does not come into it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>It overrides SPAs and everything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>In case the Senator does not know, it is part of a planning application.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>We will want to see that written into the legislation.  We will want to make sure, line by line, that environmental impact assessments and any environmental assessments or ecological reports are exempt for any works that have to be carried out.  If that is the case I am sure the Minister will have no difficulty in accepting this amendment to the effect that the householder will not be expected to bear any further costs apart from making the application, for which we propose there will be no registration fee, and that there will be no other additional costs hidden in this section.</P>
        <P>Section 4(3) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">An application under this section shall&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) be made in writing or by electronic means, [we have no difficulty with that because if it was only by electronic means it would make it very difficult for people who may not have access to a computer]</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) specify the name of the applicant and the address at which he or she normally resides, [we have no difficulty with that]</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) specify the address at which the domestic waste water treatment system is situated, [we have no difficulty with that]</P><Col N="732"/>
        <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) contain such other information as may be prescribed, [we have major difficulty with that because that is as long as it is wide] and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>e</i>) in the case of the application under subsection (2), be accompanied by the prescribed fee.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We have tabled another amendment on that because we are not in agreement with it.  The information must be specified before this Bill can be passed, regardless of any other relevant information the householder would be required to send to the local authority.</P>
        <P>The Minister might clarify when he intends to introduce a Government amendment to the effect that there will be no planning charges, no environmental impact assessment charges and no SPA, NHA or SAC implications in terms of any septic tank located in or near an SPA or a wetlands area.  If that is the case questions may arise in terms of the classification of those areas, and I am sure we will have people such as those in An Taisce jumping up and down.  The alternative that we would accept is that if there is a requirement to have those reports the Department would pay for them.  However, we favour no charges or cost in this area to the householder or the consumer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is tinkering around the edges if he is talking about &euro;50 or &euro;200.  We are proposing the amendment because we believe there should be no charges.  There is a way of doing it.  There is &euro;431 million in the Minister&rsquo;s budget this year for the maintenance and servicing of urban wastewater treatment systems.  Some of that money should be diverted to rural Ireland.  Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to put forward <Col N="733"/>our de-sludging plan for every house in the country that would come out of that fund.  We are asking the Minister, in terms of the retrofit scheme, to scrap the &euro;2.7 billion project in north County Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and put that money into the upgrading of septic tanks in rural Ireland to make sure that the ordinary people of this country who work hard in rural Ireland will not have to pay the costs of this draconian legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister will reassure the House that the form of registration, when it eventually sees the light of day, will not win the prize for difficult English.  Whenever most Departments get their hands on forms, irrespective of whichever party is running the Administration, I always have the impression that there is a group of people who gleefully look on form creation a little like getting sweets for Christmas, in other words, they try to make it as difficult and complicated as possible for the ordinary citizen.  The Minister has spelled out in good detail exactly what will be required under the registration but I would like an assurance that the form of registration will, in the interests of clarity, be simple, straightforward and will not have any addendums, appendices or references to subsections.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am concerned about that because there is a reference in the Bill to the phrase &ldquo;contains such information as may be prescribed&rdquo;.  The Minister might enlighten us as to his thinking on what other information might be involved.  I can think of one item of information in the context of this debate on the amendment.  I am not an expert on septic tanks but we have had septic tanks since the early 1960s and treatment plants have changed considerably in that time.  The more modern septic tank is a much more efficient machine than those of a few decades ago.  Does the Minister believe it will be of benefit to the various water authorities, which are the local authorities in this case, to have information on the type of septic tank or is that something that will follow later in terms of the inspection?</P>
        <P>I am not sure how the inspection will identify the type of septic tank, and whether the Minister believes that will be relevant.  If technology has moved on to the point where there is now little or no pollution from the more modern septic tanks, the inference is that there are older septic tanks that are leaking and causing pollution.  Is that the type of information about which the Minister is concerned?</P>
        <P>I am concerned &mdash; I suppose this is inevitable as it happens in almost every Bill of this type &mdash; with the phrase &ldquo;prescribed fee&rdquo; in respect of an application under subsection (2).  That is a great get-out clause for Ministers.  I appreciate the registration fee will be made clear but why did the Minister not prescribe it in this legislation and state what he has been outlining?  It raises the issue of whether successive Ministers for the environment will use this as another tax raising method or another form of revenue for the Department.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I welcome the robust debate that is taking place and the clarification and bona fides of the Minister.  I believe he is telling us how he sees it and how it will play out.  In recent years we have had different Ministers for the environment with different opinions.  What is written in the legislation is how it will be interpreted and it can be interpreted in two ways.  How the Minister intends to interpret may be one way.  We need to future proof the legislation in order that people cannot be caught out and that Ministers with a different agenda might take a different meaning.  Although the Minister has clarified a certain number of points in the legislation,  what we hear when discussing this issue with people at all the public meetings across the country is that this is a very complicated Bill.  When one tries to read through the EU directives on which it is based, they are complicated and point one from one directive to another.  It is a complicated process to go through.</P>
        <P>Our job as legislators is to make the Bill as simple as possible for the people whom it will affect.  The system to be put in place must be clear.  Therefore, the information that has been alluded to, specifically around the specification that will be expected of the ground water in the vicinity of the domestic water treatment system that is in place, should be made clear before the Bill is enacted.  The Minister should tell the House his intentions for those specifications so that if people want to conduct their own test tomorrow morning they can get somebody to come out and check the water to ascertain whether it is up to standard.  We need to remove any vagueness around this issue so that people are clear where they stand on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I suppose we have a good deal of misinformation about this legislation, starting with a &euro;300 annual inspection charge.  It is a while ago since we heard that but it was dropped.  Now we have the Cavan Fianna F&aacute;il &euro;200 inspection charge, arising from an amendment tabled by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, whereas I am seeking no more than &euro;50 for a registration charge.  At least we have clarity on that issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of the guidelines to be drawn up is to ensure the septic tank is working, minimum standards apply, and there is no danger to public health, the environment or groundwater quality.  There are no guidelines in place that meet those requirements.  If I were to adhere to existing guidelines I would make the requirements too onerous, unlike Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill who wants to make the requirements more onerous.  The 1996 EPA guidelines provided for a &euro;200 inspection charge but I do not want to do that, hence I opposed that amendment.  We are interested only in meeting the basic requirements of the ECJ judgment in having an inspection and monitoring system in place that meets that judgment of good practice in regard to public health and the environment.  That argument will not suit everybody especially those who go around in the Senator&rsquo;s constitutency and others talking about regulations that do not exist.  They speak about introducing measures that I have no intention of introducing but I cannot stop those people.  If people want to perpetuate this type of nonsense I cannot stop them.</P><Col N="735"/>
        <P Just="Left">I cannot stipulate a fee in the Bill &mdash; no Government does that.  The fee will be no more than &euro;50 for registration purposes.  There is a standard catch-all phase included in legislation for the same purpose.  I am doing no more or no less than what is standard practice in law.  I have no other particular proposal in mind.  The planning regulations to implement that will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and one has 21 days, as part of a statutory instrument, in which to deal with them.  The planning regulations, about which Senator Mooney is concerned, will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I do not consider the amendment before the House to be appropriate.  The details to be requested, when registering, are under consideration by the Department and the EPA.  The registration will be kept as simple and as straightforward as possible.  I agree with Senator Mooney that there is a temptation to seek more information than that relating to septic tanks or households when sending notices to the door or filling in a form.  I will look at that form before it is disseminated to households.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  It strikes me as strange that if we have been found to be in contravention of an ECJ ruling, which obviously lays down a certain standard for water quality, that the ruling did not indicate a proper water quality standard to be adhered to.  Therefore, it is strange that officials in his Department would not have said that when  the water quality is checked, this is the standard we should be looking at.  It is not unreasonable to ask that be made available to people in advance, as part of the discussion around this Bill &mdash; it is quite fair.  Some 36 years have elapsed since this directive was introduced in 1965 and successive Governments failed to implement it.  Cavan has introduced some regulation which states that water quality is at a standard that would not contravene the ECJ ruling.  It must be clear from that what the water quality level should be and that should be made available as part of the discussion on the Bill.</P>

For anybody who did not read that section and our amendment fully, part of the section reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">Each water services authority shall establish and maintain a register of domestic waste water treatment systems situated within its functional area (in this Part referred to as a &lsquo;register of domestic waste water treatment systems&rsquo;).</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">That should apply except for County Cavan which has that system in place.  It is a matter then for Cavan County Council to reduce the &euro;50 registration fee which the Government wants to introduce.

	<P>They may not have.  The point I are trying to make is a genuine one. I am not trying to be argumentative but I am trying to establish what maintenance standards will be established for septic tanks.  Can I take it the Minister is scrapping the most recent 1999-2000 EPA maintenance standards and that he will look at something else that has not yet been drawn up?  What are the maintenance standards?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, for the purpose of complying with the judgment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>How are we expected to vote on something if we do not know what the criteria will be?  The Bill provides that the Minister will take it in by regulation which would mean that after the Bill is passed the Minister will sign in by regulation, maintenance servicing and operating guidelines to be agreed, I assume, between the EPA and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  How can we go forward on the basis that some time in the future, a Minister will sign a regulation that will take in the standards with which 475,000 septic tank owners will have to comply?  If the bar is set too high, we are in trouble.  If the bar is set too low, Europe will come after us again in the courts, but there is no grant aid available to meet any update costs.  That is where the problem lies with the Bill.</P>
        <P>We agree with a registration system because it is needed.  We do not agree with the fee attached to it, and this can be seen from our amendments.  Before a registration system in the Bill is brought in, we want to bring in a de-sludging system, which is referred to in article 12 of the European directive.  Any costs should be borne by the Department under the retrofit grants scheme up to a  maximum of 85%.  There is nothing in the Bill on that.  Our amendments were ruled out of order.</P>
        <P>This amendment relates to costs that can be passed on to individuals.  For example, the ordnance survey maps or others may be required.   As Senator Mooney has outlined, we do not know what will be on the application form.  Will the individuals living alone be able to fill in the application form?  Even though they do not need planning permission, will they need to go to a solicitor or a REPS planner to fill in the form?  If that is the case, they could be charged at least a couple of hundred euro to get a form filled in, maps attached and sent to the local authority.  There are hidden charges built into this that are not clarified.</P>

	<P>I will look after them as well, as I always do.  There are 475,000 people with these systems and they will not all come to me, Senator Harte or other Members of the House.  If they did, we would not be in here.  The Irish Rural Dwellers Association has raised this as major fear.  The IFA has also raised this as a fear and I had a long discussion with its environment committee chairman on this issue today.  These hidden costs could accumulate over years and the prescribed fee, referred to under the regulation, can be increased at any given time by the Minister by signing a regulation to increase it.  The &euro;50 registration can be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer that in a minute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps he might clarify that.  There is still an issue with hidden costs associated with making an application when we do not know what the application form is yet.  We have the application available in the North of Ireland that must be filled in and sent to Northern Ireland Water.  There is much to be filled in on that form, but the form we expect people to fill, if this Bill is passed, would be much more onerous because it is a registration <Col N="737"/>system.  There is no registration system in place yet in the North of Ireland, although I understand they are looking at bringing in such a system, but the form is still quite onerous.  We are expecting many elderly people in rural Ireland to fill in an application form that could be onerous, but we do not know what standards they are expected to meet thereafter.  We are proposing this amendment to the Bill to defray additional costs for people when those costs could accumulate through information they may need to provide and which may not be readily available to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>If I am making a matter like this exempt from planning, then there are no fees.  I must apologise to Senator Mooney for doing a very unusual thing.  I have ensured in the primary legislation that the registration fee will be no more than &euro;50, so that will reassure Senator Mooney, whatever about Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill.</P>

	<P>I might not be around to reduce it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh asked about guidelines.  These are listed in section 70C of Part 4A of the Bill, which states the following.</P>
        <P LI="1">The owner of a premises connected to a domestic waste water treatment system shall&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) comply with regulations made under section 70L,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) ensure that the system does not constitute, and is not likely to constitute, a risk to human health or the environment,</P>
        <P LI="2">and, in particular does not&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) create a risk to water, air or soil, or to plants and animals,</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) create a nuisance through noise or odours, or</P>
        <P LI="3">(iii) adversely affect the countryside or places of special interest,</P>
        <P LI="3">and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) ensure that the system is entered on a register of domestic waste water treatment systems in accordance with section 70B.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This amends the principal Act to set out the principles with which we will comply.  As I have said several times, these are new regulations, in conjunction with the EPA and the local authorities, which ensure that we have good quality ground water, that we are not contaminating groundwater sources, that we are not contaminating water to an extent of risking public health, and that we are protecting the environment.  These are set out quite explicitly.  The Senator will have to accept that the prescriptive nature of including what he is asking cannot be put in the legislation, but will have to be put in the regulations that subsequently follow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The regulations will subsequently be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Senator will then have an opportunity to debate them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="738"/>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Will that happen before or after the Bill is enacted?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill comes first, then the regulations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister.  That is common sense.  As he outlined, specific fees are not always included in legislation, so this will go some way to allaying fears out there that there is some hidden charge on the registration fee as currently prescribed.</P>
        <P>The date by which the treatment system must be registered will be specified in regulations to be made by the Minister.  In light of the previous debate and in order to reassure those who may have difficulty in filling out the form, will the Minister request any response from the local authorities to assist people in filling in the forms?  He has yet to specify the date.  It could be two or three weeks from the time the notice is sent out.  How does that system work?  Is it about self-compliance?  Do people have to contact the local authority?  At the moment, there is no register.  I am not too clear on this.  It is a little bit vague on the information that is already with the local authorities.  Perhaps there might be some obligation on the local authorities to provide assistance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Harte has spoken about a certain of category of people.  In the past 20 years since European money started coming in, bypassing elected politicians in many cases, an industry of consultants sprang up.  They went around charging community groups and others for filling in forms in order to access funds.  I am sure the last thing the Minister would want is to create another cottage industry that will levy an extra charge on people.</P>
        <P>Will there be a registration period?  Will it be obligatory on local authorities to provide the service, rather than discretionary?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  I still feel it would be great to make it clear to people what the regulation and the inspection should be in advance, but I appreciate his answer.  However, it raises another question.  If a person built a house 20 years ago and since then the area has been designated an SPA, an SAC, an NHA or whatever, the Minister states that there will be a planning exemption in place for such a house.  Will this also cover the exemptions that would relate to an NHA, SAC and an SPA?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
        <P>In answer to Senator Mooney&rsquo;s question, people will have 12 months to register.  They have the entire year in 2012 to register.  I am sure that when public representatives, community groups and neighbours get notification of this particular matter, they will be able to assist the people next door.  Some 475,000 people seem a lot but they are scattered around the country.  For example, there are about 11,000 in Kilkenny.  I am sure I will be able to notify them properly about what the requirements are and help them in any way I can.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>

	<P>It will be easy for them to find help online.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the question of assistance with form-filling, many people are quite capable of filling in forms, as we know from our own clinics.  Sometimes people are much sharper than the local politicians.  I imagine the local authorities would have information days on this.  Local community groups should be encouraged to do this also, in conjunction with local authorities.  This will be a new system for everyone.  There are people who are afraid of form-filling, but local authorities and community groups have a background and an interest in helping them.  I do not think it will be a big issue.  If they cannot get the <Col N="739"/>Senator on the telephone they can telephone me in Donegal.  Between the two of us we can look after them all.</P>

We touched on this point earlier.  If I heard the Minister correctly, he stated that if a septic tank or wastewater treatment system is located in a special protection area, a special area of conservation or a national heritage <Col N="740"/>area, then no septic tank upgrade works, irrespective of whether they put in on any of the special protection areas, heritage areas or surrounding areas, would require an ecological report or other scientific report.

	<P Just="Left">The reason this provision is included in the Bill is that the provision of any additional information could include such issues as the type of system that is already there, when it was installed and whether it is serviced regularly.  It will help the EPA and local authorities to come up with what they regard as an appropriate national inspection plan.  There is a catch-all statement in the Bill to allow us to get that information in order that we can have a reasonable interpretation of what the general requirement is for people as part of the inspection plan.  It is not mandatory but it allows us to ask for that information.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The householder already has the information.  On a point of clarification, we know the householder has this information because he or she lives there.  When we get the information from the householder and give it to the local authorities, we are informing them of what type of inspection has to be carried out, taking into account what is already <i>in situ</i>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought that is what he said.  That was my understanding.  Will people be asked when they clean the glass and keep records over a number of years?  Will that be the basis for the selection of inspections?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="744"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>He indicated to us only a small proportion of those with septic tanks will be selected for inspection.  How will inspections be selected?  Will it be on a random basis or on the information supplied?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It might inform the fact we will not have to inspect them at all.  It might help local authorities.  They, with the guidance of the EPA, will pick the places to be inspected on a risk-based assessment, something they already know and are doing under the Water Services Act 2007.  The basic information supplied in this case about the type of system to be registered may inform a local authority that there is no need to inspect it because it is modern and is working, based on the manufacturer&rsquo;s certification.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>That raises another question.  I made the point on Second Stage that I would have preferred if we took a more focused and targeted view on the registration and inspection regime.  We should look at areas where water courses are at risk.  Such areas could be identified.  Such a system works in other jurisdictions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what we are doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>

	<P>We are on amendment No. 8.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>My point deals with the specific additional information that will be prescribed.  What purpose will the information be put to?  I understand, from the response of the Minister, that the risk based assessment or evaluation by the EPA will be based on risks to water courses.  It already has that information because geographic areas have been identified.  The only information they will get from the new system will be the address of the householder.  I am anxious to know how the other information obtained will be used and can affect the individuals supplying it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be used for the purpose of informing local authorities of how best to draw up the national inspection plan, no more and no less.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment is about the application form to get on the register.  The Minister indicated, when pressed, that he would seek clarification of the types of information the EPA will seek, and offered some examples.  Why then did he subsequently opt for a catch-all provision?  Why not define the information in order to make clear the intention of this provision?  There is a concern that a future Minister could misuse this legislation, for example, with title deeds, proof of ownership&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not misuse legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not referring to the Minister.  The amendment seeks to remove the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo;.  My point is that the Minister should define exactly what information the EPA can and should seek rather than going for a catch-all provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to delay proceedings, but I predict that the Minister will be hoisted by his own petard on this issue.  He has been very clear in regard to other sections and subsections as to how the prescribed form will be rolled out.  Therefore, I cannot understand why he has chosen not to spell out what is envisaged in this particular provision.  What is out there that we do not know about?  What is the assumption or inference behind it?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="745"/>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not know what is out there until the inspections take place.  That is the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot understand why, having gone to the trouble of making other provisions which are very detailed in regard to the application form, the Minister has thrown in this canard in regard to additional information.  It is reasonable that we should seek to establish what precisely is involved here.  As I said earlier in respect of the various types of septic tanks, none of us has any difficulty with ensuring the authorities get as much information as possible.  All we are seeking to clarify is whether there is a hidden agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister indicated that there may be a need to provide some form of drawing.  I assume this refers to a drawing of the location of the septic tank and percolation area relative to the property.  If that is required &mdash; I am merely giving an example of what might be envisaged in this &mdash; the likelihood is that the homeowner may not have the necessary skills to provide that information, in which case one is looking at an additional cost.  My concern is that the EPA, under pressure from groups such as An Taisce, might, in its prescription of the additional information required, go far beyond what is envisaged in the legislation.  That is the difficulty I have with this section.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I appreciate what the Minister is saying, it would be far preferable to specify precisely what is being sought under this provision.  He indicated that this provision might lead to lower costs for homeowners.  Given that there are no fees, as the Minister outlined, how could the inclusion of these additional requirements possibly lead to reduced costs?  Surely they would cost nothing additional at best while, at worst, there is certainly an implication that there would be additional responsibilities and, by extension, costs on the individual.  That is the source of concern in these provisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s last response provided some clarification on this issue in so far as he explained that the additional information will be used by the EPA to develop a national plan.  The purpose of the Bill, as the Minister indicated and with which we all agree, is to ensure we have safe watercourses and a safe water supply.  There is both a public health and an environmental perspective.  However, if we are looking at a hierarchy of risk to watercourses, we must consider that many of those affected by these provisions do not live close to a water course which might be vulnerable to pollutants from their septic tanks.  I have heard nothing about the main polluters.  For example, despite the millions of euro invested in water treatment systems, Dublin and Limerick city councils are still unable to comply with the regulations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That has nothing to do with this amendment.  It is a matter for the local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I am making is certainly relevant to these provisions.  They relate to the gathering of information which will, as the Minister said, inform the authorities on how the national plan should be targeted.  My point is that the people from whom we are seeking this information are the wrong people.  The river basin management plan revealed that the main polluters are local authorities.  I accept there is an issue in regard to septic tanks that are proximate to water courses.  That problem must be addressed.  However, I would argue that, at a guess, one third of people with septic tanks are within those catchment risk areas while the other two thirds are not.  However, we are bringing all of them into a bureaucratic system which will have significant costs for the State and for the individuals concerned in respect of inspections and probably issues of non-compliance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="746"/>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>For whom will it involve costs?  There is a standard registration fee of &euro;50.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>There are local authorities which have decided only in recent years that percolation tests should form part of the process of granting planning permissions.  People who sought permission, went through the process set up by the State and now find themselves in great difficulty, perhaps unable physically and financially to comply, will be put through the hoops.  That is unacceptable when the State is the largest polluter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>What hoops?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>

	<P>It may not be working.</P>

	<P>In which case it will have to be fixed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am saying that the worst culprit in regard to pollution of watercourses is the State.  The State is not prepared to get its house in order but is seeking instead to pass the burden onto individual rural dwellers.  It is typical of how the State operates.  I am not blaming the Minister or the Government specifically; it is typical of how the apparatus of the State functions.  Standards are set down with which individuals must comply while the State itself is not so obliged.  That is unacceptable and if the Minister does not address it, he will run into serious difficulty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree that local authorities are responsible for pollution.  We are trying to do something about that.

If that is the strategy we must adopt tonight, so be it.  It is a good one.</P>

	<P>As the Minister said, all properties must be subject to inspection; whether they are in a high-risk area or otherwise is irrelevant.  We cannot make fish of one and flesh of another.  Properties in high-risk areas will be inspected, while those which are not may not be.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill seems to be hung up on certain aspects of this provision.  To reiterate, the information being sought is not mandatory.  In other words, if the person happens to have built the house within the past 20 years and has a copy of the planning permission for the house, the site map will show the position of the septic tank and of the percolation area and this can be submitted with the application for registration.  This is the type of information referred to by the Minister, as I understand.  The second port of call for a site map would be the local authority which will have a file on all applications as far back as 1963.  It is not mandatory to have a site map and there will be no penalty for not having one.  Perhaps Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill will accept this as an explanation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Landy that this has been a very good debate and the clarification is very useful.  It seems that the Government representatives create more questions than answers.  I seek clarification on the Minister&rsquo;s statement that all houses are covered under the information to be gathered in respect of this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, he said that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>It relates to one of the amendments we put forward which were ruled out of order.  The Bill as it stands refers to domestic wastewater systems.  I ask the Minister to clarify the information that will be gathered on these registration forms.  What is classified as a domestic wastewater system?  The definition being used in the Bill might be a tad loose.  The debate in the media and in the public arena has been about septic tanks and people have possibly jumped to the conclusion that we are talking about a house connected to a septic tank in a rural area.  The Bill actually refers to domestic wastewater which is why I would have questioned the Minister&rsquo;s ruling.  I imagine the use of the word, &ldquo;domestic&rdquo;, means that somebody lives in the house.  A wastewater system is a system for taking away the wastewater.  If I live in a house in a terrace which has a pipe going from it into a system that deals chemically and biologically with the waste, does this qualify as a domestic wastewater system?  Therefore, are we talking about all houses in the State?  Are we saying that every house in the country could potentially be open to these charges?  It is not necessarily an urban-rural divide&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have good respect for Senator Landy as we know each other a long time.  I do not fully agree with the point he made.  The inclusion of all houses with septic tanks goes beyond what is necessary to protect our water courses which is a priority.  Some people are getting anxious because even if their septic tanks were not functioning perfectly, they would still not cause a problem.  This proposal is actually putting our water courses at risk because the scarce human resources available to monitor and inspect will be too thinly spread over the full range of septic tanks whereas a focus on tanks which constitute a risk to the water courses would be more effective.</P><Col N="749"/>
        <P>I agree with Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  For example, if the Minister&rsquo;s house has its wastewater system connected into the public system which, due to the failure on the part of the local authority, is flowing into and polluting the river and I have a septic tank which is not affecting a water course, I am punished and the Minister gets off scot free.  This is completely unfair.  I think every house should have to comply.  This is the point being made by the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators.  If their amendments had been in order they would have provided a very valuable input into this debate.  There is an element of unfairness in the manner of the debate and it is somewhat bureaucratic.  I do not wish to accuse the Minister because I regard myself as almost a friend of his&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I wish to be helpful.  The Members of the Opposition are in danger of tying themselves into linguistic knots and Senator Cullinane is talking about hypothetical houses.  I will try to add some clarity to the debate.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill and Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh ask whether a future Minister could abuse this Minister&rsquo;s legislation for some nefarious or perfidious function and this is always a possibility.  No law can bind a future Minister; the next Minister can do what he or she wishes, such as introducing another new law.  Whether this law is tied up or tied down does not matter because a new Minister can bring in another law to repeal this law.  Therefore, the Senators&rsquo; concerns are completely irrelevant and unfounded.</P>

I wish to say this for the sake of clarity.  When I speak in future I will be a lot clearer for those who may misinterpret what I might be trying to say.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The point I am trying to make is that in very many urban wastewater treatment systems, under whichever local authority, when the plant fills up the slush gates are opened and raw sewage flows into rivers and lakes.  I know this and so does the Minister.</P>

	<P>We are discussing domestic schemes, not local authority schemes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>A domestic scheme might belong to any house.  Just because one has a sewerage scheme does not mean one&rsquo;s house is classed as non-domestic.  A sewerage scheme is different from that of a domestic dwelling.  It is either a domestic sewerage scheme or a publicly funded sewerage scheme in the town or village.</P>
        <P>In a report in 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency stated that &ldquo;due to the complexity of environmental issues effective environmental policies and solutions must be underpinned by <Col N="751"/>a good knowledge of the science&rdquo;.  What science is being used to determine the new monitoring systems and the pollution being caused by septic tanks in rural areas?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The department of microbiology at University College Hospital, Galway, stated that comprehensive science does not exist in the case of alleged pollution from septic tanks.  If that is the case on what are we basing our strategy?  On what is the Minister basing his monitoring strategy?  The EPA further recommended in its 2008 report that standard septic tank properties, sited with good percolation, are the best way of dealing with waste water treatment systems.  The best wastewater treatment system is a domestic septic tank; it is over and above that offered by the public infrastructure within this State.</P>
        <P>Figures for population density in rural Ireland show that very often only ten people live within a square kilometre, with a possible rise to 25 persons per square km.  Those figures are based on the 2011 census.  If those are the figures for rural Ireland, how can those ten to 25 people be compared to the numbers of people living in Senator Keane&rsquo;s constituency which has massive population densities, apartments and houses built very close together?  Population density there would be ten or 20 people in an area no bigger than 100 sq. m.</P>
        <P>We must be real about this issue.  Europe may be crying up and An Taisce and Friends of the Earth and all the others may be reacting and sending all sorts of memos to Europe, but we must live in the real world.  People living in rural Ireland are not the prime cause of pollution in this country and they should not be penalised accordingly.  Why are we subsidising people just for living in cities?  I have nothing at all against people who live in cities but why&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was able to negotiate against us having to do that and was able to use the Water Services Act 2007 introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in order to deal with areas with high risk water courses.

They will not be able to comply because of the physical nature of their site, because of soil conditions or because of their financial positions.  I spent a considerable amount of time in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency as a young lad.  My grandparents lived in the marble city of Kilkenny.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that.  The Minister has indicated that basic information will have to be supplied to the local authority by the owner of each septic tank.  That will facilitate the making of decisions on where inspections should take place, as well as on the volumes of inspections that will be necessary.  After months of scaremongering, the Minister has made this measure acceptable to many people.  The registration fee will be small.  It will cost just &euro;20 to appeal a decision that one does not like.  At this stage, we are really clutching at straws.  We should accept what the Minister is saying.  He is a man of his word.  If we pass this legislation and a future Minister attempts to alter it, I am sure people in this House and the other House will have an opportunity to tease these issues out again.  I appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il to accept the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides with regard to the system of registration we are talking about.  There is nothing sinister involved.  I do not doubt that the information that will be gathered will help to inform the local authority on where inspections need to take place.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for the clarification he has given regarding houses.  He said that individual houses, rather than public authority or group scheme houses, will not be connected.  In fairness, that is not written into the Bill.  The definition of &ldquo;domestic wastewater treatment system&rdquo; in the Bill is &ldquo;a system involving physical, chemical, biological or thermal processes, or a combination of such processes, utilised for the treatment or disposal of domestic wastewater, or the sludge derived from domestic wastewater&rdquo;.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the point I am trying to make.  In fairness, I honestly feel this is a serious issue.  It needs to be examined by the Bills Office.  I believe the potential exists for the definition to be misconstrued.  It could be argued that it covers all houses, as has been mentioned.  I appreciate that Senator Landy was talking about houses connected to septic tanks.  I do not think that is what is written in the Bill.  When one reads the Bill, one finds that it refers to &ldquo;systems&rdquo;.  I think this needs to be clarified.  It could be misconstrued as a reference to group schemes and local authority schemes and, as a result, they could be covered by this Bill.</P>

In urban areas, there is a pumped sewage scheme and there is no necessity for a registration process or a registration fee.  We have no objection to the registration process but we have a fundamental objection to the registration fee, which at &euro;50 per house would yield almost &euro;24 million to the Exchequer.  It is said that the Bill is revenue neutral, but I am not sure that is the case because inspectors must be paid and I do not know who will pay them if the Bill is revenue neutral.

There might be more of a buy-in to the Bill among the public if there was no registration fee.  There are obviously other costs to contend with and we have dealt with them in other sections of the Bill.  The registration fee seems to be a cash cow for the Government.  As everybody knows, if a fee is introduced, no matter whether it is &euro;5 or &euro;50, it is inevitable that it will go up.

	<P>I have been asking for the past two weeks for a discussion on pre-budget alternatives and where money can be found.  A Government Senator recently asked where are the alternatives.

	<P>We pay taxes to ensure we have what the Minister says we should have, which is good clean groundwater and proper disposal of waste water in order, which, in turn, protects the environment.  There is an unfairness in this charge which goes right to the heart of our opposition to it.  Many people who are connected to local authority water systems do not have to pay and this charge penalises those who are not connected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We do not oppose registration, inspection or remedial works.  The &euro;50 charge is important and the bigger fear many people have in counties Kilkenny and Waterford is that if remedial works are needed, no provision is made in the legislation to make grants available.  The Minister should acknowledge such works could be necessary and it would cost householders.  Why should they bear that cost when they pay taxes?  There is an inherent unfairness in what the Government parties are trying to do.  They are using a good European court ruling, which ensures we comply with proper environmental and sustainable planning standards, to extract more money by adopting a registration fee that is solely intended to get more money out of people who may not have it to give.  They are cynically using the European court judgment to get money from people.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in is not opposed to the broad thrust of what the Minister is trying to do.  Mention was made of what is happening in the North.  There is no registration fee and free desludging is provided, to which I referred on Second Stage.</P>

        <P>We believe this is an exercise on the part of the Government to collect revenue from people who may not have it to give.  This is unfair because it will result in a two-tier system where people who are connected to mains systems in urban areas will not have to pay and those who live in rural communities and on the fringes of towns and cities will be penalised.  People living just outside my own city of Waterford are not connected to the mains system.  That is not their fault but they will be asked to pay this charge.</P>

I would not like too much grandstanding but there are issues and they are being discussed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I come from rural Ireland and I have been approached about issues in this Bill.  One of the reasons I was approached by people was they do not have a great deal of knowledge about what is involved.  That is understandable given the debate on the legislation is just under way.  However, reflecting on the correspondence I have received in the past number of days, it is clear there is a great deal of interest in what is happening here.  I was asked earlier why this Bill is taking so long to go through.  The message we are getting is there is a perception among the public that it will amplify the urban-rural divide.  In the past quarter of a century, we have tried to minimise this divide by ensuring fair play for urban and rural communities when an issue is raised.</P>

	<P>I originally lived in a rural area &mdash; we did not have a septic tank &mdash; but I currently reside in an urban area.  As I informed the Minister of State last week, there are many urban dwellers who pay management fees in respect of their estates, etc., and who are now going to be obliged to pay fees for sewerage pumps.  These people will be of the opinion that they are paying fees in respect of what is basically a water treatment system.  If we state that rural dwellers should not pay anything, the former individuals will feel hard done by.  It has not been indicated, in any correspondence I have received in recent weeks, that people are opposed to a &euro;50 fee.  They understand that it is to be imposed and they also understand the logic which underpins it.</P>
        <P>When those in Sinn F&eacute;in are asked to identify from where the money should come, they state that a wealth tax should be introduced.  Their version of such a tax is based on the French model.</P>

	<P>I am sorry I had to say it.  A fee of &euro;50 is not exorbitant.  It is not nice to be obliged to inform people that they must pay &euro;50.

I must remind Senator Cullinane &mdash; because it appears to have slipped his mind &mdash; that it is not discriminatory to charge someone in a particular area &euro;50 when one is also imposing development charges on those who live in urban and semi-urban areas.

	<P>Those who own houses that were built since the introduction of development charges are obliged to pay such charges, either directly or indirectly.  Developers pay the charges in the first instance and then pass them on to householders.  Ultimately, it is the householder who pays.  Sinn F&eacute;in has not been advertising that fact.  There is a need for balance and honesty in respect of this debate.  It is terrible to hear Members use the word &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo;, which is incendiary in nature.  Utilising language of this sort does not enhance the discussion.  Let us, therefore, try to keep the debate honest and balanced.</P>

It is legitimate for those of us on this side to question both the concept behind and the amount of a charge.  I do not accept the argument that people can throw &euro;50 around like snuff at a wake as if it makes no difference to them.  One need only read the newspapers or walk around one&rsquo;s community to realise that the development charges to which Senator Gilroy refers are now, sadly, history.

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 4</P>
        <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 5, to delete lines 9 to 11 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5" Just="Left">&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) in the case of an application under subsection (2), there will be no fee required.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot agree to this proposal.  A modest fee must be charged in order to cover administration costs and those relating to inspections.  I do not want to again impose on the goodwill of those in employment by introducing another general tax, which is what Sinn F&eacute;in wants.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is.  If we do not charge for these services, then the money will have to come out of the pockets of working people.  I do not want to do that and I am imposing an administrative charge on a once-off basis for registration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I will drop that copy of the pre-budget submission down to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>In case Senator Cullinane is worried about what would happen five years afterwards, there will be no re-inspection charge.  There will be no &euro;300 annual inspection charge like the one some were going around speaking about when this Bill was first mooted in June.  I am sure the misinformation and fear generated about something that was not going to happen is what motivated many to write to Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  I can understand that and Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is correct to reflect it.  The manner in which, this evening, we have clarified many issues on planning and the risk-based assessment that we will introduce, for example, the planning exemption will mean that people will not have to go to the expense of applying for planning permission for upgrades, will allay the reasonable concerns of those who want to have their fears allayed.  All that is required here is to comply with the European Court of Justice judgment of 2009, which I inherited and about which my predecessors did not do anything, in order to ensure that there is an inspection and monitoring system so that the State will not <Col N="772"/>have to pay &euro;26,000 a day in fines to the European Community, which working people would not want us to do either.</P>
        <P>Grants are something that can be considered when we know the extent of the problem.  We do not know the extent of the problem until inspections are carried out and that will be in 2013.  For those on low incomes or for the less well-off in the community, if they have a serious problem, I will not be found wanting in looking at the grants issue in 2014.  I cannot do that until I know the extent of the problem or the people who are affected, as I have said all along.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others expressed another view on the urban-rural issue.  Some &euro;500 million has been spent in the past ten years under the rural water programme, which was a serious investment to improve water quality, particularly through group schemes.  It should be acknowledged the State is still subsidising these schemes in rural areas and people are benefiting from the improvements that have been carried out by successive Governments.  The same investment was required proportionately for urban areas because of the difficulties they encountered over the years in terms of urban wastewater treatment plants, which are still a significant problem in villages and towns and must be addressed.</P>

Unbelievably, I probably did not even acknowledge it sufficiently to Senator Mooney earlier that I have put the &euro;50 in the legislation in order that there is no doubt about it.

        <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to the certificate of registration.  The Bill provides that it shall be valid for a period of five years from the date on which it was issued.

	<P Just="Left">We are proposing that the certificate of registration would be extended to the lifetime of the property, or for a period not less than 40 years.  If a septic tank in a property is deemed to be working properly under the assessment process, if self-regulation was built in for the householder, and if what we are proposing on annual de-sludging was accepted by the Government and paid for by the Exchequer, there would be no need to review the legislation after five years.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Under the RIA which accompanies the Bill and under the section which deals with financial cost to the householder, it is suggested that a recommendation for desludging accompany the legislation.  Perhaps this could be inserted into some of the regulations that the Minister controls under the legislation, and the RIA suggests that the average cost of this would be &euro;200 for the householder.  That could be defined as a hidden cost in the legislation if householders are requested at a future date to carry out that de-sludging themselves.  We propose that de-sludging should be paid for by the Exchequer before the Bill comes into operation.  If that were to happen, I do not see why the certificate of registration could only be valid for five years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not sure if there is another scientific or microbiological reason for having a certificate that lasts only five years.  Perhaps the Minister could identify such a reason.  If there is a reason, can he tell us whether or not an annual de-sludging would deal with it?</P><Col N="776"/>
        <P>The registration certificate also has massive ramifications from a conveyancing point of view.  Legal experts have advised me that any section of this Bill, irrespective of whether it is a section attached to conveyancing, has property implications as the lawyer acting for the purchaser in a property transaction would look for all of the compliance certificates attached to this legislation when carrying out due diligence.  That will have cost implications for people who may need to sell their homes.  What implications will that have at the moment for a person who has a distressed mortgage, who is in financial difficulty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.  I have posed a few questions to the Minister.  It is too definitive to have a five-year registration certificate when there are alternative solutions to it.  We feel it should be extended to the period outlined, given that the desludging would address any anomalies that may occur within the period specified in our amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be grateful if the Minister clarified the reasons for the five-year term.  How was it arrived at?  What criteria were used to establish that five years would be the required time?  The explanatory memorandum refers to section 70B(1) and explains that it provides that each water service authority will be responsible for establishing and maintaining a register of treatment systems within its functional area.  I assumed that the concept of registration was to establish that the number of septic tanks in the country was the same that the local authorities already know about, and that the system of registration would then allow for inspections to be carried out.  That is why I am perplexed as to why there is a time limit put on it.  Surely once a septic tank is registered and that register is then maintained, no updating needs to be done.  A person either has a septic tank or not.  It is unlikely that a person who has a septic tank will not have it after five years, because once it is sunk it is there and it will be used.  The instances of people abandoning a house are rare.</P>
        <P>Without labouring the point, I would like the Minister to enlighten us as to how this was decided.  I would like him to address it in the context of the concept of registration and the reasons for registration, which is about maintaining a register.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Fair points are being raised.  The Bill states that a certificate of registration shall be valid for a period of five years from the date on which it was issued.  Why will people be asked to re-register?  They make an investment in their homes, and a septic tank system is also a life-long investment.  Once somebody is registered, what is the logic of re-registering?  The Minister said in earlier contributions that there would be no re-registration fee, and that is fair enough.  However, in dealing with a separate amendment, he was precious about the word &ldquo;prescriptive&rdquo;.  If that is the case, why is this not prescriptive and why is it not in the Bill?  It does not state anywhere in the Bill that there will be no re-registration fee.  The Minister is asking us to take a leap of faith on many issues, and that is the problem.  I have no difficulty in taking the Minister&rsquo;s word, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">Why are people being asked to re-register after five years?  It just does not make sense.  If something does not make sense, it is reasonable to ask if there is some ulterior motive for making people re-register.  People make a lifetime investment in their homes and I cannot understand why this timeframe be put on them.  Why put any timeframe on it?  Having said that, I think the amendment of 40 years is reasonable.  I have heard nothing from the Minister on Second Stage or since on why there needs to be a re-registration after five years.  That puzzles me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister see any need for a certificate of registration to be registered also on the title of the property?  Anybody buying or selling property will ensure that the cost of desludging or fixing or replacing a septic tank will be an integral part of any searches to be done.  Will it be registered as a <i>lis pendens</i> or a burden on the property?  Should it be so registered?</P>
        <P>I am also confused about the five-year period.  The septic tank, the soak pit and all that goes with it are such an integral part of the property that if it is registered, it should be registered for good and glory.  If property is registered, it is there forever.  If a house is being sold, then unless it is being knocked, the septic tank must last with the lifetime of the house, which in most instances would be in excess of 60 years.  The Minister might consider giving the registration a permanent function, and also making it part of the title; that is, if somebody is buying or selling property, he or she must ensure it is present as a simple attachment to the title deed.  It does not make a lot of sense if people have to re-register.  I do not see the need, unless, as somebody said, it is to require people, for some furtive motive, to go back to square one.  It is similar to when one gets an NCT for a car and one is asked pay another fee, even though the Minister says he does not wish to do that.  He should make it more permanent and make it part of the title.  A septic tank is an integral part of a property.  This five-year clause is confusing.</P>

	<P>Under the judgment of the European Court of Justice, we are required to institute regular inspections of the quality of our groundwater and, arising from that judgment, we are obliged to have regular checks.  We can do this through a registration process which happens every five or six years &mdash; I will pick five years.  The first round of registrations is to request basic information.  This will establish the ownership and location of on-site systems.  When the inspections are carried out, the EPA may decide to seek further information on the systems that are being used, whether they are in compliance with regulations and whether they are working.  It is a normal and expected course of action that the State, and local authorities in particular, should wish to know if compliance with the judgment continues and if information supplied on a second occasion correlates with information given on a previous occasion.  It is a cross-check to reassure the public, through the authorities, that we are serious about our groundwater quality and that we are complying with the judgment that was laid down in 2009.</P><Col N="778"/>

The fundamental thing is to ensure we establish checks and balances and a risk-based approach that will actually deal with groundwater quality.  I am pro-environment.  I support measures that protect the environment and protect our groundwater, and I am against anything that will damage public health.

	<P>I must point out also that &pound;115 is the discharge licence fee requested in Northern Ireland.  Senator Cullinane did not mention that in his contribution.  There are regular inspections in Northern Ireland and groundwater issues are treated seriously.  We have to do the same in the interest of households, public health, inward investment and job creation.  We cannot continue treating water in a casual and haphazard way.  It is a finite resource and must be respected, and people will do that in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Cavan model was mentioned earlier.  De-sludging is a solution, but &euro;200 is charged and the householder pays, not the public authority.  The system is privately operated and people pay the operators to do the job.  This does not fit in with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s thinking that we should rely only on public bodies to deal with these matters.  Private contractors deal with them in Northern Ireland and in Cavan.  We cannot have it every way.  We are trying to put a reasonable system in place to comply with the European Court of Justice judgment and deal with groundwater issues.  The more information we have and the more checks and balances we establish, the better equipped we are to ensure we continue to protect our groundwater to the highest possible standard.</P>

	<P>That is the point.  It was a red herring thrown in by the Minister.  There is a basic issue here: if one registers a septic tank, it will not move.  It is connected to a house, which will not move.  A person who registers will be on the system; the county council will know exactly what septic tank he or she has installed.  There is some sort of red herring in the Minister&rsquo;s explanation of the requirement to re-register after five years.  The inspectors will know where the tank was the last time; it will not have moved in the garden.  I agree with the amendment.  We certainly should not have a re-registration fee or even a re-registration process, because once a system is on the list, it is on the list.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>To follow up on the point made by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, the Minister said that the logic for the initial registration is to ensure that we have a database, which will allow us to carry out inspections and checks.  He said the purpose of the initial registration was to get basic information &mdash; I have no difficulty with that &mdash; and that the re-registration was to get more information and allow inspection.  Why is there a need for a second registration?  It does not make sense.  What Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh has said is right.  The Minister has not clarified why there is a need for re-registration.  He accused people on this side of the House of being anti-environment because they oppose a Bill on entirely different grounds &mdash; that is, on financial grounds.  He will not debate the real issues.</P>
        <P>The Minister has been asked a simple question about re-registration but his argument, from where I am standing, does not make any sense.  He has not given us any credible reason for the requirement to re-register.  It is not a question of looking for shadows or anything else; I am trying to find some logic in what the Government is doing.  If I could see the logic, I could perhaps support it, but I fail to see the logic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I must confess I am not totally reassured by the Minister&rsquo;s reply either.  I will not rehearse the arguments that have already been made but if I heard him correctly, the Minister said that this process would have to be undertaken following inspections in order that the EPA would be aware of any changes that might have taken place post-inspection.  I will return to the original point I asked the Minister to address.  It is specified in the legislation that the purpose of the registration process is to create and maintain a register.  There is nothing else, unless I am wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it then suggested that all 475,000 septic tanks in the country are going to be inspected?  The Minister said the information would be used post-inspection to help improve the flow of information back to the local authorities.  I do not want to labour the point, but when one sees an aspect of proposed legislation that does not make sense, it is only human nature to question it.  I am happy to be reassured by the Minister on this; I am not trying to be awkward.  However, I wonder what is the point of it if the concept, as stated, is the creation and then maintenance of a register of septic tanks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of de-sludging in Cavan and Northern Ireland was raised.  It is the case that this is being carried out by private contractors who have waste collection permits and I have no issue with that.  However, they are not the same people who are carrying out inspections.  They carry out the de-sludging and I would have no difficulty were they to do the de-sludging here if the grant scheme were available.  More employment could be created.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the need to carry out periodic inspections to comply with the registration scheme and I note that this is referred to in the Commission&rsquo;s judgment.  The Environmental Protection Agency recommendations state that periodic inspections should be carried out on septic tanks as well.  A better way of doing this could involve the provision of updated information by the individual if a simple form were made available to a householder to advise of any changes.  That might be a better way.  For example, let us consider the situation whereby a three-bedroom house is extended to a four-bedroom house and one receives planning permission and one <Col N="781"/>complies with X, Y and Z.  Self-regulation or inspection might be easier, rather than inspectors having to come out every year or every two or three years.</P>
        <P>When one buys a car one only registers it once unless one is selling it onwards.  The NCT is different and involves an inspection that is carried out every two or three years for each car.  However, the registration is different and it is the same in this case.  It appears from this side of the House that the registration process could be used as a vehicle to bring in new charges or criteria after five years from enactment of the Bill.  That is the concern on this side of the House.  Unless the Minister can provide a detailed explanation to the contrary that is how it appears.  Let us consider the example of a car being registered once, save when it is sold on.  The NCT inspection for such a car takes place based on the age of the car, regardless of the owner.</P>
        <P>The requirement for registration and certification after five years will have major property implications in terms of property transfers.  For example, what happens in the case of people who get into difficulty with mortgages and people who must move house and upgrade their registration certificate?  After five and a half years they will be obliged to start the process again.  The guidelines may change and more stringent guidelines may be introduced by a future Minister.  The regulations could be changed in conjunction with the EPA.  All of these permutations must be taken into consideration.  We should extend the time-line because five years is simply too short a time window.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan asked about the certification arising for people who might be buying or selling property.  All that is required is a certificate of compliance with the registration of a septic tank on the purchase or sale of a property, similar to the case of the building energy rating, BER, certificate.  There must be a certificate to demonstrate that one has registered a septic tank.</P>

	<P>No. Registration is all that is needed.  The fact that one has registered a septic tank is sufficient.  One need not do anything more.</P>

	<P>The Minister could make things perfectly clear by&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am making it clear.  If I were introducing a system of uniform inspection of septic tanks then no other registration would be necessary, but I am not doing so.  I am introducing a risk-based assessment under which approximately one in every five or six tanks will be inspected.  During the five year period changes will be made to the systems by some people and some may put in second or tertiary treatment systems.  Any details in a second registration would necessarily take account of improvements since the first registration.  Circumstances will change and the detail one outlines in the second registration may be different.  This involves updating what is taking place on the ground and seeing what people are doing in a self-assessment way through the registration process by updating the information about how people are putting in new systems, whether they must do so or what they are doing to improve groundwater quality without having inspections through this registration process.</P>

	<P>I agree with what Senator Cullinane is saying about people who are inspected but I am referring to the five out of six people who will not be inspected.

	<P Just="Left">I fully accept what the Minister is saying.  It is perfectly logical and sensible that this will happen.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan touched on the same point that there may be changes which I did not fully anticipate.  Does the Minister believe that five years is sufficient?  When people install a septic tank and comply as of now, does the Minister believe they would effect changes within a five-year period?  It does not seem likely.  Has the Minister given any consideration to the five-year period and to extending it further?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is another possibility or way of doing this.  If one has a house and one wishes to make an alteration to it, one should make an application for a change.  Could that work under this system?  My concern is that we may be creating a bureaucracy that will lead to duplication every five years and a great deal of additional work within a Civil Service that is already burdened and which we are trying to scale back.  We should try to use the existing resources in the best possible way.  Could the Minister not put in place a system where one registers only once?  The number of people who will add or change a system is rather small in the overall scheme of things.  Why not make it a regulation that if someone is going to change their wastewater system then they must re-register or register the change they are making to that system?  Surely that would make more sense than creating a bureaucracy that will do this once every five years and which will create more work for paper pushers.  We do not need people to do such work and we are trying to cut back on bureaucracy.  Non-compliance could be picked up at inspection stage.  If the inspectors are qualified then surely they will pick up on a change that has been made to a system.  This represents a more sensible approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh is advocating a reporting mechanism such that each time we carry out some work it is reported to someone, to the central registrar.  Certainly, that is one way of doing it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is dealing with the definitions now.  We have not laid down in legislation what we intend to do in that regard.  The second registration will pick up wherever inspections have been carried out in the risk-based areas and whether the work has been carried out.  One must allow a certain amount of time for people to carry out work arising from an inspection.  Then one can see with the second registration whether people are declaring if certain work has been carried out to the appropriate standard.  It will be evident at that stage.  Equally, if people carry out work without an inspection, such information will be picked up at the second registration as well.  One could choose any term but I believe five years is a reason<Col N="783"/>able term.  It amounts to updating an existing register and adding additional information that may be requested in an appropriate timescale.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>There is common ground between what the Opposition and the Minister are saying.  We all accept the bona fides of his logic for this part of the Bill, except that if substantial changes are made to a system then it makes sense for the system to be updated.  I assume the point Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh was making referred to every change or minor repair made.  The Minister was referring to significant changes.  It makes perfect sense.  There is nothing stopping the Minister from being prescriptive about the type of changes that would require someone to re-register.  The Minister could be prescriptive and suggest that if certain changes are made then one must contact the administrator with the information and provide them with the information and simply update the existing register rather than having to re-register.  As Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said, we will create a bureaucratic nightmare for the Minister and his Department where people have to re-register every five years.  The Minister said the logic of this is that people may make changes.  Only a small percentage of people would make changes and they should be required to inform the Department.  The Minister should be prescriptive about the changes he proposes.  It is a reasonable request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Minister said in the registration, which is to last five years, septic tanks may not be inspected.  If that is correct, it flies in the face of the framework of the Bill and the decision of the European Court of Justice. </P>
        <P>One worry I had was that once one registered an inspection would necessarily follow within a five year period.  If there is a problem in west Cork, Kilkenny, Connemara or Donegal, having a cop-out to placate Europe does not mean that a septic tank on the Beara Peninsula which may be polluting aquifers would be inspected.  If that is not the case there are inherent flaws in the Bill which the Minister may need to examine.  I am not saying I agree with that.</P>
        <P>However, the thrust of the Bill is that a person has to pay &euro;50 to register but is not inspected for five or ten years.  There are many more septic tanks than we would like to see in the country which may be polluting streams, roads or aquifers.  If that is the case the registration system will fall far short of what the Minister, Department and Europe envisages it should be.</P>

There is a system in place, through the planning process, which tells people the specifications for septic tanks if they are building houses.  Therefore, the Minister is asking people to register such systems with the Department, which is fine.  The issues are the environment, water and effluent.

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This has been a long debate but I am fairly clear about what was said earlier because I tried to labour the point.  We discussed houses that were built 20, 30 or 40 years ago.  I understand the Minister said if the water coming out of such systems was of an EPA standard to be laid down it did not matter what the systems were or how they worked as long as they conformed to the guidelines in place when they were built.  It is proposed to <Col N="784"/>register that system and re-register it if there are changes.  If I add to my system and the effluent from it is still of a high quality the water coming out of it should be inspected.  The idea of registering and re-registering is a red herring and I do not see the logic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will sanctions be imposed for non-compliance with the re-registration process?  How will the system of re-registration work?  I presume it will be similar to the registration process.  Will individuals be written to and advised that the five year term is up?  Will the form be automatically sent out at the end of five years?  Will there be sanctions for non-compliance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Based on the arguments made on this side of the House and what we have heard to date, I can see what the Minister is trying to achieve to a point on reregistration which might allow changing circumstances to be taken into account and so on.  However, it will introduce major conveyancing and land transfer difficulties.  Any solicitor carrying out proper due diligence will obviously look for much more than the registration of the property and all of the other work that has been carried out.  We need to extend the period of registration.  Other elements could be introduced under another Government amendment to the Bill if the Minister feels they need to be covered.  I am not sure if he is open to that idea but it might be constructive in resolving the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have protection of groundwater without a good working system.  If groundwater quality is not up to scratch the system has to be changed to deal with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what the Minister said earlier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>How can we have good groundwater quality if we do not have a system that is able to deal with it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>If I improve my system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>What is being tested, the water or the systems?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The system is inspected but the groundwater is tested to make sure everything is working properly.  The objective of the exercise is to ensure we have non-contamination of groundwater from septic tanks.  That is the ruling from the European Court of Justice.  We are doing our best to comply with it through a risk-based approach.  I am not introducing a universal system of inspection, which some people said I was going to do during the summer months, or have a &euro;300 annual inspection charge.  I do not think Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh did not get in on the act, to be fair to him.  He was not as bad as some of the others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has said that a few times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have and I will keep saying it.  One has to have a valid registration, otherwise it is an offence.  That clarifies Senator Mooney&rsquo;s question.  If one does not have a valid registration, even on re-registration it has to be valid.  I am prepared to consider what Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and &Oacute; Clochartaigh said on the time period and the cumbersome way in which one might have to re-register.  I will return to the point on Report Stage if I am in a very generous mood at 11.50 p.m.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This amendment relates to registration.  We seek to insert into the Bill a provision that any re-registration would not incur an additional cost to a householder.</P>
        <P>The initial registration fee was &euro;50.  We opposed that but in terms of re-registration the Minister has indicated he may accept that.  The mood is changing as we approach midnight.  We propose inserting the words &ldquo;at no additional cost to the householder&rdquo; in terms of a re-registration which we hope would take place after a period longer than five years and that it would be specified in the Bill for Report Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I will explain it in plain English.  The Senator&rsquo;s amendment states &ldquo;at no additional cost&rdquo;.  That is to presume that the Minister had it in his head to impose an additional cost.  He did not have it in his head to impose an additional cost and therefore he cannot accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment because he is presuming he is imposing an additional cost.  Does the Senator understand that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>As we approach midnight I am pleased to note that the Minister is ameliorating somewhat and softening in attitude, which is most welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There must be something in the water around here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>No. The Minister is known affectionately as Big Phil.  I think he might have a big heart as well and we might give him a chance in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is appropriate for Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill to table his amendment and it should not be belittled.  Will the Minister clarify that he is not saying he will amend the Bill to incorporate Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s amendment?  Will he confirm to us that in the Schedule to the Bill on which we will have to vote before it becomes law the question of no charge for the second registration will be included?  If the Minister can give us that assurance in his current good mood I would be glad to accept that position providing he confirms that to us.  We do not want to split hairs but if the Minister confirms that in the Schedule to the Bill, which will form part of the Bill, he will have a little aguis&iacute;n that there will be no fee for a second registration I am prepared to accept that.  I compliment him on the manner in which he is at last listening to us after several hours.</P>

	<P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is worth making the point that we do take the Minister&rsquo;s word.  I appreciate the amount of discussion on the Bill tonight which has been useful but we <Col N="787"/>have had about five different Ministers for the environment in the past number of years.  This Minister might get a promotion and move on to bigger and better things in the near future which is the reason it is important that this be clarified.  That would ensure that what he is considering, with which we agree, goes into either the Schedule or the legislation itself.  We would need clarification that that is the case.  We would support this amendment being pushed through because it is a reasonable request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>We all like to get on the record and it is nearly midnight.  There appears to be confusion on the part of one member of the Opposition who seems willing to accept that the Minister will do this by way of regulation.  Another person from the same party is not accepting it.  Perhaps it is getting so late&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;people do not understand what the Minister is saying.  He clearly stated that this matter will be dealt with by way of regulation when the time comes and in fairness to the Minister, if we are to progress this further tonight and when we return to it tomorrow evening, and I accept that much good work has been done in the hours we have been here, we should accept the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides and move on to the next amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no reference to a charge for subsequent registration.  Why should I agree to an amendment that highlights that fact?  I am prepared to do that by regulations, which is fair.  Why should I include a section in a Bill to draw attention to a future Minister to do it?  The Senator is concerned about future Ministers but I am only a Minister about eight months and I intend staying a Minister for a little longer.</P>

	<P>It is 12.15 a.m.  I much appreciate the fact that the Minister has taken time out to be present to deal with the serious, urgent and potentially dangerous situation that is unfolding in County Roscommon.  On Monday, 14 firefighters were dismissed for failure to attend a breathing apparatus refresher course.  The reason they refused to attend it is because the national proposal on the matter has not been agreed, yet Roscommon County Council wants to proceed with an approach that would result in firefighters passing or failing the breathing apparatus course with the consequent risk of losing their job.  I tend to agree with the firefighters.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 midnight</TimeSt>
        <P>As of yesterday, there was an interim agreement in the Labour Relations Commission that is valid until 1 December.  The firefighters in Roscommon need to ballot on the same proposal.  Today, 14 more firefighters in County Roscommon were dismissed.  There is now no emergency cover in County Roscommon.  We had a fire in my area where only five firefighters were mobilised, because that is all that was left, and we had to bring in a unit from another area to help put out the fire.  As of tomorrow, Roscommon County Council wants to bring in the Army to put in a piecemeal service that is not trained to the same level as the firefighters.  It also wants to put the lives of Army personnel at risk.  I am sure their wives too would have something to say on the matter.</P>
        <P>The approach of Roscommon County Council is very heavy handed.  It is bordering on bullying.  Men with 32 years service in their early 50s are now being told by management that if they fail a course, they are no longer considered useful in the fire service.  That is outlandish.  According to <i>The Irish Times</i> the answer of Roscommon County Council is that even with half of the workforce in the fire service it is able to cope, which begs the question that if it is able to cope with half the fire service why we need as many as we have.  Is this just an excuse on its behalf?  It is absolutely ludicrous.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned recently in the Seanad, in most cases across the country most of the chief fire officers and assistant chief fire officers &mdash; the statistic is approximately 90% &mdash; never did fire training.  They were never firemen.  They were engineers that did a four week course and <Col N="790"/>who all of a sudden knew everything about the fire service, more than someone who has 32 years service in the fire brigade.  As I said yesterday, some of them never put out a cigarette, let alone a fire.</P>
        <P>I will raise this point again with the Minister, namely, that it is time we had an integrated national fire and ambulance service.  In the North of Ireland there is one chief fire officer and two assistant fire officers covering a population of 1.7 million.  We have 30 chief fire officers and 300 assistant chief fire officers for 4.7 million people.  It is an absolute waste of money.  The system is top heavy and we must address it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am dealing with young and middle aged firefighters with young families in my county, some of whose wives are not in the best of health for one reason or another.  Neighbours of mine in their early 50s have 32 years service in the fire service.  They have more experience than any chief fire officer ever had.  I have the greatest of respect for firemen.  I know the same is true of the Minister.  I urge him to intervene and to bring common sense back to the situation because it has been lacking in the entire process.  The first step that needs to be taken is to reinstate the firefighters who have been dismissed.  They are willing to negotiate.  If it is agreed at national level that one can either pass or fail the training they are willing to go along with that but, as yet, there is no agreement.  If the Minister does that we will avert a national strike.  I would be ashamed to say that if we end up with a national strike over this issue, the one county we can blame for it will be my county, while in other counties they are deciding to go with the old system of not passing or failing but having more refresher training.  It is sad that we cannot just deal with the issue.  One county can deal with it, but another county is trying to make a name for itself nationally and bring the entire country to a standstill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret the situation that has evolved in Roscommon.  The fire services, funded and managed by local authorities, are one of the finest community services.  Roscommon County Council has six fire brigades which are manned by 56 retained firefighters in Ballaghaderreen, Boyle, Castlerea, Elphin, Roscommon and Strokestown.  It is most regrettable, as Senator Kelly has said, that despite all the efforts by the parties and the machinery of the State we find ourselves in a situation where a number of firefighters have had to be stood down from duty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Competence in the use of breathing apparatus is one of the basic requirements of carrying out the functions of a modern firefighter in a safe and effective manner.  Initial training in the use of breathing apparatus provides firefighters with the necessary skills and knowledge to use breathing apparatus in a competent and safe manner.  Breathing apparatus is a basic tool.  It enables firefighters to enter smoke-filled buildings to search for casualties or to get close to the source of a fire for effective intervention.  The Department has published national guidance to assist fire authorities to provide consistent and safe training in the use of breathing apparatus.  The relevant documents are The Use of Breathing Apparatus in the Fire Service, published in 2007, and Guidance on the Provision and Assessment of Breathing Apparatus Training, published in 2010. </P>
        <P>Breathing apparatus training involves both instruction to impart knowledge and practical exercises to enable learners to apply the knowledge gained in a series of progressive learning activities.  It is also important that skill levels of firefighters are maintained and refreshed on a regular basis.  For this reason, all firefighters are required to undertake breathing apparatus refresher training every two years.  Furthermore, there are specific safety issues associated with firefighting and local authorities have statutory responsibilities for their workers under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  This includes ensuring that firefighters are <Col N="791"/>sufficiently skilled and trained to undertake their duties safely for their own sake and for that of their colleagues and members of the general public.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Such training is an integral part of the fire service and must be undertaken, as required by fire authorities, by all personnel in order to enable them to comply with their statutory obligations.  Firefighters who may be unsuccessful on a first attempt at reaching the required level of competency are afforded every opportunity to develop proficiency and demonstrate the required competence and knowledge.  I understand that local authorities have given assurances that every effort will be made to address any competency deficiencies identified in refresher training in the shortest possible time &mdash; before the end of the training course, if there is that possibility.  I note what Senator Kelly has said in respect of this matter in the context of firefighters in Roscommon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Labour Relations Commission has set out a set of interim guidance points in respect of this matter.  I greatly welcome this.  In my opinion, those guidance points form a good basis for moving forward from the current position.  I strongly encourage those involved at management and union level to resolve the existing problems for the sake of members of the public, for whom the fire service is provided.  I will make inquiries in order to discover what progress has been made by the Labour Relations Commission and others to advance the case relating to the people to whom the Senator refers.  I will do everything possible to ensure that there is an adequate fire service in Roscommon and to bring together the personnel who have been stood down and the management of the county council in order that they might find a satisfactory solution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s reply, which came about as a result of the Labour Relations Commission sitting to deal with this matter yesterday.  There are a couple of issues to which I must refer.  A number of fire chiefs throughout the country have failed the breathing apparatus course and some were obliged to travel to the UK in order to obtain accreditation so that they might remain on the job.  I do not know if a similar process will apply in respect of our experienced firefighters.  I have an issue with those who run the course being responsible for deciding whether someone passes or fails.  I am of the view that an independent body should make the decision in this regard.</P>
        <P>It has been stated that further training will be given in order to ensure that the firefighters to whom I refer will pass the course.  I have been led to believe that firefighters are obliged to pay for every course they attend after the first refresher course.  I have many concerns with regard to this matter.  Perhaps the Minister can intervene with the county manager in order that some common sense might be brought to bear and that the matter might be resolved swiftly.  I do not want it to escalate any further.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When I tabled this matter I did not know we would only be taking it now, in the early hours of the morning.  Given that public health nurses provide a universal service for all our children, will the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs outline the role they will play in the context of the new child and family support agency? The latter is extremely important and was only recently established.  What steps will be taken to ensure that the service provided by public health nurses will be integrated with that of the new agency in order that children and families might have access to a seamless overall service?</P><Col N="792"/>
        <P>Public health nurses provide a universal programme of child care for those from birth to 12 years.  They are a unique group of individuals and they knock on 10,000 doors each day.  The Institute of Community Health Nursing, ICHN, a professional and educational body which represents public health nurses and community registered general nurses working in primary care throughout the country, advocates for greater participation and improved systems for public health nursing that would be effective in supporting identified at-risk families.  At this juncture I must declare an interest because I am a newly-appointed patron of the public health nurses.  From that point of view, I wish to represent their interests and ensure that they will be included at the decision-making levels in the new child and family support agency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The role of public health nurses encompasses primary, secondary and tertiary care from birth until death.  Although public health nursing emphasises a lifespan approach, in practice time involved in direct and indirect work is predominantly spent on older people and with child health groups.  Effective public health nursing requires an ability to work in partnership with individuals, families and communities in their own environment and in a way which has due regard to the determinants of health.  The HSE office of nursing and midwifery is reviewing the public health nursing service.  It is good that the debate relating to child and family services is running alongside this review.  At all times the welfare of the child is paramount and public health nurses, as part of the primary care teams, have been identified as &ldquo;prime workers&rdquo; with children at risk in the community.  Public health nurses visit every family with a new infant and then return on a number of occasions during the course of the child&rdquo;s life.  Public health nurses&rsquo; knowledge of local communities is critical to identifying supports and resources for families.  For example, their specialist education and training enable them to identify when families require referral to the social work services.  As a prominent referrer to child protective services under the Child Care Act 1991 and the policy guidelines issued by the then Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2010, a public health nurse will work with families by using an ecological approach to identifying need, risk factors and issues of concern in order to prevent a child from crossing the threshold of significant harm.</P>
        <P>The great thing about public health nurses is that they act as a kind of early warning system.  There are approximately 1,700 of these nurses throughout the country.  As already stated, they knock on 10,000 doors each day and their knowledge must be fed into the system at the critical stage.  If the latter is not done, then these nurses will be nothing other than a wasted resource.  What I have learned about public health nurses in recent weeks has led me to conclude that they are an undervalued and under-used resource.  Where child abuse concerns arise, public health nurses work with multidisciplinary teams in supporting and monitoring the families involved.  In the context of safeguarding children one of the key activities that can be provided by a public health nurse is a universal health visiting service, with more intensive support for those in need to ensure all children have the opportunity to fulfil their potential.</P>
        <P>The ICHN recommends that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs task force on the new child and family support agency should consider how to capture, develop and integrate the work of public health nurses into the agency.  It has set out four ways in which this could happen.  These are that the public health nurse service would remain in the HSE, configured in the same way &mdash; that is, that each area in the country would be assigned a public health nurse who, in general, would have responsibility for the organisation of all nursing services within said area; that the service would, along with other services, be transferred to the child and family support agency, thereby positioning a universal service within the agency and ensuring a continuum of services and meaning that public health nurses would be the first line of service for all families as all new births are notified to them; that one public health nurse could be appointed to each county and that person would be responsible for ensuring that child <Col N="793"/>protection services involving public health nurses operate according to best practice; or that the child protection aspect of public health nurses&rsquo; work would be integrated into social work teams.  The latter would require the appointment of somewhere in the region of 100 to 150 additional public health nurses and would be dependent on how the social work teams are organised.</P>
        <P>Public health nurses do not believe themselves to be adequately valued at key decision-making levels.  Given that they are at the front line, they visit 10,000 families a day and they have such a key role in identifying families at risk, it seems a huge waste of a good human resource, human capital, not to use their professional experience and knowledge adequately.</P>
        <P>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child enshrines our collective commitment to ensuring that all children, including the most vulnerable, are properly cared for and protected from harm.  While moral and social justice arguments are prominent in the rationale for focusing on prevention and early intervention, there is also compelling economic evidence for same.  Evidence shows that it is possible to prevent abuse and neglect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Institute of Community Health Nursing believes that the public health nurse is a major stakeholder in the debate on the future direction of child and family services in Ireland and it urges the task force to fully engage with the public health nurse service in planning future services.  My question is how does the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs plan to include public health nurses in the decision making layer of the new child and family agency and will she consider their inclusion in the task force?  I thank the Minister for taking this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to update the Seanad on work relating to the new child and family support agency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the programme for Government we made a commitment to fundamentally reform the delivery of child protection services by removing responsibility for child welfare and protection from the HSE and creating a dedicated child welfare and protection agency, reforming a model of service delivery and improving accountability to the D&aacute;il.  Accordingly, the Minister, established a task force on the child and family support agency in September 2011 under the chairmanship of Ms Maureen Lynott.  The task force will advise the Department in regard to the necessary transition programme to establish a child and family support agency and will base its work on best practice in child welfare, family support and public administration, consistent with the Government&rsquo;s public sector reform agenda.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the agency, it has been asked to propose a vision and principles to guide operations; advise on the appropriate service responsibilities and the delivery of same; review existing financial staffing and corporate resources and propose a methodology for resource allocation; propose an organisational design and operating child welfare and protection service model; prepare a detailed implementation plan; identify the main priorities and co-relationships required; and oversee the implementation and monitor progress, pending establishment of the agency.  As I have outlined, the task force will advise on the appropriate service responsibilities for the agency during the course of its work from among those within the HSE that relate to children and family services or from within the relevant operational responsibilities of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or its agencies.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Senator will be aware of last week&rsquo;s Government statement on the public service reform plan.  It confirmed that the family support agency will merge into the child and family support agency by 2013.  The Government also stated that the role of the National Education Welfare Board will be reviewed by June 2012 in the context of the establishment of this new agency.  No other decisions have been made in regard to other services for the new <Col N="794"/>agency, either universal or targeted for children and families, including public health nursing services.  It is clear that public health nurses have an important role to play in a range of child and family services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand that a new public health strategy is being developed and it is the intention that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will liaise with the Department of Health and the HSE with regard to any new developments in the context of the establishment of the new agency.  A review of public health nursing is under way in the HSE, which includes community nursing in the context of the role to meet primary health care services, which will include children services.  It is anticipated that a summary report will be finalised in January 2012 and it will specifically consider the role public health nurses can plan in supporting children&rsquo;s health care in the community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister looks forward to receiving the report of the work of the task force, which will inform preparations for the new agency, including the drafting of legislation.  It is her intention, working with her colleague the Minister for Health, to establish a dedicated child and family programme within the HSE in 2012.  This will provide for a dedicated management structure and a budget for children and family services.  Management of these services will be led by the national director, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, who already has a very close working relationship with the Minister and her Department.  A considerable change programme has already been implemented by the HSE&rsquo;s national director of child and family services, aimed at strengthening organisational capacity, business processes and systems.  These developments are an integral part of preparations for the new stand-alone agency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is anxious to advance the full establishment of the agency at an early date subject to the work of the task force and the necessary legislative provision.  It is envisaged that legislation will be tabled before the House next year to provide for the agency&rsquo;s establishment in 2013.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister probably does not know the answer to the question I am about to ask and it is not fair to expect him to be able to answer it.  Will he ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs if public health nurses will be included at a decision making level as opposed to only submissions being taken because they are a key stakeholder in child and family health?  That is the key question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As I said, it is a matter for the Senator to be able to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.  I will convey the Senator&rsquo;s view to the Minister and the Senator may be able to engage with her directly on this matter.  I am not in a position to give that information to the Senator.</P>
