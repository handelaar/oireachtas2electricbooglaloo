	<P>I have received notice from Senator Deirdre Clune that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to instruct local authorities to reduce and-or abolish development charges on a temporary basis as they are a deterrent to development.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">Ar an gh&aacute; don Aire Chomhsaoil Pobail agus Rialtais Aiti&uacute;il sol&eacute;iri&uacute; ar st&aacute;das na n-oibrithe i Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, agus cad at&aacute; i nd&aacute;n d&oacute;ibh &oacute; thaobh dl&iacute; de, agus cad at&aacute; an Roinn tar &eacute;is a dh&eacute;anamh, n&oacute; at&aacute; s&eacute; d&rsquo;intinn don Roinn a dh&eacute;anamh, chun leasa agus cearta fosta&iacute;ochta na n-oibrithe a chosaint.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Marc MacSharry of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to clarify the situation regarding the upgrade of the N4, between Castlebaldwin and Collooney, County Sligo, to dual carriageway status, in line with the previously stated commitments of the Government.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I regard the matters raised by Senators Clune and &Oacute; Clochartaigh as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator MacSharry as it is a matter for the National Roads Authority.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill 2011, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business, with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes, and the House to be adjourned not later than 5.45 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Leader about the report that HSE west is to write off &euro;6 million of funds owed to it by private health insurers, particularly in the context <Col N="108"/>of the pressures the health budget is under.  How is it that the HSE is allowed to make a decision to waive &euro;6 million owed to the HSE not by private individuals, but by private health insurance companies with large profits?  I ask this in the context of the downsizing by the Government of hospitals in the region, including Sligo and Roscommon, and various other hospitals and services, and the fact that this &euro;6 million could be put to very good use.  Perhaps the Leader will shed some light on that issue for Members on this side and on what the Government and the Minister for the Health intend to do about this decision taken by the HSE.</P>
        <P>In regard to the special pay-outs mentioned last week in respect of some senior civil servants, it appears those arrangements apply also to some county and city managers and will cost the Exchequer approximately &euro;16.5 million over the next two years.  While the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have said very little can be done about this &mdash; these are existing arrangements &mdash; what pressure is the Government putting on these individuals in regard to these special payments which are substantial in nature?  What is the position in respect of reports that pensions are being augmented and additional years service being added for many senior public servants across the country?  I know it is happening in our universities because I raised it in the last D&aacute;il also.  In that instance, additional pensionable service is being added even though there was a directive from the Department of Finance in January 2009 that in any case where the State would have increased liabilities regarding pensions, the trustees were to err on the side of the State.  I would like to get clarification on that issue and on what the Government intends to do.</P>
        <P>I note the Government Chief Whip is missing.  He is obviously still suffering from Sunday&rsquo;s defeat.  I am glad to see my colleague from Kerry is present.  I hope Senator Coghlan attends the Seanad quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Another minute and it might have been different.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Stop.  Everyone will join me in congratulating the Dublin team, Pat Gilroy and Bryan Cullen on a magnificent victory against Kerry.  Senator Coghlan is always referring to how Killarney is the capital for tourism, but it is obviously true after this weekend that Dublin is the capital for football.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is not often that I rise to support Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s remarks robustly, but it was a great day for Dublin and I join the Senator in congratulating the team and Pat Gilroy, its manager.  It is probably no coincidence that tomorrow will be blue day in the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be the whole of the week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We will all wear blue in support of men&rsquo;s cancer programmes, although it may be somewhat difficult for some of our Kerry colleagues to conform.  It was a great result not just for Dublin, but also for tourism.  Ireland had a great result in Saturday&rsquo;s rugby.  Both results gave a considerable boost to people&rsquo;s positivity in the face of significant economic challenges.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I renew my call for a debate on third level education.  The Minister will attend the Chamber to discuss the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill 2011 and issues concerning universities may be raised in that context and in light of the inaugural address of the Provost of Trinity College, Professor Patrick Prendergast.  Like other Senators, I had the privilege of attending that address.  It is worth pointing out that he noted Trinity&rsquo;s achievements <Col N="109"/>and mounted a robust defence of it and universities generally at a time when universities and higher education are coming under attack.  As he stated, Trinity is unique in entering the list of the top 50 universities worldwide.  It was in 43rd place at its highest point, but it has since slipped down.  Being one of the top 50 was a considerable achievement.  As the Provost pointed out, only one Irish-owned company numbers among the Fortune 500 companies.  Trinity is now in 65th place and there is a concern that reduced funding and resourcing of third level and the stifling of autonomous decision-making will hinder creativity and innovation in universities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A Higher Education Authority study today shows that Government investment in research in universities, colleges and institutes of technology has had a direct return in investment of &euro;1.8 billion.  This is a matter of great concern at this time of economic challenge.  I will renew my call to the Minister, but we need a fuller debate on third level funding.  It is important that universities have autonomy and, in light of student numbers doubling, be able to hire when necessary.  It should not be an either-or situation.  It is not a case of putting investment into primary or third level.  It should be a case of investing in education at all levels.  University is not a luxury &mdash; it is a necessity, even in a time of economic challenge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I congratulate Dublin on its ranking as ninth in the list of the world&rsquo;s bicycle-friendly cities.  According to a Danish survey published today, this is due to visionary politicians.  It is worth mentioning the Lord Mayor, Councillor Andrew Montague, who pioneered the Dublin bikes scheme, which has gone a long way towards making Dublin such a great city not just for football but also for cyclists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s remarks about the Dubs.  He did not mention that north Dublin is also good at cricket.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>One of his constituents in Balbriggan defeated England.  That was an achievement.</P>
        <P>Regarding Senator Bacik&rsquo;s comments, universities and the points mechanism comprise the subject of a statement today that has been covered widely by the media, certainly the broadcast media.  The statement was made by seven people who all happen to be men.  I am a member of a university governing body, but this topic has never been discussed.  The Oireachtas should be aware that the tendency of these seven people is to rush out statements without consulting anyone.  Under the Universities Act, universities are collegiate and not managerial bodies.</P>
        <P>The person who set up the points system, the late provost of TCD, Professor Bill Watts, pointed out in his book that it is independent, not subject to influence, autonomous and self-financing.  Given the possibility of influence, any alternative system must be viewed askance.  I am surprised that, yet again, the heads of universities rushed out statements without discussing the alternatives with their constituents.  Regarding tomorrow&rsquo;s conference, there should be a health warning to the effect that this is what seven people decided, not the rest of us in a collegiate community.</P>
        <P>In pursuit of a 72% pay rise, the university heads boasted on 5 January 2007 that they were no longer educators but corporate chief executives.  The views on who is in college might actually reflect those of us who have the honour and privilege to teach them.  I regret the heads should issue statements without drawing attention to the fact that their combined wisdom, or lack of it, is that of just seven people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is now over 22 years since three Irish soldiers serving in the Lebanon were killed in an incident or accident.  Since then, the three families involved have been trying to achieve closure by obtaining the full details on the cause of the incident.  The <Col N="110"/>families were concerned that the incident could have been avoided.  It is fair to say their efforts in recent years were not greatly successful.  Successive Governments were not able to respond fully.  It is with this in mind that I compliment the Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter, on putting in place a mechanism to inquire further into the tragedy.  The report was made public yesterday and the Minister apologised to the families.  The apology does not bring back their loved ones but I hope it is of some small consolation to them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I spoke to my colleague Senator Henry last night and she said two of the C Company soldiers were from Sligo.  She said it was important that closure of the kind in question be achieved.  I appreciate the work of the Minister.  He set up the inquiry last April.  This shows we can make quick progress through inquiries once the political will exists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the actions of the Government on this matter.  As Senator Bradford said, the families in question are from Sligo.  They have waited a long time for closure on this issue.  A former Member of this House, John Minihan, was in Lebanon at the time the soldiers died.  I believe the Captain of the Guard in Leinster House was also serving at the time.  We all welcome the progress on the investigation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following on from what our party leader Senator O&rsquo;Brien said, I ask for an urgent debate on the HSE and the most unusual statement that it appears it is to write off some &euro;6 million in uncollected debts from private health insurance companies.  It is ridiculous in the extreme.  We have seen robust debate in the House, including on the part of Senator Leyden, on the closure of the accident and emergency department in Roscommon and on bed closures in all hospitals throughout the country, particularly in the HSE west area.  In Sligo, some 50 beds are closed.  It seems beyond all comprehension that any Government agency could flippantly write off debt from another arm of the State, namely, VHI, and other insurance companies.  It requires an urgent statement by the Minister for Health, who should come to the House as a matter of the utmost urgency.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on overall responsibility within the Government for answering questions, including issues raised on the Adjournment, despite the best efforts of the Cathaoirleach and Leader of the House to have them answered.  With regard to health issues, under the 2004 health legislation it seems to be the HSE alone that is responsible for answering questions.  Issues pertaining to roads and transportation are solely the responsibility of the NRA.  Ultimately, the people want Members to take responsibility for their actions such that they can have confidence in the political system and know that those they elect to the D&aacute;il and to the Seanad, as councillors or university graduates, are taking responsibility for their actions.  Despite the best efforts of the Cathaoirleach, it is ridiculous in the extreme that officials within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will hide behind legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Senator have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in denying access to information when it is sought on behalf of the public by ourselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is not quite correct.  Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My question to the Leader is simply that we must assert ourselves if we are to be in any way useful as an institution of the State.  If we cannot get answers to questions, there is surely a major problem.  It is not possible for us to invite the chief executive of the NRA to the Chamber and ask a legitimate question on behalf of the people of the north-west region who, in recent years, have seen 29 people killed on this road.  This is completely <Col N="111"/>unacceptable.  If it were on the east coast, an inquiry would have been established to investigate the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have ruled on the matter.  Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on the nation&rsquo;s roads and if the Minister finds he does not have the competence to participate in the debate, perhaps he will send in the CEO of the NRA, for this is the person who seems to be responsible for all of these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Barrett, I revert to the discussion paper published today by the Irish Universities Association in which it is stated there is a need to reassess the points system of entry to college and its impact on learning at second level.  I do not know the seven members of the Irish Universities Association council, but I know the chairman of the working group which produced the report, Tom Collins, a former president of NUI, Maynooth who is now in Bahrain heading the Royal College of Surgeons programme there, and I have the greatest of respect for him.  The report refers to the practice of teaching to the exam.  Everyone who listens to the radio is aware of the number of advertisements for exam papers.  In secondary schools, much time is spent teaching to the exam.  One does not fatten a pig by weighing it every day and one does not teach students by teaching to the exam.  As this type of teaching is becoming too prevalent, as a statement of intent I call on the Leader to request the Minister to ban the use of exam papers as a teaching tool in fifth year and in the first term of sixth year.  We need to do something about teaching to the exam.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from what other speakers have said, it is all very well for the Government to prioritise the upgrading of Waterford Institute of Technology and to give it university status.  I am aware reports commissioned by Waterford Chamber of Commerce and others point to possible benefits if the institute of technology is so upgraded and I know it is part of the programme for Government.  However, it is interesting that it took the job losses at Talk Talk to see this issue suddenly put on the agenda.  I wonder whether issues are being managed at the level of PR more than anything else when we see this quick upgrading of the priority given to the goal of creating a new university in the south east.</P>
        <P>I raise this issue because I wonder whether it is easier to make this type of commitment than it is to deal with the hard questions of the type being asked by the new Provost of Trinity College, Professor Prendergast.  He stated he needs funding and freedom and we need to debate these issues.  Professor Prendergast also stated if there was more flexibility in how university authorities were able to run their colleges, they would be able to become employers and do more to attract students from foreign lands.</P>
        <P>A key issue which the Provost has raised is that of university fees for those who can afford to pay them.  It is easy to make a promise to create a new university, but whether that new university will be capable of delivering the type of opportunities for its region that it might will depend on whether universities have the funding they need to excel.  The Government will have to deal with these harder questions and face up to more difficult issues such as the question of university fees.  Let us have this debate in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join indirectly Senator MacSharry on one of the points he made.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges is reviewing the possibility of inviting leaders of different organisations and State bodies to the House.  With regard to NAMA, yesterday we heard reports of it selling 22 pieces of Irish art in London in Christies or another of the big auction houses.  That is not on.  Our own auction houses are like any other employer in this country in that they are struggling to survive.  Besides the fact that the Irish art in question will <Col N="112"/>be potentially leaving the country for ever &mdash; it is possible that Irish art collectors will go to London to buy them &mdash; it seems another thoughtless thing for NAMA to do.  I would like NAMA to appear before the House in order to scrutinise the way it is doing its business because I find it is completely unacceptable.  Perhaps the Leader could address the issue at some point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  T&aacute; dh&aacute; cheist gur mhaith liom a ard&uacute;.  I gcomhth&eacute;acs an dr&aacute;ma ar fad at&aacute; ann maidir leis na hainmni&uacute;ch&aacute;in do thoghch&aacute;n na hUachtar&aacute;nachta, s&iacute;lim gur ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a bheith againn maidir leis an bpr&oacute;is&eacute;as sin ar fad.  With the drama surrounding the nomination process for the presidential election, it might be timely for us to have a debate on political reform relating to that election in particular and the nomination process.  There are different opinions on that and such a debate would be timely.  The debate should also take into consideration the all-island context in that regard.  For example, recently thousands of Latvians were able to vote in their national election for their president in Newry.  The Government saw fit to appoint Senator Martin McAleese to the Seanad but if he was living in his home town of Belfast, he would not be allowed to vote for the next President of the country.  Such a debate would be timely.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in could bus a few of them down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al.  It is a very important issue.  It would be important to have such a debate while it is still in people&rsquo;s minds and pertinent, in particular in regard to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and the all-island nature of it.</P>
        <P>Reference has been made to bringing in high profile individuals to speak to us in the House.  Perhaps when the nominations close it would be an idea to invite the nominees to the House to give us their vision for the Presidency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">&Aacute;bhar eile gur mhaith liom a ard&uacute; &mdash; agus cuireann s&eacute; an-olc orm &mdash; n&aacute; an cheist at&aacute; ardaithe ag an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Briain.  Is &eacute; sin na h&iacute;oca&iacute;ochta&iacute; seo dos na bainisteoir&iacute; contae.  It is outrageous what we hear again today on the amounts that are being paid to county managers.  The Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, was in the House last week.  He wrung his hands in response to my statement that &euro;400,000 was being cut from the rural transport budget.  He asked where we were to get the money from.  On the other hand we see hundreds of thousands of euro being paid to county managers and others.  It is an example of the Government leaving pensioners waiting for buses while the county managers jump on the gravy train.  It is not good enough.</P>
        <P>We are constantly told that there is not enough money in the country and that there are harsh economic realities.  While the Government wrings its hands when it comes to saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the top civil servants and such types of payments, if there was a political will the payments could and should be stopped.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, should come to the House to explain how the Government can justify making such payments when it is telling ordinary members of the public to tighten their belts and that there is not enough money to give pensioners in rural areas money for buses to bring them to the post office.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am delighted to hear Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh refer to the all-Ireland context and calling for a vote for citizens north of the Border in the presidential election.  Would he be as keen to have people in Donegal voting in Northern Ireland or people in the south of Ireland voting in the Six Counties?  I live in Donegal where the politicians in Derry are of great importance. Democracy is a two-way street but the debate is only one way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>If the debate takes place in the context of an all-Ireland vote for a presidential election, people in Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth should be able to vote in areas that have a direct effect on funding for Northern Ireland.  What happens in Derry and Tyrone impacts on Donegal, while what happens in Newry impacts on Dundalk.  That is why I think it is easy to say we all want a vote.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I take particular umbrage with the Northern Ireland Minister, Conor Murphy, saying that we should change our Constitution.  A Minister from another government is telling us to change our Constitution, but I do not think we would be telling the British to change their laws.  Conor Murphy may have overstepped the line there, so he should withdraw the remark that we should change the Constitution to suit him.  If he wants to vote here, he can register as a voter and live here, but we do not change our laws.  A Minister in another government should not be telling us how the Constitution should be framed.  If the debate takes place, it should be all-inclusive and not one-way traffic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree 100% with my colleague.  It would be great if the citizens of Donegal and other Border counties had a vote in the North of Ireland because, if so, we would have a united Ireland in the morning.  I do not think that Ian Paisley, senior or junior, or any other members of the Democratic Unionist Party would be in favour of that, however.</P>
        <P>I agree that citizens in the North should have a vote in the presidential election.  The idea of appointing a Senator to represent Irish citizens overseas has been debated.  In 2006, the current Taoiseach said he would support such a move but, of course, when the opportunity came with the appointment of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s 11 Senators &mdash; even though they are excellent &mdash; he did not do what he said he would do.</P>
        <P>I wish to congratulate the Dublin GAA football team.  We accept our defeat.  It was a great performance and a great game.</P>

	<P>Yesterday was a historic day when our T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade presented the first certificate of Irish heritage in New York to the family of Joe Hunter who was in squad 288 of the New York Fire Department.  Joe&rsquo;s mother had to receive it on his behalf because, along with many members of his squad, he was killed ten years ago, on 11 September 2001, at the age of 31.  It was fitting that the T&aacute;naiste would give the award to someone in the fire department who gave his life in the service of others.</P><Col N="114"/>
        <P>Joe Hunter represented some 70 million people of Irish descent living abroad, including 40 million Irish Americans who have contributed so much to their adopted country, as well as to Ireland.  I wish to pay tribute to Ray Bassett who, in 2009, worked alongside me to ensure that the certificate scheme came to fruition.  It shows the great work of our public servants when the strategic review, which was written by Ambassador Collins and included the proposal for a certificate, made it all the way to New York.  Bridget Hunter, Joe&rsquo;s mother, said she was very proud to be the first recipient of the first certificate of Irish heritage.  It is a great day for the country to start recognising the millions of people who have contributed so much to Ireland from their adopted countries.</P>

	<P>The Government has established the JobBridge programme, which is a welcome development.  Recently, I was contacted by someone who is running a community hospital.  They are prepared to provide training to people who want to work as carers in the community.  They have set up a training scheme within the community hospital, which is not taking jobs away from anyone.  They have more than adequate staff in that hospital, but they have now been told that they cannot take on people under the JobBridge programme.  A huge opportunity is being lost as a result.  It was an opportunity to train people who want to work in the community.  There is an urgent need for trained carers to help elderly people who want to remain in their own homes.  We do not have an adequate number of people with the required qualifications and experience.  The community hospital was prepared to provide that training and experience.</P>
        <P>There have been cuts across a number of Departments such as in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, in which Deputy Richard Bruton is Minister, the Department of Social Protection, under the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, and the Department of Health.  I ask the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Ministers concerned.  The regulations should be amended to accommodate this initiative as developed by a community hospital, where a very good programme has been put in place in order to provide training and experience.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to see that the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has set up a telephone appliance which highlights the hospital trolley crisis.  The reference for it is <i>m.ino.ie/trolley.htm</i>.  As someone from the north east, I find it disappointing to see Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda topping the list with 46 patients on trolleys today.  It is the case that not all major hospitals have significant numbers of patients on trolleys.  I ask for a debate on this issue because I am not convinced it is entirely an issue of capacity.  In some cases it seems to be maladministration.  I refer to the case of a person who was referred by her GP to an accident and emergency department for a routine procedure and was informed she would have to stay overnight to await the procedure the following morning.  I ask why that person could not have been called back the next day and this would have allowed a person on a trolley to avail of a bed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Provost of Trinity College, Professor Prendergast, gave a very impressive speech yesterday.  I concur with Senators Mullen, Barrett and Bacik that we need to have a major debate on the third level sector and this subject will be discussed today.  Senator Barrett has warned we should tread very carefully with regard to the points system.  I was a student representative member of the committee of the law school when I was a law student.  It may well be the same today but at the time the academic members were aghast at the prospect of the pressure being applied to admit students who had not qualified in particular areas.  At that time they much preferred the points system, which is a fair system.</P><Col N="115"/>
       <P Just="Left">We need to look at the exam system to see how the exams can be made fair and balanced.  I am not sure what effort is expended on school exams.  For instance, in America, a whole science is devoted to ensuring consistency in school exams from one year to another.  The Provost, Professor Prendergast, is correct in that Trinity College is a world-class institution and it must be given the freedom to compete internationally on the basis that it will contribute to the country through the education it provides and businesses that are created as a result of its innovative research.  UCD and other colleges are also very high in the rankings.</P>
         <P>The JobBridge scheme is another example of money being given to multinational companies on the backs of pensioners.  Tesco has advertised for shelf-packing staff and the JobBridge website lists waiting staff vacancies.  These are not the type of skills the Government should be funding because such skills can be funded by an employer who can provide the appropriate training.  We need to up-skill the workforce for jobs in the future, not just train people for jobs already in existence.</P>
        <P>I note that people from Glen Dimplex are members of the Government&rsquo;s advisory board.  They are very welcome and such companies are giving very good internships to students.  However, some members of the board of JobBridge are political appointments and I fear they are not offering sufficient criticism of the Government.  I have heard some of these members standing up for the Government all the time when speaking on the radio.  This is the wrong attitude if something is not working properly.  They should stop defending the process.  There is a serious problem when Tesco can look for shelf-stackers and be provided with &euro;50 a week for each such job provided.  We should concentrate on up-skilling the workforce in order to market the country and to attract people who will provide jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am alarmed at the speculation that &euro;6 million is being written off by HSE West.  I dealt with a case recently where a relatively old person was hounded by a certain hospital to pay &euro;100 for presenting at the accident and emergency department.  That &euro;100 was not written off; it was paid by a charity on behalf of the old lady.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like the Minister for Health to appoint a senior official from his Department to carry out an immediate investigation into what exactly is happening with this &euro;6 million in HSE West.  The inspector might also look at the various other elements of the HSE to see how much has been written off as a result of the debts of private health care.     What is wrong with health care here is that we have a two-tier health service that needs to end.  It is appalling and reprehensible that this is going on.  Perhaps the inspector will also establish how many retired officials from the HSE are now working in private health insurance.  That would be a very interesting exercise.  Will the Leader establish that through the Minister for Health on our behalf?</P>
        <P>I agree with other Senators who spoke about political reform and reform of the nomination process for the Presidency.  What progress has been made in terms of the constitutional convention on political reform in this country?  What has happened in the past number of weeks in regard to the presidential election makes it clear that the whole system needs to be reformed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Comptroller and Auditor General has issued his report and, as usual, it is getting a fair amount of airing in the newspapers.  It will also go before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on that important document?  I have always felt that while the comptroller will identify places where money was wasted in the order of perhaps tentative millions, based on my business experience there is no doubt that no matter how tightly one runs a company, waste will accumulate.  The bigger the organisation, the bigger the waste.  There is probably at least a couple of billion to be saved.</P>
        <P>This can be done painlessly by honing in on areas where we could effect economies and efficiencies by making people who are quite well paid in the public service, both in middle and <Col N="116"/>higher management, accountable and charging them with getting savings across the board of something in the order of 10% on current public expenditure.  Then we should send in a task force and where people are found wanting for failing to do the job with regard to cost efficiencies, their career and continuing employment should be in question.  That is the way it works in the private sector and there is no reason it should not work in the public sector.  Incentive schemes should also be in place to hone in on this issue.  A debate is merited.</P>
         <P>I welcome the fact that a move is being made towards a university in the south east.  When a previous Government decided to enhance the regional college in Waterford to institute of technology status, unfortunately, everybody else got on the band wagon.  On all economic indicators the south east lags behind other regions.  It has high unemployment and a low industrial base.  We need to try to ensure that the infrastructure is in place in the south east so that people living in that region can have some prospects of securing employment there.</P>
        <P>Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht go c&uacute;ramach leis an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh agus an Seanad&oacute;ir Harte agus n&iacute;lim i gcoinne aon rud a chuala m&eacute; uathu.

	<P Just="Left">Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Would the Leader consider having a debate on how, perhaps, the Seanad election could be extended on an all-island basis?  I know from talking over a decade ago to colleagues who were elected members of the Unionist fraternity in Northern Ireland that they would countenance participating in this Chamber if there were sufficient numbers to prevent them being isolated within their communities.  That would be a good democratic way of enhancing and progressing on an all-island basis the peace process.  It would also enhance the deliberations and prospect of all people on this island of having a voice in this Chamber.  I urge the Leader to ensure this is something that is looked at.  Perhaps people from here could then, on a reciprocal basis, participate in selected debates within the Northern Ireland Assembly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While acknowledging the work that the Revenue Commissioners do, I have been contacted recently with regard to the anecdotal evidence.  The banking fraternity has taken direction from the Minister for Finance regarding its dealings with businesses and people in debt.  Hence there are longer timeframes for repayment, restructuring is an option and people are able to retain their homes and businesses, yet Revenue&rsquo;s approach seems to be very much confrontational.  There is no give or ease in the organisation&rsquo;s approach.  Banks are engaging with people and if Revenue adopted a similar approach to ensure people remain in business and gave them an opportunity by providing more time to pay and so on, they will pay.</P>
        <P>We are in different and difficult times and if the Revenue Commissioners endorsed a different approach, businesses and jobs would be retained.  If people can keep their businesses going, they will pay their dues at some stage but if they are put out of business, those dues will never be paid and more people will be on the live register.  Would it be possible for the Leader to invite the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners to the House or could a direction be sent to the organisation to give people in business every opportunity?  They have to pay and they will pay if they are allowed to remain in business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I refer to the baffling news that HSE West is about to write off approximately &euro;6 million because consultants employed within the health service did not take the opportunity to fill in and submit the appropriate paperwork to private insurance firms.  This <Col N="117"/>merits a serious investigation and I hope the Committee of Public Accounts will investigate this matter.  If &euro;6 million has to be written off in the HSE West area alone, how much will be written off for the entire country?  I would like to know.  It is disgraceful that this should be allowed to happen when, on the other hand, the HSE, the Minister and the new Government are allowing hospitals to close and facilities to be withdrawn from patients.  The Minister is presiding over a Department that has closed X-ray units in two community units in my constituency this week, namely, Killybegs Community Hospital and Donegal Community Hospital.  Over the summer, the service was reduced from two days to one day per week and it has now been withdrawn, which is wholly unacceptable.  The Minister must come to the House and the officials responsible must be brought before the Committee of Public Accounts for questioning and to be held to account.  It is not good enough that the taxpayer would be asked to pay for the failings of HSE officials or consultants.</P>
         <P>The second issue I wish to raise is the report compiled by the Government on Garda stations.  According to the report, 24 stations in County Donegal are earmarked for closure.  The Minister for Justice and Equality needs to come to the House to explain the political motivation behind the report and the rationale behind the decision of the Minister and the Government to request superintendents to examine stations within their jurisdictions that could be closed.  This is unacceptable, particularly given the increase in crime since the onset of the recession.  I hope the Leader will invite the Ministers for Health and Justice and Equality to come to the House as soon as possible to discuss these two emerging issues of national importance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I join previous speakers in congratulating everybody involved in our successful sporting weekend, including the wonderful achievement of our Rugby World Cup heroes on Saturday morning.</P>
        <P>I share the concerns expressed by colleagues regarding the reported Health Service Executive write-off.  I am aware that many consultants are disputing the fact that they are the cause of the hospitals&rsquo; ability to claim the moneys but we must find out what is the exact position.  I ask the Leader to organise, if at all possible, a question and answer session with the Minister, Deputy Reilly, at the earliest opportunity because there are a number of issues we all want to discuss with him.  We have seen from previous visits here by Ministers that the question and answer type format works particularly well and we should develop that further in this session.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to another important event taking place, the National Ploughing Championships 2011, in Athy.  Agriculture is one of the bright spots on our horizon and it is encouraging to see Teagasc issue a statement this morning to the effect that many additional places are being made available in agricultural colleges.  It is encouraging to see so many young people interested in getting involved in agriculture and agri-business.  If we are to dig ourselves out of this recession, agriculture will play a major part in the revival of our economy.  Most farmers would admit that all sectors of agriculture are doing well and let us hope that we can continue to build on that.  Having seen our Minister here in the Seanad some weeks ago we would have confidence that we have a good man driving agriculture forward into the future.  I wish the ploughing championships well today and I wish our Minister well in the difficult and protracted negotiations he will have in the coming months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like Senator Mullins, I was thrilled by the result of the match and I send my congratulations with the rest of the House.  Rugby is like politics.  Dublin was ahead by one point at half time.  I thought we had the psychological advantage and then Kerry got a goal and it went to the wire.  That is exactly like politics.  That is the kind of politics I am experiencing at the moment but the Senator stole my thunder when he mentioned the ploughing championships.  The Cathaoirleach knows my devotion to this House.  There is only one <Col N="118"/>other place I wanted to be today and that was down there in Athy.  I would like to shake the hand of Anna May McHugh, an extraordinary woman.</P>
        <P>I used to go to the Spring Show.  It has been completely eclipsed &mdash; in fact, I think it is gone; they only have the Dublin Horse Show &mdash; but it is so important, and I speak as the grandson of a farmer from Laois.  The fact is that incomes for farmers have gone up 30% in the past year, and thank God for that.  I remember them when they were outside this House and they were suffering decreases in their income.  Thank God that we are seeing young people coming back into rural employment.  I ask the Leader for a debate on the positive aspects of this because we also have the food industry.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Brien and several other Members raised the question of the &euro;6 million waived by HSE West for private health insurers.  I am sure it is a matter that will be investigated by the Minister and certainly by the Committee of Public Accounts because it is appalling that such amounts can be waived for private health insurers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On senior civil servants and county managers, I am aware that recent payments to retiring civil servants have been on the basis of their career long contractual agreements and arrangements.  Substantially increased pay rates were a feature of the previous Government.  Benchmarking was introduced without any significant reform and, as such, the Government has inherited these arrangements.  However, it has indicated it is committed to overhauling public service pensions.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, is currently reviewing the Top Level Appointments Commission, the terms for the new appointees and particularly severance payments.</P>
        <P>We would all like to congratulate the Dublin footballers and our rugby team on wonderful victories.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator Bacik spoke of a &ldquo;blue day&rdquo; following the victory of the blues.  Blue Day tomorrow is a serious matter dealing with men&rsquo;s cancers.  I am sure we will all wear some blue item.</P><P Just="Left">A number of Members referred to Trinity College being in the top 50 universities of the world and the statement from the heads of universities.  There is also the question of the points system.  Senator Barrett mentioned the statement in the names of the seven heads of the universities, which is not totally representative of everybody else involved in the system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bradford spoke about the number of soldiers killed while on UN duty.  That matter has been ongoing for some time and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, acted by calling for an inquiry last April.  Both he and the Army Chief of Staff apologised to the families, which was welcomed by them.  The families have waited a long time for justice and truth to come in the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator MacSharry spoke about the National Roads Authority.  I am sure that any question tabled for the authority&rsquo;s chief executive will receive a reply dealing with the roads in question.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator D'Arcy also spoke about universities, teaching and exams, outlining reservations in that regard.  Senator Mullen and others spoke about upgrading Waterford Institute of Technology to university status.  That is not a promise made just now but it is on the agenda of the programme for Government.

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The criteria for the technological university are being worked on with the Higher Education Authority.  The promise of a university for Waterford has been ongoing for the past 20 years, with promise after promise received from previous Governments.  I hope it will be acted upon as a matter of urgency, as the Government has now stated.  The measure is long overdue.  As Senator Walsh has indicated, the south east is the poorest and most under-performing region in the country, with almost 18% unemployment.  Waterford city has 20% unemployment and together these are the highest rates in the State.  It is about time the people of the south east and Waterford get some share of the cake.  By all means we should have a level playing field for universities, which should be able to compete for money, but some bodies should not try to prevent other institutions from elevating to a higher status.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Noone spoke about NAMA, whose representatives have been before the finance committee.  I am sure they can be returned before the committee to answer further questions in that regard.  The matter may also be raised with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who will be here to make a statement and take questions on 6 October.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh called for a debate on the Presidency.  I do not think it is an appropriate time to have such a debate as we will have a campaign in full swing within a week or so.  On the same subject, Senator Harte referred to voting rights for people in Donegal and the Twenty-six Counties, saying that people should have votes in Northern Ireland.  Any changes in the Constitution will be decided by the people &mdash; the people in the Twenty-six Counties, the people who will pay their taxes here.  They will be the ones who will decide on any constitutional amendment.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly praised the firefighters, and we all agree with him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Colm Burke referred to the JobBridge programme and the need to tweak the criteria and regulations in that regard.  I agree with Senator Byrne that the object should be to up-skill the workforce.  I am sure that any tweaking of the criteria that is required will be done as the scheme goes on.  Senator Byrne also mentioned Trolley Watch and the fact that we can now get it on the apps system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Conway referred to the HSE write-off and the number of retired staff who hold positions in private insurance companies.  I do not know whether that information is available, but I will certainly raise the issue with the Minister.  On the call for an update on the constitutional convention, as the Senator knows, we will be having two referenda along with the presidential election, but I will ascertain from the Government the progress made on the constitutional convention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Walsh referred to WIT and said that the Seanad election could be held on an all-party basis.  Again, it is a question of waiting until after the referendum on the future of the Seanad, when the people will decide.  If they decide in the affirmative, that it should stay, we can discuss the item at that point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Sheahan referred to the Revenue Commissioners and the difficulties for small businesses. Everyone can empathise with people in small businesses and the difficulties they have not only with the Revenue Commissioners, but with banks and others.  Their backs are certainly to the wall.</P><Col N="120"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Donnell referred to the problem with the HSE and the withdrawal of some services from community hospitals, and also the proposed closure of Garda stations.  We will try to get the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice and Equality in to discuss these matters in early course.  Senator Mullins also called for a debate and question and answer session with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and I am doing my best to facilitate it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am sure we all wish those involved in the National Ploughing Championships well.  Agriculture is certainly of paramount importance to the economy and I am delighted to hear that more places will be made available in our agricultural colleges.  I thought we were going to get a commentary on the match from Senator Norris.  It was like the presidential election campaign, with people scoring and not scoring and so on.  However, we all welcome his comments on agriculture and wish everyone involved in the National Ploughing Championships every success in the next few days.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to bring the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill 2011 before the House.  The main purpose of the Bill is to amalgamate the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, known as HETAC, and the Further Education and Training Awards Council, known as FETAC.  The new agency will also take on responsibility for the external quality assurance of universities, which is currently carried out by the Irish Universities Quality Board.  Before outlining why I am proposing the reforms set out in the Bill, I want to give a short explanation of the nature and functions of the agencies that will be amalgamated.  I will also touch on some of the important work they have undertaken, much of which has prepared the path for amalgamation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The NQAI, HETAC and FETAC were established in 2001 under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999.  The core role of the NQAI is to establish and maintain a national framework of qualifications, which is a critical support for lifelong learning.  The National Framework of Qualifications, the NFQ, was launched in 2003.  It is a system of ten levels that incorporates awards made for all kinds of learning, wherever it is gained.  Awards <Col N="121"/>made in Ireland by national awarding bodies, from basic literacy awards up to doctoral degrees, have been included in the framework and it also provides the basis for recognising international qualifications.  The NQAI promotes access, transfer and progression opportunities for learners across the education and training system, consistent with the overall aims of the framework.  It facilitates the recognition of Irish qualifications internationally and the recognition of international qualifications in Ireland.  The NQAI does this at a systematic level through European and broader international agreements, but also at an individual level through its qualifications recognition service.  It agrees and reviews the quality assurance arrangements of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  More recently, it took over responsibility for the Advisory Council for English Language Schools, which inspects and quality assures English language schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">FETAC and HETAC make awards to more than 200,000 learners annually. Earlier today, I awarded 25 level five FETAC awards.  Their awards are made in the further and non-university higher education and training sectors.  They also agree and review providers&rsquo; quality assurance arrangements and validate their programmes of education and training.  They provide services for providers such as the VECs, F&Aacute;S, community training and education centres, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Teagasc, the institutes of technology and private further and higher education and training institutions.  HETAC and FETAC have developed standards for awards in a wide range of disciplines.  A large number of individual programmes of education and training offered by a broad spectrum of public and private providers have been validated and quality assured.  Through their systems of major, minor, supplemental and special purpose awards, the award councils and providers are at the forefront of efforts to offer flexible and responsive learning pathways.</P>
        <P>The Irish Universities Quality Board was established in 2003 by the seven universities to externally review their quality assurance activities and to support quality enhancement.  The IUQB has developed a detailed quality review process and has completed a full cycle of reviews.  A second cycle is under way.</P>
        <P>Before the agencies were established, there was little shared understanding of how the various awards in the State related to one another and approaches to quality were uneven and unsystematic.  The relationship between university awards and those awarded elsewhere in higher education was sometimes unclear, while in further education and training, more than 50 awards bodies were operating.  The four agencies have made major progress in bringing coherence and consistency to Irish qualifications, in developing awards standards, in providing quality assurance to educational providers and programmes and in facilitating progression opportunities for learners.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will now outline the rationale for the amalgamation.  Our economic recovery will be driven by how we develop and use the knowledge, skills and creativity of our people.  We must ensure that we cater for the needs of all learners, including those coming into further and higher education straight from school, those undertaking research in our universities, those looking to retrain and reskill following a period of unemployment and those seeking to supplement the skills they have developed in the workplace.  Senators will be aware of the structural reforms under way in the provision of higher and further education and training, in particular through the implementation of key recommendations of the Hunt report and the establishment of SOLAS.  However, it is also vital that we have fair and responsive ways of enabling learners to access and move between programmes and institutions, that learners can be assured of a quality experience in those institutions and that the qualifications our learners receive enjoy wide recognition and respect.</P><Col N="122"/>
        <P>All of the agencies being amalgamated have made major progress in these areas.  The national framework of qualifications has matured and qualifications and quality assurance systems have been established in the various sectors.  The linkages from the framework to progression and access policies and onwards to awarding and quality assurance are now such that four separate bodies operating in this area is no longer the best organisational response.  Progress can now be most efficiently and effectively achieved through the establishment of a strong single organisation prioritising the needs of learners and delivering quality service to providers.  The amalgamation of agencies is also a key part of the Government&rsquo;s overall public sector reform agenda and the establishment of the authority will result in cost savings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The NQAI, HETAC and FETAC have already delivered significant savings through implementation of the moratorium and through expenditure reduction across their range of activities.  The bodies&rsquo; collective Exchequer allocation for current expenditure in 2011 of almost &euro;9 million is approximately 30% lower than outturn in 2008.  Further savings will be achieved through rationalised corporate structures and supports and through integration of services.  Overall, the establishment of the amalgamated agency will save money, deliver a more efficient and integrated service, uphold quality and standards in our qualifications and institutions and will bring a strong focus to creating flexible pathways for learners at all stages.  The Bill sets out the overall structure of the amalgamated organisation and provides for its functions in the areas of quality assurance of education and training providers, maintaining the national framework of qualifications, approving programmes for education and training, making awards to learners and delegating authority to institutions to make awards, procedures for learners to access programmes of education and training and to transfer and progress between programmes, developing a code of practice for institutions, enrolling international learners and awarding an international education mark to qualifying institutions and protecting learners in the event of the closure of an institution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill repeals the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999, under which HETAC, FETAC and the NQAI were established.  Provisions on board composition and corporate governance have been revised and updated from the 1999 Act and the functions of the existing agencies have been consolidated.  The statutory basis for the relationship of the new agency with various classes of provider and other stakeholders has been clarified and updated and the opportunity has been taken to address issues arising from the implementation of the 1999 legislation since its enactment.  New provisions on the regulation of providers offering education and training services to international students have been included.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new amalgamated agency&rsquo;s official title will be the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland,  QQAAI.  However, the Bill allows the Minister for Education and Skills to assign a different name to the authority for operational purposes.  This is similar to the arrangement where the National Tourism Development Authority is known as F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  It should be noted that administrative preparations for amalgamation are advancing under the co-ordination of an interim board of the QQAAI, comprising the chairpersons of the NQAI, HETAC, FETAC and the IUQB.  Work is being overseen by the CEO designate of the QQAAI, who was appointed in October 2010.  The CEO designate is now also CEO of all four existing bodies following the retirement on completion of contract or voluntary resignation of serving CEOs.  Progressing this work will enable the early establishment of the amalgamated agency following enactment of this legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill for the benefit of the House.  The Bill is set out in ten Parts and contains 80 sections.  Part 1 of the Bill is entitled &ldquo;Preliminary and General&rdquo; and covers the first six sections.  These sections include provisions on citation and commencement, on the making of regulations, on repeals and on expenses incurred in the administration <Col N="123"/>of the Bill.  Section 2 defines the key terms used in the Bill and sets out the different categories of education and training providers to whom it applies.  A wide range of education and training providers are covered by the provisions of the Bill, including existing universities and their linked providers, including colleges of education; new universities established under section 9 of the Universities Act 1997, of which it should be noted there are currently none; the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland who, like universities, have their own awarding powers; recognised colleges of the National University of Ireland; providers whose programmes are validated by the authority and lead to awards of the authority such as the VECs, F&Aacute;S and private providers; providers who have delegated authority to make awards &mdash; it should be noted that only institutes of technology currently have this authority &mdash; and providers who apply to be granted the international education mark for provision of education for international learners.  It should be noted that structural changes in the provision of further and higher education and training, such as the establishment of technological universities and the foundation of SOLAS, will be implemented through separate legislation.  The overall quality and awarding framework set out in this Bill can be readily applied to any new structures emerging.</P>
       <P Just="Left">Part 2 of the Bill is entitled &ldquo;Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland&rdquo; and covers sections 7 to 25.  Schedule 1 of the Bill is also associated with this Part.  This Part deals with the establishment and corporate structure of the amalgamated body and also sets out the body&rsquo;s overall functions.  The board of the authority will have eight members, including the CEO, and will be directly appointed by the Minister for Education and Skills.  Unlike its predecessor bodies, there is no provision for nominations from stakeholder organisations to the board of the QQAAI.  Given the relationships the QQAAI will have with organisations throughout education and training, I believe the stakeholder nomination model would have resulted in a board too large to be fit for purpose.  The body will consult widely in the performance of its functions and does not require all stakeholders to be represented in its governance structures.  Board members must have expertise in, and experience of, matters related to the functions of the authority.  At least one member will be representative of learners and one will have international experience.  The Minister may from time to time review the operation of the authority.</P>
        <P>Part 3 of the Bill is entitled &ldquo;Quality Assurance&rdquo; and covers sections 26 to 37.  This Part sets out how providers must establish and implement quality assurance procedures to cover the provision of education and training and related services and have them approved by the authority, which will also periodically review their effectiveness.  The core provisions, although much more detailed, are similar to those in the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999 and the Universities Act 1997.  There are, however, some significant changes.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Bill extend to a greater number of providers than previously.  For the first time, there is provision for the establishment of quality assurance procedures by linked providers of universities, such as colleges of education, and by recognised colleges of the National University of Ireland.  The Bill also makes statutory provision for the external review of the effectiveness of the quality assurance procedures of universities.  This was being done by the Irish Universities Quality Board but under delegated power from the universities themselves.  Acknowledging the greater autonomy that universities traditionally enjoy here in Ireland and internationally, the authority will not have a specific approval role for the quality assurance procedures of universities.  However, universities must implement the authority&rsquo;s directions following a review.</P>
        <P>The Bill explicitly provides that the authority can withdraw its approval of the quality assurance arrangements of providers and that, in those circumstances, validation of all programmes is automatically withdrawn and awarding arrangements terminated.  It clearly places the overarching quality assurance agreement at the heart of the authority&rsquo;s relationship with providers. <Col N="124"/> Furthermore, the Bill empowers the authority to undertake quality reviews at a cross-institutional level.  This could include reviews of a particular subject or award type or reviews of provision on a regional basis.</P>
        <P>Part 4 of the Bill is entitled &ldquo;Standards and Awards&rdquo; and covers sections 38 to 53.  This Part sets out the provisions regarding the national framework of qualifications and the making of awards by the authority.  It enables the authority to determine the standards of knowledge, skill or competence to be acquired by a learner before an award is made.  The Part sets out the procedures whereby providers may apply to the authority to have a programme of education and training validated.  It also provides for the delegation of authority to make awards.  Awarding power is currently only delegated to institutes of technology but the Bill enables delegation to a wider set of providers subject to certain conditions being met and a review being undertaken.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that procedures for access, transfer and progression must be developed by providers.  These cover how learners can access programmes and move between them in flexible ways, while receiving recognition for their learning already achieved.</P>
        <P>In a change from the provisions of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999, public providers who do not have their own awarding power will be permitted to enter into award-making arrangements with an awarding body other than the authority.  This will give providers access to a wider and evolving range of awards.  The awards made must be recognised through the national framework of qualifications which means that they are quality-assured and that progression opportunities are understood.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 5 of the Bill is entitled &ldquo;Code of Practice and International Education Mark&rdquo; and covers sections 54 to 57.  This Part sets out the arrangements for providers of programmes for international learners.  The authority will develop a code of practice for providing education for international learners.  Providers will be able to apply for the international education mark based on their compliance with the code of practice.  This code will be based on strong requirements around academic quality and cover such issues as the treatment of fees and support services for international students.  The code of practice and international education mark are core elements of Investing in Global Relationships, Ireland&rsquo;s international education strategy.  They will be important supports in enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s international education offering, assuring international learners of a high quality educational experience in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 6 of the Bill is entitled &ldquo;Protection of Enrolled Learners&rdquo; and covers sections 58 to 61.  This Part sets out the arrangements that providers which offer programmes leading to awards of the authority must have in place for the protection of learners in the event of the provider ceasing trading.  The arrangements must be put in place where a programme is of at least three months duration and can be an agreement between the provider and two other providers to allow learners to transfer to a similar programme or, where this is not possible, arrangements for the refund of moneys paid.  These arrangements are unchanged from the provision of the 1999 Act but extend to a wider set of providers.  The arrangements do not apply to certain providers, generally those publicly funded, including universities, institutes of technology, F&Aacute;S, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Teagasc, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, VECs and recognised schools.</P>
        <P>Part 7 is entitled &ldquo;Appeals&rdquo; and covers sections 62 to 64.  This Part provides for a process to be put in place to enable appeals against a range of decisions of the authority.  Appeals will be determined by an appeals panel under published procedures.  The appeals panel will be appointed by the Minister for Education and Skills and will consist of at least ten people with a special interest or expertise in, or knowledge of, the functions of the authority.</P><Col N="125"/>
        <P Just="Left">Part 8 is entitled &ldquo;Dissolution of Bodies&rdquo; and covers sections 65 to 71.  This Part provides for the dissolution of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, NQAI, the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC.  Any reference to those bodies in a legal document will now be construed as a reference to the new authority.  Any claim or legal proceedings by or against a dissolved body will lie with the new authority.  All property, assets and records of each of the dissolved bodies will transfer to the new authority.</P>
        <P>Part 9 is entitled &ldquo;Miscellaneous Provisions&rdquo; and covers sections 72 to 77.  This Part sets out miscellaneous provisions such as the maintenance of a register of providers and a database, fees that the authority may charge, provisions regarding institutes of technology and service of documents.</P>
        <P>Part 10 is entitled &ldquo;Transitional and Savings Provisions for Act of 1999, Amendments of other Acts&rdquo; and covers sections 78 to 80.  This Part, together with Schedule 3, provides for transitional and savings provision for the Qualifications Act 1999 and for amendments of other Acts.  This allows for the continuation of certain policies and criteria under the 1999 Act until such time as the authority adopts new procedures.</P>
        <P>These provisions cover such matters as agreed quality assurance procedures, reviews, policies and criteria for validation of programme and applications for validation, awards by a dissolved body to be an award of the authority, policies and criteria standards for awards, policies and criteria for making of awards, delegation of authority and NQAI procedures for access, transfer and progression and charters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are 3 Schedules to the Bill. Schedule 1 deals with the particulars of membership and meetings of the authority.  Schedule 2 lists Acts repealed and statutory instruments revoked.  Section 35 of the Universities Act, which deals with quality assurance, is to be repealed, together with the entire Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999.  Schedule 3 lists amendments to other Acts.  There are 16 such amendments in total.</P>
        <P>This Bill is an important step in maintaining and improving standards in education and training for all learners, including those who choose to come to Ireland from overseas.  I hope that Senators will agree that at a time of increasing diversity of demand and in challenging economic conditions, this is important legislation.  I look forward to listening to the views of Senators today and to further debate as the Bill progresses through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill.  In fact, it is delivering on a commitment we set out in government to amalgamate the various qualifications and quality assurance <Col N="126"/>bodies.  It has the potential to be a hugely positive development for many of the reasons the Minister set out in his opening address and it will make it possible to pool the experiences and expertise the various bodies have built up.  Generally, they have done a very good job and have developed and become much more successful in recent years.  It will enable them to deliver plans more effectively across the whole sector, which is crucial, from further education up to higher education.</P>
      
        <P>It will be easier for providers to have to deal with only one body.  We have had experience of the complications that can arise when institutions have to deal with more than one body.  Also, establishment of the authority should simplify procedures and make them more effective in terms of enabling progression across the system.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Continuous improvement of the education system and of the quality of education is of huge economic and social importance.  This legislation has the potential to assist in that regard.  Rather than repeat all of the excellent points made by the Minister in his address, I will focus on a number of areas which it is hoped will be a priority for the Minister and authority.  Ultimately, quality assurance is about the student experience and ensuring students have the best possible experience of education.  The procedures in place for quality assurance should reflect this.  It is important that students&rsquo; voices and feedback are heard at all levels.  In every institution and on every course where quality is being considered, there should be student representatives.  I am a former student representative having served while in Trinity as education officer and president on the academic council and board.  It is important to ensure there is more than one student representative.  Often, a student representative can find himself or herself the only student in the room, which is a difficult position to be in.  It is important to ensure the right procedures are followed in choosing students for such panels.  Students should not be selected because they might be helpful and so on.  Those chosen should be vocal and confident and not intimidated by the fact they might be sitting on a course review with lecturers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important also to ensure student representatives have the training and supports they need.  There has been a gap in this respect in the past.  I know that the Union of Students in Ireland has made a proposal to the Minister in regard to the Scottish system.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on that or whether there are other effective arrangements that could be put in place to ensure training and basic supports such as briefing material and so on are provided in order that the students know what their role is, what they are empowered to do, where they can get advice and so on, all of which is important.</P>
        <P>I welcome that there will be a student representative on the authority and that the student will be representative of students rather than from a stakeholder body.  That is important.  I ask that the Minister ensure that students are empowered at all levels.  While some institutions have been good at this it is remarkable that while some universities have a number of students on their boards others have only one and that while some universities recognise student unions others do not.  Also, some institutions have good procedures for involving students on quality assurance and view it as a positive, which is how it should be viewed.  Partnership with learners is the best way to improve.  It is in every institution&rsquo;s interest to improve.  We learned from the recent university ranking that the quality of the student experience is valued internationally.  It is important that the new authority also focus on that issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important the right balance between internal and external review is achieved.  I know that the authority&rsquo;s main role will be external quality assurance.  As the Minister correctly stated, the universities have good internal procedures.  The main role of the authority will be to support self-evaluation, of which we do not have enough at all levels of the education system.  Self-evaluation is crucial.  Empowering leadership in institutions at course, departmental and <Col N="127"/>faculty levels and giving people the tools they require to do the job rather than leave them constantly worrying what an external body might say about them is also important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to the fact that access, transfer and progression will be key part of the remit of the new authority.  Merging the agencies should help in this regard.  There is no doubt but that the new framework of qualifications promoted by the previous Government has helped and progression has opened up somewhat.  However, we still have a long way to go.  I welcome that the new authority will publish procedures for setting out progression pathways.I ask that that be prioritised.  That should be one of the first matters to which theauthority attends.  It is important people, in particular those who did not have a first chance opportunity to go through the whole education system, have a clear path to progression, be it from their local further education college to Trinity.  The procedures for doing so should be obvious.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister also spoke about the international reputation of the education system.  I welcome that the authority will encourage providers to provide for an international education mark based on their compliance with the code of conduct.  Our colleges are not alone ambassadors for the education system but for the country as a whole and when things go wrong or problems arise our reputation as a whole can be damaged.   Perhaps the Minister will say if he has had discussions with the Minister for Justice and Equality and other Ministers in regard to link-in in terms of the education mark and student visas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fianna F&aacute;il supports the legislation, which pretty much does what it states.  I am concerned in the main about the strategies the authority will put in place.  I must emphasise that the student experience is a crucial part of this and as such, thinking in respect of the new authority should start with the learner at the centre and work out from there.  Fianna F&aacute;il will be tabling a number of technical amendments on Committee Stage.  The Minister may have received the communication also received by other Members from City &amp; Guilds in regard to a number of definitional issues, which appear reasonable to me.  It is in respect of those issues that we propose to table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire ar ais chuig an Seanad.  T&aacute; s&eacute; iontach maith teacht isteach anseo agus molaim &eacute; as sin.  Ba mhaith liom freisin, mar aon leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Power, f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an mBille seo, not least because for the first time it brings the universities into the same orbit as other third level and further education institutions.  It is also cost effective in that it amalgamates a number of quality assurance authorities.  However, the most important feature of this Bill is that it will ensure that our qualifications and quality assurance system is in line with best practice internationally in that it allows for external peer review and will thus give a high recognition and value internationally to our awards.  This is important for a number of reasons, two of which I will outline.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe this will improve our local students&rsquo; chances in the international jobs market.  As a member of the board of governors of DKIT for the past eight years, I am keenly aware of the need for strong international value and recognition of our awards.  I believe this legislation will assist in that regard.  There are a large number of overseas students studying in our third level institutions.  There were 96,000 foreign students &mdash; not all at third level &mdash; studying in Ireland last year, which is a phenomenal number of people.  I do not believe people are aware of that.  Also, students who come here for summer, autumn or winter courses often return as full-time university or institute students.  As well as being prestigious it is very lucrative to the State that we have international recognition of our awards and a strong authority to determine the quality of those awards.  It appears to be difficult for prospective students from India and Nepal to gain entry into our third level institutions compared to Chinese students.  We have a success rate of more than 90% from India and Nepal but even where they have bank statements and <Col N="128"/>have lodged money into the third level institution, the entry level is very low at 29%.  I will not judge why the Embassy does not grant the visa.  I ask the Minister to look at this particularly in view of the fact that an Indian firm, HLC Technologies, has announced plans today to create 80 jobs in Dublin during the next three years.  We must develop and improve those links with India and Nepal.</P>
        <P>The Minister said he would welcome the views of Senators. It is not usual for the awarding authority to be the quality assurance authority in other countries.  It is highly unusual where we have delegated authority to the institutions.  Could that issue be looked at again?  Some colleges might suggest that they make the award like the universities and that the quality assurance authority oversee the quality rigorously.  I am not making any further suggestion other than to say that because it is the practice in other countries that the two authorities are separate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new authority will also be responsible for the quality of teaching and learning to a certain extent in the colleges and institutions.  Senator Bacik referred earlier to the fact that Trinity College has gone down 22 places in the world rankings while I observe that the Technological Institute in Singapore is now in the top ranking.  As a former teaching primary school principal I recall remarking 15 years ago on the teaching, curriculum, and implementation of mathematics at primary level in Singapore which was outstanding.  Last week we talked about Project Maths but the quality of the maths programme in the Singapore primary schools is outstanding.  I am sure that has a bearing on what happens further up the line.</P>
        <P>As the parent of third level students I suggest that in first year, eight hours lecture time per week is not enough and more should be provided.  On a more light-hearted note&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am pleased to welcome the Bill which is a significant development in the landscape of further, higher and university education throughout Ireland.  With the Bill&rsquo;s full implementation it holds the potential, as the Minister and others have said, to provide more efficiency and coherence across the landscape.  Equally significant, the establishment of a single body provides opportunities for strategic development of a few key dimensions within <Col N="129"/>further, higher and university education that are still significantly underdeveloped throughout Ireland.  I will come to those after I raise some of my concerns.</P>
        <P>In light of my own background in education and a number of years in community and further education in geographic regions of severe disadvantage I welcome the Bill as learner centred, as Senator Power said.  With the establishment of the authority, its governance, executive and staff responsibilities will be consistently challenged to create strategic opportunities of an equivalent nature for all learners, regardless of whether they are learning in the further, higher or university sector.  There is more potential for an equality of outcome for all learners with the establishment of a single body than there has been in the past.  I hope this will be a key principle in guiding the development of its first strategic plan which, as the Bill notes, will happen within the first six months of its establishment.</P>
        <P>I have some questions and concerns and I will identify a couple of opportunities.  With the new body there will be an opportunity to ensure a consistency across the whole sector whereas in the past, for example, with regard to the operations of HETAC, there has been oversight of the process of quality assurance.  The new quality authority could implement ways to ensure quality in the actual product of the course or programme, while respecting the freedom and the autonomy of the providers.  It is important, therefore, to devolve responsibility of quality to providers but could the new authority also hold the power to, perhaps, spot check the quality of the product?  Is this what is meant by giving the authority the power to review programmes that it has already validated?</P>
        <P Just="Left">An issue raised by the recent Hyland report may have some bearing on the potential opportunity of the new quality authority.  As Professor Hyland has pointed out there exists currently a replication of courses across the third level system, approximately 880 separate level 8 courses and 1,300 level 6 and 7 courses.  The question is whether the new authority, in light of its streamlined nature, will provide an opportunity to encourage a reduction in the number of specialised courses towards more generic courses.</P>
        <P>One of the functions of the new authority is to determine policies and criteria, as the Minister has outlined, for access, transfer and progression for learners and to monitor the implementation of those policies and procedures.  Senator Averil Power referred to the importance of this.  The arena of access is critical for those adults who lost out first time around in their education.  In light of the current economic crisis and high numbers unemployed, higher education needs to put a spotlight on policies and procedures and supports for access of the adult learner.</P>
        <P>The accreditation of prior experience in learning, APEL, needs to be a priority in the authority&rsquo;s work in this arena.  This has already been called for.  This requires an understanding of flexible learning and structures need to be put in place quickly to provide greater access by greater numbers of adults.</P>
        <P>Progression issues need to be thoroughly re-examined as a priority.  It is a strategic opportunity.  It should not be more difficult for all adult learners to receive a third level degree than it is for the traditional learner, namely, a young person just out of second level education.  Strategic work by the new authority in the arena of progression must recognise the needs of adults in terms of learning and the fact that their learning does not always progress in a linear way up the accreditation ladder.  A system of progression needs to be developed and easy to use.  Previously, too much red tape meant a significantly longer period of time for non-traditional learners to move from unemployment to employment.</P>
        <P>According to other educators, access and progression issues highlight an opportunity to have a parity of esteem between the further and higher education sectors.  Given the high number of learners involved, the level of development and the professionalisation of the further edu<Col N="130"/>cation sector, it should be viewed on an equal footing.  In 2010, it is estimated that approximately 40,000 learners availed of full-time further education opportunities, while 125,000 learners availed of part-time further education programmes such as adult literacy, the back to education initiative, BTEI, and community education.</P>
        <P>In addition, there is a concern about how the Bill recognises the role of the community and voluntary education sector, that is, community education organisations operating alongside the VEC and statutory sectors.  For example, Part 4, section 39(7) formally names the providers in the context of the validation process.  Community education providers are not included in the list unless they are intended to be included within subsection (7)(<i>g</i>).  Approximately 22% of FETAC providers are from the community and voluntary sector, which is a significant proportion compared with the VECs, F&Aacute;S and private providers, 35%, 25% and 18%, respectively.  Will the Minister clarify whether in the implementation of the Bill the process of validating programmes will continue as it was for these community education organisations, namely, that they will have their programmes validated directly by the new qualifications authority?  Could community education providers be named in the list?</P>
        <P>The Minister clarified some of the issues around my sixth concern.  The Bill proposes an eight-member board for the new authority.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s decision that a stakeholder model is not appropriate, but how will he proceed with the appointment process?  For example, will he seek some form of equivalence of representation from the further and higher education sectors?</P>
        <P>My final issue relates to the Bill&rsquo;s commitment to protecting learners in the case of a provider ceasing to operate.  As outlined in Part 6, section 60, there is an obligation on the proposed new authority to make all reasonable efforts to assist enrolled learners affected by the cessation of a programme of training or education.  Will this obligation place a strain on the resources of the new authority?  Would a system of risk assessment for commercial providers prior to rather than following validation provide better protection?  For example, if a provider must fulfil more stringent requirements at the initial stage, it may provide a more cost-effective protection for learners in the long term.  Could a bonding system similar to the travel agency system be more effective in saving costs and protecting learners?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Quinn, back to the House and I wish him well in the new term.  I also welcome the Bill and am delighted to hear that it is learner focused.  The Minister must be commended for his achievements to date in his role.  The learner should always be the focus.</P>
        <P>I welcome the amalgamation of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, NQAI, HETAC, FETAC and the Irish Universities Quality Board, IUQB, into a single agency known as the qualifications and quality assurance authority of Ireland.  When I first read the Bill, I hoped the name would be changed.  I am delighted to hear the Minister say he has that power.  It is a mouthful.</P>
        <P>The bodies&rsquo; amalgamation is a key part of the Government&rsquo;s overall public sector reform agenda and the authority&rsquo;s establishment will result in cost savings.  Considerable savings have already been made by the NQAI, HETAC and FETAC through the implementation of the moratorium and expenditure reduction across their range of activities.  The bodies&rsquo; 2011 Exchequer allocation for current expenditure of almost &euro;9 million is 30% lower than their 2008 <Col N="131"/>outturn.  Savings in the order of &euro;1 million will also be achieved through rationalised corporate structures and supports through the integration of services.</P>
        <P>The authority&rsquo;s establishment will prioritise learners&rsquo; needs and deliver a quality, joined-up and more effective service to providers.  The amalgamation will also lead to a more comprehensive approach in further and higher education and training.  In line with other EU member states, Ireland has adopted a lifelong learning approach to education and training.  It is vital to have a seamless transfer and progression for all learners with accreditation through the National Framework of Qualifications, NFQ.  It is impossible for learners to reach their full potential if they do not experience quality at all levels in our institutions.  This quality underpins the value of our qualifications, supports the economy&rsquo;s skill requirements and protects the value of our investment in public institutions.  It is critical that our institutions take ownership of the quality agenda and ensure that it informs areas such as governance, organisation, programme design and delivery, assessment and research.</P>
        <P>Quality must continue to be a core part of the institutions&rsquo; mission and culture.  However, it is also important that there be an external dimension to quality assurance.  This will ensure that the institutions are reviewed and monitored so that best practice can be shared.  I welcome the fact that a seven-person board will oversee this process.</P>
        <P>The vocational education and training and higher education sectors have built up considerable practice and expertise in quality assurance.  The processes put in place by the NQAI, HETAC and FETAC are consistent with the three-tier process adopted in the standards and guidelines for quality assurance in the European higher education area and the European quality assurance standards for vocational training and education.</P>
        <P>It is vital that we maintain the NFQ and further deepen its implementation.  We must also review the policies and criteria on which the NFQ is based.  It is important that the authority be able to advise the Department of Education and Skills on lifelong learning.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Zappone&rsquo;s remarks on the transition of adult learners to third level education.  After more years than I care to remember, I returned to third level to do a masters.  I completed my BA 20 years prior.  Going to university in the 2000s was different from how it was in the 1980s.  I welcome that adult learning is being taken into consideration.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I join others in welcoming the Minister to the House for the new term.  I thank Senator Moran for sharing her time with me.</P>
        <P>Like other Senators, I believe this Bill, which I welcome, has cross-party support.  It is the culmination of a long process of reviewing the framework for ensuring quality in education and training.  It is good to see it before the House.  I am glad the Minister has initiated it in the Seanad.  It is very worthwhile given how many of us in this House have long had an interest in higher education at third level.  I refer not only to the university Senators but also to those with a broad range of experience and expertise, which expertise will be evident from the debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad we are debating this Bill just after the inaugural address in Trinity College of the new Provost, Professor Prendergast.  The Minister was in attendance and heard the speech.  Other colleagues were also present.  I referred to the speech earlier and on the Order of Business.  The Provost mounted a very robust defence of the universities in general and Trinity College in particular, pointing out that the latter is unique in having achieved a top-50 place amount institutions worldwide.  He pointed out that, at its peak, it was 43rd in the world.  This fact should be compared with the fact that only one Irish company has achieved a rank by Fortune 500 in its list of top companies.  It was approximately 490th.  Trinity&rsquo;s achievement is remarkable for an Irish institution.  That we have slipped back to 65th place is, as the Provost <Col N="132"/>said, a testament to the economic difficulties we face and the challenges for all, including the university sector.  The Provost made a very strong case for preserving the autonomy of universities, particularly with regard to hiring practices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not agree with the Provost&rsquo;s analysis of the return of third level fees but agree with him that there is a need to ensure adequate resourcing of the university sector to ensure we maintain a culture of innovation and creativity therein.  The Minister has said on many occasions that he agrees with that.  A HEA report, issued today, shows the direct benefit to the economy or return on investment from investment by the State in research centres in universities, institutes of technology and colleges.  That is very important and provides a very good context for debate.</P>
        <P>Quality in education is central to international rankings and our attraction of international students.  It is important that we see an amalgamation of the agencies currently providing for quality assurance at third level and in further education.  We all welcome that.  The new body with the unpronounceable name, as others have called it, does represent a streamlining of existing quality assurance mechanisms.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have reflected on the name QQAI, as others have.  An acronym such as &ldquo;QI&rdquo; could present a difficulty because of the Stephen Fry programme of the same name.  There is potential for using &ldquo;CI&rdquo;, which could stand for &ldquo;C&aacute;il&iacute;ochta&iacute; Ireland&rdquo;.  It would be like the F&aacute;ilte Ireland example given by the Minister.  It is certainly a lot more pronounceable than QQAI.  A more facetious example would be &ldquo;QUACK&rdquo;, which could stand for &ldquo;Quality Assurance for Colleges and Kids&rdquo;, but that would not be very suitable.  In any case, a title that is easier to say would be an advantage.  Furthermore, it would consolidate the status of the authority for individuals, service providers and, much more important, service users, including students at all levels.  It is very important that people be aware of this.  Until I read the briefing notes on this Bill, I was not fully aware of the wide range of agencies and bodies providing for quality assurance.  That itself shows the need for this Bill.</P>
        <P>That the authority will have eight members chosen on the basis of expertise rather than representation is important.  I am glad to see, however, that the Minister will be requesting the USI to provide an individual to be appointed to the authority.  Thus, the authority will have a representative nature to some extent.  As with Senator Power, I was the only student in the room at many meetings when I was president of Trinity Students Union.  It is important to have student representation and also that members of the authority be chosen on the basis of expertise.</P>
        <P>I am interested specifically in the issue of quality assurance in universities, having participated in reviews within Trinity and having worked as an external reviewer for colleges in Ireland and other jurisdictions.  The universities already have a quite established quality review process under way.  I am interested in knowing, however, how section 37 will affect that because it seems quite open-ended in terms of empowering the new authority to conduct quality reviews.  I am wondering how it will work in practice alongside the reviews already being conducted within the universities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provisions on internationalising education in sections 54 to 57, inclusive, are very important.  Universities are already signed up to Ireland&rsquo;s international strategy and to attracting more international students. The Bill will really facilitate that and it is very important.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister clarify how the Bill deals with the difficulty with so-called bogus colleges?  There was some reference to this in briefings.  The Bill will make it easier to tackle the difficulty.  It is a very small issue but there has been some media reportage on colleges being set up to attract students from abroad rather than to offer quality education, particularly in the English language sector.</P><Col N="133"/>
        <P>I have two other points to raise.  Schedule 3 to the Bill provides for an amendment to the Universities Act 1997.  It relates to section 9 of the Act and the universities established thereunder, of which there is none.  The Minister pointed that out in his speech.  Why preserve the provision?  Is it a reference to the new university for the south east, on which we have had some debate already today on the Order of Business and on which there is considerable debate in general?</P>
        <P>My final point relates to a point raised by Senator Power, on which I have done a great deal of work in Trinity College.  I refer to access to university for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  It is a particular problem within the university sector.  The ITs have a better record on this.  Programmes such as the Trinity Access Programmes and the BITE programme in DIT have tried to ensure more developed routes for access to third level for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  What are the implications for those programmes of this Bill?  Is there a specific route of progress?  Will the certificates offered for participating in the programmes be subject to review under the Bill?  I have an open mind as to whether they should.  Most of the courses in question are post-leaving certificate courses but I wonder whether they fall within the remit of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill as one of the many reforms in the education sector that the Minister is in the process of carrying out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister.  I do not welcome the Bill because I believe the Minister is better than this Bill would have him appear.  It has the look of a Bill that has been hanging around Marlborough Street for a long time.  There is  a recent tradition of hostility to university autonomy from Marlborough Street, which I regret.</P>
        <P>On 17 September last year, the Comptroller and Auditor General reported that international comparisons suggest Ireland&rsquo;s universities are relatively efficient and highly regarded.  A massive level abuse was found on the administrator side, as Members will know.  I refer to bonus payments, for example.  The proportion of pay received by academics in universities has dropped to 42% in recent years.  It used to be more than double that.  Layers of bureaucracy have been created and there are vice presidents, assistant registrars and staff with the word &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; in their titles. They escape scot free because, as is perceived in the universities, they are part of the Marlborough Street tentacles getting into universities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The part to which the 42% statistic pertains has the highest international ratings.  That would have become apparent had there been consultation on the Bill.  I am a member of a governing body and noted there was no consultation therewith.  We would have been able to tell the Minister that our graduates are up to the standard in Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard and Yale.  The US and UK authorities are not imposing a system such as ours on our competitors.</P>
        <P>It is very much to be regretted that the Minister stated the universities must implement the authority&rsquo;s directions following a review.  We have always been in favour of autonomous universities.  We accept and respect diversity and different views.  Universities are not a branch of the Civil Service.  The latter&rsquo;s attempts to take them over in recent years, by rapidly increasing the amount of bureaucracy and devoting increasingly fewer funds to what goes on in the lecture hall, are a pity.  I regret to see this continuing.</P>
        <P>The Hunt report was mentioned.  There was not a single lecturer or teacher on the Hunt committee.  The same applied to the innovation committee and the knowledge economy report.  Those of us who do the work in universities would very much like to make the case that we provide degrees at much less cost of parity with Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard and Yale.  Our graduates go straight to these places to do graduate work.  They do not need this type of <Col N="134"/>certification as they have it already at a much higher level.  Employers tell us the same thing; Irish graduates are employable here and abroad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not know what problem the Bill addresses except the political one of amalgamating bodies.  As one will see in the Bill that nobody will lose a post, I do not know from where the savings are to come.  A section in the Bill states all staff of the existing quangos will join the new one.  How does the Bill address Ireland&rsquo;s problems?  When the country was falling apart because of, as members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform have seen, appalling banks which did not know what they were doing and probably did not care much either and an appalling Central Bank regulating what was going on, the universities were still performing.</P>
        <P>Part of the Chopra and IMF arrangements must be to reduce bureaucracy and increase front line activity.  We need to increase the 42% statistic and stop unnecessary quangos and bureaucracies.  This is an unnecessary quango and unnecessary bureaucracy with regard to what it intends to do in the universities.  We must get away from not asking the people in the classrooms.  Surveys can be taken on who is a good lecturer and who is not.  If somebody does not turn up, 400 people will be in the front square.  It must be the most transparent part of the system.  This is unlike how the rest of a university&rsquo;s affairs is organised as it is extremely difficult to find out what is going on and, I would venture to say, also unlike the Department of Education and Skills.</P>
        <P>I do not know what problem the Minister is addressing.  I do not know what legal minefields we are entering because some of the institutions have charters.  It took a private Act of the Legislature to remove seven senior people from the TCD board.  This has been a disaster because it removed from the board seven experienced people and tilted the balance in favour of managerialism.  Universities are collegiate institutions, not managerial ones.  The Bill is managerialism from beginning to end.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not know why section 28 is included.  I do not like to read on page 15 that the Minister will appoint a chief executive and on page 62 that the Minister will appoint all the members of the authority.  Representational bodies might have something to contribute outside the ever-decreasing circle which Marlborough Street chooses to consult when it wants to know what is going on in Irish education.  On page 17 it is stated the chief executive will not be required to account for court cases.  Bizarre court cases have been taken in Irish education and when the taxpayer loses a bundle of money in the Supreme Court, which happens, I would like to ask the chief executives what they thought they were doing by running the court cases.  It seems to be a very strange section.</P>
        <P>Also on page 17, it is stated the chief executive will not be allowed to comment on the merits or objectives of any policy of the Government or Minister.  This is what higher education is.  Owen Skeffington came to the Seanad when it was policy to wallop children and for years and years he argued against it.  Eventually, the Government changed its mind.  If this is destroyed, Irish universities will be turned into the type of eastern European ones which collapsed and contributed nothing.  This has totalitarian elements.</P>
        <P>With regard to section 9 on the functions of the authority, the Bill reinvents what is already being done to the highest international level.  Examples have occurred of misguided interference such as restructuring, which cost &euro;6 million through the strategic innovation fund and which has never been properly appraised.  A survey was conducted after it was done in which one lecturer stated it freed up more time for research and 180 stated it did not.  However, restructuring continued because somebody in an office somewhere, who had not been near a lecture hall for many years, decided it was a good idea.</P><Col N="135"/>
        <P>As the Comptroller and Auditor Chairman stated, we should examine the administration side of universities.  We should also examine the administration of the HEA, other quangos and the higher education sector of the Department, because an bord snip nua found a large amount of money there.  If we have only seven universities and are really interested in getting the public finances under control, why not have one person writing seven cheques in five minutes and then getting on with other work?  An immense amount of bureaucracy is diverting badly needed money away from front line activities in education.</P>
        <P>With regard to international accreditation, under the Bologna process the Trinity final year was reduced from five to four courses.  We were better than the international standard, which is why we are up there with Harvard and Yale.  When it came to what courses had to go, it was either one&rsquo;s dissertation or the general paper.  The purpose of the general paper is that one should not know only about course A, B and C; one should know economics or genetics in general.  Mindless internationalisation and standardisation reduce what we have to offer international markets.</P>
        <P>I mentioned that under the Bill one will not be able to criticise the Government or Minister or the objectives of policy.  This is extremely strange.  The compulsion on a working sector which has an international reputation to engage in this at a time when we are cutting so many vital public expenditures such as special needs assistants seems strange.  We should be cutting out unnecessary layers of bureaucracy and not introducing more.</P>
        <P>I shall certainly table amendments but I regret the tone of the Bill, its content and its failure to recognise that developing education in Ireland would be a way out of the current difficulties.  Unless we are to have massive tax increases, we have to remove the administrative layers inside and outside universities.  This is a strange Bill which contradicts many of the very interesting and innovative statements the Minister has made since bringing such energy to the portfolio.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for not being present for the Minister&rsquo;s contribution.  I was at a committee meeting which always seems to clash with Seanad debates.  However, this is not the fault of the Minister.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and I will begin where Senator Barrett finished by stating we should remove layers of bureaucracy, and this is what the Bill will do by amalgamating the various bodies which exist.  The McCarthy report, which Senator Barrett mentioned, recommended that bureaucracy be reduced.</P>
        <P>I read some of the Minister&rsquo;s statement in the time available to me and he stated the Bill will establish a new body, the qualifications and quality assurance authority of Ireland, which will amalgamate the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, the Further Education and Training Awards Council, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and the Irish Universities Quality Board.  Even if only the offices and furniture of these boards were amalgamated, one will make savings because pushing paper from one organisation to another trying to achieve the same end is not recommended by anybody.  An efficiency review conducted in 2008, the OECD report, &ldquo;Towards an Integrated Public Service&rdquo;, and the recommendations made in the McCarthy report all stressed a need to consolidate the quality assurance bodies, and I am glad the Minister has taken these recommendations on board with the publication of the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The remit of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland will be wide ranging and will include maintenance of the national framework of qualifications established under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999; the review of policies and criteria on which the national framework of qualifications is based; and advising relevant departments on the national policy on the transfer of credits and the recognition of prior learning.  Stan<Col N="136"/>dardisation of recognition of prior learning and accreditation of prior learning has fallen back.  Will the Minister speak about this?  There are various ways to introduce the recommendations on the accreditation of prior learning in various colleges.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reasoning behind the Bill is clear.  It is logical to have one organisation taking responsibility for ensuring quality in higher and further education, as opposed to the present system that is in place.  I mentioned several bodies that overlap.  Such a progressive move must be welcomed and I commend the Minister for taking it.  The Minister outlined some of the savings that would be made.  Perhaps at a later date we could evaluate those.  Senator Barrett made a similar point.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Skills has already established the inter-agency implementation amalgamation group to support the amalgamation process.  Considerations for this process have been set out in the consultation paper since 2009.  Senator Barrett indicated that there has been very little consultation.  However, consultation did take place.  Written submissions were received during the consultation process from various organisations and individuals.  The consultation paper that was published in 2009 by the Department found that an amalgamated body would be better placed to progress plans for development across further and higher education and training.</P>
        <P>The consultation paper was in favour of the amalgamation of the remit of the quality assurance bodies because having one authoritative body would simplify the process of communication for providers and would make it easier to share information and expertise, facilitate consultation and simplify decision making.  Moreover, a single agency, as proposed in the Bill, would be better placed to enable and contribute to international best practice and quality assurance and distribute it to the further and higher education and training sectors.</P>
        <P>The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, NQAI, has welcomed the publication of the Bill, noting that it would provide a more cohesive and integrated set of services to learners in higher and further education to the highest international standards.  We want to serve students.  That is an unequivocal vindication of the provisions contained in the Bill.  It is based on best international practice as well.</P>
        <P>The Netherlands and Spain have already established one organisation for the provision of quality assurance and accreditation in third level education.  The bodies in both of those countries were reviewed in 2007 and were both found to be in compliance with the membership regulations of the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education which established a common framework of reference for quality assurance as far back as 2005.  We will be able to compare with the agency in the future.</P>
        <P>Recent quality assurance 2011 statistics have shown an overall decline in Irish universities.  Senator Barrett mentioned that we have good universities and a good output but the figures indicate that a review of quality assurance procedures is needed in our universities.  The new agency will take over the quality assurance review function from the Irish Universities Quality Board, IUQB.  In the light of the latest university world ranking it is a welcome and positive move for Irish third level education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to see the Minister in the Chamber to bring forward the legislation which will standardise qualifications in the third level sector.  We must be mindful that it will also save the taxpayer money.  The anecdotal figure is that savings in the region of &euro;1 million will be made through the amalgamations.  I very much welcome the Bill.  The previous Government supported such a move and we on this side of the House will support the legislation.  As previous speakers indicated, the legislation arises from the efficiencyreview which was carried out by the Department in 2008.  It follows on from the publication of <Col N="137"/>the OECD report, Towards an Integrated Public Service, in 2008 and the McCarthy report, which recommended the amalgamation of various authorities, including HETAC and FETAC, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and the Irish Universities Quality Board.</P>
        <P>The Minister is not proceeding with the recommendation of the previous Government on the abolition of the National University of Ireland.  I agree with him in that regard.  I lobbied my own Ministers at the time not to abolish the National University of Ireland because it was fulfilling a useful and important purpose both nationally and internationally to the universities it served and in terms of the status of the qualifications obtained by the students who attended the constituent colleges.</P>
        <P>As previous speakers outlined, the establishment of the qualification and quality assurance association of Ireland is being welcomed by each of the organisations which is being amalgamated.  That is something we should acknowledge.  The designated chief executive of the National Qualifications Association of Ireland, Dr. Padraig Walsh, has welcomed the Bill before the House.  FETAC and HETAC, the NQAI and the IUQB have placed a united statement on the FETAC website welcoming the legislation.</P>
        <P LI="1">FETAC, HETAC and NQAI and IUQB are agreed that this move strengthens a focus on high quality learning experiences across all education and training provision nationally.  The strength of current quality assurance systems will grow, opening up new opportunities for people to engage and succeed in learning.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is all about providing opportunities for older citizens and young people to further themselves within a learning experience following the qualification they achieve be it a certificate, diploma, degree or fourth level qualification.  It is about giving people an opportunity to better themselves within society, whether in terms of attending further education and opening up doors in that regard or to obtain employment.  That is important in the current economic environment where approximately 100,000 people who were employed in the construction sector nationally lost their jobs and are seeking retraining.  It is important that there would be a standardised approach but also that there would be opportunity of access available to people as well.  If the proposed legislation does all of that plus save the taxpayer money then we must acknowledge and welcome it.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister referred to the establishment of the board in his opening remarks.  I welcome the fact that he is considering having a representative from USI on the board.  That is particularly important given the viewpoint represented by USI at student level.  He also mentioned that learners and the international experience would be represented, which is important.  When the Minister was a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Science, as I was, the heads of the universities were before us.  We spoke about the benefit to Irish universities of looking to attract international students into the system.  That is something we must look towards.  The funding of third level education is a debate for another day.  One avenue to increase funding available to the sector is to have international students coming into the system. The new structure will provide a standardised approach.  Reference was made to the Netherlands and Spain where, according to the reports we have read, the new system is working effectively.  A single authority would be of benefit if it can open the door to encouraging universities to consider bringing in international students.  We will see benefits if the new standardised authority is able to provide a better international template of the qualifications that are being obtained.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have a query which may not be related to the authority which is being established but it is linked to third level education and the opportunities therein.  I refer to access to education.  A teacher came to a clinic in my constituency last night who had spent 25 years teaching. He is <Col N="138"/>earning a gross salary of &euro;68,000.  His wife has multiple sclerosis, which is a debilitating medical condition.  She is obtaining a small benefit for that.  They have three children going into third level education and the registration fees being charged by each college - in Dublin, Limerick and Galway - are approximately &euro;2,200.  The cost of sending those three children to college is &euro;37,500.  The net pay of that public servant is about &euro;37,000, while his wife is in receipt of about &euro;12,000, and they are unable to meet those costs.</P>
      
        
        <P Just="Left">We all talk about the most vulnerable in society, but these now include middle-income earners who are being penalised by all the additional charges. As they cannot obtain third level grants that are available to those on social welfare or lower income earners, they and their children are being squeezed.  The Minister should examine this matter to see what can be done to facilitate equal access and opportunities for such students entering third level education.  They should not be penalised because of the way the system operates.</P>
        <P>The McCarthy report recommended that the National University of Ireland should be abolished with a net saving of about &euro;3 million to the Exchequer.  The figures presented by the NUI, however, show the cost was approximately &euro;1.36 million.  In addition, tax receipts to the Exchequer were valued at &euro;500,000 so the overall cost of running the NUI was about &euro;800,000.  The McCarthy report got its figures wrong in that case.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the NUI will remain in its current format.  I also welcome the legislation which shows that there is a joined-up approach to amalgamating agencies in order to cut down on the number of perceived quangos, streamline the system and make it more effective.  The amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money being spent will thus be reduced and this should be replicated across other Departments also.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Taca&iacute;onn Sinn F&eacute;in leis an reachta&iacute;ocht seo, i bprionsabal, agus f&aacute;ilt&iacute;mid roimhe.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom iarratas beag a dh&eacute;anamh maidir leis an ainm.  Molaim go gcoinneofa&iacute; ainm bre&aacute; Gaelach.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin d&eacute;anta go rialta, mar shampla i gc&aacute;s Solas.  T&aacute; m&eacute; cinnte go bhfuil tuairim&iacute; ag an Rialtas faoi sin.  Cad faoi focail ar n&oacute;s &ldquo;c&eacute;im&rdquo;, &ldquo;gradam&rdquo;, &ldquo;foghlaim&rdquo; n&oacute; &ldquo;bronnadh&rdquo;?  T&aacute; m&eacute; cinnte gur f&eacute;idir teacht ar ainm bre&aacute; Gaelach ar an eagra&iacute;ocht seo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin t&aacute;bhachtach sa chomhth&eacute;acs n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.  In renaming the organisation, the Irish language might be brought into play to give it a nice Irish language name as well, as has been done previously with other organisations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sinn F&eacute;in naturally supports the improvement and increased efficiency of public services and reform directed to advance this aim.  The Bill seeks to consolidate the services as outlined.  The stated rationale is that it is more efficient to have a single organisation ensuring quality in further and higher education and training rather than, as is currently the case, several bodies with some overlapping responsibilities.  While this is laudable, it can only be achieved if the new authority is properly resourced and staffed with qualified and experienced personnel who are capable of delivering a more streamlined and efficient service.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in supports the aim of the Bill to make qualifications more understandable across different countries and systems in Europe.  It is also important that, wherever possible, education bodies ensure that their awards are recognised within the NFQ.  The legislation should provide a more integrated, efficient and coherent range of services to learners that meets the highest international standards.  Any new body overseeing quality must strive to create transparency in the Irish education system, as well as ensuring independent quality assessment.  It must also enable international comparison between degree programmes and continue to improve the quality of Irish degree courses.  I agree with previous Senators who spoke of the necessity of having student representatives on the board.</P><Col N="139"/>
        <P>We share the NUI&rsquo;s concerns that amalgamating a higher education awards body with a further education awards body has the potential to damage the reputation of higher education awards.  The NUI also argues that most member agencies in the European Association of Higher Education Quality Assurance are solely concerned with higher education.  We would be interested to hear how the Minister intends to address these concerns.</P>
        <P>We note that one of the objectives of the Qualifications, Education and Training Act 1999 was to promote and maintain procedures, access, transfer and progression.  It should be noted that access is a process by which learners through education and learning receive recognition for confidence, skill and competence.  Access should apply to all learners but especially those who are disadvantaged or marginalised.  On that note, I agree with Senators Zappone and Keane on the accreditation of prior learning.  Disadvantaged or marginalised socio-economic groups usually have prior learning experience which should be recognised and brought to bear when they are being considered for diploma or degree courses.</P>
        <P>The QQAI must place a particular focus on the implications resulting from cuts to essential services in SNA support and special language resource teachers, both at primary and post-secondary levels.  The impact of rising third-level fees on restricting access to students from disadvantaged families must also be taken into consideration.  This could be achieved through the development of procedures on access transfer and progression that ensure positive outcomes across life-long learning.</P>
        <P>The RIA claims the Bill will have no additional cost to the Exchequer and will result in savings of &euro;1 million annually.  Savings will be realised over time and through economies of scale, reductions in staff numbers and CEOs.  What are the projected job losses resulting from the establishment of the QQAI?  What will be the cost to the Exchequer of terminating senior management and CEO contracts?</P>
        <P>The RIA considers that costs may be incurred by universities in implementing revised quality assurance practices.  Can the Minister provide assurances that if there are any additional costs, they will not result in higher student fees?</P>
        <P>The Bill must establish quality assurance procedures that address the recent slippage of three Irish universities in world rankings, as has already been mentioned.  In recent years, I have taught in two third level institutions.  One of the things that alarmed me in both institutions was the push to pass people.  Every available opportunity was used to ensure that students would pass their exams, so that it did not look bad for the institution in question to have people failing courses.  It will be interesting to see how that matter will be taken on board.  In fairness to everyone sitting exams, we must be sure that the quality of courses is assured and that qualifications are awarded fairly, thus demonstrating what work has been put into the courses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been a great deal of discussion in recent times on the issue of public appointments to State boards and State bodies, and the Minister&rsquo;s influence on their operation.  I echo the comments by previous speakers who sought to ensure that those appointed to the new body are suitably qualified.  When new bodies are created, such as this one, they must be as transparent and accountable as possible, as well as meeting high standards from the outset.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that only the Minister can appoint the eight members of the QQAI board.  We hope, however, that consideration might be given to interested parties, individually or in appropriate groups, to make at least some nominations.  The appointed CEO will have a good deal of power under the change of legislation but will he or she only be accountable to the Minister?</P>
        <P>The authority aims to encourage providers to apply for an international education mark based on their code of conduct.  Nowhere is it mentioned, however, that course providers must guarantee that courses will run to their final completion.</P><Col N="140"/>
        <P Just="Left">To some degree, the Bill is related to the Bologna process and the Bologna Declaration which aims to create a single higher education European area.  While there is clearly merit in cross-European co-operation and standardisation to some degree, I note that the Bologna process is not without its critics.  I ask Senators to consider that in areas such as these, we must proceed with caution.  The process has been criticised as facilitating the commercialisation of higher education, and for the increasing emphasis on competitiveness as opposed to a broader, holistic approach to education.  It has also been criticised by many for turning universities into businesses or diploma factories rather than places of learning. There are real concerns that students are being treated as customers and that the system which is over-regulated, does not allow for national differences or individual considerations.</P>
        <P>The emphasis on the attainment of vocational degrees, while not always a bad thing has, in some commentators&rsquo; eyes, meant a reduction in funding in some non-vocational areas and has seen sponsorship by big business of the more &ldquo;employable&rdquo; education programmes.  Many institutions offer a broad education, in particular, the NUI colleges and many other institutions and this approach must be preserved.  There is more to education than the mere grinding out of results for the lowest costs possible and for the international league tables which can be rather misleading.  While Sinn F&eacute;in does not oppose the purpose of the Bill, I wish to urge caution and care in the progress of such reforms and the preservation of the positive, unique aspects of our higher and further education systems while seeking their improvement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senators for their contributions and consideration of the Bill.  I have made notes of the points made and anything that has not been satisfactorily discussed can be on Committee Stage.  I hope to be back in the House next month for Committee Stage and I will present a number of technical amendments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Senator Power for the support of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party. I recognise that this Bill originated with a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister some years ago and we are now building on that work on which there is broad consensus.</P>
        <P>The issue of quality assurance and the role of students is very important.  I have said elsewhere that I regard the involvement of students in modern day terms as having three phases.  The first phase was in the 1960s when we were out on the street, barely tolerated and regarded as pups, and which resulted in confrontation.  As John Hume famously said, the trick about street politics is knowing when to come in off the street.  The begrudging recognition &mdash; which varies in different colleges &mdash; of the need for student representation, is more or less given under duress rather than as a right of place.</P><Col N="141"/>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the appointment by the Minister of the day to the boards of the universities of, not so much a token student, but a lone student, in the case where everybody needs a seconder on a board for support.  I take the point made that bringing students in from the street and putting them on the board and then ignoring them is not desirable.  I have asked USI and IFUT to provide representation on the student appeals board under the student support legislation which has been enacted.  I regard the third stage of student engagement as being the quality assurance.  Students are partners in the education system to which they contribute and they are entitled to good service.  The occupation of the school of architecture in UCD in which I played a role, along with others, was about that very point.  We were not doing it for fun.  We were in danger of losing the international recognition which was tantamount to an international degree in those days, pre-Bologna process and pre-everything else, with the consequence that we would have less earning power and that our degree would not be recognised abroad, in the case where half of the college&rsquo;s 30 students used to emigrate out of choice in order to gain experience or out of necessity if the economy was not going well.</P>
        <P>Students are the direct consumers and have a role to play in ensuring excellence in standards and this point was made by Senator Barrett.  Among the younger generation of academics there is a recognition that students are partners in the education process and not subjects within it.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett referred also to policies on access and transfers.  This is an important point.  Currently, one third of entrants into the university system are not coming through the points system which is the traditional route for second-level students.  This varies from college to college and from place to place but the likelihood is that as access programmes are advanced &mdash; Trinity College probably led the way as regards access programmes &mdash; and improved, one will see a diversity and an increase in the non-secondary school route into college.  I do not believe one can have a knowledge economy without a knowledge society and such a society requires the availability of lifelong learning.</P>
        <P>As regards the international dimension, I supported the previous Administration&rsquo;s policy and we have built on it.  We regard the international student body not just as a cash cow, because this attitude would be very damaging from all points of view and we would not get away with such an attitude.  There are three reasons for actively progressing the internationalisation of our university structures.  Ireland is a very homogenous society and the cohort of people in the university system is a social minority.  It is important to include people from different backgrounds and cultures.  The learning abilities of some of the international students show up some of our own students in an unfavourable light.  The introduction of international students at either undergraduate or postgraduate level, raises the game for everybody.</P>
        <P>International lecturers and participants are also to be welcomed.  Yesterday in his address, to which Senator Bacik referred, the Provost of Trinity College, Professor Prendergast, said that half the staff in Trinity College is composed of people from countries from all over the world.  Education itself has been internationalised.  The Internet has facilitated collaboration and the exchange of academic papers.  For those reasons I will be taking up the points made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been an improvement in the issuing of visas by the Department of Justice and Equality to allow foreign students to attend university.  I am informed there is a speedy recognition of visas at a percentage rate of 92%.  Senator D&rsquo;Arcy is correct that the experience is not universal.  One can speculate on the reason but the experience of Indian and Nepalese students in obtaining visas is different from that of the Chinese students.  This will need to be investigated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome Senator D&rsquo;Arcy back to the House.  He spoke about the large number of students and the potential for internationalisation, in particular, in the development of the sector for learning English as a foreign language.  We aim to deal with any of the barriers to this sector, <Col N="142"/>in so far as is possible.  I was very taken with his reference to universities no longer being like those in <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>.  I do not know what Senator D&rsquo;Arcy does with his teddy bear but I never had one.  He also spoke about the necessity to use best international practice to raise the standard of Irish universities and I support this view.</P>
        <P>Senator Zappone made a number of points and I will try to refer to all of them if possible.  Those points I do not deal with can be discussed on Committee Stage.  She spoke about the Hyland report and the issue of duplication of courses.  There has been an extraordinary inflation in the system.  I did not realise until I became Minister for Education and Science that the State Examinations Commission sets the leaving certificate papers and provides for their examination while the Department, through the NCCA, sets the syllabus.  However, the CAO is a privately-owned company, owned by seven universities.  It allows other institutions to use its services but the CAO has effectively, through its joint owners, added to the system.  The number and range of alternative courses has increased 300%.  This has then allowed colleges to privately boast that they are in the top league because their courses need 500 points for entry.  This also forces young people to make career choices at a very early stage.      I received an e-mail today from a guidance counsellor and maths and chemistry teacher, who pointed out that approximately 10% of people starting fifth year actually know what they want to do or have a clear idea of what to study.  When they fill up the CAO forms the following year, at age 17, they are being asked to make a choice between law with German or law with Sanskrit but they may want to simply to get into that space rather than commit to something specific.</P>
        <P>Years ago, the UCD school of engineering &mdash; the old college of science is now part of Government Buildings &mdash; offered a generic general foundation course in the first year.  People got a flavour of the course and could then opt for specialisation into civil, construction, mechanical, chemical or electric engineering.  If we consider the paper published earlier today by the Irish Universities Association as a contribution to tomorrow&rsquo;s conference, we may be seeing a change and a response to the paper that Professor Hyland spoke about.</P>
        <P>We already discussed access and second-chance education, including recognition of prior learning.  I know Senator Barrett was concerned about the impact on the university sector or even one particular university.  The purpose of this legislation is to examine the entire third level sector, which was not possible before, although there was a general recognition that we needed one body.  There are savings to be achieved and the process has been ongoing for some time.  To answer the Senator&rsquo;s question, there is now a designated CEO, who has been there for some time.  There will not be the kinds of costs for termination of salaries spoken about by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.</P>
        <P>Senator Zappone spoke about the importance of progression for all learners and recognition, in particular, of the needs of adult learners.  I have spoken to people with a third level qualification in this respect and as Senator Moran indicated, in going back to college after 20 years one may find it a very different place.  Making an allowance for somebody in this respect is something of which to be conscious.</P>
        <P>The parity of esteem between further and higher education is critical.  This country was riven with academic snobbery in the teaching profession, for example.  When somebody applied to a training college years ago, the famous term was the &ldquo;call to training&rdquo; when that person was accepted.  Secondary school teachers, who had a university degree, tended to look down their nose at people who did not have a degree.  That informed relationships between various unions and also had an extraordinary impact on the relationship at second level between vocational education on the one hand &mdash; or in the techs, to give them a generic name &mdash; and in secondary schools.  Fortunately, we have moved on.</P><Col N="143"/>
        <P>Part of the consequence, however, was that when training colleges became colleges of education attached to universities, the Teaching Council discovered that there was an assumption that they were part of the university experience.  The reality is that the Teaching Council did a recent consultancy report on Mary Immaculate College in Limerick where there was a feeling that the college was teaching subjects at an academic level that would never be appropriate for a primary school experience.  There was far too little emphasis on pedagogical skills.  That has come up in some of the other contributions, which I will refer to later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Zappone also referred to the security of a college opening and providing a course on a commercial basis but subsequently going out of business.  In these cases students&rsquo; fees are lost.  From my experience of the building industry &mdash; the travel agency business is a similar sector &mdash; we could probably deal with that best with a bond.  If a course goes belly up there could be a financial provision to compensate people damaged by that act.  I would be open to considering such a feature.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have already referred to the points made by Senator Mary Moran. I will return to this House with legislative proposals to give effect to SOLAS, which has an Irish name as a full title.  The relationship of this piece of legislation to the new authority, SOLAS, will provide for the first time a structured authority in the higher and further education space.  To use a shorthand description, which might be dangerous, it will become the equivalent in the further education sector of the Higher Education Authority in the university sector and for institutes of technology.  When the two pieces of legislation are in place we will have a solid piece of infrastructure, in educational terms, in that space.  After that it will be a case of getting on with the business of providing education and ensuring outcomes are positive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bacik referred to the speech by the Provost of Trinity College.  Trinity is still the best known university.  It is 419 years old and one of the oldest universities in Europe.  It is well known internationally.  I recall the angst coming from the city centre in 1999, when the university legislation was going through.  Many of the prophets who foresaw the end of civilisation as it was known have been reasonably surprised at how that Armageddon did not arrive in the manner suggested by some.</P>
        <P>We must get the balance right in that there is a necessity for some oversight of an independent institution while allowing for the autonomy of that institution to flourish.  With a venerable institution like Trinity College as opposed to Dublin City University or the University of Limerick, which are less than 40 years old, there is a different tradition and sensitivities may be stronger.  I say to Senators Bacik and Barrett  that whatever was embedded in the culture on Marlborough Street to which they referred, or the attitude of the Higher Education Authority, which deals more directly with universities, that is certainly not my intention.</P>
        <P>If practices or attitudes are evident of which I am unaware, the Senators can let me know.  By the same token, when certain specific instructions and requirements attached to funding are conveyed to those institutions, we expect at minimum those conditions would be adhered to.  There should be an honest dialogue if there are difficulties in adhering to the conditions as it is in none of our interests to have misapprehension or misunderstanding in either direction.  I hope that will not happen and I do not intend to compound the issue in a difficult or counter-productive fashion.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik also raised the question of how section 31 will work and we will probably discuss this in more detail on Committee Stage.  There was also a question concerning bogus colleges.  The word &ldquo;university&rdquo; is protected here and permission must be given to use the description.  Some colleges have put their addresses on websites and offered courses intimating that the institution is a university; at the time a few years ago I hoped the Department would take a more proactive line than it did.  In one case discussions have been initiated and action <Col N="144"/>will be taken.  We must protect the reputation of our seven universities, the DITs and other colleges in the third level sector.</P>
        <P>There was a question on membership of the board, and Senator Barrett mentioned increases in bureaucracy in the management of universities.  In some respects that is a matter for universities.  I know how strident the Senator has been in the past and respect that point of view.  The absence of academics on the Hunt report is something I regretted.</P>
        <P>I am perhaps wrongly quoted but I am responsible for that myself because I said that the Hunt report was the only report we had.  This was at its launch in January 2011 in the convention centre.  It took a long time to put together.  It stalled in the system for three or four months because the junior partner in the previous Government could not agree to some components of it.  Like all reports, it is the veritable curate&rsquo;s egg.  The last thing I wanted to do was to find fault with its contents and then look for a new report.  I wanted to go with pieces in it without necessarily accepting all of its recommendations and get on with the job of reforming, modernising and improving the third level sector.  The academic input into this is important.  The Senator used an interesting phrase when he described the culture of the university as &ldquo;collegiate rather than managerial&rdquo;.  We might explore what is meant by that on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>I have the power under the Bill to appoint board members.  In a previous Ministry I had the opportunity to appoint a full board <i>de novo</i> and I appointed a team with different skills and voices representing a balanced overview of the area they looked after.  In this instance, the board will cover the entire sector and, therefore, I would like to appoint people with a knowledge of different aspects of the third level sector.  The reason I am not nominating stakeholders is, for example, if the Irish Universities Association nominates someone, the person will feel he or she has to represent the views of that organisation.  If people have a knowledge of the sector but are appointed in their own right, they will not necessarily be beholden to the university sector or the sectors they come from.  I hope to reflect the entire spectrum of the education system and that students, administrators, staff and academics will be able to recognise a kindred spirit or somebody who at least understands their role in the higher education system.  I assure the House no thought has been given to the composition of the board.</P>
        <P>I look forward to amendments from Senators on Committee Stage.  I will examine the question of court cases and the autonomy of the CAO and why we want those powers.</P>
        <P>Senators Keane and Zappone referred to the application of prior learning and how that would be recognised and to the savings that will be generated by these proposals.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill welcomed the decision in which I took an active part to retain the NUI.  A key element in the internationalisation strategy for Irish education is a college with a national reputation.  We are dealing with parts of the world, for example, the Middle East, which are quite statist in their approach.  The Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland is recognised and validated by the NUI.  The NUI provides a benchmark, quality and comfort that we should not jettison because it no longer applies in the way it did in 1909 when colleges were established.</P>
        <P>The cost of third level education for parents with a number of children in college was also referred to by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill.  My first thought was that it was unfortunate that each student found a course in three different universities when he recounted his clinic case.  This is a problem but parents make extraordinary sacrifices to give their children an education.  I recall when I was struggling years ago as an architectural student, trying to get my head around the periodic table, my father saying to me that I should keep studying and not give up because no matter how difficult I would find it, no bank or recession or economic downturn can take away my qualification.  Very few of his generation had gone to third level college and his advice is apposite now.  A qualification is costly and how it is paid for is secondary.  Third level education <Col N="145"/>costs money and how we, as a society, fund it is a secondary issue but part and parcel of the difficulty, according to the Provost of Trinity College, Dr. Prendergast, is the ratio of academic staff to students has deteriorated in the academic sphere.  This is one of the criteria measured by the QS world university rankings and other agencies and we have to be conscious of its impact.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this matter and I am glad the Minister is present to respond.  I refer to the issue of development charges and the impact they could have on restricting economic development.  The charges have been with us for a while and they have been a significant revenue source for local authorities.  A review of the charge was carried out a few years ago when I was a member of Cork City Council.  Our approach was to examine future development and what would be needed.  We sought to strike a balance between existing development and proposed developments and contributions were made in an open and transparent manner and there was accountability at the time.  However, circumstances have changed and these charges still attach as a condition of planning permission.  In some cases, the charge is high and it is a disincentive to development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Cork City Council still has the same charge while Cork and Limerick County Councils have reduced it in an effort to encourage economic development.  I received an e-mail drawing my attention to a planning application granted in Cork earlier this month for a scheme on the docklands.  The development comprised 61,000 sq. m of office space and 18,000 sq. m of business and technology space.  It is a substantial proposal for which the development charge is &euro;31 million but no financial institution will lend money on that basis.  The reason I have raised this issue is to ascertain what plans the Minister and the Department have to ensure excessive development charges are reduced to encourage development.  There must be a balance.  If these developments go ahead, everybody employed in their construction will spend money and benefit the economy.  Local authorities and county and city managers must examine the situation because it is not uniform throughout the country.  In many cases there is a disincentive towards development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the Minister can also clarify something else for me.  I understand that development contributions have been waived by local authorities for any loans and developments with which NAMA has been associated.  Is that true and who decides who should or should not pay?</P>

      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.</P><Col N="146"/>
        <P>The Senator will be well aware that a key objective of the programme for Government is to get people back to work.  This is being reflected in policy and programme development across all Departments, agencies and local authorities and will continue as a key priority over the coming years.  Local authorities, including in their role as planning authorities, are acutely aware of the contribution they must make to economic recovery, to employment creation and sustainment and in directly influencing investment decisions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The statutory basis for the operation of the various development contribution schemes is set out in the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2010.  The process set out under the Acts provides for a considerable degree of transparency in the making of development contribution schemes and a high level of public consultation.  It is important to note in that regard development contributions may only be levied in accordance with a development contribution scheme formally drawn up by the planning authority and approved by the elected members following a public consultation process.  As well as having responsibility for the statutory planning code, my Department also provides the policy guidance framework for development contributions.  This guidance is designed, <i>inter alia,</i> to assist planning authorities to achieve, through their development contribution schemes, a balance between the costs of the services provided and the need to support economic activity.  At the same time, the guidance also makes clear that the adoption of development contribution schemes remains a reserved function.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have witnessed a steep decline in revenues from these schemes and it is certain that income from development contributions will continue to be adversely impacted in the current economic climate.  This reflects wider economic trends.  It is important to acknowledge also that a number of local authorities have already responded to the very difficult economic circumstances that currently exist by amending their respective development contribution schemes to reduce the contribution rates, in particular for employment generating projects.  For example, Louth County Council has halved its development contribution rates for expansions to authorised industrial and manufacturing operations, IDA or Enterprise Ireland supported manufacturing, international trade and financial services sector and businesses grant aided by the county enterprise board or other recognised local development agencies.  The Department is also aware that, in some cases, the payment of development contributions has been phased by local authorities to reflect difficulties at a local level while also supporting economic activity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department is preparing updated guidance for local authorities on the issue of development contributions which will require local authorities,<i> inter alia,</i> to consider the impact of development contributions on businesses and competitiveness generally in the development of their schemes.  Authorities whose development contribution schemes have come up for renewal since the announcement of the Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative have been advised to consider providing reductions or exemptions in development contribution rates where these would help progress the jobs initiative.  In particular, planning authorities have been advised to satisfy themselves that due consideration has been given to measures open to them to support new, or existing enterprises in their area by, for example, the deferral of payments, having regard to the overall funding position, contractual commitments entered into and the importance of projects funded through development contributions in supporting local employment.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the new guidance will enable authorities to achieve the right balance into the future between generating the revenues required to provide the necessary infrastructure associated with new development and creating the right conditions to support economic activity and renewal.  I will follow up on the question raised by Senator Clune on NAMA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am glad the Minister of State will follow up on that issue.  He mentioned guidance and guidelines but will he inform local authorities directly that these are <Col N="147"/>strict guidelines?  The planning application to which I referred was granted earlier this month.  The Minister of State has said that guidance was given to local authorities after the jobs initiative, but the local authority did not adhere to those guidelines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The guidelines were there, but the updated guidance will be issued shortly to the local authority and I hope it will clarify the issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  T&aacute; beag&aacute;n d&iacute;om&aacute; orm nach bhfuil an tAire &Oacute; h&Oacute;g&aacute;in anseo leis an gceist seo a fhreagairt mar is ceist f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach &iacute; i gcomhth&eacute;acs na Gaeltachta agus s&iacute;lim go bhfuil ceist le freagairt aige.</P>
        <P Just="Left">T&aacute;im ag caint faoi Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, MFG.  Go minic nuair a bh&iacute;onn jabanna  &aacute; chailli&uacute;int ar fud na t&iacute;re, feiceann muid Air&iacute; agus Air&iacute; St&aacute;it ag l&eacute;imneach suas agus anuas agus ag d&eacute;anamh sc&eacute;il chailleach an uaf&aacute;is os comhair na ceamara&iacute; teilif&iacute;se agus raid&iacute;&oacute;, ach is beag caint at&aacute; d&eacute;anta faoi MFG.  T&aacute; 130 jabanna sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ag imeacht mar gheall ar an teip at&aacute; ar an gcomhlacht seo agus t&aacute; ceisteanna tromch&uacute;iseacha le freagairt faoi sin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; curtha in i&uacute;l go r&iacute;-mhinic agam f&eacute;in agus ag daoine eile go raibh deacrachta&iacute; le Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta le roinnt blianta anuas.  Go deimhin, d&rsquo;ordaigh an t-iar Aire go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; c&uacute;pla ini&uacute;chadh ar an gcomhlacht &oacute; thaobh chleachtais bhainist&iacute;ochta an bord sti&uacute;rtha agus iad ag comhl&iacute;onadh a ndualgas, c&uacute;rsa&iacute; airgeadais agus mar sin de.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Chonaic muid an tseachtain seo caite go bfhuil an comhlacht le scor, go bhfuil na jabanna le himeacht, go bhfuil cuid de na cl&aacute;ir le cur ina &aacute;it &eacute;iginnte agus nach bhfuil s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir c&eacute;n todhcha&iacute; a bheidh ag an chuid eile.  T&aacute; imn&iacute; orainn &oacute; thaobh na ndaoine at&aacute; fostaithe sna comhlachta&iacute;, agus imn&iacute; orainn freisin i dtaobh na ndaoine ar a bhfuil na cl&aacute;ir seo ag freastal.  Le coic&iacute;s anuas, t&aacute;im ag iarraidh soil&eacute;irithe a fhail &oacute; Phobal, &oacute;n Roinn agus &oacute;n gcomhlacht f&eacute;in faoi c&eacute;ard at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute;.  T&aacute; fait&iacute;os orm go bhfuil daoine ag dul ar ch&uacute;l sceiche le cuid den sc&eacute;al seo.</P>
        <P>I will revert to English to make this point.  I believe there is significant buck passing happening in the Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta scenario.  We have the Department funding programmes through Pobal to the independent company, Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta which operates State-funded programmes.  When one asks MFG what is going on, one is told it is a question for Pobal.  When one asks Pobal, it says it cannot say anything until it talks to the Department and when one talks to the Department, one is told it is an issue for the independent company, Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta.  This is completely unacceptable.  There are 130 jobs in the balance but this has not made the media headlines it should have and when I have asked for answers, they have not been forthcoming.</P>
        <P>We have been raising serious governance issues about this company for quite a long time.  As far back as three years ago, the directors of the company were written to by certain parties warning them of their responsibilities as directors with regard to the governance of the programmes they administer.  These are all State sponsored programmes.  Three of these programmes were audited approximately a year and a half ago by Pobal, but the report has not been published despite our calls for its publication.  I have seen a copy of the report and it raises massive issues regarding the governance of the company.  Why did the Department and the Minister not step in sooner?  Why has Pobal not acted and why was the board of directors of Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta not held to task before we ended up in a scenario where the company is to close down &mdash; I believe there is talk of it being liquidated &mdash; and 130 jobs are to go?  It is an incredibly serious issue and the people of the Gaeltacht are dismayed and angry that the reaction to the news has been so slow and muted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sin &iacute; mo cheist agus sin an f&aacute;th gur chuir m&eacute; an cheist.  Cuirfidh m&eacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh an bhfreagra &oacute;n Aire St&aacute;it.</P>

	<P>The Minister is away on Government business and cannot be here.</P>
        <P>Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta Teoranta, MFG, is an independent company with its own board of management and memorandum and articles of association which has responsibility under company law for the proper stewardship of the company.  My Department has no role in the internal operations of local development or partnership companies and, therefore, does not have a role in staff matters, which are for the board of the company as the employer, to manage.</P>
        <P>Pobal, which manages programmes on behalf of the Department, commenced an audit of MFG in January 2010.  The audit findings and associated recommendations were notified to MFG in June 2010.  An independent executive, Mazars, was appointed by Pobal to MFG on 30 June 2011 to examine the outstanding audit issues and to identify suitable mechanisms for their resolution.  The executive presented its interim findings to Pobal in mid-August 2011 and presented its recommendations and progress to the board of MFG on 7 September 2011.  The final status on the recommendations was scheduled to be presented by the independent executive to Pobal by 30 September 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">MFG has confirmed that its board, on examination of the company&rsquo;s financial situation, took the decision to cease trading as of 4 p.m. on 7 September 2011 on the basis of insolvency.  The board has also confirmed that all staff contracts have been terminated since the board meeting.  The Department and Pobal met MFG and the independent executive, Mazars, on 9 September 2011 to establish the facts with regard to the specific decisions taken by the company and on its progress on implementing these decisions.  The company was strongly encouraged to avail of financial advice alongside the legal advice, which it was stressed was imperative, and it was encouraged to access the same immediately.  It also committed to immediately effect all other necessary work to meet its statutory obligations with regard to staff.  It was agreed at that meeting that MFG would take full legal advice on the necessary steps in this process and ensure it fulfils all statutory duties in that respect.  The Department and Pobal are awaiting a written update on the implementation of this work.  Pobal will continue to offer any appropriate support to aid this work.  In parallel, my Department and Pobal are examining mechanisms to support the continuation of services previously supplied by MFG within the Gaeltacht areas.  However, it should be noted that MFG is a private limited company and it is beyond the remit of my Department to direct the business of such a company in any way.  It is the responsibility of the company&rsquo;s board of directors to fulfil all its obligations under company and employment law.  As the Senator will know, the issue of employee rights is the responsibility of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation while responsibility for welfare rights rests with the Department of Social Protection.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Minister of State is saying that he has no right to interfere with an independent company, but the programmes are State programmes that are directed by the Department.  Guidelines are laid down for the proper implementation of the Leader programme, the LCD programme, the CSP programme, etc.  Does the Minister of State agree that this gives him a right and that the Department should have stepped in sooner?  If it had a report in June 2010 that showed up such deficiencies in the company, why did he not act sooner so that, instead of the jobs going, the company could perhaps have been salvaged and the jobs saved?</P>
