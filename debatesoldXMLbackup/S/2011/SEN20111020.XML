	<P>I have received notice from Senator Averil Power that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to ensure that a strategy is put in place between his Department, Dublin City Council and other relevant agencies to address the needs of the residents of Priory Hall.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not oppose the Order of Business.  The fallout from the job losses at Aviva continues to reverberate throughout the country.  It is now obvious that there are some underlying difficulties affecting not only Aviva, but also the wider financial services industry.  It seems apparent that our high cost base has led to job losses in many companies operating here, coupled with the meltdown in the financial services industry.</P>
        <P>I suggest to the Leader that the Government should show greater commitment to encouraging more people to take out private pensions.  It is extraordinary that at a time when the insurance industry, and the financial industry in general, is in meltdown the Government is proposing to further reduce the attractiveness of private pensions by imposing additional financial penalties on people.  I refer in particular to the commitment in the programme for Government to reduce the tax rates, which is illogical.  Over 50% of the workforce do not have private pensions.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund set up by the former Minister for Finance, <Col N="962"/>Charlie McCreevy, has been raided to the point where it is now down to &euro;5 billion.  Unquestionably, there is a pensions time bomb looming if not for our generation then the next.  When one considers that the Government took the initiative to introduce a levy of 1% on all premiums, a 0.6% levy on the private pension funds and a 2% levy on general insurance, which will take effect next year, it is not surprising that a major player, such as Aviva is pulling out of the country.  What is particularly significant, however, are their reasons for leaving.  It seems to be almost as a result of high wages and prices.</P>
        <P>I suggest to the Leader that the Government must embark on an urgent review of the relationship between high prices and high wages.  Mr. Brendan Keenan, a respected economist, states in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> that all of us, including politicians and trade union leaders, are justifying high wages because of higher prices.  It is a vicious circle.  Jobs will continue to be lost unless the Government takes action and I propose that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, should outline the Government&rsquo;s response to these job loses in the House.</P>
        <P>The Government cannot continue to wring its hands and blame the international trading environment or the euro crisis for what now seems to be the tip of the iceberg.  Not only have jobs been lost in Aviva, but another 40 jobs have been lost overnight in the pharmaceutical company, Merk Sharp and Dohme, which has been in Rathdrum, County Wicklow since 1961.</P>
        <P>It seems clear now there is a direct link between high prices and wages.  It is a vicious cycle and it is past time to ensure we do not have a further haemorrhage of jobs and that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, should attend the House in advance of the budget and outline exactly what the Government is doing to protect the jobs we have.  It is inevitable, sadly, that we will lose more jobs.</P>
        <P>There is an article in today&rsquo;s newspaper about begging in our streets.  The Roma gypsies are operating in the city centre and in towns and villages across the county.  The Garda issued a statement that one Roma gypsy in Dublin, who was identified as a bare footed beggar, operating in the Grafton Street area was found to have &euro;1,500 on him.  According to the Garda he has more runners in his house than Footlocker because people are buying runners for him when they see him in his bare feet.  I am sure the Leader will agree that well intentioned people should be actively discouraged from giving money to these people.  I am not referring to people who are out begging because of economic circumstances.</P>
        <P>This is a well controlled and organised group of Roma gypsies that are specifically operating here.  There have been almost 500 prosecutions since the anti-begging laws were introduced in February 2011.  Again, it might be worth considering a review of the begging laws.  Begging in itself is not a criminal offence, it is the aggressive nature of begging that is the offence and it goes to show how aggressive they are that the Garda have secured 500 prosecutions.  I am sure the Leader will agree with me that the good citizens, who are well intentioned in giving money to plaintive looking bare footed beggars, are contributing to a well organised crime syndicate.  I praise the Garda for the manner in which this group has been identified.  It arrested many of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I concur with many of the sentiments expressed by Senator Mooney on Aviva.  I know this industry from my years in the insurance business as an agent of Hibernian Insurance in the early 1980s.  It developed from Hibernian Insurance and merged with Norwich Union to become a large company with a great future, Aviva.  The cost of running an insurance company like Aviva in Ireland has proven to be difficult.  Having spoken to its staff over the past few months, who could see what was coming down the line for Aviva, it was clear that many were critical of the management structure and the costs they were incurring.  The com<Col N="963"/>pany was located in Haddington Road in the former Hibernian Insurance headquarters and it spread throughout the country and moved to premises in the Rathmines area.  The cost of relocation was substantial but I stand to be corrected.</P>
        <P>The view of many Aviva staff members was the company was being run by salesmen rather than people who had a corporate governance background.  This did not help the development of Aviva during the good times.  Many insurance companies and banks headed down the direction of overselling rather than looking to the future.  Unfortunately, Aviva is suffering.  I do not believe the pension business in Aviva is struggling as it is in the separate life end of the business and the increase in pension charges does not impact on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Aviva operation in Ireland concentrates on motor, household and personal and commercial business.  The comments of the economist that the cost base is too expensive are true.  I ask that the Minister should attend the House to give us an overview of his analysis of the general insurance business throughout the county and not just Aviva, but the large players such as Zurich, Allianz and other companies that have a long tradition in Ireland and have contributed immensely to the business and personal fortunes of Irish citizens.  I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, or the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to give us their feedback from the other companies providing general insurance.  People have insurance on their car, house or business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like Senator Harte, I too find myself very largely in agreement with our good friend and colleague opposite, Senator Mooney.  I concur with his views on the Romas in our capital city.  Sadly, the Roma gypsies are spread throughout the country.  A group of Roma gypsies came to Killarney; they are like an organised cell, with emigrant remittances going the wrong way.  The money was going through Western Union to Romania.  The sad thing is that genuine beggars are getting a bad name, the people who need to collect a few bob to survive, and eat and clothe themselves.</P>
        <P>We must discriminate when giving charity.  I did not know about the bare footed Roma on Grafton Street, to whom Senator Mooney referred, having more runners than could be found in a shop.  The begging laws were amended and improved and the Garda have been able to discover these groups but we must be on our watch.  The pervasive presence of beggars in the capital city is not good for our image.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I defer to the Leader in that regard.  Senator Mooney might have views about that too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>It would require a review of the Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the discussion of the Keane report at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, an apparent anomaly arose in regard to the rights of tenants in buy-to-let schemes where the landlord defaults.  Apparently the tenants could lose their houses, even though they are not the defaulting party.  The issue was raised by FLAC and Threshold.  Mr. Keane said it had not come to his attention when they were working on the report.  I doubled checked it with FLAC and Threshold after the meeting.  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Penrose, and also with a person of legal training.  It seems very strange that the tenants do not enjoy legal protection where they pay the rent but where the landlord defaults in one of the buy-to-let schemes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I had the pleasure this morning of having breakfast with Science Foundation Ireland.  Those of us who were lucky enough to attend heard about a treasure trove of activity that is almost like a parallel universe.  People are working to try to improve weather forecasting, rebuild bone, identify the fastest racehorses in the world and to cure seizures in tiny babies.  It is cause for great optimism that such work is progressing and is being funded in this country.  Could we have a debate on how we could support that work?  We could do so specifically in one area by forming some type of cross-party scientific group.  This was discussed at the meeting this morning.  Perhaps the House could take a lead on this.  We might not be scientists but we can at least show our support for the work and expertise being built up and coming to this country.  Perhaps if parliamentarians understood this work more effectively we could contribute to what they need.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was not present for the debate yesterday on the motion tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il regarding Army barracks and the Defence Forces.  However, I listened to most of the debate and to the Minister&rsquo;s response.  It was an appalling debate, the worst that has taken place in this House since I became a Member.  It was not a debate.  There was no constructive analysis or comment from the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is inappropriate to reopen yesterday&rsquo;s debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am making a point about the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator must ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question for the Leader about it.  The Minister&rsquo;s response was absolutely appalling, as was the response from the Government Members of the House.  They did not address any of the issues that were put to them.  It is important that the Minister return to the House to answer the questions that were put to him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will respond.  There is no point going back over the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Rather than attacking Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in, the Minister should have addressed the substance of the motion.  When people who were in the Gallery for the debate left they were absolutely shocked by the performance of the Government parties, especially the Labour Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>If that is the quality of debate we will have in the future&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is making a statement on yesterday&rsquo;s debate and that is inappropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;it says a great deal about the Government.  Will the Leader ensure that the Minister who was here yesterday returns to the Chamber to address the issues raised in the motion tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il and the amendment tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in, and that he does so in a constructive way?  Will he also ensure that we have constructive debates in this House and not have Ministers coming to the Chamber to use Private Members&rsquo; business to attack the Opposition rather than deal with the substance of the motions?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>My second point relates to jobs.  I support the calls for a debate on jobs.  There is no doubt that the Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative is an abysmal failure.  I do not see any of the jobs the Government promised to create.  I do not see how the jobs initiative has done anything to lift the domestic economy.  All we see are more job losses.  A further 26 manufacturing jobs were lost in Waterford this week, in addition to the 575 job losses in TalkTalk and the 950 job losses in Aviva Insurance.  Far from jobs being created, we continue to see more jobs lost.  It is important that we again have a debate on the fact that 450,000 people are out of work.  Young people are still being forced to emigrate.  Rather than blaming the previous Government and the Opposition, the Government should be delivering the jobs and investment that the people need to get this country back on track.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I was ruled out of order twice last week for asking a question about the Central Bank.  Is this a party political broadcast or statement?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is not a point of order, as the Senator is well aware.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Keane was obviously not present yesterday.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be no engagement across the floor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>What we got from the Minister was a party political broadcast.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that when they were in opposition, every day in the D&aacute;il we got party political broadcasts by Deputy Eamon Gilmore and members of the Labour Party.  Now that they are in government all they can do is blame the previous Government.</P>

	<P>I agree with my colleagues, particularly Senator Paul Coghlan, on the Roma gypsy issue.  There are people of all nationalities in this country who are in difficulty but these organised gangs do not appear to fall into that category.  I cannot put it any better than Senator Mooney and Senator Paul Coghlan.  However, the Minister for Justice and Equality is a very reasonable and efficient man and I hope he will find time in his busy schedule to deal with this serious issue.  The Roma gypsies prey on the vulnerability of people like me.  I feel guilty when I walk past those people and do not give them money.  It is a serious issue and the Minister would be well advised to take the time to examine it.  I ask the Leader to discuss the matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader confirm the date the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, is coming to the Seanad?  Will he consider taking No. 16, motion No. 3, on the Order Paper, which relates to Roscommon hospital, on that date?  The Leader can take it that there will be a question to the Minister and that Roscommon hospital will feature in the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will make sure of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation there is very serious.  We have lost the accident and emergency service and it is causing great concern as we go into the winter months.  I will ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
        <P>Second, I do not expect a reply from the Leader today but will he examine the situation regarding the Lisbon treaty?  Under the Lisbon treaty this House was required to scrutinise European legislation.  That has not been the case since our election to the House.  In fact, the European affairs committee is no longer scrutinising legislation.  The foreign affairs and some other joint committees are scrutinising it.  However, the legislation is building up and an enormous amount is not being given proper scrutiny in either House.</P>
        <P>Only this House or the D&aacute;il can refer legislation back through a system of rejection or reconsideration.  Will the Leader consider this matter and see if we can devote, perhaps, one day every two weeks to European legislation?  We could sit on a Thursday or Friday to do so. <Col N="967"/> Perhaps the Leader would ask his advisers to examine this issue and see if we could accommodate the scrutiny of legislation from Europe.  I do not believe any committee has knowledge that is equal to what is available in this House.  All the committees&rsquo; members are nominated but this House represents the entire country and its different views.</P>

	<P>I sympathise, up to a point, with what has been said about begging and the presence of particular scamsters on our streets.  However, is it really helpful or useful or does it add anything to the debate to identify the provenance of particular scamsters?  The truth is that we have plenty of home-grown types who engage in similar behaviour.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We should always question that.  I do not criticise the bona fides of my colleagues but we should always question why it is necessary because I know one lady, who is a home-grown person with a particularly plaintive voice, who has been chilling me to the marrow for years.  It is only because I have been seeing her for the best part of 20 years that the situation cannot continue to be as urgent as her voice indicates.  We need to tackle this behaviour and we should not be unduly concerned with identifying the nationality or the ethnicity of the people because of the problem.</P>

	<P>The budget is coming up and the Department of Education and Skills proposes to make savings of &euro;1 billion over the next four years.  The Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin, Michael Jackson, has rightly raised the particular needs and issues facing Church of Ireland national schools.  He is concerned about the State&rsquo;s long-term commitment to sustained provision of school transport in rural areas.  There is a challenge facing Church of Ireland schools if school transport is affected.  Parents will perhaps choose schools that are closer to them.  If we are only focused on the financial bottom line, there is a danger that we could undermine the texture and diversity of the school system.  The archbishop is right to make the point he has made and the Government should heed his concerns and those of the Church of Ireland community in regard to education.</P>

	<P>Last night debate&rsquo;s on the possible closure of Army barracks was not the most edifying that I have attended.  Both sides of the House will agree on that.  There was a feeling that it was not the best way to reflect and represent the views that had been brought to us from the various areas in question.  Many of the challenges we face cause a great deal of frustration and part of the frustration is fed by the sense of helplessness we all feel.  We had better realise that the helplessness and frustration will permeate many issues inside and outside the House.</P>
        <P>One issue worth debating in the House &mdash; the Taoiseach should come to the House participate in the debate &mdash; is the contribution community organisations make.  When there are economic and other pressures or emergencies, the gap is generally filled quickly by these organisations.  My home town, Cashel, has 37 community organisations, which cover a wide spectrum of activity, including sport, culture and charity.  While many of us are involved in debates and <Col N="968"/>trying to find solutions to the bigger issues, these people are at the coal face and they act urgently and quickly to help in any way they can.  The purpose of the debate would be to outline the ways and means we can help these organisations financially and with other resources.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The debate should take place prior to the budget.  I suggest the Taoiseach should take part in the debate because he is focused on this issue and because individual Ministers will only deal with one aspect of it.  We had a wonderful debate on the arts with the Ministers for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht but we need a broader debate.  Given that there are many Departments and agencies involved, the Taoiseach would be the right person to come to the House.  This would also send an exceptionally good message.  We need positivity and that is the bedrock of community organisations.  They do not waste time with negative discussion and looking for scapegoats; they just get on the work.  If the debate takes place, I have suggestions on how we can help without putting pressure on the Exchequer.  I have another direction on which I could make recommendations that would provide resources but would not the cost the Exchequer.  The Leader has been helpful on many occasions and not just to make the House more relevant.  That is not the reason I raise this issue.  We have a huge powerhouse at our disposal, which reaches into every village, town and city.</P>
        <P>I take the comment made by Senator D&rsquo;Arcy earlier this week.  There are some issues about which we should not be partisan and on which there should be unanimity.  This is one area where every Member could set an example and instead of feeding frustration, we could come up with answers and use the outlet provided by community organisations.  If the Taoiseach could find the time to come to the House, it could lead to something important in these difficult and challenging times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s request for a debate because we are all very much aware of the contribution community organisations make to life throughout the country.  A debate would show them we are interested and support what they are doing.  An economic benefit could derive from us all putting our heads together to discuss this matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane was rather negative.  He is unfair to the Government by saying no effort has been made to create jobs.  When the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Government outlined their strategy in this regard, they indicated that what was being put in place would be just the first phase.  Will the Leader facilitate at an early stage a further discussion with the Minister on job creation?  The biggest crisis facing the country is unemployment, with 450,000 on the live register, and the number of young people emigrating.  The matter needs to be discussed but it must be acknowledged that progress is being made.  The reduction in the VAT rate and so on were positive initiatives and, for example, jobs were created in the tourism industry.  I would like another debate on how all of us might contribute to assisting the Government and make the next leap and significant contribution to the jobs crisis facing the country.  I am sure the Minister would be prepared to come to the House to listen to what Members have to say while taking on board shortcomings and failings and positive contributions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I was impressed by Senator Leyden&rsquo;s reference to the ability of both Houses to scrutinise European legislation.  In the past, we had a Joint Committee on European Scrutiny but we do not have that any more and I am not sure whether that legislation is being scrutinised.  The House could well play an active part in this.  The reason I raise this is comments yesterday by the British Lord Chief Justice, where he argued the case regarding European Court of Human Rights decisions.  He said there was an arguable case that judges should take <Col N="969"/>account of decisions from Strasbourg but not be bound by them.  I do not know where we stand but the British are saying judges can take decisions into account but are not bound by them.</P>
        <P>The EU legislation, which we support to a large extent, needs scrutiny.  When that discussion took place yesterday, the Home Secretary in Britain, Theresa May, called for the scrapping of their human rights Act.  It was based on one thing which was that an illegal immigrant could not be deported because he had a pet cat.  Human rights legislation from Strasbourg had overridden their legislation.  I hope we are in a better position than the British in this area but I am not sure because we do not have a committee to scrutinise legislation.  I am not sure how well we are scrutinising legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; made a very strong statement on community efforts.  There is a huge need for that.  Active citizenship is alive and well in the country.  What can be done by the State?  State bodies can do something, without it costing money.  For example, RTE has committed itself to a series of programmes starting in two weeks&rsquo; time called &ldquo;Local Heroes &mdash; A Town Fights Back&rdquo;.  It selected the town of Drogheda and identified how that town can work together.  It does not put money into the town but acts as a catalyst to the communities in the town to do things for themselves.  It will be very interesting but it would not necessarily have happened without RTE saying it believes it has a public service broadcasting obligation to do the right thing.  It is helping to start this movement in this particular town.  Other State bodies could do something similar, using their own abilities.</P>

	<P>Yesterday, Members received a briefing from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Will the Leader raise the following issue with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte?  When somebody gets a grant to improve the insulation in his or her home, which incidentally I am getting done next Tuesday, there is no measurement of the building energy rating before the grant is provided, although there is a measurement after the work is done.</P>
        <P>The idea of this is to reduce energy use in terms of fuel, etc.  We are giving grants to people but we are not measuring the improvements made.  That is a very important point and it should be incorporated into this scheme.  A test should be done before the work commences and not after it.  Will the Leader raise this with the Minister?  We are giving out millions of euro.  It is a brilliant scheme and the provision of this money is creating 6,000 jobs currently.  Will Leader raise this so we have proper measurement of the improvements made?</P>

	<P>Ar eagla go mbeimid ro-dhi&uacute;ltach ar fad ar maidin, t&aacute; moladh dearfach le d&eacute;anamh agam.  I would like to inject a note of positivity into the morning.  I note my esteemed colleague, Senator Micheal Mullins, asked us to be a bit more positive, so we will be.  However, we will be more positive when we see some more jobs come from the jobs initiative.</P>
        <P>I would like to suggest a very positive debate which could link up tourism, natural resources and international relations and make us much more esteemed on a European level.  We should ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, to come to the House for a debate on the links between this country and Norway.  Norway is a very interesting country.  Its population is roughly the same size as Ireland&rsquo;s and there are a large number of similarities.  It has a multilingual culture and a very good education system.  It has a maritime culture and it gets great use out of its petroleum, gas, fishing, farming, etc.  It has a very rural population.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to explain why this will be so useful in terms of a debate.  We have a lot to learn from Norway.  Norway twice refused to join the EU but it still has good and positive trade relations with the European Union which are very favourable to it as a country.  We would have a huge amount to learn from Norway and it would be very interesting to find out from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade what steps have been taken to create and foster better relations with Norway, to learn how it has set up its engagement with multinational companies which exploit their natural resource, for example, how it has come to have such good education and welfare systems and how it has such good links with the European Union, although it is outside it.  That would be a very important and useful debate.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Other Senators were not interrupted when their contributions were protracted.  From a tourism perspective, there is the Viking link.  People in Norway have plenty money and it would be interesting to try to get more of them to come to this country to spend some of that money here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade comes to the House, we could ask him another serious question.  Why are there 14 special advisers to the Government who are getting paid more than what is in the guidelines it laid down?

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Leader to arrange a debate on the future of the retail trade, in particular small shops in rural Ireland.  I refer to the small hardware shop, the boutique and the menswear shop, as in my case.  This sector is really struggling.  It has been part of the fabric of Irish life for generations.  Family businesses have been handed down from one generation to the next.  I happen to be the fourth generation in my particular business and that is quite common.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>A fine shop it is too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator.  His custom is greatly valued.</P>
        <P>The future is very bleak.  Sales and turnover are down and costs remains high.  I am not talking about the large multiples like Lidl or Aldi.  When one of those opens in a town, four or five small businesses close.  There is competition which we respect but it is high time we looked at the contribution the retail trade has made to this country in terms of creating employment.</P>
        <P>We were all rightly shocked at the news that 1,000 jobs will be lost in Aviva.  It is a war of attrition with small shops trying to hold on to their staff.  Everything is paid to the minimum.  I know of shopkeepers who are taking lightbulbs from their shops to cut down on light and heat.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is well made, Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When family farms were under pressure the Government of the day went to their aid, rightly so, in the form of subventions, payments and other supports.  I do not see any level of support coming from the sector to which I referred.  Rates and service charges <Col N="972"/>still have to be paid and insurance has to be covered.  It is remorseless and every time a door closes two or three jobs are lost.  I ask the Leader to try to get the relevant Minister to come to the House to determine how we can approach the issue while there is still time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I am afraid my point contains more negativity because there is another threat to a great deal of jobs in this country.  It is nearly November.  On 5 December, EU legislation will be introduced on the agency workers directive, something I am not sure Senators are aware of.  It has two main aspects, equality and removal of restrictions.  It must be enacted into Irish law by 5 December, a date which is almost upon us.  Before we know it thousands of jobs will be lost overnight.  In the first three months of this year agency and temporary workers accounted for 9,000 people and &euro;35 million.  </P>
        <P>My company employs 100 full-time and 100 part-time staff.  We are lucky enough to have won a large export contract.  I am fortunate in that I am able to bring in temporary workers at the drop of a hat to help me in my factory for two or three months.  If the directive is transposed, if my receptionist, who is 48 years of age, is out on sick leave for six months and I take in an 18 year old, I will need to pay him or her the same salary and treatment as if he or she has been with me for 15 years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I implore Senators to listen to me on this issue.  A survey in the UK conducted by the CBI showed that there was potential for a 25% reduction in the use of agency workers.  If the same percentage reduction were to occur in Ireland, it would lead to the loss of approximately 8,000 jobs.  It was announced yesterday that 950 jobs would be lost.  I call on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to come to the House and discuss this issue as a matter of urgency as we cannot afford to shed further jobs in the economy.  The Government is in a position to mitigate the impact of the directive and reduce job losses associated with temporary agency workers and the agency profession.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach is correct.  I am raising the issue on the Order of Business because it points to the disconnect in thinking between different agencies in the State.  When this issue is resolved &mdash; it can be resolved very easily but it needs a ministerial push &mdash; we could have a debate on the lack of joined up thinking in our agencies.  South Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council cannot seem to sort out this single housing issue.  While we do not discuss individual cases, the case to which I referred merits a mention in the House.  I will pass the details of the case to the Leader.  Perhaps he would see if he could resolve it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to reiterate a request I made to the Leader a fortnight ago.  I asked the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come to the House as soon as possible to discuss the future funding of CAP and the way in which funding will be spent in this country.  As my colleagues will know, last week initial proposals were made public.  The bottom line is that it seems Ireland will continue to receive a significant level of European funding for agriculture in line with what we already receive. </P>
        <P>The debate will have to be very engaged and detailed in terms of how those moneys will be spent.  A major choice faces the Minister, political system and farming organisations in terms of how we spend the money and the future we see for farmers in Ireland, in particular small farmers who currently have grave income problems and have not benefited as much as they should have over the past ten or 15 years from European funding.  There will be a choice and debate which will cause difficulty and a certain degree of division but it needs to start as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Leader has been in contact with the Minister but he should try to come to the House for a debate because the architecture of the future of rural Ireland and farming can be put in place over the next 12 months.  It is a fundamentally important debate and will decide whether we want to keep smaller farmers and landholders on the land.  It is a debate worth having in the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator Mooney raised the meltdown in the financial services sector.  As I outlined yesterday, the insurance market declined by up to 30%, which is a cause for concern.  It is the aim of the Government to restore confidence and competitiveness to the economy, which is necessary.  Through its policies, the Government will endeavour to do that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Mooney, Coghlan, Noone, Mullen and others raised the question of begging in the streets and a review of the begging laws.  Legislation was introduced last year.  Aggressive begging and begging in businesses were prohibited.  If there is a need to change the law, I am sure the Minister will address the problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Harte and others raised the question of Aviva and the insurance industry in general.  Perhaps we can have debate on that issue next month.</P>
        <P>I will check the situation outlined by Senator Barrett in regard to FLAC and landlords and revert to him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe raised an important point on science and the possibility of a cross-party scientific group being formed.  It is important that we build on the successes of the past in science and look to the future.  It is an area in which we can build and have a good record.  We need to continue to progress our record.  If a cross-party scientific group will help we should consider it.</P>
        <P>Some Senators referred to last night&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion.  I do not intend to return to the debate but it could have been more edifying.</P><Col N="974"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Cullinane also raised the question of the 450,000 jobless people, as did Senator Mullins and others.  It is a crisis and the Government sees it as such.  The jobs initiative will not solve the jobs crisis.  It is a start, as was outlined by the Government.  We have seen an increase of over 13% in tourism in the first seven months of the year.  VAT has been reduced and I do not hear any of those who have availed of the reduction saying it has not helped to sustain their businesses.  We have built on the sustainable energy initiative, as was outlined. I know it is the job of the Opposition to be negative, but there are many positive things happening in our communities.  </P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; spoke about the role of community organisations.  To the best of my knowledge, we had a debate in this House on voluntarism not too long ago.  I agree with the Senator that community organisations and volunteers are the lifeblood of communities throughout the country.  We would welcome any suggestions which he has on the subject.  I will try to arrange a further debate on that matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn&rsquo;s contribution was on the same theme, namely, we have heroes in every community.  We look forward to seeing the local heroes programme on RTE.</P> <P>Senator Landy raised the issue of sustainable energy and grants.  The Senator made the good point that there is no BER measurement before works take place.  That is a serious matter.  There should be measurement before works take place.</P>

	<P>I am addressing the question raised by Senator Landy.  It would a serious problem if there was not measurement before and after works.  There is not much point measuring afterwards because it will not be possible to determine of what benefit the work has been.  It is a matter which can be raised with the Minister.  I am sure he will be interested to hear what the Senator has to say.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about the need for better relations with Norway.   As it stands, we have excellent relations and linkages with Norway which has excellent educational and other facilities.  It also has enormous gas and oil reserves, which helps in some small way in the provision of those facilities. </P><P Just="Left">Senator O'Sullivan spoke about the contribution of the retail sector in communities.  We all acknowledge that the retail sector is currently experiencing a difficult time.  Competition has hit some of the smaller shops hard.  We are all aware of the effect of the recession, in terms of spending power, on the retail sector in our communities and throughout the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien raised the important issue of the agency workers directive.  I am sure her comments and reservations in regard to this directive would be welcomed by the relevant committee dealing with this issue.  The Senator should, before a decision is made on the directive, make known her reservations to the relevant committee and Department.  She stated that the directive will create problems for many employers throughout the country.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I advise Members that the Seanad will deal next Tuesday with the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill and will debate the Keane report on Wednesday.  I remind them that the debate on the Keane report has been arranged at short notice at the request of several Members.  I suggest that our time with the Minister should be used wisely.  Rather than discussing the positives or negatives of the report, Senators should put forward concrete policy proposals for consideration.  I am aware that several Members have proposals in this regard, which we welcome.  We are all agreed that this is a serious issue.  It is hoped that the Seanad can assist in a positive way in broadening the discussion and developing a policy that will assist those in need in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>Before we discuss the specifics of the amendment, I would like to briefly set the context within which the amendment is made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators will be aware that road traffic legislation is probably the most challenged in the courts.  We must be so vigilant when introducing new legislation.  We need to ensure that it can withstand the vigour of legal scrutiny and do the job required.  I introduced this Bill in the Seanad a few weeks ago and with the assistance of Senators it passed all Stages.  As the Bill originated in the Seanad, I am required to advise Senators of an amendment agreed by the D&aacute;il on Report Stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the importance of the Bill, dealing as it does with the introduction of new drink driving provisions, we must ensure that the transition from old to new legislation is seamless.  This transitional phase must be managed carefully in order that appropriate consequences will apply to those who commit offences prior to the end of the old regime.  It is not possible to guarantee that legislation will be watertight but I am hoping that the D&aacute;il amendment approved yesterday will strengthen this legislation and eliminate a potential challenge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amendment is essentially a transitional measure drafted following consultation between my Department, the Office of the Attorney General and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While preparing for the changeover from the old to the new drink driving limits at the end of the month, my officials identified an issue in relation to the application of consequential disqualification orders following the commencement of section 65 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.    Section 65 substitutes section 26 of the principal Act and sets out the consequential disqualifications that will apply where intoxicated driving offences have been committed under sections 4 and 5 of the 2010 Act.  Currently, these offences arise under sections 49 and 50 of the principal Act.</P>
        <P>There was some concern that where proceedings are under way regarding offences that had been committed under sections 49 and 50, some difficulty might exist in applying the appropriate consequential disqualifications upon the commencement of section 65.  The advice of the Office of the Attorney General was sought and, as a result, the agreed amendment makes <Col N="977"/>explicit reference in the provision to offences under the old regime, namely sections 49 and 50.  This will ensure consequential disqualifications can apply in all cases as appropriate.</P>
        <P>I am sure all Senators will appreciate why I am anxious to fast-track this legislation.  These provisions are at the heart of our road safety agenda.  It is without question that legislation must be robust enough to ensure that appropriate consequences are properly applied where bad driving choices have been made.  By passing this Bill, we are strengthening the legislation in place and making way for new, more stringent drink driving limits to be introduced as early as next week prior to the October bank holiday.  This will send a strong message to all road users and should manifest itself in lives saved.  That is, after all, the ultimate reason for supporting this Bill.  Once again, I thank Senators for their support for the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill forward in the House.  I also wish to record my appreciation of the work done by the members of the outgoing dormant accounts board.  They have done the State some service.  There has been criticism of people who sit on boards and, perhaps correctly, of people who make a career of it.  However, people sit on boards either voluntarily or otherwise and it is no crime to receive a few bob for expenses.  We appreciate people who give their time, service and commitment to the State when they are asked to sit on boards.</P><Col N="978"/>
        <P>It is not due to any function of the dormant accounts board that it is being dismantled.  The programme for Government deals with quangos and other organisations, but as the dormant accounts fund is reducing there is less need for a board.  Indeed, since the 2005 legislation it was decided to bring the fund back within the remit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government so the board has been superseded.  I thank the Minister for the speed with which he is addressing matters within his Department, where he is proceeding with a reduction in the number of agencies from 21 to 12.  That process is ongoing.</P>

I welcome this legislation.  The disbandment of the board will mean a saving of between &euro;120,000 and &euro;150,000 per annum, which is welcome.  The Minister assured us on Second Stage that an audit is being carried out in the banks to ensure they are complying with the dormant accounts legislation and to ensure they are telling him the truth as to the amount of money in dormant accounts.  I also welcome that.  I hope some of those audits will be published at some point in the future.</P>
        <P>I welcome the work that has already been done by the dormant accounts fund.  That work would not have happened without the fund.  I hope the fund can continue long into the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation sets an example that we could follow in other areas.  We should examine legislation that was very sensible when it was enacted not too many years ago and recognise that it or a particular quango it established has served its time and purpose.  It is not always necessary to set up organisations and far too many were set up in the past.  I encourage the Minister and the Government to say what they will do to reduce many others as well.  In many cases the same can be done as was done in this case.</P>
        <P>I echo the words of Senator Keane to those who served on that board.  It is never comfortable to be appointed to a board and then to be told one is no longer needed.  However, that is exactly what happens when one does a good job, and this board has done a good job.  I intend shortly to propose that something similar be done in another area.

      </Speaker><Col N="979"/>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for remaining on for this debate.  The matter I wish to raise is very important.  Last night, I attended a meeting of about 130 residents of the Priory Hall development in the Regency Hotel, where they are currently staying.  People are very upset.  There are families with babies and small children and  elderly persons residing in hotel accommodation.  There are three or four people to one room.  In fairness, the hotel is doing its best to accommodate them but it is not suitable for families.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many people are affected by the situation in Priory Hall.  There are owner-occupiers, tenants who were renting accommodation and had to move out at short notice and those who bought properties in Priory Hall and have been renting them out.  Many ordinary families are struggling to pay mortgages on their primary residence and on their apartment in Priory Hall.  All these groups find themselves in dire circumstances through no fault of their own and in an emergency situation in regard to accommodation.</P>
        <P>I wish to avail of the opportunity to raise a number of issues.  The immediate difficulty for residents is housing and moving them into more appropriate accommodation.  Apartment accommodation is essential, especially for those with families but also for all concerned because they now have just basic amenities which we all take for granted, such as the ability to cook a meal.  It is all very well to stay in a hotel for a few days but to do so on a medium-term basis and face the prospect of having to do so for many weeks and months is not suitable, especially without access to belongings and the things we all take for granted.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council is paying for the hotel accommodation and is working with NAMA.  I am aware the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has been involved as a conduit in setting up that arrangement.  While NAMA has supplied a list of properties to Dublin City Council, it will take the council some time to work out their suitability and match people with them.  That is a priority.  There may be a need, beyond the NAMA properties, to find other solutions for some of the families, so I would ask for flexibility in that regard.</P>
        <P>A number of other issues were raised last night, including the fact that the residents have mortgages on their properties.  The view in some cases was that lenders are compassionate and have told people that they cannot get into their homes as they are uninhabitable.  Owner-occupiers cannot live there and those who were renting cannot get rental income on them during the next few months.  Some lenders and some individuals, because the practice is mixed within the same bank, are getting different treatment.  Some lenders have been compassionate and have told people they will pause their mortgage payments at least until the end of January when the court expects that the homes will be habitable again while other have not done anything.  I ask the Government to intervene in that respect.</P>
        <P>Given that we own practically all of AIB and have major stakes in the other banks, the Government should use its influence to ensure the banks treat people appropriately.  Some of the residents told me that when they contacted the banks and said they were residents of Priory Hall and could not pay their mortgages for the next three months, they were asked if they had lost their job.  They were invited to complete a &ldquo;losing your job form&rdquo; and to go through the same process as everybody else who is in difficulty.  Clearly that is not the point in thissituation.</P>
        <P>A special arrangement should be put in place for residents in the Priory Hall development.  I ask the Minister to discuss the matter with the Minister for Finance in that regard.</P>
        <P>Another issue that arose last night was the question of getting emergency financial support from the Department of Social Protection.  One lady, holding a small baby, was in tears.  She <Col N="980"/>said she understood that because she was working she would not get help as she is not in receipt of a social welfare payment.  While that is ordinarily the case for the community welfare scheme, there is provision of urgent needs payments for people outside of the normal set-up.  I ask that this issue be brought to the attention of all the residents in a formal way.  Sometimes the urgent needs payments can be means-tested but there is a precedent for putting that aside, such as the flooding incident in Galway and other counties in 2009.  The Government set up a special scheme to help residents affected and recognised the fact that it did not have time to process forms and compile documents.  It stated that those affected would not be means-tested for the first phase of the scheme for urgent hardship payments.  For the second stage, when considering medium-term needs, a means test applied.  I suggest the Minister speak with the Minister for Social Protection in that regard.</P>
        <P>The next issue is to ensure the fire work is completed to the proper standard.  Residents have no faith in the builder who clearly cut every corner in the most despicable manner.  To knowingly put people at risk of fire is the most despicable thing anybody could do to families.  It is understandable that they have no faith that the builder or anybody contracted by him would do the job properly.  That is an issue in which the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government should intervene to ensure the work is carried out in accordance with fire safety regulations and that the building is brought up to the proper standard under the building control regulations.</P>
        <P>The development was built off spec in many ways and not in accordance with what had been approved by the planning authority.  Some of the issues I have raised come under the remit of the Minister and some under the remit of other Ministers and State agencies.  It is important that one person pulls all the issues together.  The position in which the residents find themselves and the confusion arising from having to pull together different pieces of information from different Departments and agencies and getting contradictory stories is adding to their problems.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister can reassure me that he will take a watching brief on the matter and demand reports from all involved in seeking a resolution &mdash; Dublin City Council, the Department of Social Protection and other agencies &mdash; in the coming weeks to ensure people are looked after properly and are not running from one agency to another.  There should be one person who ensures that during their time of need they are looked after by the State.  That is very least we owe them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was listening to a former Cathaoirleach of this House this morning who said that a particular presidential candidate, who shall remain nameless, was a gr&aacute; mo chro&iacute;.  Senator Power must be a gr&aacute; mo chro&iacute; for two reasons.  I gave her much latitude and also the Minister, Deputy Hogan, who waited to give her what I am sure will be a full response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>After that gr&aacute; mo chro&iacute;, I can reply to the House.</P>
        <P>The events of last week have been extremely distressing and, of course, stressful for the residents of Priory Hall.  Through no fault of their own, they have had to struggle with the consequences of building defects in their apartment complex.</P>
        <P>As the Senator is aware, Dublin City Council was granted a High Court Order on 14 October 2011 for the evacuation of the development at Priory Hall on the basis that it was unsafe.  The Department understands that, following a further hearing on 17 October 2011, a stay was put on the evacuation order until today and that the developer has committed to carrying out a <Col N="981"/>schedule of necessary remedial works in the coming weeks.  The court has directed that the first phase of remedial works be completed by 28 November and that all works on the development be completed by 31 January 2012.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council has made arrangements for the temporary accommodation of the affected residents.  In addition, I am glad to report that the National Asset Management Agency has identified properties which could be used for this purpose and the city council is now examining the list of properties given to it by NAMA.  Such accommodation would no doubt be more appropriate to the needs of families.</P>
        <P>The Building Control Acts clearly place responsibility for compliance with the building regulations on the owner of the building concerned and on the builder-developer who carries out the works.  Last week&rsquo;s High Court action was the culmination of two years of enforcement activity with the developer.  Dublin City Council initiated legal proceedings on 17 August 2010 in respect of compliance with fire safety regulations.  As the Senator knows, the enforcement proceedings in this regard are still before the courts.</P>
        <P>I will take on board what the Senator said by asking Department officials to contact financial institutions and the Department of Social Protection to deal with matters in regard to mortgages and exceptional payments.</P>
        <P>I attach high priority to consumer protection in the area of quality construction of new dwellings.  That is why I announced in July a number of measures to be advanced by the Department and local authorities with a view to improving compliance with, and oversight of, the requirements of the building regulations.  Implementation arrangements are already under way and I have asked that this be further prioritised.</P>
        <P>The regulations required to give effect to the introduction of mandatory certification are currently being prepared and will be the subject of some consultation in the near future.  The implementation of the other measures will be progressed by local authorities in consultation with the Department in the context of the wider programme of achieving greater efficiencies in the local government system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In broad terms, the measures will involve the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the building regulations have been met; more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective and meaningful oversight of building activity; standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions; and better support and further development of the building control function nationwide.  Implementation of these measures is being advanced as quickly as possible in consultation with the relevant stakeholders.</P>
        
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and assure the residents that I am doing everything possible, with the help of officials in the Department and in Dublin City Council, to advance as quickly as possible progress on these safeguards and on the remediation work requested by the court in respect of this developer.</P>
        <P>Developers who act in the manner in which this developer acted must be brought to book as quickly as possible.  I am sorry the proceedings have taken so long but it shows that trying to get enforcement proceedings through the court is too slow and too cumbersome and certainly not acceptable to the residents who live in those developments.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for his commitment to intervene in respect of mortgages and to talk to the Department of Social Protection.

I know the Minister is looking at changing the building inspection procedures in the future.  We would all agree on the need to do that as soon as possible.  Again, I thank him for the commitments he gave and for coming to the House to address this issue.</P>
