	<P>I have received notice from Senator David Cullinane that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to discuss the need for the promised integrated oncology unit and 20-bed palliative care unit at Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Crown of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to outline his views on the health implications of people smoking in cars where young children are passengers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kathryn Reilly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to discuss the increase in electricity prices being imposed by Bord G&aacute;is and the application by the same company to increase its gas prices.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Cullinane and Crown as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Reilly, as it is one for the Commission for Energy Regulation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Finance (No. 3) Bill 2011 [<i>Certified Money Bill</i>] &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business until 1.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes and the Minister to be called to reply not later than 1.25 p.m &mdash; if there are still speakers at that stage, I will review the concluding time then; No. 2, statements on unfinished housing developments, to be taken at 3 p.m. and conclude not later than 5 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than 4.55 p.m; and No. 17, motion No. 4, Private Members&rsquo; business, to be taken at 5 p.m. and conclude not later than 7 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Leader for outlining the business.  I assume the Finance (No. 3) Bill will be taken by the Minister or the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  Will the Leader indicate who will come in to take it?  Yesterday, I called on the House to support the call of the Palestinian Authority to support it in its quest to have the United Nations formally recognise a Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders.  A motion has been tabled and I will ask our Whip to bring it to all groupings to establish if we can get agreement on it.  The motion is that Seanad &Eacute;ireann calls on the Irish Government to formally recognise a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly meeting in September 2011 and that such a state would be based on Israel&rsquo;s pre-1967 borders and mutually agreed land swaps.  I hope we will get agreement on the motion.  That is our proposal on how the motion reads but we are open to some amendments to it.  Our Whip will discuss the matter with the other Whips.</P>
        <P>It is a matter of great concern that yesterday, Moody&rsquo;s, one of the supposed experts in the financial field, downgraded Irish debt to junk status.  I raise this because more than two years ago in the D&aacute;il I and other colleagues raised the issue of the power and influence of these ratings agencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised it three years ago in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been here only a short while.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased I have the support of Senator Norris on the matter.  To be serious for one moment, these ratings agencies have vested interests, of that there is no question.  In the past two or three years many of us have raised the issue and it has been raised in the European Parliament.  The European Commission, the European Parliament, our MEPs and Ministers from all countries have stated that we must tackle the power of ratings agencies such as Moody&rsquo;s.  I note a comment today from Michel Barnier who stated that he would propose stiff measures in November to curb the power of ratings agencies.  That is far too late.  Moody&rsquo;s, Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s are the same people who hopped around like door-to-door salesmen with US sub-prime debt in the months before the bust awarding such debt AAA status.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The people mentioned are controlling the future of Europe.  A crisis is coming down the tracks.  I wish the Minister for Finance and the Government well.  It is unfortunate that when the European Parliament President, Mr. Buzek, was here, he did not answer questions on the European Central Bank rate.  The bailout rate pales into insignificance compared to what Europe will have to deal with in this regard.  Those in Europe are fumbling in the dark on this issue.  They must get control of the ratings agencies.  There is a grave situation in Italy and Spain.  People are effectively betting against the euro.  It is outrageous of the European Commission, the European Union, successive Governments here and all governments in Europe to permit a situation whereby private vested interests such as Moody&rsquo;s, Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s have this type of control over the financial stability of the citizens of the European Union.  What representations have the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach made at European level with regard to this serious issue?</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is contained in the programme for Government in respect of the protection of social welfare allowances for our elderly, in particular the protection of fuel, electricity and telephone allowances, which, we learned today, there will be a &euro;65 million cut in?  What was agreed in <Col N="495"/>the programme for Government?  Was it agreed that there would be protection for the most vulnerable and our elderly, which we all seek?  Is it Government policy to proceed with &euro;65 million in cuts in fuel allowances, welfare and telephone allowances for the elderly?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We would all be pleased to see the text of the motion on Palestine to which Senator O&rsquo;Brien referred.  I hope there can be cross-party support for such a motion.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s comments on the power of Moody&rsquo;s.  We all agree that the power of these ratings agencies should be curbed and that they have had an undue effect on exacerbating the financial crisis within the eurozone.  We all condemn that.</P>
        <P>I call for a renewed debate on women&rsquo;s representation in politics.  We have had the debate before in the Seanad.  We held a historic debate in this House during the last session.  It was the first ever debate on women&rsquo;s representation in politics in the history of the State.  However, the need for this debate is made more urgent in light of the reports of yesterday&rsquo;s sexist comments made in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I was greatly concerned to hear reports that comments were made in the D&aacute;il Chamber which indicate that a culture of sexism is still prevalent in the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>I heard an apology.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator, as you well know, what happens in the other House is of no relevance to us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is simply the context.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It indicates there is still a culture in which women do not feel encouraged or confident to come forward to enter political life.  Members will be aware that in 2009 I authored a report on women&rsquo;s participation in politics for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  It received cross-party support in this House and at the joint committee and it recommended that action be taken to tackle the obstacles facing women on entry into political life.  These obstacles were known in our report as the five Cs: lack of confidence, lack of child care, lack of cash, difficulties with candidate selection procedures and a sexist culture.  This culture is the hardest to tackle.  Clearly, it cannot be tackled through legislation but it can be tackled through all of us, men and women alike, standing up and condemning comments that indicate there is still a sexist culture.  I am pleased that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, has announced the introduction of legislation along the lines we recommended in our report in 2009.  Such legislation will require political parties to select a minimum number of candidates of each gender at each election.  Only through such positive action can we increase the woefully low numbers of people entering Irish political life.  Certainly, the comments we heard yesterday do not help the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I congratulate the Cathaoirleach and the members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on inviting, hosting and facilitating the visit of the President of the European Parliament to Seanad &Eacute;ireann yesterday.  It was an informing and productive session and Seanad &Eacute;ireann distinguished itself with the standard of questions, including Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s questions, from all leaders in the House and with the fruitful engagement with our esteemed guest.  I understand the CPP is currently deliberating on how it will respond <Col N="496"/>to the reform of Seanad procedures whereby on our behalf the CPP can invite civic leaders to the House.  The way we conducted our business yesterday with Mr. Jerzy Buzek was appropriate, respectful and productive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I suggest that with the Private Members&rsquo; motion passed in the House one month ago with regard to reform of the way we conduct our business we have found a model of engagement that could work.  It allowed for respect and consideration and gives the Seanad a new perspective and information on how it can and should conduct its business.  The event, the questions and the wrap-up by the Leas-Chathaoirleach were appropriate and productive.  I learned a good deal yesterday.  The event illustrated to everyone in the House and the wider public how we can be innovative.  In addition, the fact that the Visitors Gallery was full of interested politicians and citizens should encourage the CPP to offer this working model of engagement as a solution to the implementation of our motion.</P><P Just="Left">Today is also an important day that will see the publication of the Murphy commission's report on the Cloyne diocese and reports of child sexual abuse.  Members have been hearing for months about the state of our financial bankruptcy and this report is expected to continue to drive home our moral bankruptcy as well.  Many issues will arise from the publication this afternoon of the aforementioned report, of which financial compensation will only form a small but important part.  Bearing witness and seeking justice are the key drivers, something that still has not been satisfied with regard to the Murphy report on the Dublin archdiocese or indeed the Ryan report that was published three years ago. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Minister, Deputy Quinn, for his statement last week on continuing to press the religious congregations to transfer ownership of schools to the State to make up the shortfall in the 50% contribution to the redress bill&rsquo;s overall cost of &euro;1.3 billion.  The lack of prosecutions arising from the Ryan report has been a disappointment considering that it has been made public for three years and took ten years to complete.  Everyone in Irish society, wherever one lives, has a moral duty to remember all those who suffered and to fight for justice for them and for their long suffering families.  I ask the Leader to set aside time to discuss the Murphy commission of investigation into the Catholic diocese of Cloyne before the summer recess in order that Seanad &Eacute;ireann can consider the report and bear witness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik was correct to bring up the issue she raised this morning.  Her concerns about women&rsquo;s representation in politics are well known.  I also share her concern about the representation of women in politics, which is a different but no less important matter.  However, as for the issue that has arisen, the reason it is relevant is that it is not simply about an absence of gentlemanliness but is about how Members conduct themselves in these Houses that comprise the national Parliament.  Yet again, a story has appeared in the media concerning frankly embarrassing behaviour on the part of Members of these Houses.  In this context, I ask the Leader to get in touch with the Ceann Comhairle, who I believe to be the appropriate person, and ask him to write to the Members of the Oireachtas to remind them of their duties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a matter for this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It certainly is appropriate for me to ask the Leader to write to the Ceann Comhairle, who I believe has a certain responsibility for both Houses in the context of the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and so on.  While I am open to correction by the Cathaoirleach in this regard, what is relevant to the other House in this matter is also relevant here.</P><Col N="497"/>
        <P>I speak as someone who is normally critical of the media.  I am not enthusiastic about the media picking up things off-mic but I believe a bigger issue has arisen, namely, the issue of how Members treat one another and are perceived to treat one another.  Moreover, in the background there are concerns that people and young women in particular have about body image, as well as a certain inequality in the manner in which women appear to be prone to be commented on in a way that men are not and so on.  These are relevant issues and it is important that we politicians meet a higher standard in such matters.  This is the reason it is important for the Leader to get in touch with the Ceann Comhairle and that Oireachtas Members are reminded of their duties in these Houses.  In this context, it was made known to me that two female journalists were heard to comment on the issue and one expressed her reluctance to criticise any Member of the Technical Group because they are all such diamonds who are great for copy.  Perhaps this illustrates the trivialisation that goes on about issues in these Houses and may be a reason that politicians do not meet high standards in the manner in which they address issues or speak of one another.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise a second issue in my capacity as an Independent Member, a status of which I am highly conscious.  I am worried about a culture of spin characterising the actions of the Government.  First, there was an apparent lack of openness regarding concerns being expressed by the Smithwick tribunal.  Then the Taoiseach first stated he had made no commitment to keeping open Roscommon hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency department, only for it then to emerge that a commitment was made.  Then it was stated there were safety concerns that only&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes, I am coming to my question, which is sincere.  There then was a statement that there were safety concerns but it now emerges that HIQA did not make any safety report concerning accident and emergency services in Roscommon hospital.  Moreover, one now is told that another report is extant.  It would be worthwhile were the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to make clear the basis for the decision.  I make this point as someone who is willing to support hard decisions even when they affect local communities because hard decisions are now inevitable.  However, it is extremely important that the Government be seen to be responsible in the manner in which it manages its communications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>These are points the Senator can make during the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe that such responsibility has been demonstrated.  There has been irresponsibility in communication about judges&rsquo; pay.  Moreover, I differ from my colleague, Senator Mac Conghail, as I do not consider it appropriate to mix the issue regarding the patronage of schools with the question of contribution to a redress bill.  This also characterises a certain culture of spin by the Government.  Higher standards are needed both individually and on the part of the Government in its communications with these Houses and the public.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mullen, five Senators were unable to contribute yesterday because Members persisted in going over time.  I will call those five Members first this morning and now call Senator White.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I urgently request the presence in the Seanad before the end of this session of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The state of the economy and the crisis in the number of unemployed people are most serious issues and I am disappointed that <Col N="498"/>the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has not yet appeared in this House.  I plead with the Leader to make endeavours in this regard.  While it was all very fine to have Mr. Buzek in the Chamber yesterday, I seek the attendance of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to spell out the position on the ground and what he is doing with regard to the numbers of unemployed people and to help get them back to work.  The danger lies in the increasing numbers of people in long-term unemployment.  As I have stated previously, the continued success of the multinational exporting industries and the indigenous exporting Irish companies was nurtured and grown under the watch of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Moreover, I read an article last week about the financial services sector and how successful it is, in which there was not a single mention of how Mr. Haughey had driven the development of the financial services centre.</P>

	<P>Senator, it is Deputy Flanagan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I did not get a chance to speak yesterday when I had intended to call for a debate on the arts.  I am thankful to the Leader who anticipated my request when he announced he would arrange for such a debate in his summing up.  I would like such a debate to be held before the August recess and my county colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, should be present because his credentials in promoting <Col N="499"/>the arts and being proactive in County Kerry are well established.  The Minister would welcome the support of this House as he faces into the pre-budget talks because as every Member is aware, in recessionary times the arts and culture in general are vulnerable.  I believe it was Hitler who once stated that when he heard the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo;, he reached for his revolver and politicians tend to forget about culture when the purse is empty.  The arts are of great importance, particularly in the regions.  Our art centres and arts festivals already are shivering at the prospect of massive swingeing cutbacks in their budgets.  I refer to events such as the Galway Arts Festival, the Kilkenny Arts Festival and of course Listowel Writers&rsquo; Week.  Arts centres nationwide perform a fantastic service in the promotion of the arts.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s initiative regarding his plans for the Bank of Ireland building.  He should receive the support of the entire country on this issue and I am not in any way impressed by the bank&rsquo;s attitude to the Minister&rsquo;s proposal.  In addition, while I bow to Senator Mac Conghail in this regard, I note how the debate on relocating the Abbey Theatre has been put onto the bleachers for at least ten years.</P>
      
        <P>Senator Norris has form on this as well.  I would like to reopen the debate and make sure that we get capital investment for the relocation of our national theatres in the city and regions.</P>
        <TimeSt down="3" idown="3">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I commend the leader of this side of the House, Senator O&rsquo;Brien, and Senators MacSharry and Byrne for the fantastic work they put into the Home Protection Bill which I hope will be adopted by the Government.  My party suffered odium and blame for the recession, more than it was entitled to, but is now prepared to be part of the solution.  This Bill is part of the solution for people who are oppressed.  I would like to see the matter dealt with in a non-political way.  If the Government wants to table amendments they will be taken on board.  I commend my colleagues for their initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I had not planned to speak today but I thank Senator Bacik for raising the issue of the sexist comments made in the D&aacute;il.  They are unbecoming from any parliamentarian.  Senator White said the rules should be reviewed.  I look around this House and I see conduct becoming of parliamentarians, both female and male.  The other House should take an example from this House, not just in terms of attire but verbal contributions.  The debate in the D&aacute;il is sometimes like a slagging match and is conduct unbecoming.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter for the D&aacute;il but it is also a matter for me as a woman and every other parliamentarian.  I am delighted to hear others speak on the issue.  The women in the House should indicate that they will not be intimidated by comments or anything else and that we are strong enough to stand up and be counted. </P>
        <P>Women in politics is a serious issue, to which Senator Bacik referred.  I was elected in 1991 and before that I was a member of the Women&rsquo;s Political Association.  I am now a member of the 50:50 Group established in Cork last year.  It is six or eight months old and new branches have opened in Dublin and Sligo.  There will not be 50:50 by 2020.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator looking for a debate on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek a debate on women in politics.  I was totally against quotas and believed women should get here on their merits.  However, in the Nordic countries they gave up after having a debate for 25 years on quotas.  </P>
        <P>The most important debate called for today is the publication of the Cloyne report.  It is a very important day.  I asked for a debate on all the reports published, including the Ryan report and the Cloyne report.  Television time should be given to it.  It is such an important matter <Col N="500"/>that we should concentrate on it.  We should analyse all of reports, find out the recommendations, see how many have been implemented and then do our own report on what action should be taken, who has fallen down and where they have fallen down.  That is the most important issue on the agenda today.</P>

	<P>When I get the opportunity to speak about the greatest transfer of debt from the private sector to the ordinary taxpayer I find it hard to remain calm and calculated.  I refer to the Irish banking scandal.  It is beyond a scandal and is an affront to ethics, democracy and the morality about which Senator McAleese spoke in reference to another area. I  find it even harder because we in the House speak constantly and consistently about human rights.  </P>
        <P>I would like to ask about the financial human rights of the citizens of Ireland who have these banking albatrosses on their backs.  I would also like to ask about our human rights when, as working people, we have to witness no change in the status of the executive of the Bank of Ireland.  There is overweening pride, arrogance, circles of protection and an attitude that one is worth &euro;500,000 a year and can forget to tell the taxpayer about the &euro;66 million in bonuses which continue to be paid.  I run out of the language of outrage about their morality.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Finance into the House to explain why the junk status directors and executive of the Bank of Ireland are still in charge.  I call them &ldquo;junk status executives&rdquo; because they were driving the truck when it crashed and are still driving it.  It is as simple as that and I would like that question answered by the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would also like to ask the Minister for Finance why the bonuses and salaries of the Bank of Ireland executive have not been wiped out or cut in ribbons.  The Bank of Ireland excuse is that these kinds of banking salaries and bonuses are the life breathing work of the bank and if the work is to be done it requires salaries of a high level.  It is argued that the bank will not function without them.  That is hilarious.  We now own 36% of the bank and it will soon be owned by the State.

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader ask the Minister to come into the House and explain why we cannot cut the executive salaries of the Bank of Ireland?  I do not want to hear about the illegality of such a plan because there is no problem with illegality in cutting the salaries of the 190,000 workers who turn burgers.  I want the Minister to explain why a struggling and incompetent executive of Bank of Ireland is still<i> in situ</i>.  The executive is not even able to explain himself in any understandable language, let alone convince shareholders to invest.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s comments on the rating agencies.  I have raised this issue in the past three years.  They are a corrupt conspiracy and commercial offshoot of the New York Stock Exchange.  They do not seem to understand the very basic principles of law, such as a conflict of interest.  They got involved in rating companies who were paying them for ratings.  It is the clearest conflict of interest possible.  They incorrectly estimated the situation in Enron.  They gave Iceland a triple-A rating a week before it went down the drain.  They were also involved in Greece.  The current situation was precipitated by these people and the fact that they were involved in junk bonds, and that is where the junk title should reside.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about them not because of any abstract economic or political theory but because people are hurting.  Several Members on both sides of the House have said this.  We have set about attempting to save a system, with references to the systemic importance of <Col N="501"/>banks.  The priority of the Government should be the welfare of the people.  I heard it said by leading people here that nobody died.  They did and more are dying.  More people are taking their lives across Europe.  Last week a survey was produced which showed the impact of the economic situation on the suicide rates across Europe.  People are dying as a result.</P>
        <P>In this city a young mother died of hypothermia in the past year because of a heating situation.  Gas prices are going up.  We will be faced in the very near future with cuts in fuel, electricity and gas allowances and supports for the elderly.  We are probably going to have more debt as a result of this because of the inability of all Governments to protect the people, which should be the first responsibility of government.</P>
        <P>Today at least two newspapers, the <i>Irish Examiner</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i>, contain reports of the account given by Focus Ireland, led by Sister Stanislaus Kennedy.  It has had a 20% increase in its latest figures of people requiring services because they are homeless.  This is where the cuts bite and where we as members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann should stand up and be counted for the people of Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with my colleagues on the visit yesterday by the President of the European Parliament.  It was interesting.  My colleague raised the issue of reform.  The President referred to the number of submissions received on draft legislation being passed at European level.  I understand that 337 submissions were made by different states, none of which was made by either House in this jurisdiction.  It emphasises the need for reform and how we can play an active role in drafting European legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have an eight week gap from the time issues are proposed to when we have the right to make a submission.  I agree with my colleague about the need for reform.  It is important that we put in place a process to deal with that issue.  Europe now has a large influence on what is happening in this country, and has had for some time.  My understanding is that we have over 29 European Commissioners; therefore, even if one of them attended this House every fortnight we would still not have heard from them all by the end of the year.  Issues that will be relevant in the next two to three years include the Common Agricultural Policy, which is to be reviewed.  Consequently, it would be appropriate to invite the EU Agriculture Commissioner to attend the House to give a broad outline of what is coming down the line with regard to the CAP.  Those are some of the issues that we should deal with proactively, rather than waiting for them to happen.  We should be proactive in issuing these invitations to ensure that we have a clear annual programme of involving such people in the Seanad.  We should invite people representing various interest groups in this jurisdiction, as well as those in Europe.  I think those points should be taken on board.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Leader and other party and group leaders on their contributions yesterday.  It was well managed.</P>

	<P>I rise to disagree strongly with Senator Mac Conghail who said earlier that yesterday&rsquo;s proceedings, concerning the visit by the President of the European Parliament, were appropriate, respectful and appreciative.  Respectful and appreciative, yes, but not appropriate given that the leader of the second largest Opposition party in the Oireachtas &mdash; and the second largest political party on the island of Ireland &mdash; was not given an opportunity to welcome the President or put a question to him.  A political decision was made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges not to allow Sinn F&eacute;in an opportunity even to welcome the President of the European Parliament to this Chamber yesterday.</P>

	<P>If it was agreed by the House then that is even worse because it says that this House is not open to reform.  I take exception to the Independent Group whose Members are appointed to this House by the Government.  They talk about people from outside this Chamber having the right to come in and address this House, which I agree with, but they were part of the decision to prevent the second largest Opposition party from addressing the President of the European Parliament yesterday.</P>
        <P>To be respectful, we withdrew an amendment we had tabled to allow for the proper timing of the President to come into this Chamber.  In addition, we did not press the issue when the President was here, but it shows a complete lack of willingness by the political parties in government to have any kind of meaningful reform.  Even minor requests by Opposition parties are put to one side.  This was not about Standing Orders.  There was no breach of Standing Orders because this would not have amounted to giving Sinn F&eacute;in status as a group.  It was nothing of the sort; it was an opportunity to allow us as an Opposition party to welcome an important guest.  We have 14 D&aacute;il Members who are equally disgusted at the way in which our party was treated here yesterday.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I would like the Minister for Finance to attend the House for a discussion on how we might close some of the tax loopholes, particularly cross-Border ones, that are costing the Exchequer a significant amount of money.  It has been brought to my attention recently that unscrupulous people can go to the North of Ireland and quote a VAT reference number when purchasing large pieces of equipment.  By quoting a VAT number they do not actually possess, they are exempt from VAT.  They then bring the equipment to machinery auctions in Dublin and elsewhere in the South, selling it with VAT added.  They are thus able to pocket the VAT, while their only outlay is the 4% that the machinery auctioneers charge.  Therefore, on a piece of equipment costing &euro;100,000 VAT of 21% is added; therefore, <Col N="504"/>the unscrupulous person is pocketing a profit of &euro;21,000 of which he or she pays &euro;4,000 commission to the auctioneer.  There is therefore a loss of &euro;17,000 to the Exchequer.  It is a significant issue and I am sure other Members have many other examples of similar situations whereby we are losing a fortune because of cross-Border activity.  I would like the Minister for Finance to attend the House in the near future for a frank and open discussion on how we can avoid such negative impacts on the State&rsquo;s finances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that Seanad &Eacute;ireann calls on the Minister for Health and the Government to honour its pre-election commitments and ensure the continuation of the existing 24 hour a day, seven day a week, accident and emergency services at Roscommon County Hospital.  That motion has been signed by all members of the Fianna F&aacute;il group here.  I wish to have this matter debated today as a matter of grave urgency.  It has now come to light that HIQA never carried out an examination of Roscommon County Hospital, yet HIQA is being used by the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, as an excuse for closing the hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency department.  This is a serous situation.  HIQA has completely denied that it had any hand, act or part in an inspection of Roscommon County Hospital.</P>
        <P>The accident and emergency department was rebuilt in 2002.  I signed the &euro;10 million contract for the Western Health Board.  It was built, equipped and has a tremendous opportunity of providing a service.  I reject the statements made by the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, that the mortality rate in Roscommon County Hospital is 21%.  The fact is that it is 5%, which is the same as everywhere else.  The service has been provided by Dr. Pat McHugh who started off in 1977, the same year I was elected to the D&aacute;il.  He has served there for 34 years and is one of the finest physicians ever to qualify in this country.  While I have never said it before, that man literally brought my father back from the dead.  He is the most brilliant physician this country every produced and he has been denigrated by the Minister for Health.  I hope he gives those views outside this House and I hope that Dr. Pat McHugh will sue him in the High Court and claim damages for what he has said.</P>

He and Mr. Michael Relihan, the surgeon, both came at the same time and they both provide a great service.  It is a damn shame that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, would say those things about a man who served his people so well.  I have never previously said what I know about this man, but I am giving a testament today about him, on a personal basis.  He is a person of the highest possible integrity, who has saved lives in Roscommon.  Lives will be lost.  The decision by the Taoiseach, backtracking on what he stated during the general election campaign, will cost lives and the Government will be responsible for the death of many people from Roscommon travelling the roads to Galway and elsewhere.</P>

	<P>I support the comments of Senator Colm Burke in requesting the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs to address the House on how our Parliament is effectively or adequately using the Lisbon treaty provisions to put a stay on European legislation being implemented here until it is adequately scrutinised.  I was shocked by what the President of the European Parliament said yesterday that other countries are certainly using this provision in the treaty for the six to eight-week period, but as Senator Colm Burke said today, Ireland has not yet used it.  We need to realise the impact EU directives and legislation are having on Irish people.  We must use that provision to put a stay on it until we are certain it suits us.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Mac Conghail in calling for a debate on the report on the handling of clerical sex abuse allegations in the Cloyne diocese due to be published this afternoon, which I understand contains findings against 19 priests.  I would like the Leader to ask the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs and Justice and Equality to give us an update on the implementation of the recommendations of the Murphy and Ryan reports.  We debated those reports during the last Seanad, but we do not know how many of the recommendations have been implemented.  There is little point in getting reports with recommendations if we do not know that behaviour and practice is changing.  I proposed to the Leader of the previous Seanad, Mr. Cassidy, that this House should play a significant role in the implementation of those reports and that we would have oversight in this House.  This was abuse against our children down through history by some clerics.  This is a shameful history we have and this House should play a leading role in ensuring that practice and behaviour are changing for the better and for the protection of our children.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business, proposed by Senator Leyden.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Senator made a very telling point in his contribution this morning.  To omit Sinn F&eacute;in from the democratic process and the exercise we had here yesterday with a very important visitor from Europe could send out the message that it is a negation of democracy.  In many ways it also makes a mockery of our aspiration to an all-island political interaction.  In the future we should endeavour to ensure Sinn F&eacute;in will be given that oppor<Col N="506"/>tunity.  A contrived sanitisation of a debate such as yesterday&rsquo;s does not do any credit to this House.</P>
        <P>Senator Eamonn Coghlan recently asked for a little more positivity in our debates, given the depressive situation in the country.  Listening to Newstalk this morning, I heard an example of that positive approach.  It was made by the female Deputy who was at the centre of the debacle in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  She immediately wanted to get on to the real issues concerning the country and she listed those issues.  She could be a role model for us all in public life, by dealing with the fundamental issues that are causing so much suffering.  I will give an example.  We often talk about the people of no property and we can now add to that the people of no means.  To think that a man would jump into the river and risk his live to save his pet rabbit tells us something about society today.  That was all that man owned in the world, but he had such regard for that little animal that he was prepared to risk his life.  He could also be a role model for those who are suffering at present.</P>
        <P>We can use all the rhetoric we like and come up with all the flamboyant policies we like, but at the end of the day, we are still not focusing on real people in this country.  The suffering on the ground is unreal and unbearable.  We should all keep that in mind in our future debates.  When I was on the other side of the House, I used to ask the Opposition to help and assist.  We should be doing it now from this side of the House.  The Government has a difficult task to do.

I compliment the Minister for Finance on the strict terms and conditions he has laid down for it to meet.  As a colleague said, the State has a 36% equity interest in Bank of Ireland as it stands.  Given the lack of investor confidence, if this rights issue is not taken up by the investors and by the shareholders, it could rise to 70%.  I know the Leader has meant well in offering us a debate on banking and he might again address that in a few minutes.  We all know how starved small and medium-sized businesses are in trying to meet the challenges in the marketplace at the moment.  Some &euro;3 billion will be made available to them this year, &euro;3.5 billion next year and &euro;4 billion in 2013, on which I compliment the Minister, because it is so necessary.  However, so many legacy issues continue in that institution and the other pillar bank that any director who was in place prior to the introduction of the guarantee should not be there now.</P>

I believe Bank of Ireland has only two such directors out of ten or 12, which is not adequate and certainly will not be by the time this rights issue is completed.  I would like to hear from the Leader when we can have the Minister to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very important that I make this point.  If we do not respect each other, we do not respect the mandates we have as Members of this House and we do not respect the communities and people who elect the various politicians who work very successfully and very well in this House.</P>
        <P>I am aware of and agree with the campaign group to which Senator Keane referred, 50:50 by 2020.  It is a very worthwhile organisation and I support the Senator&rsquo;s calls for a debate.  However, I ask the Leader to extend that debate to other minority groups and to consider why minority groups as a whole are not represented in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Why has no one from the new Irish or the Traveller community been elected to either the D&aacute;il or Seanad?  Why is there only one person with a declared disability elected to the D&aacute;il or Seanad?  We need to have a debate on political participation and we need to widen it not just in regard to the quota balance between male and female but in regard to other aspects of society that are not represented at all within the political system.</P>
        <P>I agree very much with the comments of Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell and Senator Paul Coghlan on the banks.  It came to my attention recently that Mr. Declan Collier, the chief executive of the Dublin Airport Authority, who did not take the bonus of &euro;102,000 on top of his salary of &euro;600,000 or &euro;700,000, is also a public interest director in AIB and, on top of that, a member of the remuneration committee of AIB.  This is bizarre.  I do not believe the public has confidence in this man to be a public interest director.  Will the Leader ascertain from the Minster for Finance what moneys Mr. Declan Collier has received from AIB in terms of his remuneration for being a public interest director?</P>

I agree with the Senator that having the Barnier report published in November seems very late in regard to addressing the problems relating to rating agencies.  I will see whether that can be expedited but I doubt if it can be at this point in time.</P>
        <P>With regard to social welfare cuts, we are not aware as yet of what, if any, cuts there will be.  To speculate in regard to what they should be or might be is unwise at this stage.</P>

	<P>Senators Mac Conghail, Keane and Healy Eames raised the issue of the Cloyne report.  As we know, the Cloyne report will be published today and copies will be made available to all Members of the House.  My office was in contact with the office of the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to inquire when the Minister could come to the House to outline details and developments on child protection and priorities for her Department.  She advised us of the Cloyne report being published today and noted that the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will announce a series of measures today which will provide the basis for a measurably strengthened system of child protection.</P>
        <P>Arrangements have been made to give victims groups an opportunity this morning to have a preview of the report.  The HSE and voluntary groups who operate victim helplines, have made arrangements to offer support to anyone who may be affected by the contents of the report and who wishes to contact them.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also operating a dedicated telephone line for anyone who wishes to provide information in regard to the report or a criminal offence arising from it.  I would encourage anyone who has such information to report it.</P>
        <P>The House will no doubt discuss the findings of the report, and requests for such a debate have been made today.  I will endeavour to have that report debated before we conclude at the end of the month.</P>
        <P>Senator Mac Conghail referred to the President of the European Parliament.  I believe everything went off quite well yesterday.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges met yesterday and will reconvene on Thursday next.  The petitions committee has been activated and terms of reference are being drawn up and will be decided upon on Thursday, so we are making progress in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen talked of the issue of spin and the Smithwick report.  The Minister&rsquo;s response in this House last week was far from spin and I thought he was very clear and unambiguous in his comments to Senator Mullen on that matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator White asked that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation come to the House.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, was in the House on two occasions dealing with the jobs initiative but we will endeavour to get the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to the House also.</P>
        <P>I dealt yesterday with the matter raised by Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan in regard to a debate on the arts, which is long overdue.  We will try to get the Minister to come to the House, if not before the end of the month, then early in the new term.</P>
        <P>Senators Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell and Paul Coghlan raised the matter of the banks in regard to directors, including private interest directors, and CEOs.  It is about time, as has been said in the House by many Senators, that the banks are cleaned out and that those who were there prior to the crisis should not be in position at this time.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of the rating agencies, with which I have dealt.  The Senator also suggested there would be cuts in fuel allowances.  I have no information as yet on whether there will be cuts in fuel allowances.  That is a matter for the budget which we will have to await.</P>

The Senator raised the very valid point that no representations were made from this State in regard to European legislation, which is not a good situation.  The question of inviting European Commissioners is one which we can deal with in <Col N="509"/>the CPP.  To have a calendar listing those people available for each period of months would be a good idea, and something I am sure the CPP will deal with.</P>
        <P>On the point made by Senator Cullinane, there was no comment from the Senator when the motion was put to the House.  On the question of group leaders, the Senator needs to realise that the Sinn F&eacute;in Members are not a group in this House.  It takes seven or five or whatever it is to have a group in this House.  The Senator is not a group leader, he is the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in in the House.  If he had the 14 Members of the other House in the Seanad, he would certainly have a group.</P>

	<P>As Senators will be aware, this is a single issue Bill which is designed to provide for the necessary changes to tax legislation and follows on from the enactment of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2010, more commonly referred to as the civil partnership Act which received overwhelming support in both Houses when passed last year.  It was milestone legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in that it received not only the support of both Houses but also the collective support of apolitical opinion far and wide across the Houses.  The manner in which the legislation was progressed through the Houses marked a good day for the Oireachtas in dealing with an outstanding issue that had been left to one side for many years.</P>
        <P>It is a convention which I support that tax law follows general law in the social sphere.  In this case, the Bill simply transposes into tax law the provisions of the civil partnership Act.  It sets out the various rights, entitlements and obligations that will apply to the taxation treatment of civil partners and cohabitants.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 was historic because it facilitated the recognition of same sex relationships for the first time though a scheme that allowed the parties to declare their allegiance to each other formally and to register their partnership which would be recognised by the State.  This official registration brought with it a number of duties and responsibilities for the people involved.  While many have dwelt on the changes brought about by the recognition of same sex relationships, the Act also introduced provisions to address the position of cohabiting couples, both same sex and opposite sex couples, where the relationships ended.  The redress scheme established in the Act provided a safety net for an economically dependent cohabitant at the end of the relationship, whether by separation or death.</P>
        <P>We committed ourselves in the programme for Government to enact any necessary follow-on legislation from the civil partnership Act.  The Bill deals with the tax changes necessary to align tax law with general law.  It is complex, in so far as it makes necessary amendments to a large number of areas of the tax code.  Registered civil partners will receive the same tax treatment as married couples in respect of income tax, stamp duty, capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax and VAT.</P>
      
        <P>They will be able to avail of the tax bands and tax credits available to married couples.  The Bill also provides for similar tax treatment where there is a transfer of property by gift or inheritance for capital taxes and stamp duty purposes.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned, the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act  2010 also legislated for a redress scheme for cohabiting couples who chose not to marry or register a civil partnership.  The redress scheme provides protection in law for long-term cohabiting couples and provides safeguards for an economically dependent cohabitant where a relationship ended by separation or on death.  The Bill provides for the tax changes arising from this.  For example, in the case of a transfer of property on foot of a court decision under the redress scheme, the transfer will not now be liable to stamp duty.  It will also mean the donor of the property will not have a capital gains tax liability on the transfer of the property and that the beneficiary will not be liable to capital acquisitions tax.  Without this change, the former cohabiting couple would have been deemed as &ldquo;unconnected&rdquo; and subject to full stamp <Col N="512"/>duty, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax on transfers of property arising from a separation.  A clear anomaly arose in that case which is dealt with in the legislation before Senators today.  In addition, if court ordered maintenance payments are made to a former cohabitant who was financially dependent, these will be subject to income tax relief for the person making the payments.</P>
        <P>The changes under the Bill will be effective for the year of assessment 2011 and subsequent years.  Inheritance tax, gift tax and stamp duty reliefs will apply as and from 1 January 2011.  For example, as indicated previously, if a civil partnership was registered in April 2011, the couple will be considered for civil partnership income tax treatment from the date of registration of civil partnership, not from the date of enactment of the Bill.  This is in line with the treatment of persons getting married in the usual manner.</P>
        <P>The Bill is short and the detail of the tax changes are set out in the Schedules.  There are five sections and four Schedules.  Sections 1 to 4, inclusive, have related Schedules which deal with the various aspects of the tax code applicable.  Section 1 deals with income tax and capital gains tax; section 2 deals with stamp duty; section 3 deals with capital acquisitions tax; section 4 deals with VAT; and section 5 deals with the Short Title, construction and commencement of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 1 and the related Schedule 1 deal with the income tax treatment of civil partners and the various assessment options available to them.  These options are joint assessment, separate assessment or separate treatment.  I will outline for Senators what this means in more detail.  A couple who are in a registered civil partnership will be deemed to have elected for joint assessment in the absence of an election to the contrary.  Under joint assessment, one partner is chargeable to tax, not alone on his or her own total income but also on the total income of the other civil partner.  The civil partner who is chargeable to tax on the income of both individuals is known as the &ldquo;nominated civil partner&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Under separate assessment, each civil partner is assessed on his or her own income with allowances and reliefs divided between the civil partners.  Separate assessment is also known as &ldquo;separate assessment within joint assessment&rdquo; as one civil partner&rsquo;s unused allowances, reliefs and rate bands may be transferred to the other civil partner.  It is the exact same position for married couples in tax law treatment.  All this does is extend to civil partners, where their relationship has been registered in law, the same application as in other areas.  Under separate treatment, each civil partner is treated for tax purposes as if he or she continued to be single.</P>
        <P>The section also deals with maintenance payments for civil partners living apart, and the adaptation of certain provisions to allow for the joint assessment of civil partners living apart or whose partnership has been dissolved or annulled.  It also deals with the assessment of civil partners for capital gains tax purposes.  It sets out the method of joint assessment, makes provision for applications for separate assessment and provides rules for the transfer between civil partners of unutilised capital losses.  As I stated, all of the above provisions follow the practices applicable to and entitlements of married couples.</P>
        <P>The section deals with the income tax treatment of a cohabitant in respect of maintenance payments from a former partner where the relationship has ended.  As I said, in such cases the person paying the maintenance will have income tax relief in respect of the payment and the person receiving the payment will be liable to income tax on the payment.</P>
        <P>Section 2 and the related Schedule 2 give effect to the changes necessary to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.  In future transfers of property between civil partners will be free from stamp duty in the same way as a transfer between a married couple.  The new section to be inserted in the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 will provide that stamp duty shall not be <Col N="513"/>chargeable on an instrument executed after 1 January 2011 where property is being transferred on foot of a property adjustment order made following the breakdown of a cohabiting relationship under section 174 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act  2010.</P>
        <P>Section 3 and the related Schedule 3 give effect to the changes necessary to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 which will mean that the same CAT reliefs and thresholds available to married couples will now also be available to civil partners.  Likewise, children of a civil partner, including children of the other civil partner, will be entitled to the same CAT thresholds as children of married persons.</P>
        <P>The section also provides for an exemption from gift and inheritance tax in respect of a court order made under Part 15 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act  2010 when a cohabiting relationship ends.  As a result, any property transferred, where ordered by the courts, on the cessation of a relationship will not attract a CAT charge for the person receiving the property.</P>
        <P>Section 4 and the related Schedule 4 give effect to a single change necessary to the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010.  The change is in relation to the option to tax letting of immovable goods by extending the definition of &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo; to include the civil partner of an individual and the civil partner of a relative of the individual or his or her civil partner.</P>
        <P>Section 5 contains provisions relating to the Short Title, construction and commencement of the Bill and is self-explanatory.</P>
        <P>There was widespread support for the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act  2010 when it was debated and passed both in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann last year.  The Bill before the Seanad today will help to implement the Act as it relates to taxation and I hope all Senators can fully support it.</P>
        <P>It is worth saying the previous Government included these changes in the finance Bill as proposed coming towards the end of the life of the previous D&aacute;il, but given the time constraints at the time, the relevant sections were not continued.  All the Bill does is bring forth these provisions again to give effect to the tax changes required to give civil partners the same rights in Irish tax law as married persons.  It is a simple and logical extension of legislation already enacted by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I commend the provisions contained in the Bill to the House.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for the way in which he concluded his remarks.  This is a good day for the State and citizens.  For a committed constitutional republican, as I am, a true republic respects the rights and dignity of all its citizens, regardless of their views and preferences.  This legislation predates 2007.  Commitments in this respect were given by all parties prior to the 2007 election and they formed part of the 2007 programme for Government.  I had many engagements with groups who supported civil partnership legislation and with people, <Col N="514"/>who had strongly held views on it, who were opposed to it.  Those discussions were important because such change takes time.  On the other side, there are people who believe this legislation does not go far enough in terms of civil partnerships, and that is understood also.</P>
        <P>This legislation is a big step forward for this country.  We only have to look back to the early 1990s when certain laws providing for the criminalisation of homosexuality had to be removed.  We have moved a long way since then.  Groups such as the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, and other groups I have met were realistic about what could be done.</P>
        <P>The tax changes in this Bill, which we fully support, are welcome.  The Minister of State has reminded me of a few dark days politically between the last budget and the fall of the previous Government.  It was a regret of mine that this legislation could not have been passed at that stage.  I am aware that former Members of the Seanad and D&aacute;il were very involved in the civil partnership legislation as well as, to be fair, members of the Green Party who are no longer represented here or in the D&aacute;il who held strong beliefs in this respect which were important to them.  Everyone must be commended on the way this debate was handled since 2007 and that was a sign that Ireland was maturing and becoming a real republic.  There are many areas in our society that we must improve, and this is a step in that direction.  It may not be a step as far as some people want to go but it gives us a basis from which we can move forward.  In most instances over recent years the manner in which this debate was held was welcome.  It was done in a mature fashion.</P>
        <P>In regard to civil partnerships or marriages in other jurisdictions &mdash; this question may have been dealt with already &mdash; and the retrospective nature of this legislation in terms of tax and returns for previous tax years, how will that be dealt with in the case of a person who moves to this State having entered into a civil partnership or a civil marriage in another jurisdiction?  In what way is such provision encompassed in this legislation?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State specifically mentioned maintenance payments in his contribution.  I might be straying from the content of the Bill but the Minister of State might be able to assist me on how the tax treatment of maintenance payments will be dealt with.  Has that issue been examined?  I am aware that his colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, is examining this issue in terms of social welfare recipients who are not remitting maintenance payments agreed under court orders.  If there is a dissolution of a civil partnership, no more than a judicial separation or divorce in a marriage, how far is the Government down the line of ensuring that the requirements to remit maintenance payments agreed in a court order are followed through?  The issue of maintenance is not specifically covered in this Bill but it is important that the Minister of State mentioned maintenance payments in the context of civil partnerships.  The most commonly used phrase in this context is the &ldquo;deadbeat dad&rdquo; and it is a major issue.  We all see instances of this in our constituencies where people can still claim benefit from the State and not live up to their obligations to their family, partner or children.  I would be interested to hear how far the Government has advanced in addressing that issue.</P>
        <P>It is crucial that all views have been respected in this legislation and the Government should continue along that line.  Some people had concerns about provision for civil partnerships and the manner in which that has been done has ensured that this process has moved forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We support the Bill and have not proposed any amendment to it in the Seanad.  This is not a political issue.  The legislation on this area was introduced by a previous Government and it had cross-party support.  I am glad the Government has seen fit to bring forward this legislation early in its terms of office to complete the process of civil partnerships, enshrine them in law and ensure that same sex couples who enter civil partnerships will have the same tax treatment as married couples.  That is crucial.  We in this state, this republic, must work together partic<Col N="515"/>ularly in these difficult times.  We must put our differences aside, be they social or economic, and work together.  There are still many areas where there is inequality and there are some provisions in the programme for Government to deal with it.  The Government will have the support of the Fianna F&aacute;il group in addressing inequality and ensuring that people are not marginalised in our society.  This Parliament or Oireachtas, that is, the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, has a major role in addressing that issue.  A great deal of our time has been spent dealing with economic matters, rightly so.  I was going to use this opportunity to ask the Minister of State questions on other matters but I will not do so because it is appropriate that the time be devoted specifically to the issue of civil partnerships and this legislation.  We are very much caught up with the economic difficulties we and the rest of the European community face.  In dealing with those financial matters, we should not forgot about our citizens, what is important to them, how we can improve their quality of life and how we can address inequalities.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  He has the full support of the Fianna F&aacute;il group in this House on the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I hate to stand up after two Members have spoken to say effectively the same thing.  It is not often that this happens.  I was in the D&aacute;il with the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, and Senator O&rsquo;Brien, then a Deputy, when the civil partnership legislation went through and I saw the cross-party consensus for it.  It was a genuine consensus rather than, as is sometimes the case, a pretence of consensus.  On that occasion everyone wanted the issue to be dealt with.  If I recall correctly, a Labour Party Private Members&rsquo; Bill on this issue was rejected and following that the civil partnership Bill was passed towards the end of the last D&aacute;il.  We are now giving taxation effect to the consensus that occurred on that occasion.</P>
        <P>Like Senator O&rsquo;Brien, there are many issues outside the remit of this Bill that I could raise with the Minister of State, but it would not be appropriate for me to do so.  However, I wish to raise a few minor issues.  Some people benefited in the past on the basis that there was no civil partnership legislation or legislation to give taxation effect to it in place in that they walked away from their obligations and left behind a partner or a partner and children who were in need of maintenance.  Those people had that benefit because the Legislature had not done anything in this respect.  There was no such legislation on the Statute Book.  Those people were, effectively, given a free hand to choose to walk away if they wanted to.  This legislation ties up that lacuna in law for people who found themselves in such a difficult vulnerable position and I am glad about that.</P>
        <P>I am also glad that the Bill makes provision for long-term cohabiting couples.  While there was a good deal of focus on same sex couples, it is good that people who were cohabiting were not excluded in this Bill.  I touched on the issue of maintenance payments.  It is one of the biggest issues and I am glad it is concluded.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am concerned about the tax elements.  While this is a short Bill and much of the detail is in the Schedule to it, I am hopeful that there are no loopholes in it.  I hope the Department of Finance has gone through this with a fine toothcomb to ensure people cannot employ the best tax lawyers in the country to find loopholes.  The ability to locate such loopholes is not in my sphere of expertise nor is it within the ability of most Members of these Houses.  However, certain taxation law firms specialise in this sort of activity.  If the Bill is discovered to contain loopholes I ask that they be closed quickly rather than pursuing them through the courts.  Far too often, the Legislature does not act until a case comes before the courts.</P>
        <P>On the day we were downgraded by Moody&rsquo;s, it would be remiss of me not to discuss our current position.  Moody&rsquo;s is one of three or four international organisations which rate nations, banks and businesses but the biggest players are the members of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and they will be the people who determine whether a credit default <Col N="516"/>occurs.  While the markets may react to the ratings agencies, the latter are not the major players.  In the context of tax law, it is appropriate to point out these companies are not regulated.  They are the same companies which described the banks as wonderful prior to the international financial collapse.  They operate as they see fit even though their views have significant implications for markets and governments.  These companies must be regulated at national, European and global levels.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that the Bill was received very favourably and with little comment or debate in the D&aacute;il and select committee.  As the Minister of State has noted in his opening statement, it is viewed as progressive and a complement to the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 in terms of providing for the taxation implications of that Act.  My fellow Senators have described the legislation in similar terms.  I respect the right of Members to hold these views and, although they are not views that I share, I understand I am in the minority in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not think an equivalence of rights has been achieved in the 2010 Act.  It legislated for legal discrimination and, as such, I do not describe the Act as a stepping stone to equality for lesbian and gay couples.  I am also cognisant of the fact that a significant number of couples have already availed of the civil partnership registration process and I acknowledge this is an important event in their lives.  I have had the privilege of attending a number of these ceremonies and they are very moving.  For some, it is an opportunity to recognise their lifelong love in public, to give visibility to the normality of homosexual identity and speak eloquently about Ireland as moving towards the &ldquo;republic of love&rdquo;.  The latter phrase, which comes from a poem by Michael Murphy for his partner, Terry O&rsquo;Sullivan, was one of the most recent attempts to put into language the achievements of this legislation.  Others, however, have in effect conducted this public ceremony in private because they are still fearful of inviting their mothers, fathers or other family members in case of rejection.  At the same time, they undergo the process because they desire the protection that accompanies this statutory institution.</P>
        <P>We are living in a land of paradox as a result of the 2010 Act.  It is not a land of equality.  We should not forget that only married couples and their children can legally be deemed families and civil partners and their children do not yet benefit from the constitutional protection of the family.  I recognise that many couples are availing of this institution for the key aim of gaining protections and benefits that are similar to those of married couples.  There is no way of getting these protections other than by entering into civil partnership.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I put aside the differences to which Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien referred and I spent a lengthy period reviewing the Bill in order to offer the Government constructive suggestions which would ensure the taxation protections and benefits for civil partners are as similar to marriage as possible.  The Bill is technical in nature and I ask Members to bear with me because some of the comments I shall now make traverse into that technical domain.  I am not an expert in taxation law but I have had the support of someone with experience in this area in reviewing aspects of the Bill.  I agree with Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy on the importance of applying a fine toothcomb to the legislation.</P><Col N="517"/>
        <P Just="Left">My question is whether the Bill does what it sets out to do, namely, provide exactly the same tax treatment for civil partners as for married couples under all tax categories.  Furthermore, are children of civil partners afforded the same treatment as the children of married couples?  From an initial reading of the Bill, it appears this equivalence is achieved but, on closer scrutiny and with the support of research conducted by the public interest law initiative of FLAC at the request of the marriage equality organisation, some of the amendments contained in the Bill do not achieve full equivalence between civil partners and married couples or for the children being raised within the respective institutional arrangements.  Furthermore, there appear to be some gaps in the range of amendments required in the tax code if full equivalence is to be achieved.  The lack of same tax treatment between civil partners and married couples may require amendments to be introduced.</P>
        <P>In regard to the insertion of the new Part 44A to be inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, chapter 1, section 1031J, it is still easier for a married couple to avail of more favourable tax treatment on the break-up of their marriage than is the case for civil partners.  Maintenance payments for a spouse in marriage attract tax relief at the time of a deed of separation or judicial separation.  In the case of civil partners, tax relief on maintenance payments is not possible until statutory dissolution or annulment.  It takes longer to get a statutory dissolution or annulment than to put in place a deed.  A deed takes however long the negotiations last, whereas the statutory dissolution requires a two-year waiting period.  In order to ensure the same treatment, section 1031J needs to be amended.</P>
        <P>In respect of chapter 1, section 1031A, the Bill inserts a new Part into the 1997 Act in order to deal with the assessment of civil partners for income tax purposes.    The new section mirrors how spouses are assessed in the Taxes Consolidation Act.  The tax treatment for income tax purposes depends on whether spouses or civil partners are living together or separated.  The Minister of State referred to this in his remarks.  Within this section it appears that the definitions of what constitutes living together for civil partners are different.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For the purposes of tax legislation, a married couple can be considered separated, even if they are living together under the same roof.  That is in case law.  If a married couple&rsquo;s relationship breaks down &mdash; which happens more today than it did in the past &mdash; but given difficult financial circumstances they cannot maintain two separate dwellings and are forced to live together, they can still be considered separate for income tax purposes.  I presume that if people are separated they want to be considered as such for tax purposes and issues consequent to that.  With the section as it stands, if civil partners are separated but still living together under the same roof, they would not be considered separated for income tax purposes.  There does not appear to be parity with married couples in this respect.</P>
        <P>A third example may highlight a gap.  Within the body of tax legislation, the definition of &ldquo;relative&rdquo; and &ldquo;family&rdquo; are often used.  The meaning of these words in the tax code is not technical and refers to ordinary meaning.  The ordinary meanings of these words are as contained in the Oxford English Dictionary, which the Revenue Commissioners rely on for definitions, and they turn on blood or marriage.  To ensure relatives and families of civil partners are recognised within the tax code, it seems we require an amendment to bring them under the ordinary meaning.</P>
        <P>The different cases I have outlined, if they are accepted, may require amendments to achieve what the Government is setting out to do.  My next example moves to the issue of children and maintenance arrangements.  This is a little more technical but I will put it as simply as I can.  With regard to maintenance arrangements for children of a civil partnership, or even as such payments relate to civil partners, a more favourable tax treatment for married couples kicks in with regard to maintenance payments after the breakdown of a marriage.  This does not come <Col N="518"/>about as quickly for civil partners, who must get an order of the court to trigger that favourable tax treatment; married couples do not require this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Moving to the issue of children, there is a more favourable tax regime for maintenance payments, although that is not reflected in the Bill as it stands.  In this regard it might be helpful to recall that the Civil Partnership Act does not place any statutory obligation on civil partners to maintain the child or children of a civil partner in the case of a marriage breakdown.  Is that the reason there cannot be the same favourable tax treatment for the children of civil partners in this Bill?  If that is the case it is important to note it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I begin by welcoming the Minister of State to the House, as others have, and the Bill, which as the Minister of State has mentioned is a single issue Bill.  It was prepared under the last Government and supported by both sides of the House.  I also declare my interests in the issues we are discussing as I am junior counsel in the case being taken by my dear friend and colleague, Senator Zappone, and her wife Ann Louise Gilligan.  I pay tribute to Senator Zappone and her partner for their immense bravery in taking the case, which has been ground-breaking in seeking recognition of same-sex marriage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My comments in welcoming this Bill are tempered by my view and that of the Labour Party that neither the Bill nor the Civil Partnership Act provides for full equality.  The Bill will bring about a separate regime, with similar and in some cases equivalent rights and obligations as married couples for civil partners, but it does not amount to the same thing.  On Second Stage with the Civil Partnership Bill I welcomed the legislation, which the Labour Party supported, but I made the point that the difference between civil partnership and marriage matters.  There is a symbolic legal reason as civil partnerships are not the same as marriage in law and are seen as a different entity or institution.  There is also a difference in practice, and Senator Zappone has very usefully described to us some of the differences which have a practical impact.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The key difference in the Civil Partnership Act, reflected in the amendments in this Finance Bill, is the absence of recognition of rights and responsibilities <i>vis &agrave; vis</i> the children of gay couples.  There was a great deal of debate in the Seanad and among the wider public when the Civil Partnership Act was passing through both Houses.  It is very regrettable that there is not more provision for children of civil partners.  I hope the Government will pass follow-on legislation.  The Minister of State indicated that this is a necessary addition to the civil partnership legislation.  I hope we will see more to deal with children of civil partners and the rights and responsibilities between children and civil partners.</P>
        <P>I do not want my remarks to take away from the positive impact of the Bill.  Others have alluded to the ceremonies which have taken place here, where people have entered civil partnerships since April.  Like Senator Zappone I have attended some of these and they are wonderful celebratory occasions.  I am sure all of us would like to congratulate those people who have taken the plunge and entered civil partnerships in accordance with the Act.  We all welcome the point made by the Minister of State that this Bill, when passed, will apply to those already registered to have entered civil partnerships.  They will be considered for tax treatment from the date of registration of civil partnership rather than the enactment of the Bill.  It is an important protection which should be made clear to people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien asked a question of the Minister of State about those who entered marriages or civil partnerships abroad and if they would be recognised under the Bill.  Under the Civil Partnership Act provisions, it is made clear that those who entered same-sex marriage or civil partnership abroad would be recognised as civil partners here.  Many of us viewed that as unsatisfactory in that people who have entered marriage in one of the many countries where <Col N="519"/>same-sex marriage is recognised would have their marriage downgraded, effectively, to a civil partnership under Irish law.  I hope we can return to that issue in future legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I intend these remarks to be constructive and do not want them to detract from the overall impact of this Bill, which will have a very important practical protective effect on civil partners and qualified cohabitants.  It was often overlooked in debates on the Civil Partnership Act that it also applied to qualified same-sex and opposite-sex cohabitants where the relationships broke down.  That part of the Act offers very important protections to dependent cohabitants who previously had no real protection in law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Others have alluded to the very important point that the Civil Partnership Act had cross-party support in both Houses.  I am the only person to speak so far who was a Member of the Seanad during the last term when we debated the Civil Partnership Bill.  It was a very proud time for me and Senator Norris, who pioneered the introduction of a civil partnership Bill as a Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  It was regrettable that we did not have unanimous support in the House, although there was unanimous support in the D&aacute;il.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In this House there were some dissenting voices but we have moved beyond that.  It is very clear that the Civil Partnership Act and the necessary amendments following it &mdash; including this Finance Bill &mdash; will now achieve unanimous support.  I have not heard any dissenting voices, which is very important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will refer to a couple of other points which may go beyond the direct import of the Bill.  As Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy has already gone that way I believe I can follow.  This Finance Bill will make the necessary technical changes to ensure equivalent protection and responsibilities for civil partners in the tax code.  We are all grateful to Senator Zappone and the MarriagEquality organisation for putting forward some points which may need further review to ensure that as close an equivalence as possible is achieved between civil partnership and marriage in the tax code.   I want to make a more general point on the same theme, but it goes somewhat beyond the scheme of this Bill.  The Government needs to look beyond the categories of married couples, civil partners and qualified cohabitants.  It should review the protections given and the definition of &ldquo;family&rdquo; in the Constitution.  It is a matter of some concern for many people that although family forms and units well beyond the family based on marriage are recognised in our legislation and in our social welfare and tax codes, the family based on marriage remains the only family that is protected under Article 41 of the Constitution.  One of the key Labour Party policies to be incorporated into the programme for Government involves the establishment of a constitutional convention to examine constitutional reform generally.  I hope that during the convention process, we will look at how best to protect and celebrate the diverse forms of family life that exist in the State at present.  It is clear that the children of gay families deserve protection and recognition.  That can be provided for through legislation.  We need to look beyond the institution of marriage as a basis or a constitutional foundation for the families we support in the Constitution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Apart from the big issue, that is examining the constitutional definition of &ldquo;family&rdquo;, we need to consider other legislative changes needed to protect different forms of family relationship in Ireland.  Some glaring gaps in our legislation have been identified but not acted upon.  I hope this Government will be able to take action.  I refer, for example, to issues relating to children born through surrogacy to gay and straight parents.  They currently exist in a serious legal vacuum.  This is not an abstract point.  When I spoke to a few colleagues, I was interested to learn I am not the only Member who has been getting representations from couples whose children have been born through surrogacy, or are about to have children born through surro<Col N="520"/>gacy.  The law is not clear on the status of their children in law, or their status as parents in law.  We need to tackle that issue and provide for the regulation of assisted human reproduction in general.  The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction produced an excellent report on the latter question.  I know it is outside the Minister of State&rsquo;s brief, but I hope the Minister for Health will move on this during the lifetime of the Government.  I know his officials have already been involved in drafting proposals.  A predecessor of mine, Dr. Mary Henry, prepared draft legislation when she was a Member of this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We can do a great deal during the Government&rsquo;s term of office despite the immense financial constraints under which we are operating, as alluded to by Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy.  We can do an immense amount to offer greater protection to different forms of family life.  I see this Bill as a stepping stone or staging post on the way to true equality for different family forms.  Although I welcome the Bill, it is not enough.  We need to introduce further follow-on legislation and make constitutional changes to ensure we give all forms of family life protection that is as strong as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Today&rsquo;s debate brings to mind a meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party, when the Leas-Chathaoirleach and I were at the vanguard in supporting the civil partnership legislation.  While the legalisation of homosexuality was introduced in 1993 on foot of Senator Norris&rsquo;s legal action, it is a point of pride for us that our party implemented it and introduced the civil partnership Bill.  We have been criticised in some quarters of the media for attempting to portray Fianna F&aacute;il as a new liberal party, but I suggest we are doing what we have always done, which is to try to be at the vanguard of social change and to recognise all forms of human and family life in society.</P>
        <P>Regardless of opinion, it is important to recognise that dissenting voices are entitled to be heard.  I do not agree with other people on everything.  I am sometimes conflicted on the issue of marriage equality.  When I sit around the table at meetings of &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; I am 34 and I am the chairman &mdash; I am often the only person with even slight reservations about marriage equality.  On such occasions, it strikes me that we need to bring the main party policy on the matter into line with that of &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il, which is that full marriage equality should be provided for.</P>
        <P>Many of us have been on journeys as we have considered our position on this issue.  Mr. Justice Kennedy of the US Supreme Court was here a few weeks ago.  His journey on this issue was instrumental in striking down anti-sodomy laws in the United States.  He was part of the majority that retained these laws in the 1980s.  I do not know if Senator Zappone mentioned that because I did not listen to the entire debate.  He changed his mind on the issue in the context of a more recent US Supreme Court case.  That allowed the US to bring its laws forward after being about 20 years behind us.  Obviously, the practice was not uniform throughout the US.</P>
        <P>The Irish people have been on a journey with regard to this issue.  They are becoming much more liberal in this respect.  They are much more cognisant of those around them.  As we have a more open society now, people do not hide matters and are not as afraid to &ldquo;come out&rdquo;.  People throughout the country see their own family members entering into relationships and have no difficulty with it.  Society has changed and is changing.  It might not be ready for marriage equality yet, but that issue will undoubtedly be brought to the fore.  When my colleague, Senator Power, advocated full marriage equality last week, it caused some controversy within Fianna F&aacute;il, in the media and among other representative groups.  She is entitled to her opinion, an opinion which is becoming more and more the norm.</P><Col N="521"/>
        <P>The only logical answer I can give those who argue that we must stop at civil partnership, and go no further, is to say that marriage equality would not endanger family life or marriage.  I see no threat to my family from someone else being allowed to enter into a relationship and to secure for it the same status as my relationship.  My view is that it has nothing to do with my family.  I suggest to those who constantly make the point that marriage equality would pose some serious threat to family life that we should provide more practical supports to all families through the tax code.  People with children need general practical help and support to help them to overcome their difficulties.  Some people suggest that we can protect families by preventing the liberalisation of laws and the introduction of marriage equality.  They forget about the real problems and common struggles faced by ordinary families &mdash; gay couples or homosexual couples, with or without children &mdash; on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il is proud to say this Bill was part of its budgetary plans in the aftermath of the passing of the civil partnership Bill.  There was dissent in my party and in Fine Gael when that legislation was being considered.  Some members of Fine Gael expressed their dissent to me.  They are entitled to their views.  The measure before the House this afternoon was provided for in the last Fianna F&aacute;il budget.  Its introduction was delayed because the Green Party decided to pull out of government.  It is being passed now, thank God, and is supported by Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome this Bill.  I also welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House.  I thank them for bringing the Bill forward.  When the law is changed, it is important that the equivalent change in the taxation area is also made.  I have to take account of what Senator Zappone has said.  The Minister of State should take it on board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will give an example of how far we have come.  In 1980, which was before the Minister of State&rsquo;s time, we started a campaign to abolish the status of illegitimacy whereby a child born outside marriage did not have any rights in relation to his or her father&rsquo;s estate.  When the campaign was started, everyone agreed it would take ten years to achieve the change.  It took seven years &mdash; the legislation was eventually passed in 1987.  That is not an excuse, however.  The changes being made represented a step forward.  They needed to be made.  The legislation before the House is welcome.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about the link between children and taxation.  As I understand it, if a person is paying maintenance to his or her partner or spouse, he or she can get income tax relief.  I understand the relief does not apply, however, if the maintenance is paid for the children.  I am open to correction on that.  I wonder why that variation requires to be there.  I understand it is also in this legislation.  It is something that should be looked at.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I suppose the reason I raise it is that, taking on board what Senator Zappone stated about one needing the necessary orders before getting the benefits under this legislation, as recently as yesterday my legal office got a decision in the Supreme Court in a family law matter that commenced in 2001.  It brings home the point.  In fairness, this was not the fault of the courts.  I do not blame anyone for the delays involved.  It is merely that sometimes there are issues that drag on.  Even though there was a decision given in the Supreme Court, unfortunately, neither does the case end there.  I suppose it emphasises what Senator Zappone stated on this legislation.  Perhaps the Minister of State might take on board her views on it to see whether the necessary changes can be taken on board.  All of the changes Senator Zappone suggested may not be possible at this stage but in the example I gave, ten years later we are only getting a court order, not because of a delay by anyone but merely because of the way the system worked.  That should be taken on board.</P>
        <P>I welcome this legislation.  That the legislation runs to more than 70 pages shows how complex is the area in the various issues on taxation, such as income tax, capital acquisitions tax <Col N="522"/>and stamp duty.  It is important that we put in place the same reliefs and that the Bill is implemented at the earliest possible date.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming forward with the Bill and thank his officials for carefully drafting this in the way they did.  We should take on board the views of Senator Zappone on this matter.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Government will take up the mantle on this issue.</P>
        <P>I affirm my support for this legislation today.  I lament the fact that it had fallen down coming up to the general election and I welcome that it is back on the agenda, albeit a few months later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is progressive legislation, but it is legislation that seeks to right a wrong and end an injustice.  The principles behind this Bill are not new.  Senator O&rsquo;Brien spoke about republicanism.  The principles behind this legislation were enshrined in the 1916 Proclamation and it is our responsibility to make good that vision of a republic that guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities for all, not the majority, of its citizens.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has long advocated for full legislative equality for lesbians and gay men.  While civil partnership did not go far enough, my party was happy to support it as another marker in the journey to realise the rights of all citizens regardless of sexual orientation.  Civil partnerships, although not providing full equality, provide for important rights such as inheritance, adoption, visitation and residency.</P>
        <P>Today, we are dealing with some of the outstanding issues arising from the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act  2010, and this is another step forward.</P>
        <P>The Bill, as was previously mentioned, seeks to correct anomalies in the current tax code to ensure that civil partners will be treated in the same manner as married opposite sex couples.  While to date we may not agree with some of the Government action or inaction, we should commend it, and its predecessors, for bringing forward this Bill and reassure the Government of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s wholehearted support on this matter.</P>
        <P>As legislators, it is our privilege to correct the wrongs in the system.  This Bill provides for couples considering civil partnerships some legal certainty and security, which, given the current economic climate, is more important than ever.</P>
        <P>The Finance (No. 3) Bill is also important in another respect in that it ensures that children of civil partners will be treated the same in some respects for tax purposes as children of married couples.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I stated, it is a privilege, as a legislator, to right these wrongs.  I hope the Minister will take on board the recommendations of Senator Zappone in this matter.</P>
        <P>I welcome that this Bill will largely enjoy cross-party support.  This is essential if we are to send a strong signal that discrimination and prejudice is wrong and that the Oireachtas is properly serious about equality and about treating all citizens and residents in the State with the dignity they deserve.</P><Col N="523"/>
        <P>This Bill will further the rights and entitlements of all of those in society, regardless of sexual orientation, including equal recognition of same-sex parents in families.  As I stated, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the right of same-sex couples to marry and form a family, including by adoption, and sought to have this right enshrined in legislation.  It was Deputy Crowe of Sinn F&eacute;in who first tabled an amendment to the Civil Registration Bill in 2003 to provide for equal recognition of same-sex marriage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the programme for Government Fine Gael and the Labour Party made a clear commitment to promote constitutional reform to enable same-sex marriage and I urge the enactment of this commitment as soon as possible.  My party looks forward to seeing the Government advance the rights of lesbian and gay individuals, couples and families in the future.  If this happens, I assure the Government that it will have Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s full and enthusiastic support.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill is merely another step in realising the rights of all of the people.  It is another step in realising the vision of the 1916 Proclamation to build a republic on the principles of equality, sovereignty and liberty.  I hope it is shared by all parties and Senators in this Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State.  I welcome the introduction of this legislation.  As has been stated by previous speakers, it follows up the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act  2010.  The commitment was given by the then Government and the incoming Government obviously had no difficulty in putting in place the legislation promised at that stage.</P>
        <P>The previous speaker used the phrase, &ldquo;A lot done, a lot more to do&rdquo;, as an indication of where the Bill was coming from politically.  I suppose we could also think of another Fianna F&aacute;il phrase, &ldquo;an Irish solution to an Irish problem.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

	<P>It is early in the game yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the legislation.  The Bill &mdash; which has numerous sections, as, I suppose, all finance Bills have &mdash; is straightforward in nature and we have no difficulty in supporting it.</P>
        <P>Senator Reilly used the phrase &ldquo;progressive legislation&rdquo;, which I hear so often and which, while I hold the Senator in huge admiration, can irk me from time to time.  I hear these phrases &ldquo;progressive legislation&rdquo; and &ldquo;progressive thinking&rdquo; coming very much from one side of the spectrum philosophically.  Many of those who speak of progressive legislation will tell one that what we see in China and in some parts of South America and Cuba today is progressive legislation.  We should start defining what is progressive and what is not, and should not use the word with total abandon.  I welcome this legislation, but this definition of some legislation being progressive and only being generated from a certain ideological base is not always correct.</P>
        <P>Last year the civil partnership legislation generated significant debate, particularly in this House.  It was a genuine and comprehensive debate, unlike what occurred in the other House, and a wide spectrum of opinion was presented to us.  The view of the House on that occasion was to pass the Bill and, therefore, we are now putting in place the follow-up taxation pro<Col N="524"/>visions.  It is only fair and proper.  It deals with same-sex couples and cohabitating couples.  It is appropriate and I have no difficulty in the tax code being changed to allow all of those people to have full taxation rights.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>A substantial case was made during the debate on the civil partnership Act about the rights and entitlements of people living together in what were described as caring relationships.  Generally, this involved brothers and sisters and elderly persons who were looking after each other.  The case was made that rights and entitlements should be afforded to such persons also.  Obviously, the Bill does not provide for this.  However, those of us involved in constituency politics will be aware of people who have lived together for almost a generation and who do not have any social welfare, taxation or legal rights.  I am referring for the most part to brothers and sisters.  Perhaps the Minister of State might reflect on those in society in need of State protection under the tax and social welfare codes.  That does not, however, take from the fact that this legislation is necessary and will be supported by everyone in the House.  I thank the Minister of State for fulfilling the Government&rsquo;s commitment, as it moves our legislation to a newer plane.  This is something we promised we do and that everyone supported in the debate on the civil partnership Act last year.  I do not envisage a divide on the legislation.  I thank the Minister of State for introducing the Bill and we look forward to its speedy enactment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it; I welcome the Minister of State.  I have no doubt he is aware that I was one of the Senators who opposed the civil partnership Act in the House last year.  I would be a hypocrite were I not to state I continue to be concerned about aspects of that legislation.  Therefore, I cannot support aspects of this Bill because it flows from a false premise or a faulty idea of how we should go about addressing the legitimate needs and concerns of some in our society, including persons in same sex relationships.  I note Senator Ivana Bacik stated her comments were, to use her own words, tempered by the fact that she regretted the Bill did not go as far as she would have wished.  This view was reflected in Senator Katherine Zappone&rsquo;s position also.  My comments are also tempered by the fact that at no point either last year or now did I desire or have I desired to disregard or disrespect the undoubted sincerity of those who believe this Bill will achieve some social good.  I respect people completely in their personal and private relationships and I am keen to see our society, policies and laws honouring and respecting people in the commitments they make to each other.  However, it does not follow automatically that we should have civil partnership legislation of the kind brought forward.  Certainly, it does not follow that we should have to change the Constitution and laws to redefine marriage in the way proposed.</P>
        <P>I make my comments animated by a genuine, personal concern for the common good and a particular concern that society should continue to recognise in a special way the institution of marriage between men and women in the way validated by recent international legal pronouncements and that it should show special concern to these relationships because they achieve a particular social good or because they provide the context for the achievement of a particular social good which we should not deny.  I do not believe it could be wrong in any way for me to flag this concern.  Therefore, Senator Ivana Bacik was wrong in her assessment of the apparent unanimity in the D&aacute;il last year being positive and in her regret that there was dissent in the Seanad on the civil partnership legislation.  What we saw in the D&aacute;il last year and in large measure in the Seanad was an example of group-think.  I do not believe anyone was done a favour by the closing down of the debate to only permit or celebrate comments that were politically correct or in accordance with the apparent media and public policy agenda that prevailed.</P><Col N="525"/>
        <P>I respect what I have heard from Senator Katherine Zappone who believes the legislation does not go far enough.  Generally, most politicians are supportive of it.  The reason for this is partly historical because Fianna F&aacute;il was the party which brought forward the civil partnership legislation and it could hardly oppose what is now taking place, even if it were motivated to do so for political reasons.  Therefore, it falls to the few who genuinely hold objections and see problems to raise them in the public interest.  I am not impressed by Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s borrowing of the language of civil rights when it has addressed civil rights and the equality agenda in a partial way.</P>
        <P>The civil partnership legislation was about a notion of equality but it was only ever equality for some.  I made the point then and make it again now that there is no human right to a same sex marriage or civil partnership.  Even in recent times international decisions, including the UN Human Rights Committee decision in the 2003 case of Joslin <i>v</i>. New Zealand, suggest marriage is for men and women, in particular.  That is not to be offensive to anyone; it is because marriage is seen as a particular social good.  The Doha International Conference for the Family in Qatar in 2004 affirmed similar sentiments, referring to a family composed of a husband, a wife and children as being a natural basic element of society.  The recent European Court of Human Rights decision on same sex marriage and civil partnership affirms that there is no right to marriage for homosexual persons under the European Convention on Human Rights.  I make the point to illustrate that the public policy direction we should take in these matters is not a no brainer; it is far from a settled issue.  We must hold a genuine debate and need to engage the brain on what we consider to be most in the public interest.</P>
        <P>I could also quote a judgment by Ms Justice Elizabeth Dunne, the judge in the case involving my colleague, Senator Katherine Zappone.  I am paraphrasing, but she came to the conclusion on the evidence on equality of outcome for children being cared for within same sex relationships was that it was unsafe to rely on the evidence on offer.  Senator Katherine Zappone made a recent decision in the context of a different issue relating to polygamous marriage in respect of the marriage of a Lebanese man and woman in Lebanon and a relationship that was valid under the law of Lebanon.  She stated that to interpret our constitutional provision as including polygamous marriage would be to give it an interpretation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Ms Justice Dunne made that decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct, Ms Justice Dunne made it.  She ruled that it would be to give it an interpretation which was simply not compatible with the constitutional understanding of marriage.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not confusing the two issues.  I am merely making the point that there are significant issues that we must consider.  When we import a notion of equality, we must ask who else will seek equality in the future for their relationships.  Will we have the same group-think when it comes to such debates in the future as we have had in respect of civil partnership?  I am making a point on the need for a more intellectually searching debate and the avoidance of a closing down of dissenting voices.  That is my point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Central to my concerns last year and now was and is the fact that this is equality in favour of people in a particular caring dependent relationship, namely, one that has a sexual dimension.  I understand the former Deputy and Minister of State, Martin Mansergh, asked the question of whether this was an example of the State getting back into the bedroom.  Is this really about equality?  Under the changes to be made in respect of capital acquisitions tax, a child of one civil partner will be entitled to inherit from the non-parent civil partner up to a threshold of &euro;332,000.  If that person were to receive an inheritance from another close relative such as a sibling, an aunt, an uncle or a grandparent, a threshold of one tenth of that figure would apply, <Col N="526"/>that is, &euro;33,000.  What does that say about our commitment to equality?  Last year, I made a point about what really should be provided for.  I remind Members that last week, I supported Senator Zappone&rsquo;s amendment to allow the Minister to decide in favour of naturalisation of a non-European Union national spouse or civil partner.  I genuinely believe each case needs to be considered on its own merit and genuinely believe in a compassionate accommodating society.  However, I question a form of equality legislation that does not recognise that people in a caring dependent relationship in which there is mutual dependency, sacrifice and support but which is not sexual, are entitled to just as much recognition as are people in a same-sex relationship.  Ultimately, the reason marriage between men and women was supported all along was, to paraphrase the millennium cohort study, to support that context in which children would be brought up as much as possible by two biological parents in a low conflict marriage, which is the gold standard.  I believe Members lost sight of genuine equality with the civil partnership legislation last year in favour of a notion of partial equality.  Just as seriously, they failed to have a debate in which all sides&rsquo; genuine concerns were ventilated fully and properly debated.  It was to the shame of the Government of the time, as well as of other parties in this House, that the debate on the legislation ended with a guillotine.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Although I had not intended to speak on this Bill, it is significant legislation.  It is extremely important and while I have absolute respect for Seanad&oacute;ir Mullen and agree with many of his sentiments, I do not agree with him in respect of the civil partnership legislation, which I believe to have been necessary.  I agree with him on his issues regarding equality and the definition thereof.  This morning, I spoke on the Order of Business on the subject of political equality.  While political equality is the point at which it must start, it must percolate through society and particularly in legislation.  Legislation must reflect equality in every sense of the word.  The lack of recognition of a scenario in which an elderly brother was caring for an elderly sister is just as much a scandal as the lack of recognition of the rights of a cohabiting same-sex couple.  Senator Bradford spoke of the need for a debate and I understand that statements on A Vision for Change have been scheduled for tomorrow, at which time opportunities to so do might arise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>Approximately 12 months ago, I was approached by a constituent who informed me about a couple&rsquo;s intention to buy a house.  One element of the relationship already owned property while the other did not.  The person who did not previously own property felt very hard done by, because the couple was caught for stamp duty in respect of the entire house.  That person was of the view, correctly, that it should have been for 50% of the value, if one considers the definition of equality about which Senator Mullen spoke.  This is a point at which equality does not exist.  Significant cohabitation takes place in our society and this must be recognised in legislation.</P>
        <P>As for the civil partnership legislation that was enacted last year before I was a Member of this House, I welcome how the tax requirements at least are being brought through in this legislation.  As for the future, the definition of equality is a concept around which all Members must get their heads.  Moreover, people must begin to work out what comprises equality for future legislation.  The case of older people was referred to previously and there could be a case, for example, in which an 88 year old lady was being looked after by her 75 year old brother and perhaps they might wish to will their properties to nieces and nephews.  In such a situation, the threshold is one tenth of what it should be, which is highly inappropriate.  There should be a way to facilitate aunts, uncles and cousins.  Moreover, perhaps children should be <Col N="527"/>able to leave their property to an aunt on their deaths in cases in which there was no one else up along the line.  Members must become creative and must extend the definition of fair play and equality.  Moreover, over the lifetime of the Government, Members must ensure that legislation is progressive in this regard.  I had not intended to speak in this debate but as Members are speaking about equality and the issues associated thereon, there must be a proper definition of equality that reflects a broad church.</P>

	<P>Before I deal with the substantive issue, I note there was broad consensus in both Houses when the civil partnership legislation was put into Irish law.  This does not diminish the rights of colleagues on any side to take a different stance in this regard and I refer to a point made by Senator Mullen.  I was in the D&aacute;il and participated in and listened to that debate.  Close to 70 Deputies spoke and I do not remember a debate in which so many colleagues spoke on an issue.  There was no guillotining of the debate in the other House and no clamping down of people&rsquo;s personal expressions.  The Senator suggested the debate in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann was closed down.  That is not true.</P>

	<P>One person&rsquo;s guillotine is another person&rsquo;s filibuster.  I watched the debate in this House and fair is fair.  There was a fair articulation of the views but like all things, a conclusion must be reached.  As I note the Senator is smiling, the suggestion of a filibuster in respect of the parliamentary device he used at the time may have had some justification.  However, I make the point that we all must respect one another&rsquo;s view on this issue.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with the elephant in the room, which has been brilliantly introduced to the debate today by Senator Zappone when she spoke of the land of paradox and equally by Senator Bacik when she stated that full equality has not been restored.  Moreover, the same argument was made by Senator Mullen, albeit in another way.  One should be clear that civil partnership is not marriage because it cannot be marriage.  The only way in which marriage can be changed under our constitutional architecture is by constitutional referendum.  If one examines the existing High Court rulings, it is absolutely and fundamentally clear that the precedent and view of the Irish courts is that a marriage is a marriage between a man and a woman.  I note the case of Zappone-Gilligan against the State effectively tries to establish the right of the Irish State to recognise a marriage conducted in another state.  I understand that matter is still before the courts.  However, the current position reflects the High Court judgments that have been made.  The Oireachtas cannot introduce legislation when it lacks the constitutional power to so do.  A fundamental requirement in the Constitution is that the Oireachtas can only pass laws that are consistent with the Constitution.  It is patently inconsistent with the Constitution under the existing judgments of the courts to suggest that this House or the other House could impose a definition of marriage on same-sex couples.  Consequently, one must be honest that civil partnership is not the same thing as marriage.</P><Col N="528"/>
        <P>I understand the legitimate expectation of those who argue it should be the same and this debate, as Senator Bacik rightly noted, will take place in Ireland.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to have a constitutional convention in which that issue will be explored with many other issues over the course of the next few years.  However, to be clear and up-front with people, if marriage <i>per se</i> is to be extended to same-sex couples, it will require a constitutional referendum of the people.  It has been the collective view of parties and Independent Members this year and last that a majority for such a proposal is not in place at present.  People can have a legitimate expectation for such an extension and can continue to campaign for it.  However, the only way in which it can come about is through a constitutional referendum.  In a sense, the comments by Senators Zappone and Mullen point to the arguments made by the present Government and its predecessor.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>What we are putting in place in civil partnership legislation is a recognition of the fundamental rights being prescribed to people who are in civil partnership relationships.  I cannot tell the Senator what will happen in the future.</P>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fundamental constitutional term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to fundamental taxation rights.  No one knows where this debate will go.  There are independent views across the House which are all legitimate.  For the purposes of this Bill we need to say that it is an extension of an Act passed by the Oireachtas which gives rights, rather than fundamental rights, to civil partners.</P>
        <P>Why do I think that is important?  It is in the public interest that this State encourages people to live together and encourages people in a loving relationship to be at one with each other.  That should be recognised by some institutional change, be it a civil partnership or marriage.  It is fundamental because the more we support each other and the more families are brought together, the greater the benefit to the State in terms of social protection.  It is fundamental to this Bill that it is not just an extension of rights but also a fundamental extension of responsibilities to one another.  Some of the most loving relationships I have ever seen are gay relationships.  People want to make a commitment to each other in the long term.  People want to ensure their house is in order so that if one partner dies, there is proper provision for the other.  It is absolutely right that the State would provide in law for that by way of civil partnership.  Whether it would extend further on the question of marriage is a question I suspect will be revisited and one on which we will all take a position.  The civil partnership Act gives the question of rights and responsibilities to a new category of people who have previously been excluded from the law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Wearing my Department of Finance hat and having got that off my chest, I want to respond to a number of the excellent ideas that have come from Senators today.  Committee Stage may take place next week and we will have the chance to tease out some of the issues.    I ask people to remember that we in the Department of Finance can only introduce changes to the taxation code whereupon the principles are provided for in the civil partnership Act.  We cannot dream up other things that are not in the Act.  Changing the taxation code is a logical outworking from the fundamental legislation which is the civil partnership Act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien for his very constructive speech.  He also referred, rightly, to the role played by Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  A number of colleagues made that point.  One name I did not mention is former Senator Sheila Terry, who is a member of my party.  She produced the first comprehensive policy of any political party on this issue.  The bigger the political party, the more difficult it is to get these things through given the catch-all nature of politics.  When <Col N="529"/>I was in the House between 2002 and 2007, she produced a comprehensive policy position and I wanted to recognise her contribution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien released some queries about the non-payment of maintenance which is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I will follow that up and respond on Committee Stage in more detail.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy referred to difficulties with the legislation and the potential for loopholes.  I assure him that if the legislation is not operating as intended, it can be remedied by way of a finance Bill.  Unlike other legislation, we have an annual finance Bill which not only implements decisions of the Government in the budget but can also be used to tidy up legislation.  If difficulties emerge, we will have an opportunity each year to address them in order that people&rsquo;s rights will not be diminished in any way.</P>
        <P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien asked about the recognition in civil partnership of same-sex marriages in other jurisdictions.  Anyone in such a relationship can apply for recognition in civil partnership in Ireland.  However, there will be no tax effects before 1 January 2011 because there was no recognition of civil partnership before this point.  The law came into effect on 1 January and the benefits in the taxation code will apply from that date, which is fantastic collaborative action from the Department of Finance, but not before.  The point of retrospection refers to 1 January 2011.</P>
        <P>As I stated in my opening remarks, tax law follows general law and we cannot make provision in tax law for something which was not recognised in general law.  Many of the amendments and changes that colleagues want made to the Bill have to fit in with the legislation that was enacted by both Houses last year.</P>
        <P>I take on board the general comments of Senator Zappone.  Many of her points are outside the terms of the Bill and the wider societal issues to which she referred.  Her tax comments are based on the provisions of the civil partnership Act.  The tax law can only follow general law and this Bill cannot exceed what is already allowed in the context of the civil partnership Act.  The Senator referred to four specific areas where she contends a couple in a civil partnership is not in the same position as a married couple and some form of unfairness exists.  I have taken note of the four issues, namely, the break-up question, the definition of &ldquo;living together&rdquo;, the definition of &ldquo;relatives&rdquo;, and the role of children.  There was a significant discussion on this issue, as she is aware, when the legislation was being debated last year.  We might return to those issues on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>There is no tax relief for maintenance payments in respect of children in the context of the break-up of a marriage.  Tax relief on the payment is only available for the separated or divorced spouse, which will be extended under this Bill to maintenance payments to separated civil partners and former cohabitants.  Senator Burke asked about the non-deductibility for tax purposes of maintenance payments in respect of children of a marriage or civil partnership after separation.  The view was that an individual is responsible for paying maintenance to his or her children and should not be given tax relief for that.  If we were to make such payments deductible, the logical consequence is that such payments would be taxable in the hands of the recipient, whether from the former spouse or civil partner.  It is not proposed to make such a provision in the context of the law.</P>
        <P>Senators Bradford and Conway mentioned people in caring relationships such as elderly siblings living together.  This is a matter for another day but under capital acquisitions tax provisions, there is a dwelling house relief which ensures that a person who inherits the house will not face inheritance tax liability in respect of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>Does that extend to finance?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="530"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it does not.  There is a reference to dwelling house.  It does not refer to the others.  Senator Mullen is correct that a child of one civil partner who receives a gift or inheritance from the other civil partner gets a tax free threshold of &euro;332,000.  It is called the group A threshold.  He contrasted that with the lower tax rate threshold for gifts and inheritance from siblings, aunts or uncles which is about &euro;33,000, the group B threshold.  The treatment of children of civil partners is the same as that of children born of married couples, including adopted children. He is right to point that out.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It does because it is a logical extension of what we passed in law.  If we are suggesting that the tax treatment of civil partners should, by and large, be the same as the tax treatment of married couples, it follows, <i>ipso facto</i>, that there should also be this treatment of children of a civil partnership.  That is the majority view in the context of this legislation which was passed last year.  I only make these points to be helpful.  The common will is to implement this legislation and, at the very least, give people protection in the tax code for their relationships.  It would be nonsensical to enact legislation to give fundamental rights to civil partners, which excluded the tax code as part of it.</P>

    <Title>Unfinished Housing Developments: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to appear before the Members of the Seanad.  I was here once before.  I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to discuss this very important issue.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the opportunity to outline the background, recent developments and future plans that are in place to ensure clear, decisive and proactive actions are taken to progressively resolve the difficult issues with unfinished housing developments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These developments have been left in an incomplete and unsatisfactory state principally because of the actions of developers and their funders.  With the absence of capital, local authorities and, above all, residents are finding it very difficult to get developers and site owners to meet their legal obligations.  Over the course of the past year, the housing and planning divisions of my Department have jointly undertaken extensive work in partnership with local authorities and other key stakeholders to explore how the issue of unfinished or abandoned estates can be tackled in a co-ordinated and proactive manner.  Our focus has been to address the real difficulties being experienced by people living in unfinished estates in towns and villages right across the country.</P>
        <P>Resolving these developments will not be easy and will take time.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution.  The developers and site owners of such developments must accept and take on the primary responsibility for addressing the serious difficulties that have arisen.  As Minister of State, I am focusing on a number of actions that will ensure this will take place and will restore confidence in our capacity to deal with unfinished housing developments and help to achieve sustainable urban development.</P>
        <P>The fact that the issue so clearly spans across aspects of my remit makes it imperative for me as Minister of State to initiate, encourage and promote all actions necessary to progressively resolve the issues before us.  Following the completion of a detailed national survey in late 2010, during which 2,846 housing developments were surveyed, an advisory group on unfinished housing developments was established to bring forward a series of recommendations to address the issues.</P>
        <P>On 9 June 2011, I published the final report of the advisory group, entitled Resolving Ireland&rsquo;s Unfinished Housing Developments.  The report, prepared by the advisory group and chaired by Mr. John O&rsquo;Connor of the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, highlights the scale of the problem, identifies how the developments can be broadly categorised and how the different issues arising in unfinished housing developments can be best dealt with and resolved.  I would like to once again take the opportunity to publicly thank Mr. O&rsquo;Connor and the group for their efforts and dedication.</P>
        <P>I also published my Department&rsquo;s response to the advisory group&rsquo;s main recommendations.  They include: driving a more co-ordinated and partnership approach between stakeholders; <Col N="532"/>tackling public safety as an immediate priority; strengthening the legislative and policy framework to incentivise real engagement by developers, site owners and funders in working with local authorities and residents in resolving unfinished housing developments; and building confidence in the housing sector.</P>
        <P>I outlined a range of collaborative actions to address these objectives.  They include: the urgent resolution of public safety and other critical issues seriously impacting on the living conditions and quality of life for residents of unfinished developments; the development of formal liaison protocols between the various stakeholders, such as developers, financial institutions, residents, local authorities, approved housing bodies and my Department, to facilitate the sharing of information; and the prioritisation by local authorities of a number of unfinished developments to act as lead projects to demonstrate what can be achieved, building on the best practice guidance manual on managing and resolving unfinished housing developments, which I will publish shortly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the launch of the reports, I highlighted very clearly the need for the various parties to work together in tackling a very serious problem that will take time to resolve.  I emphasised that the option of sitting back and doing nothing by developers, banks, local authorities and others is not tenable and is not acceptable to me, the Government and most of all, the residents most affected.  I also outlined that the public service is playing a key facilitating role in getting things moving again, particularly in providing leadership in solving this problem.</P>
        <P>Given that resolving urgent public safety works is an immediate priority, I am pleased to note that progress is already being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates.  To date, I have made allocations totalling some &euro;1.3 million to 15 local authorities from the &euro;5 million funding allocation made available to address immediate safety issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reduction in drawdown from this fund from previous provisional allocations reflects the fact that planning authorities are already making progress in securing the co-operation of developers, financial institutions and-or bondholders, thereby obviating the need to use Exchequer resources to fund such work.  The types of works that have been approved to date include: the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas; capping of pipes; installation of street lighting; and other works to secure sites.  I will be making further allocations as applications are received from local authorities and assessed by my Department.</P>
        <P>It is important that in seeking resolutions to unfinished housing developments we do not overlook the wider housing context.  My Department has been pursuing a multi-stranded approach to obtain vacant unsold stock for use as social housing through a long-term leasing initiative that will support the delivery of sustainable communities, including through the leasing or purchase of units from NAMA.  It is also important to recognise that whatever mechanisms are used in bringing unoccupied new housing stock into beneficial use, including meeting social housing needs, ensures a good mix of tenure in specific developments.</P>
        <P>My primary concern remains the welfare of those who find themselves and their children in a very unsafe environment through no fault of their own.  I am determined to ensure that the key stakeholders work together to improve these people&rsquo;s quality of life in the immediate future, while considering what can be done to secure these areas and communities in the longer term.</P>
        <P>In response to one of the key recommendations of the advisory group&rsquo;s report regarding the need for central leadership, co-ordination and monitoring, I have established a national co-ordination committee with representation drawn from the key stakeholders involved in pro<Col N="533"/>gressing resolutions for unfinished estates, including my Department, local authorities, the housing and sustainable communities agency, financial institutions and the construction sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I chaired the first meeting of the committee on 28 June 2011 and the second yesterday.  We will be meeting on an ongoing basis to oversee implementation with the aim of publishing a report on progress within the next 12 months.  The committee is focused on drawing up an implementation plan on the actions identified by my Department on foot of the publication of the advisory group report.  The implementation plan will outline how, over the next 12 months, the various recommendations and measures are to be addressed.  It will be focused on delivering progress under the advisory group&rsquo;s main recommendations, which I have outlined, and lead to a report on progress made by next summer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I again emphasise that the resolution of these developments requires the co-operation of all parties and the adoption of a pragmatic approach.  We will continue to focus on resolving these unfinished housing developments now because waiting for the economy or market to change is not an option.  Progressive resolution is the only option and not just for the residents but for the stock of developments because these developments are deteriorating day by day.  We will work to get houses completed and occupied as soon as possible, but this will require the strong resolve of all the key stakeholders involved.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to prioritise the assessment of funding applications as they are received from local authorities.  It is my intention that the majority of the funding allocated will be assigned as soon as possible, allowing for critical safety works to commence in the most serious unfinished housing sites within the coming weeks and months.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the forthcoming debate, including constructive suggestions as to how to resolve this serious issue which has bedevilled communities right across the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am delighted that he has been elevated to this ministerial position.  I am also glad that he attends Cabinet meetings.  I know his record of protecting the most vulnerable in society over many years and I wish him well in his new ministerial portfolio.</P>
        <P>The number of unfinished estates is clearly at a record high.  The public consultation draft document, Managing and Resolving Unfinished Housing Estates, which was published in December 2010, showed that more than 2,800 housing developments were started but not fully completed as a result of the wider economic downturn.  The report also highlighted the marked decline in housing construction with completions down from a peak of 90,000 housing units in 2007 to 26,500 units in 2009.  An estimated 14,000 units were constructed last year.</P>
        <P>Although this is an extremely worrying trend, it would be wrong of us to focus solely on the numbers of such estates.  We need to look at the human tragedy, which is at the heart of this matter.  Many of these estates look like building sites and have large numbers of families living in them.  They are in need of immediate action to deal with public safety hazards such as unsecured construction materials, open excavation pits and uncovered manholes.  In addition, partially completed buildings could be unstable where no current on-site work has been undertaken and the vacancy rate is over 50%.</P>
        <P>Quite often there is no public lighting, in addition to problems with water and sewerage services, poor road surfaces, no pavements and no open areas.  Like many colleagues in this House, when I was canvassing in the last local elections and the general election, I came across such estates.  It was dangerous to canvass due to the lack of public lighting and unfinished footpaths.  Something has to be done to make these estates safe and habitable so that these families &mdash; many of whom bought their houses in good faith and are now in negative equity &mdash; can raise their children with some dignity and in relative safety.  As the father of young children <Col N="534"/>myself, I am aware of the lure of unfinished and abandoned sites, and the potential for serious injury or even loss of life.</P>
        <P>With regard to the report published this week, I am glad that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has successfully investigated the situation and responded by laying out a set of actions, as outlined by the Minister of State.  I welcome the proposal that legislation is to be reviewed with the intention of putting site resolution plans on a statutory basis and existing legislation amended to aid their implementation.</P>
        <P>While I acknowledge the positive aspects of the Department&rsquo;s response, I still have a number of real concerns.  The first relates to the need for swift and speedy action.  It has already taken an unacceptable length of time from the initial announcement by the Department of its intention to carry out a detailed national survey of all housing developments of two houses or more in the State in autumn 2010, to the production of a final report.  Despite the time given to producing this report, many of the action points contained in the Department&rsquo;s response document are still being assessed and formulated.  That is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>The response document also indicates the Government&rsquo;s establishment of a national co-ordination committee to oversee the implementation of action on unfinished developments.  This committee is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose.  I am glad to know that the committee has already met twice, but it should achieve a resolution as speedily as possible.  We owe it to families across the country who are confronted on a daily basis with grave health and safety issues, to proceed with as much speed as possible to remedy the dreadful situation in which they find themselves.  I know that some local authorities and developers or receivers have already made efforts to address some of these concerns.  However, this has only happened since the first &euro;1.5 million of the &euro;5 million funding allocated in February this year by the former Minister of State, Michael Finneran, was released to local authorities to tackle issues on the worst 230 identified estates.  This funding was made available on foot of a recommendation by the advisory group on unfinished housing developments to prioritise action on 400 of the most problematic housing developments where there were critical issues, and to resolve them as soon as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also note from the Department&rsquo;s response document that its aim is to have 300 site resolution plans in place by the end of the year.  That is 10.5% of all estates or, on average, nine per local authority.  I am not clear whether the intention is to have 300 site resolution plans drawn up by the end of this year or to be engaged in the process of implementing them.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify that matter.  I am seeking clarity on this point because it is imperative that we reach the implementation phase across the country sooner rather than later.  Speed is of the essence, as the Minister of State is aware.  Nonetheless, I acknowledge the efforts he has made to date.</P>
        <P>Finance is another concern because finishing estates is going to cost a considerable amount of money.  The national survey has shown that there are 1,655 estates where a substantial amount of work remains to be done.  Can the Minister of State tell the House where the money will come from to finish these estates?  If the &euro;5 million from the Department is split across 1,655 estates it will result in a sum of &euro;3,200 per estate.  That is a drop in the ocean and will make no obvious improvement.  Additional funding is required and, while I appreciate it will be difficult to source, it will have to be obtained because this is a major health and safety issue.</P>
        <P>Some 38 unfinished estates were identified in County Cavan and my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, has made representations to the Minister of State about them.  Having spoken personally to Cavan County Council, I understand it has identified 12 housing estates that urgently need to be dealt with.  I ask the Minister of State to fast-track the application by <Col N="535"/>Cavan County Council, which is seeking approximately &euro;500,000.  This work needs to be carried out urgently.</P>
        <P>Can the Minister of State outline the criteria used to identify these estates?  My understanding is that if a person has two unfinished houses, they will fall into this category.  Is that part of the criteria used in putting together this report?  Perhaps the Minister of State could also outline how many of the identified 1,655 estates that are in real difficulty will be rectified or safely secured by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>Once again, I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He has hit the ground running and I believe he is doing an excellent job.  The necessary finances should be provided to him because this is an urgent matter that needs to be rectified for those families living in unfinished housing estates, including their children who find themselves playing in dangerous conditions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach le haghaidh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  I commend the Minister of State on his very proactive approach since taking up office in introducing proposals on housing estates.  I am referring to the advisory group he established which eventually led to the publication of the report, Resolving Ireland&rsquo;s Unfinished Housing Developments.  Having read the report, I recognise a considerable amount of work remains to be done and the Minister of State outlined some of the initiatives he has taken.</P>
        <P>The prevalence of these housing developments is a very tangible and concrete remnant of what was termed the boom times or the Celtic tiger, which we now know was not a tiger, but a tiger running away, with the houses built on very shaky foundations, as it were, which have now collapsed.  We need to ensure this kind of thing will never hit this country again, not only on the economic side but also on the planning and development side.  In his contribution the Minister of State referred to the payment of &euro;1.3 million of the &euro;5 million allocated in the first tranche for dealing with the most problematic unfinished housing developments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When he launched the report in June, he expressed some concern about the feedback from local authorities on unfinished developments and getting positive engagement from developers, site owners, financial institutions and others dealing with the issue.  I thank the Minister of State for chairing the advisory committee.  Has he received satisfactory co-operation?  There was strong consensus in the advisory group on what should be done.  It is important that the various stakeholders involved in the troubled developments, including banks, developers and departmental officials, should roll up their sleeves and work with the local authorities and residents involved.  I know the priority for the Minister of State at the moment is the immediate safety element and he outlined some of the issues he is pursuing in the problematic estates.  The previous speaker spoke about the issues we have all seen.  I have come across people who are crying because they are living in building sites &mdash; they could not be called housing estates.  We must ask what we can do to resolve the problems they are living with as quickly as we can.</P>
        <P>Representatives of NAMA addressed the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party recently.  I hope NAMA is placing the same priority on the issue as the Minister of State.  It has a major role to play in the estates that are under its control rather than the control of the Minister of State.  How is that agency co-operating with the Minister of State?  In theory the &euro;5 million allocated to address immediate safety issues is to be paid back eventually by the developers, but I would not hold my breath.  We need to find money but I do not know where.  Obviously there is work that can be done without money.  There are unemployed builders whom we could bring in to work with us on some schemes.  There is more than one way to skin a cat.  I ask the Minister of State to pursue every avenue.  When I was first elected to a local authority in 1991, we often talked about rogue builders not finishing estates.  That was at a time when they had plenty of money, yet they often walked off without finishing an estate, leaving the local authority with <Col N="536"/>problems.  It is not just rogue builders with whom we are dealing.  There was reckless lending to builders and to others.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said that along with the advisory committee he was keeping an eye on how things are moving with local authorities.  He mentioned the national co-ordination committee and said he would have a report in 12 months.  I look forward to receiving a detailed report outlining where we are at this time.  We are not talking about regeneration of estates; it is just a stopgap.  We have been required to step in and do something because we cannot wait for the builders to do it.  Evidence indicates that regeneration must be people focused.  The people suffering in these estates often need more than just the physical environment because many of them have also lost their jobs.  While I commend the Minister of State on making safety his paramount priority, I hope the advisory committee will also provide for support on the social aspect.  That should be borne in mind for people who are abandoned or in distraught situations when the Minister of State is prioritising future funding for ghost estates.</P>
        <P>Necessary action needs to be taken to address those estates because we do not want in five years&rsquo; time to have some of the social problems we have seen in certain urban areas as a result of bad planning.  Planning as a whole needs to be people focused.  The previous speaker gave some statistics and I will outline one of them.  Leitrim had 91 houses built per 1,000 of population, which was almost three times the number for County Wicklow at 31 per 1,000 of population or Dublin at 33 per 1,000 of population.  Such building was led by tax breaks and did not represent sustainable development.  I heard the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Hogan, say that sustainable development in planning is a priority for the Government, on which I commend them.  There is an impact on residents from bad planning, and the planners and banks need to be and are being reined in.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has said this is the beginning, but we need to get it resolved and the previous speaker spoke about the resolution.  We find ourselves in a unique situation.  Often in the past when we were talking about unfinished housing estates, we might have been talking about one or two developers, which is why the Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced the legislation on rogue developers.  We are now dealing with a national disaster with these houses, not only in the funding but also in planning.  The Minister of State mentioned some of the initiatives on which he is working with the Department of Social Protection.  Houses represent a valuable asset, regardless of whether they are half constructed or fully constructed.  Many people have asked what will happen to those estates and whether they will be knocked down.  I believe demolition would be a resolution of last resort because many people need houses.  In his contribution, the Minister of State mentioned the different types of facilities he is considering.  I hope the upcoming report will outline where we will go from here.</P>
        <P>I believe the Minister of State said that 15 local authorities had taken up the option of dealing with it, with immediate plans for public safety.  The management companies in some unfinished estates have simply pulled off site and left the residents high and dry.  What is the status of legislation on management companies?  The advisory group reported that 2,846 developments were surveyed, of which 58% had substantial construction work.  As we do not know where we can find money, we need innovative ways to address the issue.  Within the 1,655 developments, there is a further cohort of developments with serious completion issues and residents are significantly affected.  While not everybody in the House might have dealt with it in person, we have definitely all seen it on television.  However, we do not need to see it on television because every second person in the country is talking about it as well.</P>
        <P>With regard to the taking in charge by local authorities of housing estates, naturally enough, local authorities cannot take them in charge because they do not have the funding and are strapped for cash.  This brings me to the issue of planning enforcement.  When we talk about <Col N="537"/>completion, planning enforcement is a priority.  Builders should not be allowed to move on with a development until they have finished, say, ten or 15 houses to a high standard.  Planning enforcement should be done in such a way that it is seen as better to have ten units finished than to have 500 half-finished, where a developer has said he can build 500 units cheaper but then runs away from the whole lot.</P>
        <P>This is not a completely new problem but it is a serious problem none the less.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, for attending and for his proactive approach to addressing this matter in a very short time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, to the House and wish him every success in dealing with this problem, which is literally a blot on the landscape.  It is a testament to how we got into this situation.  The effects can be seen in every county of reckless lending by financial institutions, more so in the western part of the country, and of a building industry which expected property prices to rise by 20% per annum <i>ad infinitum</i>, which could not happen.</P>
        <P>This problem should be taken away altogether from the banks.  The Minister of State has to deal with the physical problem on the ground, as he sees it.  The prices of these properties should be allowed to fall as low as possible until we find some other uses for them.  We are not propping up the value of pension funds, bank shares or NAMA either.  I hope NAMA has a short life and I do not want it to hang around as the Land Commission did, giving out land for 114 years from 1885 until the late 1990s.  NAMA must come to an end quickly.  If we got these houses on the market at very low prices, which is all most of them are worth, it would immediately improve the competitiveness of the Irish economy in that workers would be spending a much smaller proportion of their budgets on housing than they were at the peak of the boom, when house prices were high.</P>
        <P>Is there leeway in the plan for the Minister of State under the planning Acts to get planning permission to complete X number of houses rather than leaving, as Senator Keane said, so many half-finished houses?  Could the position of half-finished houses be approached under dangerous and derelict buildings legislation, of which I am sure the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department has adequate supply?  This would mean we would get these houses at whatever the knock-down price is.  Perhaps we should have some auctions just to see what the knock-down price is and get these houses lived in at low cost.  I agree with Senator Keane that the last thing we should do is consider knocking any of them down.</P>
        <P>The builders and bankers will have to realise they will not get their money back on these properties because they were built with such vastly unrealistic expectations.  We need a market in which the price of these properties and sites falls to some level at which there will be activity, including, as the Minister of State said, social housing and bargain houses for young people.  Perhaps they are in out-of-the-way or inconvenient places but if the price is low enough, they will be taken up.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister of State to consider measures such as changes of ownership where people are sitting on assets and almost trying to have a battle of wits with the Minister of State that it is necessary to acquire ownership at some notional price based on the peak of the boom.  We should have the power to acquire at current prices sites and buildings that are not being completed.</P>
        <P>Ireland must lose its property fixation.  Unfortunately, many of the tax breaks will take a long time to run out of our tax system but we must never again get into that property fixation, which, by the way, deprives the Exchequer of badly needed tax receipts at this stage.  If we can get some market price for these properties and sell them subject to completion requirements <Col N="538"/>in accordance with planning laws, they can fulfil a valuable role up and down the country and not be the kind of dereliction Senators Wilson and Keane spoke about, which is literally a blot on the landscape.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, to the House and I particularly welcome the discussion we are having on unfinished estates.  I agree with my colleagues that ghost estates are the most visible scars in the country today of the excesses of the Celtic tiger.  We cannot ignore the plight of those who are suffering in these estates and we cannot kick the can forward.  The Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, has taken expedient action to deal with this matter, which is not of the Government&rsquo;s creation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to remember when we talk about ghost estates that not all of these developments are in the towns and villages of Ireland.  While Cavan has 802 completed and vacant houses, Dublin city has 2,538, D&uacute;n Laoghaire has 1,477, Fingal has 1,517 and south Dublin has 1,286, and this figure does not include numbers near completion.  All in all, the greater Dublin area has 9,131 houses complete and vacant or near completion.  I also believe these numbers are understated.  The advisory group&rsquo;s report only relates to estates where work was commenced after April 2007 with a vacancy rate of over 10%.  This survey does not include estates with a vacancy rate below 10% or estates built in 2005 and 2006, where I have no doubt there are significant vacancies.</P>
        <P>I am afraid I must disagree with other speakers.  The harsh reality is that some of the unfinished housing in our ghost estates will have to be knocked down.  They are in the wrong locations and it will take more resources than would be justifiable to keep them.  There are, however, good reasons why taking ownership of the best stock in urban areas would be the smart thing to do.  At present, aside from pressing housing need, we know the latest census reveals that Ireland&rsquo;s population is growing strongly owing to high numbers of births.  We also know there has been little or no social housing or private construction in recent years, with none expected in the medium term.  The Irish State also pays more than &euro;500 million in rent supplement to people in the private rented sector, with a number of these units reported to be below minimum standards.  In this regard, I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s recent initiative to give extra resources to local authorities to ensure that rented housing is fit for purpose.  We also have 5,000 homeless individuals and families in this country at present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the face of all of this, it is difficult to see how we cannot insist on some social dividend from this debacle &mdash; a NAMA for the people by another name.  The reality is that once the current overhang in the market, estimated by the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department to be around four years supply, is exhausted, we face a potential housing shortage in as little as five years time.  It would be a disaster if the existing vacant units were sold off to some overseas carpetbagger in a bargain basement sale paid for by the taxpayer.  The least we can expect is some social dividend for the people from this unmitigated disaster.</P>
        <P>The Allsop auction, I point out to Senator Barrett, showed a 70% decline in Irish house prices relative to 2007 prices.  Surely, this is the time to realise this asset for the Irish people.  It was the foresight of previous Ministers in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s which saw an end to the slums.  The same clear thinking today could be a significant help to future generations.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, to take whatever steps are necessary, including nationalisation, to save the housing stock of Ireland.</P>
        <P>We now have houses built in locations where no one ever intended to live.  They were built purely for the tax reliefs which could be gained with no interest paid to the towns and villages all over Ireland which are blighted by high-rise apartments and suburban sprawl.  Villages are now surrounded by empty houses where previously these tax-led developments drove up local <Col N="539"/>land prices and local people could not afford to compete against the spectre of speculation and what would become the cynical irony of our ghost estates.</P>
        <P>While I understand that most of the developed world has suffered since the crash of 2008, we cannot and should not forget that it was the previous Government&rsquo;s policy that led to this particular problem.  Rewarding speculation by cutting capital gains tax by half, making it more profitable to speculate in housing than to do a decent day&rsquo;s work plus unnecessary tax incentives driven by the location of votes and not by housing need have contributed to where we are today.</P>
        <P>I welcome the recommendations of the report that local authorities should compel those responsible for this problem to shoulder the burden.  While we will support the Minister of State in every way where this issue is concerned, we must think outside the box and consider utilising suitable vacant houses for social housing.  The Department will also need to provide local authorities with the powers and finances to take on developers who are unwilling to co-operate and are leaving in the lurch householders who have invested significant amounts in their family homes.  This last is unacceptable and we will give the Minister of State our full support in taking on the challenge.</P>
        <P>The other issue raised was that of the tax incentive schemes, about which I have reservations.  One would assume that so many vacant houses were built because of tax incentives, but it has been shown that only 10% of vacant properties were supported under such schemes.  That 90% were not supported indicates that the issue is much wider than assumed.  Many counties did not receive the benefit of a tax incentive scheme.</P>
        <P>I thank the Acting Chairman for giving me time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, to the House.  He has a challenging and interesting portfolio, one in which he will succeed.  I suspect his experience of many years as a member of a county council gives him the types of insight that are important in terms of addressing the current problem.</P>
        <P>The Irish have had an extraordinary relationship with housing and house ownership.  Perhaps this stems somewhat from our colonial past but, apart from our neighbours in Great Britain, the Irish people&rsquo;s relationship with house ownership is unique.  For generations, the auctioneer&rsquo;s maxim has been &ldquo;location, location, location&rdquo;.  Often, this has resulted in one&rsquo;s entire education, career and life options being dominated by one&rsquo;s address.  It has put a premium on housing and the value of a house, resulting in the extraordinary economic crisis we are facing.  During the past ten or 15 years, we built an entire economy around the housing industry.  When one considers the number of houses built in the Republic compared with similar sized countries, we should not wonder why we are where we are.  To the Minister of State and the Government falls the challenge of addressing this difficult dilemma.</P>
        <P>Some years ago, we would have expected unfinished housing estates to be a problem in large urban centres, but it is a problem across the entire country, including in some small villages.  Given the number of unfinished houses and how many people desperate for housing are on our housing lists, one must ask whether it is possible to marry these problems into a productive and worthwhile solution.</P>
        <P>In one sense, the most important part of the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution was when he outlined clearly that he was pursuing a multi-strand approach while recognising that any mechanism must be introduced in a manner that ensures a good mixture of housing.  Many of our housing and social difficulties stem from a bad housing mix.  In a rush to solve the housing problem, previous Governments devised a system that has not worked and has caused many social difficulties in some of our major urban towns.  We must try to avoid a recurrence of this <Col N="540"/>problem.  What will we do with the tens of thousands of vacant houses and the many ghost estates when so many people are desperately looking for accommodation?</P>
        <P>Most of the Members present have been members of local authorities.  Almost every local authority has a significant housing list.  When constituents ask us why vacant houses cannot be allocated to them, it is difficult to respond and we must try to suggest various reasons and excuses.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to put some of the jigsaw together.</P>
        <P>Regarding more immediate problems, I am not 100% sure of my facts but it may have been suggested that legislation allowing certain extensions to planning permission might cause a difficulty in terms of drawing down of bonds.  The Minister of State might address this issue.  I do not have experience of a large number of cases but, in many instances, local authorities are not inclined to draw down bonds because the value of those bonds are not sufficient to carry out the required works.  This leads to negotiations between the developer and the local authority because the authority frequently tries to procure a better solution.</P>
        <P>Senator Hayden referred to the need for a type of NAMA for the people.  Many of the estates in question are owned by NAMA, the workings of which we have debated and will continue to debate.  It is too early to assess NAMA&rsquo;s potential for success, but the fact that it owns so many houses gives the State a significant role in putting a new housing policy in place.  The recent census figures were interesting, in that they showed surprising growth trends in certain areas.  Given the vast number of unoccupied houses, a case can be made for the future occupation of the majority of them.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>On the basis of a visual examination, virtually every county appears to have estates that were commenced four or five years ago and are now in such a state of disrepair that one wonders whether completing them is possible.  Sadly, the only outcome in some areas may be for housing estates to be demolished.  Several years ago, one would not have envisaged houses being built, not being lived in and then being knocked down.  I would not advocate demolition, but it may be the only solution from a health and safety perspective in a small minority of cases.  I do not want to name estates, towns or villages, but I know of a few places in County Cork where this would appear to be the only option.</P>
        <P>I concede that the money available to the Minister of State is limited.  We all know the economic times in which we live.  It is ironic that we are trying to solve a housing crisis in the midst of an economic crisis caused in the main by that housing crisis.  This is the interesting challenge lying ahead of the Minister of State.  We have a moral obligation to remember the tens of thousands of people whose lives have been blighted by not having homes.  We must proclaim them as having a higher priority of need than those living in unfinished estates.  Our first priority must be to try to house them.  Since unfinished and some finished estates contain vacant houses, we must try to tackle the two problems together.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well in his deliberations.  His work will require a hands on approach and the full weight of his Department must be brought to bear.  Unfinished and ghost housing estates are symptomatic of our economic tragedy.  During the coming years, we must try to reverse the trend in this regard.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for being with us and offering us his initial thoughts on this issue.  It will be a rolling process.  There will not be a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; solution to this.  Different regions, counties and towns will have different requirements and there needs to be flexibility in the approach taken.  We obviously need finance but we must politically prioritise the people currently who do not have a house of their own in which to live and who are paying hugely inflated rental prices every week.  Taxpayers&rsquo; money is being poured down the drain with the subsidisation of rent under the rent allowance scheme while there are many vacant houses <Col N="541"/>available.  Finding a single solution to those myriad problems is a huge challenge but I look forward with confidence to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to it in the next few years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Like previous speakers, I acknowledge that he has inherited a real mess which must be sorted out.  He should be given the time, space and support from all political parties to make sure that we deal with the real issues with which he has to grapple.  It is important to set a context for today&rsquo;s discussion.</P>
        <P>I welcome the report on unfinished housing estates and remind Members of some of the figures in it.  There were 23,250 complete and vacant dwellings, 9,976 dwellings were near completion, 982 developments were substantially complete, 150 developments were 90% complete, no construction was commenced on 109 developments and substantial works were outstanding on 1,655 estates.</P>
        <P>Like the Minister of State, I was a member of a local authority, Waterford City Council, for seven years.  I saw at first hand the relationship between decisions we had to make as local elected representatives and what was happening nationally in terms of the construction bubble, the drive towards development and where all of that was going.  I remember that when we had to compile our city development plan we had to make decisions on the zoning of land and making millionaires out of landowners and individuals overnight and all of that was fuelled by people who simply wanted to make money.  I can give examples of where that occurred across the country but County Waterford is one region where I can certainly cite that there was overzoning of land.  Huge amounts of land were overzoned and that has led to its own problems.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must put this debate in context in terms of what is happening in the economy.  We have this problem because the property bubble was fuelled.  Too many houses were built, developers borrowed cheap money from banks and banks here borrowed money from banks in foreign countries and from the bond markets and far too much was built far too quickly.  We were building this house of cards that we all knew would collapse and we were told there would be a soft landing but that was not what happened.  We now have to borrow billions of euros to sort out the problems in the banks.  We had to establish NAMA and it has acquired many of these properties and now the taxpayer is being asked to foot the bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Arising from the Minister of State&rsquo;s report, I note he has set aside &euro;5 million for health and safety works that need to be done.  That figure can be compared to what we are paying back in terms of NAMA and the interest alone on the bailout.  It is phenomenal.  The amount of &euro;5 million is what we are giving back to those communities who we all agree are suffering, yet we are paying tens of billions of euro to speculators and gamblers who are partly responsible for causing this mess in the first place.  It is truly shocking but that is where we are at.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have a number of concerns about the report.  It refers to the role the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, should have in respect of some of these unfinished estates.  There is a difference between unfinished estates and ghost estates.  There are many estates in which many people are living but on which the work was simply not completed.  I understand the HSA has responsibility only for active estates and not inactive estates and I wonder how they will be dealt with.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This brings us back to the relationship between developers, local authorities and politicians and the fact that developers were able to get away with murder in these estates in terms of what they did.  I can cite two examples in my county of Waterford.  I remember visiting two housing estates in the Ballinroad area of Dungarvan a year ago, the Grianan estate and that of Pairc Na mBlath.  I talked to people at their front doors who were in tears.  They had paid huge amounts of money for their properties.  There is a problem with the water supply there.  In terms of the well that was dug, the water pressure is not sufficient, which means there is a <Col N="542"/>problem with drinking water supply and elements in showers, kettles and other appliances are being burned out.  There was also an absence of street lighting.  There is a fantastic amenity in the area, which is linked from the Ballinroad roundabout to Clonea.  Ballinroad is straddled between Dungarvan town and Clonea.  At the roundabout at Ballinroad there is a fantastic walkway and cycleway leading to Clonea but there was no footpath to enable the people from the housing estate to avail of that amenity.  This is what was happening in Celtic tiger Ireland.  People paid huge amounts of money for their properties, part of which were development levies, but the money accruing from them were not ring-fenced to carry out these works.  A disgraceful decision was made by the previous Government to allow developers to opt out and buy out of their Part V responsibilities.  That money in many cases was not ring-fenced to build more social housing or to invest in local communities.  I accept that all these problems are a hangover from the past but many of them still persist.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the proposed site resolution plans.  It is crucial that the people living in these estates are part of the consultation process and that a framework is established to allow them to have a say.  I would like the Minster of State to respond to this point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Derelict Sites Act was cited as a measure that could be used.  I am sure the Minister of State in his experience as a local councillor had major battles with his county manager over many years about using the powers under the Derelict Sites Act and was told it was a blunt or crude instrument, it was not what should be used and was rarely used, and asked to cite a handful of examples of where it had been used.  I welcome the fact that we can try and use this Act but I do not see how we can effectively use it to deal with some of problems in unfinished housing estates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I spoke about the bailout, that we are in this position because of mistakes made by developers, politicians and regulators who should have known better.  NAMA was established but there has been no social dividend to the people from that process.  The best way to give people a social dividend is to ensure that all those properties which are now vacant are used for the purposes of providing homes for people who need them.  I was disappointed the Minister&rsquo;s recent statement on future housing policy did not indicate anything new.  There is no new departure from what was put in place by the previous Government where we now have privatisation of social housing and no funding for it.  When I was a member of Waterford City Council I recall being told by the city manager that there was no capital funding for this year, next year and probably the year after, and he could not tell me when the next local authority housing estate would be built.  It is all long-term leasing and again we are supporting developers.  They can lease their properties to local authorities and make profits on the back of people&rsquo;s housing need.  Hundreds of millions of euros are being spent subsidising people in private rented accommodation throughout the State and yet there are housing estates that have not been completed, and there are vacant houses in others into which people could move.  We should implement the imaginative proposals, including in the area of housing, put forward by the Minister of State&rsquo;s party and about which its members spoke vociferously prior to the election to bring about the kind of changes the Minister of State promised.   Some of the imaginative proposals put forward in the context of the election campaign by the Minister of State&rsquo;s party while in opposition, as well as by Fianna F&aacute;il and other parties, should be implemented to deal with unfinished housing estates and ensure a social dividend for taxpayers and a return on the mess, created by others, which landed us in this situation.  The best way to provide a return is to ensure these houses are used for the purposes for which they were built, namely, to house people.  The Minister of State has an opportunity to grasp that nettle by providing the funding to allow that to happen.  I hope he can respond to the issues I have raised.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State is aware of the myriad problems befalling us in respect of housing estates.  I welcome him to the House.  This is an interesting House.  It is so beautiful, so qualitative, so historic and so magnificent in architecture, which makes it even more poignant considering the subject of our discussion.  Some of these housing estates were built without heeding the fact that human beings would live in them.  Some of these unfinished housing estates must be the greatest ugliness to befall our towns and heartlands.  It never ceases to baffle me how this ugliness receives planning permission, leaving aside the actual architectural construction.  I congratulate the Minister of State on his initiative in this regard.  Every time I drive home to County Mayo, I am ashamed about what was allowed to happen because of greed in the guise of tax incentives.  If it was not tax incentives, the previous Government was even more reprehensible and lacking in foresight.</P>
        <P>Many of the reports on these sites refer to securing the sites but does securing sites and their ugliness aid and abet putting the real problem on a long finger?  In other words, if we make them safe, the job is three quarters done and we can abandon them.  What is the timeframe for the national co-ordination committee in the progression of the resolution?  What will we do if developers and site owners who have abandoned their properties do not take on primary responsibility for addressing the difficulties?  Have the developers and site owners been given a timeframe to respond adequately?</P>
        <P>Missing from the report, Resolving Ireland&rsquo;s Unfinished Housing Developments, was a creative attempt at a solution.  It addressed issues such as containment, safety and co-ordination of the various interests concerned but there was little on what could be done with the developments afterwards.  Perhaps an open competition could be organised along the lines of Your Country, Your Call to come up with creative uses in the future.  We could take a giant creative leap in this regard.</P>
        <P>How many houses does the Minister of State intend to bulldoze?  If I had a bulldozer I would be on the motorway to begin demolishing them.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State has been honest and transparent in laying out his stall.  He is correct in pointing out the extent of the problem.  As is evident from today&rsquo;s debate, there is no easy fix for this problem but I hope we can contribute towards the search for a way forward.  I recall going to America in the late 1960s and the early 1970s and meeting members of the first generation of Irish emigrants, some of whom were quite elderly.  They spoke to me about the homesteads they left behind in certain parts of Ireland and which were being left to crumble.  Some of my colleagues are old enough to recall driving through Mayo and other parts of the west and wondering about the human story behind these homesteads.  The general feeling at that time was of despondency.  There was no hope for rural Ireland and it was virtually a desert.  Subsequently, various people came forward with their vision for the future, such as Canon John Hayes, the founder of Muintir na T&iacute;re, Fr. James McDyer in Glencolmcille, who came up with the co-operative movement, and Monsignor James Horan, who decided to build an airport in a soggy, boggy part of Ireland.  One can see the effect these movements had in their time and we need to take a similar approach.  However, when the <Col N="544"/>resurgence came to rural Ireland, with young people trying to build one-off houses in rural areas and emigrants in America, Britain and Australia wishing to return, all kinds of problems, difficulties and ideologies were put in their way.  They were pushed into congested areas, often destroying the character of the villages and towns in which they were made to live.</P>
        <P>History has an obscene habit of repeating itself.  This can be seen in our discussion of the housing developments that are left standing as a monument to greed and the lack of constructive vision.  We will have to live with the legacy of the building frenzy which spawned the Celtic tiger for many years to come.  We have to solve the multifaceted problems these sites give rise to, including safety and anti-social behaviour.  This anti-social behaviour is spilling over to terrorise adjoining communities.  We must also think about the unfortunate people who wanted homes of their own and bought at fixed interest rates at the peak of the boom.  When interest rates came down, they did not benefit and they are stuck with 8% or 9% interest rates on houses that are not worth half of what they paid for them.  Furthermore, the estates in which they live are not even sufficiently developed to justify the money they are paying on their mortgages.</P>
        <P>Unlike the rural difficulties, which largely arose from deprivation, the urban issue is the result of the availability of cash from the banks.  I will not address the issue of the banks or the unfortunate elderly people who are suffering from the destruction of their pension funds.  However, if we do not take a radical approach to the problems we are discussing we will not solve them.  We must have joined-up policies because this is not about a single issue.  There are many factors involved, with some Members correctly making reference to people currently on housing lists.  Some of these people have an income and a vision or ambition to ensure they have a family home.  They must be brought into the equation.  I will return to the issue of developers in a moment and the responsibility lying with them.  We should have a radical policy that puts aside some of the legal constraints, and we can do this in a legislative manner.  If we do not act, we will tinker with the issue for the next 50 years.  The Land Commission, which has already been mentioned, exceeded 100 years.  This is not a fallacy; it will happen.</P>
        <P>Our current bad position will get worse.  I recall sitting on a town council in the bad old days when money was pretty scarce.  People paid rent on council houses but those with a vision within the local authority system, and those who were elected with much to offer, came up with the idea of giving an incentive to tenants to look after a house.  When people paid rent, even if there was a scratch on the door a tenant would ask the council to repair it.  We had a constant stream of people with such requests.  The idea was to give such people ownership, allowing the rent to become part of a loan to be repaid for the house, so that at the end of a period the tenants would own it.  That is exactly how we should be thinking.</P>
        <P>There are people currently on housing lists and I hope we can lay aside legal constraints to tackle this issue.  A skilled tradesman on such a  list could be prepared to work within a policy framework to finish a house.  We do not like personal ideas in the House but I recall at one stage the urban council in Cashel purchased the local dance hall in order to make it into a community hall.  It was bought for &pound;14,000 but it was in a bad state of repair and there was no way we could get money to refurbish it.  Our idea was that anybody who wished, such as electricians, painters or carpenters, could donate hours of service.  This was overly subscribed and the hall was finished to a standard to use as a community centre.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we brought this idea to the individual we can only imagine the enthusiasm there would be if somebody was allocated a house at a cost but on the understanding that it would be finished to a particular standard.  Members may believe this is off the wall but what other options have we?  How often have we seen communities act when people have seen enough, with tenants sweeping outside their own premises when the council did not do it, for example?  Whole areas <Col N="545"/>were cleaned up as a result.  Why is there a Tidy Towns competition, which we can be so pleased with and happy about?  That has elevated the people of the country.  We have trusted the individual and individual idealism.</P>
        <P>I go back to Fr. McDyer and others who have been mentioned.  Unless we return to such idealism we will not succeed with policies that do not have courage, vision and ambition built in.  I am with the Minister of State, although I know he has a difficult task.  He has an enviable record at local level and we are probably preaching to the converted.  He knows the problems.  As I noted at the outset, I hope in some way that the contributions we make will give some idea of a new form of thinking.  We do not want partisanship in the Chamber at the expense of human ambition, and we must all work together to a certain timescale.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House.  I have a great and interesting vision of him riding with Senator O&rsquo;Donnell along the motorway with a bulldozer.  There is merit in that argument.  As my colleague, Senator Hayden, pointed out, there will be a need to bulldoze some of the buildings or estates.  It is far too simplistic to say that all of them can be matched with homeless people, as the Minister of State knows.  If the Minister of State had a euro for every piece of advice he was given about matching empty houses with homeless people since he took the job, he probably would not be sitting here.</P>
        <P>I will not add to the advice but I remember during the general election going to an estate in Kinlough, north Leitrim, where many estates were built as it was seen as a nearby place for cheaper housing for people working in Sligo.  It is a beautiful corner of the country.  I knocked on a door and a young woman who was pregnant and due to give birth on the same day as the election answered, so the canvassing did not go too well.  As she looked out from her house there was nothing but an empty field as the estate was not finished; only seven people were living there.  This is the same story heard by the Minister of State time and again.</P>
        <P>On that day I spoke to somebody who lived in America for some time and told me that in the US the amenities are built first and people are not allowed to build a house until parks and swings are installed and the area is cleaned up.  We are now discussing the mess that has been left but we should also take cognisance of the future.  Perhaps we could act more practically in future so that we could eliminate all the problems of developers supposedly putting money into safe places to be used to finish estates but in reality running off with the funding.  Every future plan should learn from this.</P>
        <P>With regard to Kinlough, I draw attention to the fact that Leitrim, one of the most beautiful counties in Ireland, has the most ghost estates per head of population.  I am sure the Minister of State is more than well aware of that figure and knows the source of it.  Unfortunately, we are not making it up.  I doubt there was a house built recently in the counties of Sligo, Longford, Roscommon and Cavan not involved with the upper Shannon renewal scheme and with tax relief.  Those counties were exploited in that way, and such places now face particular levels of emigration.  They are the locations where people flocked to work, mainly in the construction industry.</P>
        <P>If we can consider piloting housing projects, we should examine the case in Leitrim.  Even in the so-called good years there was higher unemployment in that county and fewer people received third level education.  More young men were reliant on one industry than another and there was a greater ageing community.  The county did not benefit in the way other counties did from the so-called boom, and now the people find themselves as inheritors of more ghost estates.  It is a cruel irony that has occurred in the area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The people were given promise by the upper Shannon renewal scheme, which was a great idea to bring prosperity to those counties.  It was a fine idea but it has not worked.  In the <Col N="546"/>destruction of Leitrim and other counties, we find ourselves with almost empty counties.  What can be offered in their place?  We certainly do not want any more schemes with a monetary or tax relief basis.  I echo Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s comments on joined-up thinking and the need to think creatively.  We must be thinking about the legacy for that county and extend such work.</P>
        <P>We need active re-engagement with the community to gauge strengths, which would require the recognition that the housing issue is not just the problem of empty houses but it is the underpinning of our society, in effect.  We see this concept mostly in a place like Leitrim.  It has great strengths in agriculture, food and tourism, with all surveys showing a very high level of the community involved in caring and volunteering activities there.  Surely we can build on that through a social innovation centre that could be linked to the institute of technology in Sligo.  There are strong links between Leitrim and places across the county bounds.  The co-operation between Sligo Institute of Technology and South West College in Enniskillen presents opportunities for Leitrim.  Some possible creative solutions for rebuilding these developments or making them safe have been hurled at the Minister of State in the months since he took up his post.  There is a need to ensure the specific communities that have been abandoned are reactivated by other Departments.  The Minister of State needs to contact those Departments and join the dots along the line.  He should remind the Departments of the poor legacy these communities have inherited and ensure they are at the top of the heap when decisions on regenerating rural communities are made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will always remember the woman in Kinlough.  She moved there with the aim of bringing up her family in a community.  Instead, she is looking at an empty field from an estate with about four people living in it.  That woman and others will be abandoned unless we find ways of helping to rebuild these communities.  There may be some merit in looking creatively at the JobBridge scheme for interns.  I welcome the scheme and the policing of it that we have seen in recent days.  I do not know whether there is merit in extending it specifically to cater for those interested in ways of doing up houses, as suggested by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  Perhaps we can put in place a scheme for a year or two to employ people who are looking to learn and improve their skills and thereby deal with some of the safer and better houses.  We are not talking about the houses that will be bulldozed by Senator O&rsquo;Donnell as she goes down the motorway.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Cullinane and his Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues are not the only people who are outraged by the fact that we are unable to give as much money as we would like back to these communities.  I do not doubt that the Minister of State has scoured the pockets and the seams to see how much money can be provided for the restoration of houses.  The idea that the Government somehow prefers to give the money to the banks is quite ridiculous.  Not a single person in this room or in the Government enjoys having to give money to the banks when it is needed by other people.  The Senator is not in sole possession of that kind of outrage.  We are all concerned.  The Government will do its best to try to find ways of dealing with the challenges that have been created.  I thank the Minister of State for his efforts to date.  We look forward to seeing him in the House again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I thank him for the efforts he is making to deal with this difficult problem.  A number of months ago, I was asked to speak at the historical society of UCC.  The society was having a debate on comparisons between the recession of the 1980s and the current recession.  I spoke from my perspective as someone who comes from a legal practice.  I mentioned that in the 1980s, a guy with four young children came to my office and said he wanted to buy a new three-bedroom semi-detached house.  The deposit on the house was &pound;100, which he did not have.  I was able to send him to <Col N="547"/>the bank to borrow &pound;100 and, as a result, he was able to buy the house.  If a person with &euro;100,000 in the bank came to me now to buy the same house, they would not get a loan to be able to buy it.  I suppose that is the big difference.  Even though we were going through a recession in the 1980s, it is interesting that we were still able to keep the flow of house sales and purchases going.  At the time, many people availed of a scheme that created social problems in some areas.  I refer to the provision of a &pound;5,000 grant to those who were willing to surrender their local authority house and buy their own house.  It is unfortunate that we are unable to offer a similar scheme during these times to keep the market moving.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe, spoke about the need to have services in place before starting to build estates.  I have seen a copy of the planning permission that was granted for a development in Edinburgh a number of years ago.  The developers in question, who had acquired 200 army houses for refurbishment, were required to assess how many new families would be moving into the area.  Not only did they have to provide all the services before any of the houses could be sold, they also had to assess the number of children who would be living in the area and build or extend playgrounds and additional classrooms in primary and secondary schools on that basis.  It is interesting to note that this system has been in place in Edinburgh for many years.</P>
        <P>I would like to raise two issues that relate to the taking in charge of estates.  I will give a simple example of a problem with the system that has been in place for many years.  Four months ago, I came across an estate of seven houses for which planning permission was granted in 1997.  The developer built roads, footpaths and lampposts before selling seven sites.  Some 13 years on, the estate does not have any lighting.  I wrote to the local authority on a number of occasions before eventually telephoning an official to make the case.  The problem came to a head at the end of last year during the frosty weather.  One has to drive downhill to get into the estate, but that was impossible due to the weather conditions.  People had to park on the main road.  If they wanted to go out at night, they had to walk out of an estate with no lights and with ice on all the roads and footpaths.  I suppose it really brought it to a head.  I contacted the local authority to ask why this was not sorted out.  It seems that the bond which was in place was not adequate to cover the cost of the additional work that had to be done.  The question of the inability of local authorities to follow through arises once more.  The attitude of the local authority official was that I should not be complaining because the case in question dated to 1997 and much older estates have not been taken in charge.  It is a question of accountability.  Local authorities are answerable to the Minister of State and his Department.  Not only are we letting builders and developers off the hook for not completing estates, we are also letting the local authorities off the hook for not enforcing the rules.  The problem in this case is that the bond is not sufficient to cover the costs that have arisen.  At the end of the day, taxpayers will have to pay for the local authority to finish the estate.</P>
        <P>The second issue I want to speak about is the question of compliance with the Part V regulations.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment last week.  The problem is that lands or houses which are supposed to be made available to local authorities under Part V when estates are built are not being made available.  In some cases, the parcel of land that was promised to the local authority is mortgaged to a different financial institution that is not involved with NAMA.  I referred last week to 160 apartments that have been built.  The development is mortgaged with a bank that is not part of the NAMA process.  A second lot of property, which should have been given to the local authority, is mortgaged to a different bank that is no longer co-operating.  The local authority is saying that none of the apartments can be sold because the builder or developer &mdash; there is a receiver in there now &mdash; is not complying with Part V.  This has been going on for over 12 months.  If the receiver wanted to get money by selling the properties, he would be prevented from doing so.  We need to be proactive in dealing with such <Col N="548"/>cases.  I accept that there is a problem with Part V compliance, but I am concerned that local authorities are not responding to the need to deal with this issue.  I understand their argument that the legislation governing this area means they do not have an option in this matter.  On the legal side the purchaser&rsquo;s solicitors maintain they have not been furnished with an engineer&rsquo;s declaration of compliance with planning permission because those involved have not complied with Part V.  Therefore, the solicitors cannot certify the title.  This is a problem that must be remedied because otherwise these properties will remain as they are until it is resolved.  I am unsure exactly how it can be resolved but it must be resolved.  This may not be taking place in a great many cases but it is taking place and I am aware of that one example where it is happening.  I am also aware of other cases in which the builders are involved in NAMA and there is a slow response with regard to co-operation between NAMA and the local authority with regard to Part V compliance.  This issue can be resolved.  We may need amending legislation although I am unsure.  However, in the case to which I referred it appears the hands of the local authority are tied legally unless it waives the condition in the planning.  I call on the Minister of State to examine the position in this case.  We must deal with the issues, including the old system and how local authorities ensure that developers are accountable.  In addition, it is important the Department ensures that local authorities carry on and implement the role they have.  I thank the Minister of State for giving us his time this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  The Minister of State is welcome.  As chairman of the national co-ordination committee, the Minister of State has the unenviable role in the management of what is a difficult issue to have to deal with.  The Minister of State will be working with bankers, developers, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.  The Minister of State has already referred to the work of that group.  What is the position with regard to the laying of a progress report of the committee before the House before next summer when, as the Minister of State has suggested, the report will be completed?  The committee is involved in the directing of spending of public moneys and his predecessor committed to spending the sum of between &euro;3 million and &euro;5 million allocated.  Many people are keen to know which sites are being prioritised and selected for spending.  When one considers the relatively small sums of money involved and this is contrasted with the large number of properties and estates which need urgent improvement, it is appropriate that the House should be informed of the actual spending decisions of the committee.</P>
        <P>It is frightening to consider the scale of the problem which the Minister of State, the committee and all of us face.  The recent report on the subject by the advisory group on unfinished housing developments outlined that there are more than 23,000 complete and vacant dwellings and an additional 10,000 are almost complete.  The issue of unfinished dwellings in new housing developments is a matter of major national concern.  We should not forget the serious impact this issue has had on those most affected, namely, the residents of these developments.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessor, the former Deputy Finneran, allocated up to &euro;5 million to rectify the most serious safety hazards on unfinished housing estates.  At the time, this was probably seen by cynics as an attempt to buy votes.  However, I am concerned that the funds committed work out at approximately &euro;14,000 per afflicted estate.  This is a derisory amount in terms of the ability to implement proper safety precautions and to address these concerns.  At the time, the Minister of State indicated that he was committing the funds because he felt a moral responsibility to residents of ghost estates.  I am sure the Minister of State feels a similar responsibility but he will be unable to do much about it unless the funds are available.  We must remind ourselves that there is an aspect of human dignity with this issue.  It is dreadful to think of people living in housing estates which resemble Grozny or <Col N="549"/>Sarajevo after a battle.  Thousands of people are caught in the bind of living in what are, in fact, abandoned building sites with all the risks these entail, especially for children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The residents are doubly aggravated by their plight because so many are living with negative equity as well as a dispiriting or even dangerous environment.  I am concerned that the &euro;3 million in emergency funding provided by the Department is merely a tiny first tranche of what will be needed to deal with these ghost estates.  Of course, this is a problem which the Minister of State has inherited.  We should recall the upper Shannon rural renewal scheme introduced by Charlie McCreevy in 1998 which resulted in a proliferation of unfinished estates in Leitrim, Longford, west Cavan, north Roscommon and south Sligo, all of which were covered by tax incentives.  It was a classic example of planning failure and lack of foresight which reminds me of a Ben Bernanke remark about having to be the person to come in while the party is in full swing and take away the punch bowl.  Clearly, the punch bowl was not taken away in time in this case.  A quick calculation reveals that in excess of 12% of the complete and vacant dwellings are in the five counties that were subject to the rural renewal scheme section 23 incentives, a remarkably high figure considering the local population.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My colleagues have outlined the problems arising from the existence of these sites, including piles of rubble, open pits, uncovered manholes and unstable structures.  These are among the hazards to be addressed by local authorities.  Will the Minister of State clarify the avenues open to local authorities to recoup the emergency expenditure from missing developers or by securing a lien on the future sale of houses?  Will this require legislation?  Has the committee of which the Minister of State is chairman made any recommendations in this regard about which he could advise us?</P>
        <P>A further issue arises in respect of the reported non-co-operation of banks with the task of cleaning up the mess left in the wake of the building boom.  A report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 10 June suggested the banks are choosing to avoid their legal responsibilities for cleaning up hundreds of unfinished housing estates.  The article also stated that some 230 unfinished and dangerous estates have been abandoned by developers.  The banks which funded these projects have decided not to appoint receivers in an attempt to claw back the money.  If receivers were appointed in these cases, the banks would be legally responsible for cleaning up the mess.  In the same article, the Minister of State remarked that in some cases efforts by local authorities to meet banks and developers to discuss the problem had met with no response.  The Minister of State warned that he would consider introducing legislation to force banks to take responsibility or to face the prospect of being fined.  Have the banks changed course and begun to co-operate with the Department and local authorities?  If not, what legislation does the Minister of State propose to table to compel their co-operation?  Under the Derelict Sites Act, the Minister has the powers under section 12 of the principal Act &ldquo;to make provision with respect to land to prevent it being or becoming a derelict site, to enable local authorities to require the taking of measures on derelict sites by the owners or occupiers and, in certain circumstances, to acquire derelict sites compulsorily&rdquo; and to levy fines.</P>
        <P>In light of the report of the advisory group on unfinished housing developments we know there are more than 1,600 developments with outstanding works needed.  Of these, 230 have effectively been abandoned and the developer or site owner is not contactable when the receiver is appointed.  Considering the significant planning, building control, compliance and public safety issues to be addressed, is it not after time to consider amendments to the Derelict Sites Act with a view to increasing the Minister&rsquo;s powers to levy fines and to compel banks and developers to co-operate with local authorities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for taking the time to give us so much of the afternoon.  I am sorry I missed some of the other <Col N="550"/>contributions and I am conscious that Senator Hayden has significant expertise in this area.  I have been involved in the auctioneering business in recent years, a profession which, along with the developers, has contributed to the problems we have had in overheating the economy.  It is a fact that the punch bowl was not taken away in time.  However, it may be a case of having 20-20 vision in hindsight for many of us.  I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to deal with this issue.  The brief point I wish to make was echoed in the newspapers today.  Let us consider the number of people on housing lists and the number of people homeless throughout the country.  However difficult it may be to bring these issues together, we have a major responsibility to do so and it is one on which we should be focused singularly.</P>
        <P>It is clear there is empty housing and apartment stock.  While it is difficult to directly retrofit a housing list to a particular estate and so on, I would turn to the academic sector for assistance.  Perhaps postgraduate students could suggest how best this could be done.  They could be marked for so doing in a contribution towards their educational qualifications, while at the same time gaining solutions to the problem of how best to deal with these estates nationwide, many of which are the subject of receivership at present while others are involved directly with NAMA.  An attempt should be made to embrace such an approach.</P>
        <P>While I have the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention, I wish to raise another planning-related issue.  I note that last April, Wicklow County Council had a discussion in respect of An Bord Plean&aacute;la on many issues pertaining to the council&rsquo;s section 140 motions and other planning permissions granted by that county council.  I refer to instances that have been replicated throughout the country, whereby An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s home inspectors recommend the granting of planning permissions that have been appealed, only for them to be overturned by the board.  I have a major issue with this practice and had I the money to engage people from the Minister of State&rsquo;s former profession, I would love to test it in the European courts, because I suggest it is unconstitutional for the planning process to operate as it does.  This is not to suggest it is desirable for people to build here, there and everywhere but I am sure all Members have files &mdash; Senator Comiskey mentioned this issue during the week &mdash; concerning such cases.  I refer to farmers with children, who have applied for planning permission on lands that initially has been granted by the county council.  In such cases, inspectors from An Bord Plean&aacute;la have recommended continuation of such grants only for, as a Wicklow county councillor described it, the exercise of faceless elitism by people in ivory towers, who dictate that a stop must be put to it because of ribbon development and their view of how that area should be.  While actively considering improvements in this area, Senator Comiskey made a worthwhile recommendation on the regionalisation of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and this must be done.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister of State&rsquo;s private secretary replied to Wicklow County Council quoting the letter of the law, which to me constitutes government by autopilot.  When I was on the Government benches, I regularly criticised the autopilot button that was switched on far too often.  Before he gets into the habit of it, I appeal to the Minister of State to turn off the autopilot button and to examine this issue personally.  He should avoid falling into the trap from which many members of Government from all parties have suffered.  This issue must be dealt with north of a line from Dublin to Galway and west of Mullingar.  The people living in that part of the country wish to continue living there.  They have a particular culture and I believe it is possible to embrace and allow for that culture, while at the same time ensuring responsible planning guidelines and rules are in place.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to promote at every opportunity the Family Home Bill 2011, which was published on Tuesday last and which I drafted with Senator Thomas Byrne and others.  The Bill has been informed by debates in this House, by the work of Senator Hayden&rsquo;s organisation, of organis<Col N="551"/>ations such as New Beginning and the Prevention of Family Home Repossessions group, as well as the media in recent years, in seeking to prevent the repossession of primary family residences.  I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices to ensure that when the Whips within the Labour Party and the Government as a whole make a decision on this non-adversarial Bill and the sensible provisions proposed therein, it may be embraced on Second Stage on 27 July 2011 in a non-partisan fashion.  I acknowledge that advices could be accepted from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office or amendments tabled by Government parties or Independent Members on Committee Stage.  That would be sensible and I would greatly appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s co-operation in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Before calling on the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, to respond, I thank him for his attendance in the House and for listening to Members&rsquo; views.  It was very useful and helpful and I thank him for his availability at all times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman and as he is aware, I was present for every second of the debate.  I had intended to go elsewhere but I called it off.  I am heartened to note the key points and contributions raised in a non-partisan way in today&rsquo;s debate have been broadly captured in the context of the advisory group&rsquo;s report and my Department&rsquo;s response to it.  It gives me confidence the Government has undertaken a robust scoping of the problems with unfinished housing developments but at the same time, one cannot suggest the Government has all the solutions.  Any innovative suggested solutions put forward, for example, involving synergies for providing employment and resolving these developments, to which some Members referred, will be considered fully by the national co-ordination committee.  I do not care from where solutions come, as long as they are workable and practical.  Were a Member from any side of this House to come up with an idea, the Government would be prepared to consider it.  It makes no difference, as I have always worked in a non-partisan way.  Party politics can be played outside but in these Houses, one must work with all shoulders to the wheel.  This is an approach I adopted in the early 1980s and have continued to take.  Consequently, I am greatly encouraged by what is happening.</P>
        <P>This problem presents enormous difficulties for residents and their children, especially those who face immediate public safety issues.  However, the Government is taking immediate and further planned action to resolve those issues.  The important message is that I remain encouraged by the strong consensus and commitment among the key stakeholders who are participating on the national co-ordination committee, as evidenced by its productive meetings thus far.</P>
        <P>I now intend to refer to the various points made by Members.  The Government is finalising with urgency a roadmap in the form of an implementation plan.  The plan is fairly significant and does not merely comprise two or three pages, but consists of plans, followed by actions and then results.  This is the way it will be and is the reason I took personal responsibility in chairing the committee.  I have many other things to do, as one might argue the place is always on fire as far as housing and planning are concerned.  I decided to take this on because one element of politics I have always hated is that no matter who prepares a report, it is either thrown in the bin or thrown outside, never to see the light of day again.  I was determined this would not happen in this case because the issue is far too serious and it affects every community and the residents in particular.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this context, those who will be centrally involved in site resolution plans will be the residents and communities, who should be part of the site resolution process.  As Senator Barrett noted in respect of estates in receivership, it is great to have someone there.  The same is true of liquidators.  As for developers, some simply need a boost in the form of a few bob to enable them to get going again.  I note that sometimes, developers and site owners are not the <Col N="552"/>same entities and even the occupiers may not be the same as the site owners or the developers.  There are all sorts of legal complexities and were these problems simple, they would have been solved long ago.</P>
        <P>However, there is a multitude and a myriad of complexities.  As someone who was a barrister, in common with several Members of this House, I understand the legal complexities and the last thing I wish to do is to land the Government in a legal mess.  There are enough problems all over the place and enough money is being expended on legal issues without me adding to it.  I would be letting down all Members were I to engage in so doing.  However, a roadmap is in place and the Government will work progressively to resolve the issues facing it in respect of unfinished housing developments.</P>
        <P>Senator Wilson made a point in respect of site resolution plans.  The aim is for 300 plans to be submitted by the end of 2011 and the Department will also work through 2012.  This constitutes a significant number, although Senator Wilson may think otherwise in the overall context.  However, an interesting development since the report was issued is that a significant amount of work is now up and running in various areas.  It is not earth-shattering but the acorn seeds principle suggests some light is beginning to be seen.  Some Members have made the point that of 34 local authorities, 28 have identified issues.  However, eight local authorities have now indicated they will not need any State money because developers, receivers or whoever are coming on board and are working.  Perhaps the report issued on 9 June was the switch to fire them into action, as action now appears to be taking place.  The important point is I will seek reports to ascertain how much action is taking place.  One could have action for a week before drifting back into old habits.  While I acknowledge Senator Wilson&rsquo;s mathematical skills, the calculation of &euro;3,000 per estate is a little unfair as it is for 242 such estates.  The Government asked for the identification of the most serious estates in which significant difficulties were going to arise in respect of safety, technical issues, building compliance and so on.  My concern was that as summer approached, an estate could have been built up to a level offering access for children onto roofs.  All Members are aware of how alluring that can be for children.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Those are the issues which cause me concern.  I refer to uncovered manholes.  I know of one incident in an estate which houses many children, where an elderly woman walked on a board covering a manhole and she fell through and broke her elbow.  One can imagine the danger to children and the impact such an incident would have on a person.  The elderly lady and her husband had bought a house in an estate on returning from abroad.  Such situations cause untold misery.  The State could not be expected to pick up the tab, not even in the time of the Celtic tiger, for developers who overshot the runway and who were encouraged to do so by various incentives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Barrett and refer Members to the framework document on housing.  We must not stimulate house prices because this would create a false market again, the very thing that caused us problems.  We must allow prices to reach their own floor by themselves.  The last thing we must do is create an artificial level as this would lead to disaster.</P>

	<P>The real funding will come from developers, banks and financiers.  The funds are not for completion of the houses because that is for the developers and the banks but public safety works are the first priority and we have to deal with these as best we can.  Based on their concerns, the local authorities have categorised all estates and of 655 estates with works to be completed, a total of 242 were in category four and are of most concern.  Approximately 28 of these are within NAMA.  This might not be a true reflection.  The co-ordinating committee is made up of representatives of the local authorities, the county and city managers, the sustainable communities agency of which Mr. John O&rsquo;Connor is the chairperson, the Irish Bankers Federation, NAMA, and a representative of the rural dwellers to present the views from the rural perspective, which is of particular interest to me.</P>
        <P>The committee has identified 28 estates.  It is important that people have a contact and that there is a contact person in every local authority.  Very often residents and communities do not know who to contact and they are sent from Billy to Jack.  There is a contact person in NAMA and in the banks.  This is the liaison protocol procedure.  The communities are the most important component but it is often difficult for them to negotiate the bureaucratic system.  I have cut this out by asking for a contact system to be established and the contacts have been identified and the system is working.</P>
        <P>The communities are already up and running.  I appeal to people not to use the term, &ldquo;ghost estates&rdquo;.  It is preferable to refer to &ldquo;unfinished housing developments&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;ghost estates&rdquo; casts an aspersion upon people who have expended considerable moneys to buy a house.  I prefer to refer to them as unfinished housing developments.  In that context, I ask residents of such estates to take action by setting up a residents&rsquo; or a community association.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the question of how this issue is to be resolved, a site resolution plan is being set up for each of the 28 estates.  It may well be &mdash; as some Members are masters of finance and economics and will know &mdash; that it may not be worthwhile finishing off some of these estates.  At that stage I would be very reluctant to knock houses.  However, where there is no other solution or where only foundations have been built, I would advocate giving them back to the community who may wish to build cr&egrave;ches or doctors&rsquo; surgeries or community halls.  NAMA has been set up under an Act of the Oireachtas and its remit is commercial in the main, followed by the social dividend which was added late at night during the passage of the legislation.  We plan to purchase from NAMA approximately 60 housing units in south Dublin.  We cannot afford to purchase because this is part of the 3%, the general government deficit.  Approved housing bodies will have a significant role to play in this.  These bodies will be regulated and the Department will have a supervisory jurisdiction over them.  They will be permitted to borrow money from the housing finance agency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Approved housing bodies are the way forward.  An assessment was carried out at the end of March and approximately 100,000 will be on the list when it is released in August.  A total of 100,000 people are being supported by rent supplement of &euro;500 million.  I intend to change the system and to give responsibility for rent supplement to the local authorities.  There is no sense in having rent supplement formerly administered by the HSE administered by the Department of Social Protection.  It should be an integrated system.  The local authorities will pay the rent and will enforce the standards.  There will be no more unsuitable, substandard accommodation being offered by landlords who were being paid for it.  However, in some cases the landlords never received any payment and they suffered as well.  </P>
        <P>I want to bring balance into the system which will be subject to the PRTB which will be amended to include these provisions.  I hope Senators support me in this work.  It is hoped that exorbitant rents will be driven down.  Landlords will be required to register with the PRTB and every month, the local authority will be in a position to send a letter to the local Revenue office to certify that rent has been paid to individual landlords.  There will be no more of the nonsense that a person cannot be accountable and neither will there be under-the-counter payments because the local authority will pay directly the rent supplement of &euro;85.  It will not be the case of a rent of &euro;100 with &euro;15 coming from the person&rsquo;s own pocket.  I look forward to this House supporting this work because there will be squeals and backlashes and complaints.  We do not have the money.  We are borrowing it.  We have to make the most productive use of it to ensure that the 100,000 people on the list are facilitated with quality accommodation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the question of the leasing initiative, if the leasing initiative was that good for developers, why have only 1,300 units become available since its introduction?  For example, if Senator Hayden is the tenant under the long term leasing initiative and she builds up a score of equity, unlike the hire purchase or leasing agreement, at the end she pays a proportion of what is left.  This might build up to 30% or 33% equity.  I cannot say this up-front, but that then becomes part of the general government deficit under the 3%.  It is only at the end that it becomes achievable.  Equity will be part of the leasing initiative.  That will also mean the approved housing bodies will have to change their perspective.  I would like to see a tenant purchase scheme within that structure because many people have been in situ for ten or 12 years.  Senator Labhras &Oacute; Murch&uacute; would know more about this than I would.  However, some of those involved do not want to sell.  It is time for a change to ensure equity and choices.</P>
        <P>I am looking forward to driving down the M4 with Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell because it is a beautiful trip.  I hope she will stop in Mullingar.</P>
        <P>I have a lot more to say, but I know the Leas-Chathaoirleach gets cross whenever anyone goes over time.  I am glad to be here and will be delighted to return.  It will be 12 months by the time we have an opportunity to progress this, but I want to report that significant progress was made yesterday.  I will not stop in my efforts to deal with unfinished housing developments.  I thank Senators for their ideas which will be examined constructively.</P>

    <Title>Mobile Phones: Motion</Title>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann recognising the conflicting publicly available information regarding the safety of mobile phones, calls on the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to consider the introduction of legislation that would require mobile phone operators and suppliers in Ireland to make available all information in their possession regarding the emission of electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am pleased to propose the motion to the House on behalf of Fine Gael Members.  There is a lot of information and misinformation on electromagnetic radiation.  The motion acknowledges the prevalence of mobile phones and that there is conflicting information in the public domain on the associated safety risks.  In 2005 ComReg reported that there were as many mobile phones in Ireland as there were people.  There are over 5 billion mobile phone users worldwide.  Within a very short period mobile phones went from being the preserve of James Bond to being a necessity for every man, woman and child in the State.  In the relatively short time since they became part our daily lives, conflicting reports have emerged on the health risks, if any, of these devices.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, and thank him for taking this Private Members&rsquo; motion on behalf of the Government.  In a sense, his presence reminds us of a problem with mobile phones in that responsibility for the matter cuts across a number of Departments &mdash; primarily the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In 2007 an expert report commissioned by the Government suggested there was a conflict of interest in the Department of Communications having a role in promoting and developing mobile communications as well as in providing health advice.  Subsequently, responsibility for providing information on the health effects of electromagnetic fields was transferred to the Department of the Environment.  While there is logic to separating functions in this area, such a division can also inhibit joined-up thinking on overall Government strategy.</P>
        <P>In responding to a parliamentary question in May on mobile phone radiation, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">An expert group report on the health effects of electromagnetic fields, including those generated by mobile phones, was commissioned by the Government and published in March 2007.  The expert group reported that the majority scientific opinion to date is that no adverse short or long-term effects have been demonstrated from exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection.  However, a minority group of scientists believe otherwise and extensive international research on the issue continues to be co-ordinated through bodies such as the World Health Organization.  My Department monitors this research and key developments therein will inform any consideration of possible future policy interventions in this area.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Since that statement, the World Health Organization has published a report which has changed the position.  The report was published after 31 scientists from 14 countries had come together to examine the latest research findings, as well as past studies of the risk of cancer posed by exposure to the electromagnetic fields generated by mobile phones.  These fields are generated when a mobile phone device relays information back and forth from nearby antennae.  Following their analysis, the experts concluded that the radiation from mobile phones was &ldquo;possibly carcinogenic&rdquo; to humans.</P>
        <P>On 1 June the chief medical officer in the Department of Health responded to the WHO by issuing a statement giving advice on mobile phone usage.  The statement noted the recent report <Col N="556"/>from the WHO and the International Agency for Research on Cancer which classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields emitted by mobile phones as being possibly carcinogenic to humans.  The research had shown a possible association between mobile phone use and an increased risk of glioma, a malignant form of brain cancer.  In its report the review group also identified a possible link between mobile phone use and acoustic neuroma, a benign tumour of the nerve that conducts hearing signals.</P>
        <P>The chief medical officer stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">We may not truly understand the health affects of mobile phones for many years.  However, research does show that using mobile phones affects brain activity.  There is general consensus that children are more vulnerable to radiation from mobile phones than adults.  Therefore the sensible thing to do is to adopt a precautionary approach rather than wait to have the risks confirmed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the light of these findings, the chief medical officer strongly advises that children and young people should be encouraged to use mobile phones for &ldquo;essential purposes only&rdquo;.  All calls should be kept short, as talking for long periods prolongs exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields.  The advice issued by the Department gave practical advice on how mobile phone users could reduce their exposure to radio frequency energy, for example, by making fewer calls, reducing the length of calls, sending text messages instead of calling, using landlines, if possible, using hands-free sets, if possible, and refraining from keeping an active phone clipped to a belt or in a pocket.</P>
        <P>Regarding text messages, the WHO report states that when a mobile phone is in use in the normal way, where the user has it up to his or her ear, 90% of the radiation released is absorbed by the brain tissue located within five centimetres of the handset.  The report notes the scientific uncertainty regarding mobile phone-related cancer risks.  It also notes that many countries, including Germany, France, Austria, the United Kingdom and Russia, have taken a precautionary stance on the use of mobile phones, particularly by children.  The European Environment Agency has also recommended that their use by children should be restricted.</P>
        <P>While the WHO report is significant, it is not conclusive and the scientific experts involved have stressed the need for more research.  Previously the WHO had stated there was no established evidence of a link between mobile phone use and cancer.  Moreover, there are no data showing a surge in brain cancers, despite the surge in mobile phone usage.  The University of Manchester carried out a study to examine the diagnoses of brain tumours in England in the period between 1998 and 2007 and concluded that there had been no statistically significant change in the number of brain tumours diagnosed during that period.  However, the WHO report contains some words of caution.  It points out that cancer can take a long time to develop and only 5% of the people included in the study had been using mobile phones for at least ten years.</P>
        <P>The WHO&rsquo;s statement regarding its most recent publication notes that studies are ongoing to more fully assess potential long-term effects of mobile phone use.  It also commits the WHO to conducting a formal risk assessment of all studied health outcomes from radio frequency electromagnetic field exposure by 2012.  In this context, the motion calls on the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to consider introducing legislation that would require mobile phone operators in Ireland to make available all information in their possession regarding the emission of electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones.  At the very least, such information should be made available to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government which has a role in monitoring research and key developments in this area.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il will be calling a vote on this motion.  This is showman politics.  We offered to introduce legislation into the House, which is where we are supposed to make laws.  This motion is only following up on what an Oireachtas committee did, not in the previous D&aacute;il but in the one before that, and which made all the recommendations the Senator proposes in the motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator spoke about the precautionary principle.  What brings the motion to the House today is the World Health Organization&rsquo;s recent report suggesting the use of mobile phones by people under 16 years of age could be dangerous.  The European Environmental Agency, which reports to the European Union, referred to the precautionary principle about which my colleague spoke in his address.  Our Bill proposed the precautionary principle in making people aware of the potential dangers to children.  We on this side of the House are not alone in trying to make people aware of this, but it is about how to do it.  In the North, the NHS distributes informational leaflets to doctors&rsquo; surgeries and elsewhere.</P>
        <P>Our proposal, which the Government refused to take and debate, was for legislation.  Instead of talking and proposing that the Minister do something, our job here is to propose legislation.  However, that did not happen.  In Britain the NHS refers to the dangers to children.  What is peculiar about the motion is that mobile phone companies already inform people that mobile phones are dangerous.  As my colleague pointed out, a person is supposed to keep the phone an inch away from his or her head.  The instructions with a BlackBerry recommend keeping it one inch away from the ear when using the phone.  Why does the company do that?  If a user ever decided to sue at a later stage, the company can ask whether the user always kept the device an inch away from the ear as advised in the 96 page document he or she got when purchasing it.  It is likely that he or she would not have done.</P>
        <P>However, our proposal was somewhat more practical especially for children whose bone density is less and on whom electromagnetic fields would have a greater effect when using mobile phones.  We proposed that the information the mobile phone companies provide anyway should be printed on the phone itself.  I am not saying that people will stop using their phones, but I want everybody to be aware of what the phone companies are trying to make people aware of, but in a very low key way in the hope that people will not catch on to it.  Lloyds of London, probably the best risk assessors of all time, cannot even quantify the risk to the extent that they will not insure mobile phone companies against possible litigation in a class action suit by people who could develop melanoma and brain tumours as a result of long-term mobile phone usage.</P>
        <P>Europe had its first case when a labour court in Italy gave compensation to an employee who was obliged to be on his mobile phone by his employer.  He was given compensation because the labour court ruled that it was most likely &mdash; obviously the burden of proof was less and did not need to be beyond all reasonable doubt &mdash; that the mobile phone was the cause of his brain tumour and subsequent death.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The World Health Organization has proposed applying the precautionary principle espoused by the European Environmental Agency.  The health service in Northern Ireland distributes leaflets advising that children should not use mobile phones.  Mobile phone companies advise people to keep the phones an inch away from their heads.  Lloyds of London refuses to insure any mobile phone company against litigation.  The labour court in Italy has stated that a person&rsquo;s brain tumour is most likely to have come from the long-term intense use of a mobile phone.  However, today&rsquo;s motion merely hopes the Minister might do something down the line.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il has a Bill ready to go that would do all that and make people aware.  Once people have the information, they are quite entitled to do whatever they want.  We are talking about the children under 16 years of age, who should be texting.  Phones are important from a safety point of view.  We do not suggest not using mobile phones, which are a part of everyday life, but that people should be aware of the potential danger.  While it took 47 years to prove <Col N="558"/>that tobacco smoking caused cancer, in that time there were many studies that were inconclusive.  All the tobacco companies were able to fund those studies and claim it was very hard to prove a case beyond all reasonable doubt.  We are not trying to prove anything beyond all reasonable doubt and are merely trying to apply the precautionary principle.  We do not want to wait 47 years and then discover that perhaps we should have done more to make people aware.  It is a democracy and people are entitled to make their choices of their own free will.  However, it is not appropriate simply to talk about it like an Oireachtas committee.</P>

	<P>An Oireachtas committee discussed it, not in the last D&aacute;il, but in the one prior to that and nothing happened.  We are talking about it today, but that is not what we should be doing.  We have legislation that would make people aware of the potential dangers to their children.  I would not like to be back here in 47 years time saying we should have made them more aware so that more people would not have suffered the long-term effects.  If we applied the precautionary principle in more avenues of Government, from financial regulation to planning, we would be in a far better position.  When it comes to people&rsquo;s health, we should not operate in the margin of risk.  With 2,000 reports completed on the effects of mobile phones and mobile phone masts, of course we will not get any consensus and some people will be for and others against.  I said at the start that this is showman politics and not real stuff.  We should legislate.  Colleagues this morning gave out about us having motions on tobacco and mobile phones.</P>

For many years no substantial link has been established between the use of mobile phones and detriment to health.  Over the years many eminent scientists have completed several &mdash; Senator Daly suggested it is thousands &mdash; studies in various parts of the world, but none has established conclusively a direct link between the use of mobile phones and increased incidence in cancer.  Recently, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields emitted by mobile phones as possibly carcinogenic.  More research is needed to substantiate the risk and prove beyond doubt there is a relationship between the frequent use of mobile phones and health issues.  For many years no link has been substantiated and, thankfully, the medical research will continue for many years to come.  This new analysis is based on a more recent approach and, although the risks are small, the expert group decided to upgrade mobile phone use to being a possible carcinogen.</P>
        <P>In my previous employment on several occasions I encountered people who worried about their health owing to electromagnetic fields in close proximity to pylons and transformers.  There is an analogy between mobile phone masts and overhead cables.  I have been with engineers using equipment to measure electromagnetic forces at various locations such as a farmyard and a farmhouse and in two ordinary dwellings at different locations.  Anyone who knows anything about magnetic fields will know they are measured in farads and, in the case of both electricity and mobile phones, the unit is the microfarad.  I was amazed at the readings taken by the engineers at the base of overhead transformers, inside the milking parlour in a farmyard, the kitchen of a farmhouse, beside a microwave oven and close to a bedside clock.  Having seen the reports, I ask Members to guess where the greatest magnetic reading was taken, whether it was in the farmyard, at the transformer, close to the bedside clock or otherwise.  I guarantee they will not be able to guess correctly because, despite all the transformers, pylons and cables, <Col N="559"/>it is the bedside clock which is beside most of us every night which emits more by way of magnetic forces than many of the other things we might suggest.</P>
        <P>On the question of risk to children and teenagers, it has been pointed out that health authorities have always erred on the side of caution when it comes to mobile phone use.  At this stage, who knows what the long-term affects will be, which is why I have a concern.  I use the analogy of the septic tanks used 45 years ago which were the be all and end all then, but what are they today?  The Department of Health in the United Kingdom issued fresh recommendations only this year that children aged 16 years and under should text only and speak over their mobile phones only when absolutely necessary.  Thankfully, the Department of Health here gives the same advice.  Children should be discouraged from spending too much time on their mobile phones.</P>
        <P>Am I better off with a hands-free set rather than keeping the mobile phone one inch from my ear?  I am, if I want to reduce the amount of energy being delivered to the brain, as pointed out by Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill.  In addition, many accidents have occurred as a result of the use of mobile phones, which is an issue we should consider &mdash; I must admit I may be guilty on occasion in this regard.  In seconding the motion I am not sure the information we have requested from the mobile phone operators will be forthcoming.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for taking time out from his busy schedule to come to the House to discuss this matter.  Contrary to Senator Mark Daly&rsquo;s view, to be fair, he has done good work on this issue, which I want to acknowledge.</P>
        <P>The motion has merit in its own right.  It is important that the Fine Gael group has brought it forward in a week when we have debated the Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill in the House.  We have seen what corporations do if they are allowed to get away with something and we have seen the effects of light touch regulation in this country to the maximum effect.  Therefore, it can be categorically stated one cannot trust large companies which are profit driven and will not necessarily put the best interests of the community at large first.  We saw this with the companies involved in the tobacco sector, in which, as Senator Mark Daly correctly pointed out, information had to be dragged from and beaten out of them.  It took brave whistleblowers to eventually expose what was going on, namely, that they had known all the time and had the information in their possession.  Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s motion is of benefit in that such a law would compel companies to make available the level of information they have available on the possible dangers associated with the overuse of mobile phones.</P>
        <P>I want to broaden the discussion to include transmitter masts and base stations.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s Department has taken the initiative in the matter of high voltage power lines to appoint an expert group to report back to the Government by October on the benefits or otherwise of burying such cables underground.</P>
        <P>At times in the public debate there has been a great deal of misinformation and mythology.  Scaremongering does nothing to help the constructive nature of the debate.  I agree that adopting a precautionary approach is advisable and vital.  On the back of Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s motion, it would be advisable to adopt best international practice in terms of the location of pylons, transmission masts, substations and, to extend the discussion, high voltage power cables which should not be in close proximity to dwellings, where possible.  All this would take is some goodwill and common sense.  With regard to hospitals, schools and playgrounds, as Senator Mark Daly said, what would be wrong with taking the best precautions?</P>
        <P>It is a bit rich for politicians to talk about the overuse of mobile phones when everyone here seems to have one welded to his or her jaw.  Having taken part in the debate, I intend to review <Col N="560"/>my own conduct in that regard.  One can either have a mobile phone at one&rsquo;s ear or strapped to the waist, which is not wise if we take it there are possible carcinogenic dangers.  To be fair, the World Health Organization stated there were &ldquo;possible&rdquo; risks and attached the same possible carcinogenic outcomes to coffee and petrol.  It is important, therefore, that we put the matter in context.</P>
        <P>As one travels around the country at Holy Communion time, one will see children two hands higher than a duck with a mobile phone.  While I know parents mean well, it is questionable whether this is wise, given the potential dangers, as Senator Mark Daly pointed out and on which Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill wants further information.  I ask parents to consider the merits and weigh the pros and cons of giving children mobile phones in their formative years when it exposes them to potential health dangers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  Senator John Whelan mentioned that politicians seemed to have a mobile phone attached permanently to their ear, but it is well known that politicians&rsquo; brains are smaller than those of members of the general public; therefore, the risk is neutralised.</P>

	<P>I commend Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill for bringing this Private Members&rsquo; motion before the House.  I hope, however, that he will be generous and acknowledge that this side of the House is acting in good faith in opposing it.</P>
        <P>The evidence is conflicting and vested interests are anxious to avoid damaging their brands.  The same happened 30 years ago in the tobacco industry which actively suppressed information; therefore, it is a challenge to get industry to co-operate with such measures.  I have little confidence when every expert report produced on one side of the argument is matched by another on the opposite side.  The evidence is ambivalent.  Senator Mark Daly mentioned the Italian case in which compensation was granted.  Equally, in America in 2006 the exact opposite was found in a case against Motorola.  Countries, industries and experts do not agree.  The World Health Organization has classified prolonged mobile phone use as being in &ldquo;Group 2B&rdquo;, meaning it is possibly carcinogenic and there could be an additional risk.  It recommends additional research into the long-term use of mobile phones.  Each and every report I can find, be it Danish, Swedish, British or German, finds there might be a risk but further research is needed.  I agree with Senator Mark Daly on the precautionary principle which in health matters is very important, but the same principle applies to legislation.  I support the amendment.  After a period, if the industry is found to be unco-operative, we might introduce legislation to ensure such co-operation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning on the Order of Business I questioned the wisdom of allocating two hours to discuss a motion calling for greater transparency in this area.  What political party would oppose the thrust of the motion?  Even the turn-out indicates we will not spend two hours debating it because we all broadly agree with it.  I agree with Senator Mark Daly that we need action and a Bill to follow through on what has been said.  The Senator had a Bill on the Order Paper for some time and I do not understand the reason it was not dealt with.</P>
        <P>I have a mobile phone and references were made to politicians using them.  We all use them and they are here to stay.  If we look at what a mobile phone can do today compared with even 12 months ago, the technology is moving so fast that there is no doubt the usage of mobile phones will increase in the next few years.  We must be conscious, therefore, of the health concerns.</P><Col N="561"/>
        <P>While the World Health Organization stated mobile phone use could cause cancer, it was putting the matter in the context that we should not scaremonger on the issue.  I do not believe mobile phone use causes cancer.  Many reports have been commissioned, some good and some from vested interests, but they conflict and give different information on the health implications of the use of mobile phones.  In 2011 the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified mobile phones for the first time in its gold standard rating system and rated them as being in Group 2B, meaning they could possibly cause cancer in humans.  In Denmark there was a study of 420,000 people which showed no clear link between mobile phone use and cancer.  We can have any number of reports and depending on what a person thinks, he or she can cite a report to support his or her position.  We must note, however, the remarks of the WHO.  If there is any risk mobile phone use can play a part in causing cancer, we must take the necessary precautions.</P>
        <P>I support the motion and hope that at a later point the Minister will introduce legislation.  Perhaps at that stage we could have a fuller discussion of the issues involved.  Perhaps on issues such as this, however, on which there is cross-party agreement, such motions could be passed without debate.  When Bills are then introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that I am a cancer expert, I feel obliged to say a few words in discussing a potential carcinogenesis.  I was impressed with Senators&rsquo; grasp of the confusing scientific literature.  Obviously, people have thought this through and I want to reassure them by saying the medical profession is as confused as any other.  The data are not clear that there is a risk.  There is a sound first principles reason for believing there might be a risk, but that risk has not yet been completely proved or validated.  Does that mean it is likely there is something that has not yet been discovered?  We are not sure.  Is it possible the conflict is based on the interests of those conducting the studies?  That is unlikely.  There have been several independent studies by highly reputable international research organisations which have not come out in favour of there being a risk.  In general in medicine, when many studies are conducted and the risk is not clear cut, the general consensus is that there possibly is no risk or if there is, it is small, but we do not know.</P>
        <P>At this stage, we should say what we know &mdash; that mobile phones emit radiation and that radiation in the appropriate circumstances can cause health problems.  The bare minimum position should be that a nuanced health warning should be put on mobile phones in order that when parents buy them for their children, they fully understand there is an implicit responsibility in giving such a phone to a child or teenager because there is a possible health risk and the appropriate level of caution should be exercised.</P>
        <P>Like my colleagues on this side of the House, I believe this is a non-controversial issue and the motion should be passed.  If the Seanad is to have credibility as anything other than a talking shop, we should have moved quickly to have this nuanced, minimalist legislation passed.  If it is not to be passed, I urge the Government to introduce legislation to put an appropriately nuanced advisory warning on mobile phones and in the literature that goes with them to tell <Col N="562"/>consumers that radiation is emitted by mobile phones and that it has not yet been completely established that it is safe.</P>

	<P>Is that Government policy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It is up to the people.  The atmosphere in the Chamber is more encouraging in terms of debating issues than it can be in the D&aacute;il.  This is the Seanad&rsquo;s strength.  I have listened to all of the contributions and will comment on them at the conclusion.  I thank everyone who has spoken.</P>
        <P>I will outline to the House the relevant elements of research and policy in this area.  It is important that, in what is an essentially highly technical matter, account should be taken of the best available international research on the issues involved.  The potential health effects of electromagnetic fields were the subject of an expert group report published by the then Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in March 2007.  The report, entitled Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields, is available for download from my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The independent expert group examined a wide range of issues in respect of the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields.  Its findings addressed many of the health risk questions raised by members of the public.  The views expressed and conclusions drawn were informed by the principal scientific literature available worldwide on the matter at the time, including that of the World Health Organization, WHO.</P>
        <P>The expert group concluded that there was limited scientific evidence of adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields.  Regarding the issue of mobile telephones and base stations, the group concluded: &ldquo;From all the evidence accumulated so far, no adverse short or long term health effects have been shown to occur from exposure to the signals produced by mobile phones and base station transmitters&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The group recommended that Ireland should continue to adopt and enforce the guidelines developed by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, ICNIRP, an independent scientific organisation established in 1992 for the purpose of advancing non-ionising radiation, NIR, protection and to provide guidance and recommendations on protection from NIR exposure.  The commission operates in co-operation with the environmental health division of the WHO and the United Nations Environment Programme and is endorsed by the WHO and the European Commission.</P>
        <P>The expert group also examined the issue of emerging mobile wireless communications and stated that the technology in this area is not untested.  Specifically, the group commented:</P>
        <P LI="1">No untested wireless technology can be placed on sale within the European Union.  All such equipment must meet a battery of standards for electrical safety, electrical compatibility, electrical interference, performance and fitness for use.  The CE mark is applied to all tested electrical goods marketed within the EU.  Mobile telephones and other wireless hardware meet the Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive 89/336/EEC, the Low Voltage Directive 73/23/EEC, the CE (Mark) Directive 93/68/EEC and the R &amp; TTE (Radio and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment) Directive 1999/5/EC.  In addition, mobile telephones are <Col N="563"/>designed and manufactured not to exceed the limits for exposure to radio frequency, RF, fields recommended by international guidelines.  These guidelines were developed by the ICNIRP and the exposure limits in the guidelines include a substantial safety margin designed to ensure the safety of all persons, regardless of age and health status.</P>
        <P FLI="0">One of the recommendations of the expert group was that precautionary measures be used where appropriate.  This idea has been reflected in Senators&rsquo; contributions to this debate.  The recommendations of the expert group were approved by the Government and responsibility for this policy area was transferred to the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2007.</P>
        <P>On 31 May 2011, the WHO, through its International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC, issued a statement classifying RF electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans.  Group 2B is used by the IARC to describe agents for which there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals.  Coffee and gasoline would be two widely used agents that also have a Group 2B classification.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to note that the new research has not established a direct link between mobile phone use and cancer.  In terms of ensuring a balanced discussion on this issue, we should not lose sight of this fact.  Equally, we must recognise the conclusion that there could be some risk.  The key message for us, therefore, is that an appropriately precautionary approach should be followed and we should continue to monitor ongoing studies at international level that seek to determine what link, if any, exists between mobile phone usage and cancer risk.</P>
        <P>The Chief Medical Officer at the Department of Health subsequently issued a statement, which reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">We may not truly understand the health affects of mobile phones for many years.  However, research does show that using mobile phones affects brain activity.  There is general consensus that children are more vulnerable to radiation from mobile phones than adults.  Therefore, the sensible thing to do is to adopt a precautionary approach rather than wait to have the risks confirmed.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">In light of the research findings, the CMO&rsquo;s statement strongly advised that &ldquo;children and young people who do use mobile phones, should be encouraged to use them for &lsquo;essential purposes only&rsquo;&rdquo;.  All calls should be kept short, as talking for long periods prolongs exposure to RF electromagnetic fields.  All mobile phone users can reduce their exposure by making fewer calls, reducing the length of calls, sending text messages instead of calling, using mobile phones only when land line telephones are unavailable, using a wired hands-free device in order that the telephone need not be held against the head and refraining from keeping an active telephone clipped to the belt or in the pocket.  This advice follows the precautionary approach accepted by Government following publication of the expert group&rsquo;s report in 2007.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also important to note that emissions from mobile base stations and handsets are regulated through the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, under the terms and conditions of licences issued to mobile service providers.  These require service providers to ensure that electromagnetic radiation emissions are within the limits set by the ICNIRP in its published guidelines on limiting human exposure to electromagnetic fields.  Information on handset emissions is also made available to the public in the technical manuals provided for consumers when purchasing a mobile phone.</P>
        <P>During the past number of years, ComReg has conducted measurement surveys to verify licensee compliance with the ICNIRP limits.  The detailed measurement results from 600 sites have been published on ComReg&rsquo;s website.  The most recent report, entitled 2010 Programme of Measurement of Non Ionising Radiation Emissions Fourth Interim Report, presents the <Col N="564"/>results of the fourth set of site surveys &mdash; there were 20 sites in all &mdash; undertaken during 2010.  The measurements during these surveys were taken at the point of highest emissions in a public area associated with the transmitter.  On the basis of this work, ComReg has concluded that the NIR emissions measured from all of the 20 sites were below the relevant ICNIRP guideline limits for general public exposure.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Government has been involved in international initiatives concerning possible health effects from electromagnetic fields for many years.  It was a founder member of the WHO electromagnetic field project and one of its first financial supporters.  In Ireland, the Government intends that a single agency should have responsibility for the health effects of both ionising and non-ionising radiation.  It is intended that this will be achieved by extending the statutory powers of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, to include responsibility for NIR, subject to the necessary resources being made available.  Until the transfer of functions to the RPII takes place, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will continue to hold responsibility for these matters.</P>
        <P>In overall terms, I should emphasise to the House that NIR is an evolving area of research.  While there are no plans at present to introduce further legislation in this area, the Government will continue to monitor all relevant and internationally recognised scientific research and evidence as it emerges to ensure that the policy framework is updated as appropriate.  Having listened to the contributions today, in particular that of Senator Crown, who is an acknowledged expert on cancer, I will bring those views to the attention of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and his Department.  I will ask them to communicate directly with the Senator in this regard.  It seems reasonable and right that we should follow the recommendation he made to me and I will try to progress the situation as much as I possibly can.</P>

        <P>As many speakers have stated, the jury is still out on the health effects and risks associated with the overuse of mobile phones.  In the motion we seek further information and legislation, if necessary, on the subject.</P>
        <P>I wish to clarify the position for Senator Mark Daly, whom I applaud for bringing forward a Private Members&rsquo; Bill which I am sure he will introduce during Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; time in the coming weeks.  The Government side offered Fianna F&aacute;il a swap this week.  Fianna F&aacute;il wanted to bring forward its home protection Bill which it was not able to do because it had not been published at that stage.  It then decided to bring forward Senator Daly&rsquo;s Bill, but it had been removed from the Order Paper and could not be introduced today because of this.

	<P>I support what the Leader of the House said.  We introduced the motion in our Private Members&rsquo; time and, as the Leader said, Senator Mark Daly is welcome to bring his Bill before the House at any stage.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  As Members said, research on the impact of electromagnetic fields, mobile phones, masts and such matters is ongoing.  We need to obtain the full findings and I suppose it will never be a done deal in having all the answers.  I thank the Minster of State for confirming that he will recommend to the Minister what Senator Crown brought before the House.  I also welcome what he said regarding legislation, if it is needed.</P>
        <P>Senator Mark Daly, among others, referred to the tobacco industry, one of the major industries of the world.  We know how powerful that lobby group was, especially in American politics.  It took 43 years to admit to the health risks associated with smoking.  We all saw that famous film, the name of which I cannot remember, in which the whistleblower highlighted the fact that information was being suppressed.  If mobile phone manufactures have information that should be in the public domain, they should not suppress it.  That is the reason we introduced the motion.  The information must be made available to us as legislators in Seanad &Eacute;ireann or in the D&aacute;il, as well as to members of the public because it is they who are the ones who decide in this respect.</P>
        <P>All the Senators who spoke made a valuable contribution.  Senator John Whelan is correct in pointing out that we cannot introduce an age limit as to when a person can be allowed to use a mobile phone.  A recommendation has been made in England regarding media texting by those under the age of 16 years.  I agree with Senator John Whelan.  When my children were growing up, they asked for a mobile phone.  Parents have a responsibility in regard to the age at which they will give their child a mobile phone.  Children as young as 8 years old are being given a mobile phone, with which I do not agree.  That puts them in a domain where they have contact with others.  I am diversifying from the subject of the motion, but all of the social networks in the communications industry, whether it be the Internet, Facebook or Twitter, are in this domain.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Minister of State for his time.  If the mobile phone operators have information on this matter, it is important that it be made available to us as legislators and the general public.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  The previous Government made an explicit commitment to provide an oncology unit on the grounds of Waterford Regional Hospital.  In 2007, the former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, and former Minister from Waterford, Mr. Martin Cullen, made an unequivocal statement to this effect to the people of Waterford.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State may be aware that for more than ten years a campaign has been fought to bring an integrated multi-disciplinary cancer service to the south-east region.  This campaign sought to establish a centre of excellence and an oncology unit that can provide all the modalities of cancer care, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, on one integrated site because international best practice demonstrates this approach results in better outcomes for patients.  Despite the fact that land was made available on the site of Waterford Regional Hospital, it appears the capital funding is no longer available or else the proposed oncology unit is not part of the current capital programme.  This issue causes serious concern for patients in the south east.  The region has a population of 450,000 and the hospital in Waterford covers Counties Waterford, south County Tipperary and County Wexford, as well as providing cancer services for patients in counties Carlow and Kilkenny.  It is vital, therefore, that the oncology unit is built.</P>
        <P>I recently joined my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Ciara Conway, and other Government Members in meeting the local hospice movement, which expressed concern about the delay in constructing the oncology unit and the 20-bed palliative care unit which was to be attached to it.  At present, an integrated service with three consultants is based at the hospital but only two inpatient beds are available for a region comprising 450,000 people.  There are four community home care specialist palliative care teams with consultant leads but, while these teams do fantastic work, they need in-house facilities for those who cannot be cared for at home.  In Cork and Kerry the population is 510,000 but the area has 24 specialist palliative care beds.  The south east, with a population of 463,000, has access to two inpatient beds.  Some 1,300 patients in the south east per year are seen by the specialist community team, with 850 patients seen in acute hospitals.  The estimated cost of the oncology unit which could provide the proper centre of excellence, with integrated care and all modalities on site and which would be part of international best practice in giving patients best outcome, would be approximately &euro;70 million.  It may be even less now because of the downturn.</P>
        <P>The local hospice movement has provided &euro;2.5 million which is ready to be spent.  The money has been raised through hard work and the movement needs to have the unit built.  The primary objective is the oncology unit with a palliative care section but if that is not an option, another plan to find an independent palliative care unit should be explored.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are times when people play politics with very serious health issues.  The commitments given by the previous Government were not carried out but my party also gave commitments, as did local Fine Gael and Labour Party candidates.  The leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, Deputies Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore, gave very clear commitments that if they were in government, they would deliver on the promise of delivering an oncology unit.  I hope <Col N="567"/>the Minister of State will be able to ease some of the fears of patients in the south east.  I am being told that the unit is not part of the capital programme and if that is the case we should get the facility on the capital programme in order that we can expedite the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Departments of Health and Children and Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue as it provides me with an opportunity to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing palliative care services.  Government policy for palliative care is based on the report of the national advisory committee on palliative care from 2001.  Palliative care is primarily concerned with quality of life.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s objective of the continued development of palliative care services is reflected in the funding of these services in recent times.  In 2009 in the region of &euro;79 million was made available, with approximately &euro;66.5 million of this being provided to the main voluntary organisations.  It is accepted that these organisations do an extraordinary job.  The overall budget provision in 2010 was &euro;76 million and &euro;74 million was provided in 2011.  The HSE reports that specialist palliative care is provided to 3,600 people each month, and it is understood that the admission rates &mdash; waiting times &mdash; to palliative care beds over all regions is 90% to 100% within seven days of active referral.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A palliative care services medium-term development framework was published by the HSE. This sets national priorities, which have been agreed by all stakeholders.  In line with recommendations of the framework, the HSE established in July 2010 the national steering group on palliative care services to monitor progress on the implementation of the framework at national and regional level.  As the Senator is aware, the Health Act 2004 provides the Health Service Executive with responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.  As a statutory body the provision of these services, including progressing palliative care services at local level, is therefore an operational matter for the executive.</P>
        <P>There are a number of developments ongoing in the south east with regard to palliative care services.  In the south east, including Waterford, specialist palliative care is delivered through hospital and community-based consultant-led multidisciplinary teams.  These teams consist of consultants, non-consultant hospital doctors, senior occupational therapists and a principal social worker.  Acute and primary care services in the south east have access to specialist palliative care teams 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</P>
        <P>The Irish Hospice Foundation established a national programme to mainstream hospice principles in hospital practice.  It focuses on four key themes generated from a pilot project: integrated care; communication; dignity and design; and patient autonomy.  Waterford Regional Hospital is participating in this programme.</P>
        <P>The management team at St. Luke&rsquo;s General Hospital in Kilkenny continues to work with the Susie Long Hospice voluntary group on the plans to develop outreach inpatient palliative care beds for Kilkenny.  In liaison with the Susie Long Hospice Group it is planned, during 2011, to upgrade ward areas to provide improved accommodation for patients currently in receipt of palliative care and other related services.</P>
        <P>The integrated oncology unit and 20-bed palliative care unit at Waterford Regional Hospital to which the Deputy refers, like all potential capital projects, must be submitted through the HSE&rsquo;s capital steering committees for approval to be included in the HSE multiannual capital programme.  I must inform the Senator that this project has not been included in the draft HSE capital plan 2011-2015, so it will not be considered for progress in the current plan.  I understand the HSE has just appointed a project team to design a business case for the development.</P>
        <P>The estimated total cost of all potential projects is always greater than the capital funding available.  Health care is a labour intensive activity and hospices are one of the most labour intensive services.  Therefore, sufficient revenue and current funding to staff and operate new <Col N="568"/>facilities is one of a number of critical factors considered in such a project&rsquo;s appraisal.  Given the level of contractual commitments already in place, there is limited funding available for new contracts before 2014.  The executive is required to prioritise capital infrastructure projects within its overall capital funding allocation and within the multiannual commitment thresholds notified by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
        <P>I reiterate the strong and real commitment of the Government to progressing the highest possible standards of palliative care nationally.  However, all future developments, including capital projects, must be considered within overall budgetary and economic constraints.  I know Cork has a very good and accessible palliative care programme so I understand fully where the Senator is coming from and why it would be a significant addition to the region.  There is no dispute in that manner and it is an incredible service to be available to everyone.  Unfortunately, I am sure the Senator understands the country&rsquo;s Government does not have the money to progress the project.  If he continues with pressure, it will eventually come about.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her response in reiterating the Government&rsquo;s commitment to palliative care, which is very important.  The funding could and must be provided for.  Despite the downturn, there is still money available for the Government and cancer care and provision of cancer treatment services is very important.  A private facility has been built in Waterford, the Whitfield Clinic, which provides some form of radiotherapy.  It is important in terms of international best practice that all modalities of treatment be provided on one site.  For this to happen we need an oncology unit and the 20-bed palliative care unit.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State indicated, the local hospice movement has campaigned and raised funds for this project.  I know the HSE is designing a brief now so I hope that when it is submitted, it will have the Department&rsquo;s full attention.  I hope that at some point the Government will be in a position to allocate capital funding to deliver on this very important project.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take about 20 seconds of the four minutes allocated to me to state I am very supportive of Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s Adjournment matter.  There is an extraordinary team of doctors working in oncology in Waterford Regional Hospital, and it has three of the hardest working oncologists.  Those women are incredibly well trained and have done a wonderful job with routine care and the involvement of the Waterford hospital in the national research initiative.  I express my great appreciation for the work of Dr. Horgan, Dr. O&rsquo;Connor and Dr. Calvert.</P>
        <P>I have not been in a position to follow today&rsquo;s news stories, but I understand there have been further disclosures of child abuse.  I would like to talk about another form of child abuse, which takes place in our country every day.  We are all aware of it and decreasingly tolerant of it.  We need legislation to ban the exposure of young children to cigarette smoke, which contains harmful chemicals, in small enclosed spaces.  When we are stuck at traffic lights every day, we often see one or more adults smoking in other cars even though children are strapped in with them.  It should be possible to enforce a smoking ban in cars.  This is not a crazy form of the nanny state or an attempt to heap further misery on hassled mothers and fathers who may be addled as they ferry their children around each morning.  If they have addiction thinking, they might think their stress levels will be reduced if they have a cigarette.</P>
        <P>There are unanswerable reasons to legislate definitively to ban smoking by adults in cars when children are present.  One could go further and argue that smoking should be banned in front of children in any enclosed space, including rooms in people&rsquo;s own homes.  Children are more vulnerable than adults to the effects of cigarette smoke for two reasons.  First, they breathe more quickly.  The respiratory rate of a young child is faster than the respiratory rate of an <Col N="569"/>averagely fit adult.  As a result, there is a greater exchange of chemicals into a child&rsquo;s system per minute than would be the case with an adult.  Second, their weight is smaller and therefore they have a higher amount of exposure per kilogram of body weight.  The relative impact of the potentially noxious chemicals in cigarette smoke on a young child is far greater than the impact on an average-sized adult.  The issue of choice arises as well.  An adult who is a non-smoker can choose to be in the company of smokers or to ask them to stop.  Children often do not have that choice.  Infants, by definition, never have that choice.</P>
        <P>When a cigarette is lit in a car with the windows closed, within a minute the measurable occupational level of toxic emissions is 30 times higher than the level at which the US Environmental Protection Agency advises people to flee the streets, go into their homes and close their windows.  If it is 30 times higher than the level that is considered dangerous, it is extraordinarily dangerous for children to be exposed to it.  What does it actually do?  Is this a vague theoretical concern or do we have quantifiable data?  The data based on literature are very clear.  Diseases like asthma, lower and upper respiratory infections, bronchitis, otitis or ear infections, meningitis and, chillingly, sudden infant death syndrome are more common in children who are exposed passively to second-hand smoke.  The British Medical Association has suggested the data would indicate there is an increased risk of childhood cancers &mdash; not respiratory cancers, but lymphomas and tumours involving the nervous system &mdash; among children who are exposed to second-hand cigarette smoke.  I have seen some data to suggest that people who grew up in a house where they were regularly exposed to second-hand cigarette smoke as children have a higher risk of developing lung cancer as adults, even if they do not have a smoking history themselves.</P>
        <P>Ireland would not be the first country in the world to attempt to legislate for a ban on smoking in cars.  As I have said, we could go further by banning smoking in all enclosed spaces.  Many individual states in the US and many countries around the world have already activated the process of introducing protective legislation of this nature.  I believe we should give serious thought to extending the current regulations to ban smoking completely within the confines of Leinster House, but that is a different day&rsquo;s work.  I ask the Minister of State to bring the urgency of this matter to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  This is different from the mobile phone question we considered earlier, which continues to be the subject of genuine controversy.  We should provide for some kind of warning about the potential, but as yet unproven, risks associated with mobile phones.  This is different because we know there is a risk.  Every adult who lights a cigarette, a cigar or a pipe in an enclosed area when a child is present is engaging in a form of child abuse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  I am aware that this matter was raised by Senator Crown yesterday during the debate on the Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill 2001.  As a result of the introduction of the smoke-free at work legislation in 2004, and other tobacco control measures since then, awareness of the risks of smoking and exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke has increased significantly.  It is recognised that smoking in the car exposes all the occupants to harmful environmental tobacco smoke, which is a carcinogen that contains cancer causing substances and toxic agents that are inhaled by the smoker.  There is no safe level of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.  Exposure to cigarette smoke is particularly dangerous in enclosed spaces such as cars.  Parents and others with responsibility for the welfare of children have a particular responsibility to ensure such exposure does not take place.</P>
        <P>Legislative measures have been introduced in a small number of countries to prohibit or discourage smoking in cars when children are present.  The nature of the measures and of the accompanying compliance and enforcement arrangements have been variable and far from consistent.  In some jurisdictions, smoking in cars is treated as a driving offence.  Other jurisdictions have introduced an education tool aimed at highlighting the dangers of smoking in <Col N="570"/>cars.  Any proposal to introduce a ban on smoking in cars must be based on evidence, such as data on the extent to which it occurs and the risks to public health it poses.  Consideration will need to be given to the extent to which it may be appropriate to deal with this question as a road safety and a public health issue.</P>
        <P>The successful introduction of measures with regard to smoking in cars would benefit from the roll-out of a public information and education campaign to mobilise public support.  A similar approach proved successful when the smoke-free at work initiative and subsequent tobacco control initiatives were introduced.  These provisions were underpinned by a clear evidence base and good planning.  Public opinion was mobilised through a public education and information campaign.  Simple, clear and enforceable legislation was introduced.  Proposals relating to smoking in cars are being considered in the context of the tobacco policy review that is under way in the Department of Health.  The review is expected to be completed and submitted to the Minister for Health within months.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has signalled that he is in favour of legislating in this area.  However, he would like a public information and education campaign to highlight the dangers associated with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in cars and to mobilise public support in advance of the introduction of legislation.  I think the Senator is pushing an open door.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand how legislative priorities can vary.  Any delay in this regard would lead to real and quantifiable health problems for individuals.  I suggested the other day that it would be easy to amend the original 2002 Act by including two one-line paragraphs.  The first paragraph would ban smoking in vehicles in the presence of children, which is the conservative position.  The second paragraph would ban smoking in any enclosed area in the presence of children.  I believe it could be done with universal cross-party support.  It could be enacted very quickly.  The Minister of State said that a public information campaign would be essential.  I suggest we would be pushing an open door with the public because there is overwhelming support for this measure.  There would be no opposition to be overcome.  We must remember that the tipping point for the original legislation, as introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Martin, was the exposure of people to carcinogens in a work environment over which they had no control.  People did not think they should leave their jobs because others were smoking.  The problem is far greater in this case because it affects young children.  If the original ban was necessary in the interests of adults who could voluntarily leave their jobs, we should introduce this ban urgently in the interests of young infants, who are not aware of the problem or are unable to articulate it, and of older children, whose relationships with their parents may mean they are not in a position to say what should or should not be done.</P>
