	<P>I have received notice from Senator Kathryn Reilly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to discuss the reduction in the opening hours of the minor injuries unit at Monaghan General Hospital effective from 1 October; the implications of this decision; and the backup being put in place.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Averil Power of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to resource the City of Dublin Youth Services Board in order that it can provide the same level of financial support for the Sphere 17 Youth Project, Dublin 17, in 2012 to avoid the extremely damaging effect cuts in funding for Sphere 17 would have on at-risk young people in one of the most socio-economically disadvantaged areas in the country.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, motion regarding the amendment of the terms of reference of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion regarding the extension of the reporting deadline for the Joint Committee on Investigations, Oversight and Petitions from 30 September 2011 to 27 January 2012, to be taken without debate; No. 3, earlier signature motion for the Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2011, to be taken without debate; No. 4, Road Traffic (No. 2) Bill 2011 - Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 2 p.m., if not previously concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>We are opposing the Order of Business, to which I propose an amendment that the Minister for Health come to the House immediately to discuss the many issues within the health service which amount to a national crisis.  A number of years ago a particular Senator, who will remain nameless, used to annoy me as he went through the newspapers each day.  I regret to say one has no option but to go through some of the headlines <Col N="448"/>today.  They include one over a story on doctors raking in extra cash for supplying hospital scanners &mdash; no wonder the health service is in its current state if doctors are doing nixers at the expense of others.  Other headlines indicate how the Minister has condemned the nurses&rsquo; strike and declined to endorse prostate cancer screening services while there are 1,100 absences per day in the HSE.</P>
        <P>What has happened about colonoscopy screening, having regard to the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, announced the provision of a centre of excellence in Sligo?  Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe also promised an overall centre of excellence in Sligo.  There are also issues with accident and emergency units throughout the country, not least of which is the unit in Roscommon, a topical example.  The HSE is pursuing the implementation of recommendations made in three reports dealing with the changing nature of cardiovascular care, the national cancer control programme and the centralisation of pathology services.  As my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague mentioned yesterday, this discriminates against certain parts &mdash; or even half &mdash; of the country.  It is timely to consider Dr. Manning&rsquo;s input yesterday on what this House might do to ensure its survival and usefulness while upholding the rights of the people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One wonders what the health strategy is.  Representatives of the HSE are appearing before a committee today to defend cost overruns.  Yesterday the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, condemned nurses, but the only solution he advocated to deal with the pressing issue was, &ldquo;I have asked the Department to contact the HSE with a view to contacting the Croke Park agreement implementation body.&rdquo;  Is this the level of general management we have from Government?  It is far from general management, I suggest and submit strongly it is autopilot management.  It is the kind of autopilot management which runs the Government into the ground as it neglects the care of the people of this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>What is our health strategy?  I can assure the Senator that I was no less vocal when I sat where she sits today when I saw things being done wrongly.  I expect her to be equally as forceful as I was when I sat on the front bench on the other side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;when I saw injustices done.  This is a disgrace.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, went on a well documented trip to China with an official not from his Department but from his office, a councillor from north Dublin and his wife.  One wonders what level of management and responsibility the Government will take when an Adjournment matter was declined last week because the Minister concerned said it had nothing to do with him that one <Col N="449"/>should talk to the NRA about roads.  We are also to talk to the HSE but we do not even talk to that organisation.  It might be something if the Minister were to pick up the phone and speak to them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked the Department to contact the HSE with a view to contacting the Croke Park implementation body.  I am bound to say that if this were a business it would be out of business.  I had great hopes when the Minister took over for the changes he was planning to make in the HSE.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>All I have seen so far has worried and disappointed me greatly.  For this reason we are opposing the Order of Business and ask that it be amended in order that the Minister can immediately come to the House.  As has been said here previously, he has been here on only one occasion under the new Administration.  That was for the taking of important legislation on female genital mutilation legislation but there are many issues, not least those highlighted today, to be dealt with.  The Senators opposite need not worry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can make those points when he gets the debate he seeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;they can check the record of the House and they will see how forceful I was in speaking out when things were done incorrectly, and Senators Bacik and Cummins can testify to that.  I do not intend stopping now when I am on this side of the House.</P>

	<P>The electorate did put it out of business in February.  It was Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s Government that set up the HSE, that set up this arm&rsquo;s length procedure of which he is now so critical.  It is very difficult to take his anger&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">The motion on today&rsquo;s Order Paper, amending the terms of reference of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, again gives us a better opportunity to engage with the public and in public consultation.  It is part of the ongoing process of reform of Seanad procedures in which we are engaged in the Government, which was sadly neglected under the previous Government.</P><Col N="451"/>
        <P Just="Left">I also thank colleagues for contributing to the Labour Party&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion yesterday with the Minister, Deputy Bruton in attendance.  It was again a useful and productive debate with constructive suggestions being made and the Minister saying that he would go back to consider extending the notice period in collective redundancies from 30 days.  I thought that debate was very much worthwhile having.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I call on the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Health, or I should say the Minister for Education and Skills, to come into this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;for a debate on third level education in light of the lobby by the Union of Students in Ireland, which many of us attended.  The USI has an impressive and reasonable lobbying programme and it calls, reasonably enough, for a freeze on the student contribution currently set at &euro;2,000, no introduction of any further fees and investment in the student assistance fund.  It would be worthwhile in this House, particularly given the interest many of us have in education and in third level education, that we would debate the proposals made by the USI with the Minister as soon as we can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Taca&iacute;m leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an Seanad&oacute;ir Bacik.  Is minic muid ag lorg d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute; sa Teach faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais.  Is minic muid ag r&aacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; eisceacht maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais agus go bhfuil g&eacute;ar-gh&aacute; le hinfheist&iacute;ocht in oideachas mar, mar a deir Aontas na Mac L&eacute;inn in &Eacute;irinn, infheisti&uacute; san ais&eacute;ir&iacute; at&aacute; i gceist.  M&aacute; t&aacute; ciorraithe le d&eacute;anamh, agus t&aacute; go leor acu le d&eacute;anamh, caithfear eisceacht a dh&eacute;anamh don oideachas le cinnti&uacute; go bhfuil ard-chaighde&aacute;n ann, mar t&aacute;imid ag brath air sin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad that Senator Bacik mentioned the USI&rsquo;s excellent and helpful briefing to Members of the Oireachtas yesterday.  We often call for debates on education in this House and we have talked about the importance of third level education in particular and the need for a debate on fees.  A point that has been repeatedly made, rightly so, is that an exception must be made for education in order to guarantee quality in education.  It is in investment in our recovery, which was the title of the USI briefing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The USI made a number of compelling points to us yesterday and one that stood out for me was its observations on the impact of the changes in the grant in the provisions for the availability of the adjacent grant, as distinct from the non-adjacent grant, to students as a result of pushing out the boundaries in order that in order to avail of the non-adjacent grant one must be studying at least 45 km away from home compared with 24 km, which used to be the criterion.  About 20,000 people have been affected by that.</P>
        <P>It is also instructive to examine the comparison between the student grants paid and other benefits paid in the past.  The student grant was much closer to the social welfare payments that used to apply.  With the changes in recent years the student grant has not improved in any significant way and as a result is now a pittance.  The logic for this seems to be that students are expected to have part-time jobs or to get financial support from their families.  That was all right as long as part-time jobs were there to be had and as long as families were not under extreme pressure, which they are now with some of them supporting their children&rsquo;s mortgages.  We must examine again what is being done to the students of this country.</P>
        <P>The welfare officer of UCD, Rachel Breslin, told me that there had been a 30% increase in applications for the student assistance fund.  It would make a good deal of sense for the Government to increase the allocation made to assist students in emergency situations &mdash; the funding the Government would give would be matched by European social funding.  It would be a good <Col N="452"/>investment in student&rsquo;s welfare from a Government point of view.  We need to take this agenda very seriously.</P>
        <P>I am on record as having said that we need to have a debate on student fees.  In reality, student fees have been brought back ithrough the back door.  The student contribution charge is now &euro;2,000 compared with &euro;1,000 in the past.  It has risen substantially and repeatedly and the students are rightly concerned that there might be another increase.  They do not want to see another rise in the student contribution charge.  It is the worst of all possible worlds for students if fees are being brought in through the back door without any scheme being put in place to facilitate grants, student loans or something that would allow students to plan for their education in order that at least the State would be guaranteed a return on its investment in the future.  I would be pleased if we had a debate soon with the Minister for Education and Skills to discuss these important issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree wholeheartedly with my colleague, Senator MacSharry.  The Minister for Health must come to this House.  We have been asking for weeks that he come here.  The HSE is a basket case.  It was created by Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; that is not political points scoring but a fact &mdash; and we must do something about it.  It is great to find that somebody in the Opposition is of the same mind as me.  Ultimately, we will get nothing done unless something is done about the HSE.  If people&rsquo;s health will not be taken care of, there is no hope for this country.  I join the Opposition Members in asking that the Minister for Health come to the House.  I would almost support them in whatever technical move is made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Up Mayo is right.  However, it represents everything that is good about Ireland.  It represents where we have come from and where we should be going.  It is fantastic that this painting is remaining in Ireland.  It was valued at between &euro;500,000 and &euro;800,000 by the auctioneers, James Adam &amp; Sons, and it sold for &euro;1 million.  It demonstrates that when something has quality people will pay for it.  There is still money in this country.  We have got carried away thinking that we are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On the presidential election, the media must quit this wishy-washy stuff.  We need to hear real things from the people who wish to be President.  I ask the Leader to do what he can about that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support my colleague, Senator MacSharry.  I tuned to Ivan Yates&rsquo;s programme on Newstalk this morning and he was bemoaning the fact that the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, despite repeated requests from the radio station, had not been returning its calls inviting him to appear on the programme.  It appears the programme has a regular ministerial slot.  It is somewhat bizarre.  Having listened to Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s remarks something is obviously taking place in the Department of Health that perhaps must be exposed.  The Leader might be able to cast some light on the Minister&rsquo;s reluctance.  As I am sure he is doing a very good job trying to grapple with the complexity of a Department which a former Minister, Brian Cowen, referred to as &ldquo;Angola&rdquo;, I can understand the difficulties in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I support Senator Mullen&rsquo;s call for a debate on education, I raised the introduction of the registration fee in an Adjournment debate in this House.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, replied to it.  I have researched the issue.  It is an initiative proposed by the previous Administration which was taken up by this Government, presumably because it is seeking to find money wherever it can get it.  This is not a new issue although I am glad the Union of Students in Ireland raised it yesterday.  However, it has been in the public domain for the last few months.  What is of great concern to parents is the fact that the first &euro;2,000 is not subject to any form of tax relief.  If one has a second or subsequent child going to a third level college, one can avail of tax relief amounting to approximately &euro;600 but that depends on the tax situation of the people involved.  This is a penal tax and I am glad Senator Bacik has raised the issue.  The only way its impact can be minimised for families who are becoming increasingly hard pressed is by the Senator raising it through her party&rsquo;s structures, as we would have done when our party was in government.  I am glad the Senator has spoken in so forthright a manner and I hope this will continue.  It is a penal tax despite the fact that the Government must find money somewhere.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Simon Coveney, was in the House some weeks ago for an unprecedented question and answer session, for which we complimented the Leader.  The Minister showed he was very much in command of his brief.  I am particularly pleased that the Government has put agriculture at the centre of its policy for economic renewal, on foot of Food Harvest 2020.  However, it appears that this Government has now taken ownership of Food Harvest 2020 even though it was quite critical about it when its parties were in opposition.  The previous Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, initiated the concept of Food Harvest 2020, brought it through the Government and out into the open.  He has been under-acknowledged for the outstanding contribution he made in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is the key area of the economy that will probably produce an increased number of jobs and save the economy in the next few years.  It is extraordinary, therefore, that the Department is now talking about cutting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Leader invite the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food back to the House when the spending review has been completed so we can establish if his Department is seeking cuts of &euro;200 million in its budget?  It is quite bizarre.  The Government is, correctly, placing Food Harvest 2020 at the centre of our economic renewal, yet the Department charged with its implementation will take &euro;200 million out of its annual budget.  I hope the Leader will convey to the Department and the Minister the importance of ensuring that the budget for agriculture is not only ring-fenced but also increased.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to the House as quickly as possible for a question and answer session.  The breadth of issues facing us in education is mindboggling.  There is a huge need for clarity.  Will continuous assessment be introduced for the junior certificate?  We need a response on that issue.  We have heard about the need for a debate on funding to support third level students in continuing their education.  As we must not cut our future, we must examine how to safeguard education in so far as is possible.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Most especially, I am seeking the Minister&rsquo;s support in taking on the unions to assist newly-qualified teachers to be taken on on probation.  There is a means available through the work placement programme.  It was approved on 29 November 2010 and the Minister spoke about it in July.  He is supportive of it but the unions have written to all the schools urging them not to use this work placement programme to take on newly qualified teachers for probation purposes.  They are afraid it will displace a member of staff.  I know of no board of management or school principal in this country who would not advertise a post if they had the numbers for a new teacher.  That clarity must be provided.  We must give an opportunity to the hundreds of newly qualified teachers throughout our constituencies who are seeking an opportunity to be probated.  They cannot even emigrate in peace because they do not have this fully qualified diploma under their belts.  A question and answer session with the Minister would suffice as there have been many queries on education from all sides of the House for some time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator Michael Mullins on the power of his oratory yesterday.  He called for a reduction in air travel tax and the Government in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland responded immediately by cutting the tax on flights between Belfast and New York.  We worry sometimes that the proceedings in this House get no coverage but they are obviously listened to avidly in Westminster and Stormont.</P>
        <P>I also thank the Leader for the debate yesterday on human rights.  It is another one of his innovations which is a huge success.</P>
        <P>I welcome the interest in the mathematics issue expressed this morning by the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, in response to the survey.  This matter has been raised by Senator Healy Eames, Senator White and many other Senators.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, to the House to debate the issue.  He appears to be the appropriate person given that he is so close in age to the people who are facing these problems.  What concerns me about what was reported today is that, first, 40% of schools did not reply.</P>
        <P>This is a matter involving a budget of more than &euro;3 billion and the employment of 32,000 staff.  When we vote &euro;3 billion to employ 32,000 people, we are entitled to a 100% response rate.  I fear that the 40% who did not respond are the ones with serious problems in mathematics.  This issue has been raised previously in the Seanad and our interest is appreciated outside the House.</P>
        <P>The first criterion to teach mathematics is to have studied it for one year.  In my own field of economics, one would never equate someone who studied at junior freshman level with a graduate in the subject.  The second criterion is that mathematics be taken as one of three subjects in a degree.  That is not good enough.  Finland, which is the country we are trying to emulate, requires teachers to possess a full degree in the subject they teach.  Nothing is good enough for the children of this country and we are trying to promote ourselves as leaders in science and technology.  The Royal Irish Academy and the future skills needs group have estimated that our deficiencies in mathematics teaching equates to 80%.</P><Col N="455"/>
        <P>Bonus points, which was the previous response, miss the point because the bonus will go to the 20% of students who have fully qualified teachers or can afford grinds.  The problem is presented as one of student incentives when in reality it is one of teacher training.  The bonus points solution was arrived at because everyone in the sector sought the easiest way out.  We require reforms in the teaching of mathematics in universities and in the organisation of the higher diploma in education.  We would be happy to assist the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, in developing this vital national programme.  We cannot do much at third level unless we repair the deficiencies at primary and secondary level.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I recognise that people are growing bored with the issue of health services but I raise it nonetheless because it is important.  It is embarrassing for the country that the Pakistani Embassy had to contact the HSE to find out how we intended to deal with junior doctors whom we had invited to take up jobs in the health service and who were twiddling their thumbs in guesthouses.  The Department of Health claims it is a HSE problem and the HSE lays the blame on the Medical Council, which in turn claims it was never consulted about the new procedures for category five supervised doctors.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Please allow me to make my point.  When I was interviewed on radio last week, the HSE issued a statement asserting I did not know what I was talking about and denying that junior doctors in a particular part of the country were waiting to sit exams.  This morning I intend to issue an invitation to the press office in the HSE to meet these junior doctors and see that they are living in guesthouses in a country town.  If 100 Irish people were invited to take up contracts in Australia and were living without salaries in guesthouses three months later, we would be up in arms.  It is a disgraceful situation and it needs to be resolved.  We have created a bad name for ourselves in terms of recruiting doctors.</P>
        <P>A study due for release in the coming week will reveal that in 2008 an average of six applicants applied for each consultant post advertised but the ratio is now less than two.  When one reputable Dublin hospital recently advertised for consultant posts, no one applied for them.  We must ask why Irish graduates are disappearing out of this country rather than taking posts as junior doctors or consultants.  It is time we had a debate on this issue and I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Health to come to the House at the earliest opportunity to allow us deal with this issue.  Our role is to ensure the issues that arise are dealt with and not passed from one Department or Government agency to another.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite the banter and excitement that surrounded the request for the Minister for Health to come to the House, the issue is a serious one.  Senators from all parties have commended Ministers, such as Deputies Bruton, Coveney and Shatter and others, on participating in frank and forthright exchanges in this Chamber.  We merely want the Minister for Health to meet us for a similar discussion.  Each Member can point to crises in local hospitals, whether it be ward or bed closures.  The Minister&rsquo;s response to the potential strike in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick was appalling.  Regardless of my view of the Minister, all of us share one concern, that the health service is not working.  There is a crisis and a lack of accountability and transparency.  I made the point on several occasions that the Minister and his predecessors have imitated Pontius Pilate by washing their hands of any responsibility for what is happening.  The responsibility is put back on hospital management and the HSE and there is a merry-go-round of no one, from the Department to the Minister to the local hospitals, taking responsibility.</P><Col N="456"/>
        <P>We all accept that savings have to be made but the recruitment embargo is driving up costs for hospitals because they are forced to take on agency staff.  We are faced with the current crisis because hospitals have run over budget by taking on agency staff simply to keep theatres, wards and emergency departments open.</P>
        <P>In fairness to the Leader, he has indicated that the Minister will come to the House at some point, but I ask him to fast-track the invitation in order that we can debate the issues arising next week.  The exchanges we have had with other Ministers have been fruitful, but this Seanad since its formation has not yet had an opportunity to hold discussions with the Minister for Health, even though health is one of the most pressing issues for the people.  It is not good enough that the Minister should hide from Senators or treat this House with contempt by refusing to attend for a debate.  I appeal to the Leader to ask the Minister to come to the House for a discussion on the problems facing the health service at an earlier date than the end of October.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the request to invite the Minister for Health to the House at the earliest opportunity but, in fairness, the Leader has indicated that the Minister&rsquo;s visit should take place in the near future.  I look forward to a substantive debate with him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Most speakers have debated either the health service or the education system.  Since the foundation of the State, these two important areas of public policy have not progressed at a similar rate.  Historically the debate on education was not political because there was a view that every child deserved and should be provided with a full and adequate education.  While we do not have a perfect system, a good education has been available to virtually every citizen of this State.  Simultaneously, however, we have taken the opposite approach to the health service by holding politicised debates on health through the years.  We have suffered from that.  Since I entered politics, regardless of one&rsquo;s view of the persons who held it, some of the top political brains in the country have held the Health portfolio, from Charles Haughey to Barry Desmond, Deputy Michael Noonan, now Minister for Finance, Brian Cowen and Mary Harney.  All of these former Ministers intended to do a good job, but it never worked out in the way any of them expected.  Obviously, there is something problematic at the core of the delivery of health services at a policy level.  We require not only one visit by the Minister, Deputy James Reilly; we need a much more substantial debate on why the House and the political system have divided so much on the delivery of a health service and why we cannot, as we did on education issues, adopt an all-party approach to ensure every citizen is looked after properly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s visit and hope it will only kick-off the debate.  I appreciate that he is to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and that some of our colleagues here are members of that committee, but in this House of the Oireachtas we need to begin a serious dialogue with him.  He has a concept of the health service which is only in its infancy.  We cannot expect miracles overnight, but I hope in the next week or two we will hear from him and that we will be able to chart a way forward.  There must not be only one visit, a &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Goodbye&rdquo;; it must mark the beginning of a substantial debate.  We need to change the way we engage with the health service from a political perspective because it has failed everybody.  It has failed every Minister also, as he or she did not succeed in what he or she had attempted to do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Barrett raised the issue of the qualifications of mathematics teachers.  I agree fully that all teachers should be highly qualified in their subjects.  However, merely looking at academic qualifications does not give one the full picture.  The Minister is taking an extremely simplistic and ill-thought out approach to this important issue in education. <Col N="457"/> We need to look at the results in schools because it is possible one could have an engineer who only did mathematics for one year in his or her degree course but who went on to avail of every professional development opportunity since he or she became a teacher, who has a passion for the subject, who cares about his or her students who, as a result, are getting good results.  Equally, one could have somebody wth a first class degree in mathematics who studied the subject for four years in university and is an appalling teacher.  In only looking at qualifications one is completely missing the point.  The Minister needs to look at the bottom 100 schools in the State in terms of mathematics results.  If these schools are obtaining poor results in mathematics, are they also achieving poor results in other subjects, or is it only that the results in mathematics are poor?  Are all of their results in mathematics poor, or is it only the results of students of one particular teacher in that school that are poor?  One should feed qualifications in as part of the picture, but one should also look at other matters.  One should look at whether they have been engaged in continuous professional development.  One should also look at the leadership given in the school.  One should look at the culture, the attitude to learning, and all of those aspects that make up a school environment.  One needs to look at the whole picture.  Personally, I am disappointed that the Minister is taking such a short-sighted and simplistic approach to the matter.  I urge the Leader to raise it with him.</P>

	<P>I agree fully agree that it is an important issue, but it is not the only one.  Everybody knows that the education system is broader and that one cannot merely look at one symptom and assume that it is the outcome of a particular issue.  One needs to look at all of the symptoms and diagnose the problem properly, particularly when it is so acute.</P>
        <P>Because it is important to do so, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that medics, some of them Irish-trained, have been sentenced to 15 years in prison by a military court in Bahrain.  The House has discussed this issue previously.  The only crimes of the persons concerned were to assist peaceful protesters who had been shot at by the Bahraini authorities and Saudi troops who had come over the border to put down a peaceful expression of dissent against the Bahraini Government.  We passed an all-party motion tabled by Senator John Crown earlier in the year.  I ask the Leader to bring this development to the attention of the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and urge them to do everything they possibly can as soon as possible to put pressure on the Bahraini authorities to respect the basic principles of international human rights to which they have signed up and to let the persons concerned out before it is too late.</P>
        <P>I second Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business, that the Minister for Health come into the House.  The number of Members on the other side who have supported the principle is encouraging and I hope they will support it in the vote also.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesHeffernan"><NameTxt>Senator James Heffernan</NameTxt>
	<P>Following on from what many Senators have contributed this morning to the health debate, I was alarmed when I read the article in this morning&rsquo;s newspaper <Col N="458"/>and the language the Minister had used to describe the nurses&rsquo; action.  He stated it was &ldquo;unsafe, unsound and unwarranted.&rdquo;  To me, such language, especially in the situation in which we find ourselves, is completely unhelpful.  I know many of the nurses in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital and they are literally at their wits&rsquo; end.  They raised the issue time and again with management, the HSE and the Department, but, like many of us here, it fell on deaf ears.  They are not being listened to.  They have not become involved in this dispute to improve their pay and working conditions.  This is a matter of patient safety and putting the patient first.  It is interesting that when they decided to take this action, management had no trouble in opening up an extra few beds to remove bodies from the corridors and into wards.  It is engaged in a little cosmetic surgery on the problem.</P>
        <P>I agree with other speakers that we definitely need to have the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, come into the House to deal with the grave concerns many of us have about the health service, but I would go one step further.  While coming here is all fine and well, I ask the Leader to recommend to the Minister that he visit the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick to speak to the nurses and management to come up with a solution instead of using throwaway remarks and dismissing the nurses&rsquo; action out of hand.</P>

I hope Senator Heffernan will support the amendment to the Order of Business because it is important that the Minister come to the House to deal with the matter.</P>
        <P>It is interesting.  There was cross-party support in Galway on Monday night on another health issue, the closing of St. Francis&rsquo; home, a HSE-run home for the elderly.  All of the public representatives from all parties were present and agreed that the home should be kept open.  It has passed HIQA audit with flying colours.  The HSE tells us that one of the reasons it is closing down the home is it would cost &euro;200,000 to refurbish it, this at a time when the Government intends, in the next five weeks, to provide &euro;700 million to repay an unguaranteed bond, yet it cannot find &euro;200,000 to keep open one of the best community nursing homes in the country.  It is scandalous.  That comes on top of the crisis surrounding the fair deal scheme.</P>
        <P>I want the Minister to come to the House.  At this stage, we do not need him to come for one day; we probably need him to come for one week to discuss all of the issues raised and to tell us what the Government&rsquo;s policy is.  Is it intended that the closure of St. Francis&rsquo; home is merely the first step in the privatisation of the homes for the elderly system?  If it is, the people will not put up with it.  The people of Galway will not put up with it.  Certainly, we will campaign against the closure of St. Francis&rsquo; home.</P>

They do not know what their rights are in terms of redundancy payments.  Deputy Doherty and I have made numerous attempts to discuss the matter with the Minister who has not met us.  He has not replied to our emails.  I asked him to come here last week, but he sent the Minister of State, Deputy Willie Penrose, in his place.  I want to know where he has gone to.  I would like him to come to the House and tell me, the workers in Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltacht and those in the Gaeltacht regions what will happen to their 130 jobs and why the Government has not done more to ensure these jobs are kept.

I share the concern expressed about the fact that nurses are on strike in the <Col N="460"/>Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick.  I consider it to be a major management failure and a breakdown of relations between management and unions.  I call on the management of the HSE in the mid-west and the unions to get the matter resolved as a matter of urgency.  The last thing we want to see is vulnerable patients who are under pressure worrying about whether they will have adequate care if they are admitted to the Mid-Western Regional Hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was disturbing to read in the newspapers this morning about the levels of absenteeism in the HSE, with 1,100 phoning in sick in the HSE West region.  There is the makings of an inquiry in this.  Certainly, a serious analysis should take place into the reasons for this level of absenteeism.  No country, private industry or business could sustain absenteeism at that level.  We should find out how much of this is work related.  Is it due to conditions within the organisation?  Is there too generous a sick pay scheme in operation?  These questions must be asked at a time of severe fiscal challenges in the country.  We must sort out these issues.</P>

	<P>Like others, I expressed on Tuesday and express again today my concern about the nurses having to take industrial action in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick.  Last Monday week I visited the hospital to see a friend of mine who was a patient there.  I was desperately sorry for the staff.  The overcrowding was appalling, there were queues of people and the noise levels and mayhem there were most unfortunate.  I happened to go through the accident and emergency area to see the patient.  I fully understand, therefore, why the frustration levels of staff have reached the point where they have gone on strike.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister, Deputy Reilly, must deal with this problem and we must be careful about how we deal with these things.  The Minister is doing a good job.  He inherited an absolute mess.  The health service is difficult to get right but he has the right policies, attitude and experience as a medical doctor.  We must work with him and people must be patient.  I call on the Leader to suggest to the Minister ahead of coming to the House to address it and debate the issue, that we should consider more partnership approaches within the health service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Next February, thousands will retire from the public service.  Many of these workers would be willing and able to give some voluntary time to assist in getting the country back working again.  There should be some scheme whereby their expertise is not lost to the country through retirement and instead could be harnessed and brought in as part of a voluntary programme, not only in the health service but throughout the public service.</P>

	<P>The Acting Leader of the Opposition, Senator MacSharry, made a strong point for having the Minister for Health come to the House.  I informed the then Acting Leader of the Opposition, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, on Tuesday that the Minister for Health will be here on 27 October to address questions from the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Education and health have dominated the exchanges on the Order of Business.  Senator Bacik led off by calling for a debate on education, followed by Senators Mullen, Mooney, Healy Eames, Bradford, Power and others.  The Minister for Education and Skills was in the House last week on the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill <Col N="461"/>and he will be in the House to take more legislation during October.  While it is to be confirmed, I have asked that he be in the House again for a question and answer session and statements on education on 8 November.  The Minister has been fair to the House.  He has been here on several occasions to deal with education matters.</P>
        <P>Senators Barrett and Power referred to the Teaching Council report and mathematics qualifications and so on.  I have arranged that the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, will come to the House on 11 October to address the matter.  All items seemed to relate to health and education.  The Minister for Health will be in the House on 27 October and the Minister for Education and Skills as I outlined.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik referred to Dr. Manning&rsquo;s address to the House yesterday, which went off well.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The reason it went off well was that Members kept their questions sharp and concise.  Some had submitted their questions in advance.  Two Ministers will be in the House next week, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte.  If anyone has questions, I ask that they submit them to my office in advance, either today or tomorrow, because if they were to do so, it would give the Minister and the Minister of State a better opportunity to deal with the questions and give a more reasoned response.  The Members who submit their questions will be called first on the relevant matters.  I call on Senators to think about questions on sport and questions to the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, for next week.</P>
        <P>I do not believe any items were raised other than the questions on health and education which I have addressed.</P>
        <P>I can tell Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, is alive and well.  The Senator raised a question concerning a matter in Galway that was addressed by the Minister for Jobs, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, yesterday.</P>
        <P>That addresses the matters raised by Senators today.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, line 26, to delete &ldquo;10&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;2&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister back to the House.  The amendment refers to the interval within which one has to present one&rsquo;s driving licence to the Garda.  We discussed the issue briefly on Tuesday with the Minister and he was interested in the proposition.  I asked some senior counsel about it and they told me it was custom and practice dating to a time when there were hardly any cars on the road and if somebody crashed in west Cork he or she would have had to make his or her way back via four or five railway companies to Carndonagh, therefore he or she needed time to present a driving licence.  I wondered if there was a human rights aspect to the rule and was not able to detect that.  The Minister has assistants.</P>
        <P>Does the system work?  Under the previous system one went to the Garda station of one&rsquo;s choice and I recall the information being written in a large ledger.  Does it relate to the original station?  The system does not seem to be connected and is certainly not high tech.  There should be some way of linking the information to the Garda station conducting the inquiry.  One would wonder if such a system obstructs or delays modern policing.  Does the delay relate to an era when technology was far less equipped to deal with these matters than it is now?</P><Col N="465"/>
        <P>When plastic driving licences are introduced in a few years&rsquo; time the logical thing would be for a person to have it with him or her.  A vehicle is worth &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 and it is not a major requirement that one has one&rsquo;s driving licence with one in order that an investigation can start immediately.  My amendment is a proposal for the Minister to consider.  My proposed period may be too long.  I am open to what the Minister&rsquo;s research has found in the intervening two days.  The system dates back to the early days of the State and nobody knows why there was such a large allocation of time.  It is not conducive to modern, speedy policing.  I await the Minister&rsquo;s answer with interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Minister to clarify a matter.  I was under the assumption that if one was stopped by a garda who asked one to produce one&rsquo;s driving licence, but one did not have it with one as sometimes happens, one could be charged with an offence.  Section 2 suggests there is no flexibility. If one fails to produce one's driving licence one has ten days to produce it.  I understood that was the custom and practice.  Is it technically an offence to fail to produce a driving licence when a garda stops one and demands to see it for which one could be charged and prosecuted?  What is the current position?</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I can confirm that it is an offence not to produce a driving licence.  It is the law and practice to allow people time to produce a licence for the reasons suggested by Senator Barrett.  People might not be carrying a driving licence.  We do not know where the ten-day rule comes from but it has been in place for quite some time.  I am open to the idea of having a shorter period but the period proposed in the amendment of two days is too short.  A person may have to travel on business the next day and cannot get out of it or may have to go on holidays or to a funeral.</P>
        <P>A shorter period than ten days is reasonable but two days is too short and on that basis I am not prepared to accept the amendment.  We are developing a plastic driving licence.  Production will start next year and we hope to have it in place by 2013.  At that point I propose to impose penalty points and on-the-spot fines for people who do not have a new licence with them or in their car.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The problem with a two-day rule is that if the Garda went to the trouble of using the courts and prosecuting someone for not producing his or her licence within two days and then he or she turns up in court with the licence or he or she can prove that he or she went to a Garda station on day three, it would be an unnecessary use of court and Garda time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I assume that when this section is enacted it will prevent a garda from prosecuting a driver who fails to produce his or her driving licence on demand?  The Minister has established that it is already an offence.  I do not wish to cast any reflections whatsoever on the fine body of people in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but there could be occasions where a garda might decide to use the full rigours of the law on a particular individual and he or she would be well within his or her legal rights to do so.  Will the enactment of this section prevent such a scenario from occurring?  Will a driver have the right to say to a garda that he or she has ten days to produce a licence and a legitimate reason for not having it?  Such a system would prevent a prosecution from being pursued.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fair point.  The current situation will remain.  A garda will have discretion and could initiate a prosecution, but would have discretion to allow a person to produce a driving licence within ten days.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="466"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to reflect on the proposal in the context of ongoing legislation.  He might re-examine the issue in light of this enlightened Bill.  I am not suggesting the scenario I have outlined could happen but it leaves the issue open.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesHeffernan"><NameTxt>Senator James Heffernan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the amendment, which proposes to change the time from ten days to two, I understand from where the Minister is coming.  A few weeks ago I travelled back to my constituency from work.  The new roads caused me to put my foot down a little too much.  A garda stopped me and questioned why I was going so fast.  He commented that my Toyota Corolla was not built for that type of speed and I had to agree with him.  I learned my lesson and took my chastisement.  I did not have my driver&rsquo;s licence with me.</P>
        <P>One practical reason people do not carry their driver&rsquo;s licence with them is its size.  It does not fit neatly into a pocket or a wallet.  I drove my wife&rsquo;s car and kept my driver&rsquo;s licence in the sun visor but forgot to transfer it to my car.  I am from a rural constituency and it is difficult to find a local garda at a Garda station because they are only on duty during particular times and days.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was almost impossible for me to get there to meet the garda within two days, owing to travel commitments.  The ten-day rule was appropriate to me and if it had been not in place, I might have received a few more penalty points.  For those practical reasons I cannot support the amendment although I appreciate the spirit in which it was proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Heffernan has outlined everything I wished to say on the amendment.  I understand the spirit of Senator Barrett&rsquo;s amendment.  A two-day rule would be impractical because as the Minister has pointed out, somebody could be going away for a weekend, have a work commitment or be attending a funeral.  Someone without his or her licence could be stopped on the way to the airport and staying away for a week.  I know some people might need to bring a licence when travelling with Ryanair.  I know the Minister has suggested that ten days is too long but two days is too short.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I also cannot support the amendment because there is a need for some flexibility.  I was once stopped by a garda on my way out of the country.  In such circumstances it is not possible to be back within two days.  I am somewhat concerned over the Minister saying that when the plastic cards are introduced, a driver failing to produce a licence there and then will automatically be prosecuted, fined and get penalty points.  With the best will in the world, a driver might mislay the licence, leave the wallet behind or whatever.  As the records will be computerised I presume the Garda authorities would have access to the national database and be able to check if a garda was concerned a person might not be entitled to be driving a vehicle.  I would be concerned if it was too tight and there was no flexibility where genuine mistakes in mislaying a licence might occur.  The prospect of incurring penalty points and a monetary fine is very serious.  The impact on getting insurance is the real concern for many people.  While we want to ensure that everybody is within the law we need some flexibility when genuine situations arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the solution is to withdraw the amendment and substitute &ldquo;N&rdquo;, with N being a number greater than two or less than ten.  I am sure the Minister will find the correct number that satisfies us.  One of the functions of this House is to establish the rationale behind the ten-day rule in the first place, which has been useful.  The case for two days would be that Senator Heffernan travels around so quickly, he would easily get to a Garda station within my low limit of two days.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P><Col N="467"/>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On Second Stage yesterday in response to questions from Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan and others, I understand the Minister referred to the introduction of the plastic driver&rsquo;s licence which he also subsequently mentioned.  He hoped that this would be used as a means of identification, which seems perfectly sensible.  However, as he will be more aware than most, there is one organisation that insists on introducing its own laws regarding providing identification, particularly for those travelling outside the country.  It insists that it must be a passport.  I understand that other airlines and businesses may accept a driver&rsquo;s licence.  I have no doubt that once the Minister introduces the plastic card licence containing a photograph, it will be used more frequently.  Would the Minister consider going further?  Is it possible for him to make it a requirement or is it a matter for individual businesses to decide within their constitutional right as to how they should operate their business?  I do not want to complicate the matter but if the Minister is going to the trouble of introducing a plastic driving licence, which is a welcome innovation, one would hope it would be used on practically all occasions as valid identification, including by Departments which up to now have not accepted driving licences, which may be within his purview.</P>
        <P>As this is my only opportunity to ask about driving licences in this debate, has the Minister also considered anti-fraud measures that might be built into it?  As he knows, credit cards are regularly skimmed and reproduced.  If it is going to be used increasingly as an identification method, has he considered anti-fraud elements?  Will it contain a chip or will there be other ways of identifying it?  I do not want him to waste the time of the House in expanding on it, but I am curious as to whether the matter has been discussed in the Department?</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Barrett for withdrawing his amendment.  I will give consideration to what Senator Mullins said when we introduce the penalty points and fixed fine.  Everyone forgets his or her wallet at some time and it is not the objective of the Government to impose penalty points and fines on people who forget their wallet.  Perhaps it could be penalty points and a fine if a driver does not produce it on the spot or within a period of time.  We will think about that when we come to it.</P>

	<P>It is not envisaged that the new plastic driving licence will be a national identity card.  I do not have a problem with a national identity card, but there are no plans to introduce one.  At the same time we will introduce a new social welfare card.  It will be very important in cracking down on social welfare fraud to have a photograph-based social welfare and public services card.  It will replace the existing PPS card.  That will be the more valid identification than the plastic driving licence.  Ideally they would all be contained in one, but we are not there yet and European directives do not allow us to do that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a model of the new driver&rsquo;s licence and it has a chip on the back, unlike the UK one.  It is the most modern plastic licence and that is the best anti-fraud measure possible.  Of course people can still replicate them, but it will be better than the current system.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;3.&mdash;Section 107 (inserted by section 79 of the Act of 2010) of the Principal Act is amended&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>a</i>) by substituting for subsection (1) the following:</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">&ldquo;(1) Where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alleges to a person using a mechanically propelled vehicle that the member suspects that such person has committed a specified offence under this Act, the member may demand of such person his or her name and address and date of birth and may, if such person refuses or fails to give his or her name and address and date of birth or gives a name or address or date of birth which the member has reasonable grounds for believing to be false or misleading, arrest such person without warrant.&rdquo;,</P>

	<P>This is a technical amendment.  At the moment it states: &ldquo;if such person refuses or fails to give his or her name and address or date of birth&rdquo;.  We want to change it to &ldquo;and&rdquo;, lest there be confusion that a person only needs to produce one of those pieces of information rather than all of them.</P>

        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 3</P>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, line 14, after &ldquo;unauthorised&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This amendment deals with the defence that a person&rsquo;s car was stolen at the time or taken without permission.  I am trying to give protection to the Minister and society at large that if a person wanted to use that defence it would help if he or she informed the Garda rather than simply claiming that it must have been stolen at the time.  I am trying to put an onus on the person who uses that defence to report it in order that it is not an after-the-event excuse.</P>
        <P>I realise there would be difficulties.  A person could say he or she was watching television on the night in question and did not know.  There must be a time limit issue.  If the complaint is that a person&rsquo;s car was stolen and used by somebody to commit crimes, I am trying to make it incumbent on the person who seeks to use this defence to inform the Garda.  That is the way it is phrased in the Bill and I am trying to include a protection for it.  However, my senior counsel friend said this would be difficult to do.  I think it is desirable, but I will leave it to the <Col N="469"/>Minister and his advisers to decide whether it is a constraint we would wish to place on the use of the defence, &ldquo;I was not driving the car at the time,&rdquo; to which we should be able to say, &ldquo;You should have told us.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment is to section 3 which states, &ldquo;Where a person is charged with an offence under subsection (2), it is a defence to the charge for him or her to show that the vehicle was being driven on the occasion in question by another person and that such driving was unauthorised.&rdquo;  It is essentially to allow somebody to offer the defence that his or her car had been stolen by somebody else.  My understanding is that what Senator wants to do is to avoid people using this as an excuse by requiring them to report to the Garda that their car has been stolen.  I would like to accept the amendment, but I cannot because it would create another loophole.  If somebody&rsquo;s car was stolen while he or she was away or at work, or even from the garage and the person did not know, he or she would obviously not be able to inform the Garda and even if it was stolen, he or she would have no defence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Minister who has outlined in a reasonable way why the amendment cannot be inserted in the Bill.  If a person was away for the weekend and had come home to find that his or her car had been stolen and that it had later been involved in an accident, he or she would not have reported this fact to the Garda.  It is impractical and would create another loophole.  Therefore, we will be opposing the amendment.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister and Members on the other side of the House for their consideration of my amendment.  Reasonableness applies and Senators have pointed to the circumstances that would apply.  My fear is that this provision will be used as an excuse, but I can see how difficult it is to nail down those whom we want to nail down.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are references in section 3 to driving dangerously defective vehicles and parking vehicles in dangerous positions.  All of us welcome the Bill because if we look around the country during the recession, there is an increasing number of cars with registration plates stretching far back in time.  There was a time between 2000 and 2009 when garages found it difficult to shift cars that were more than two years old.  Everybody wanted to have a new car.  Most of the cars now on the road date back to 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 and the car industry is going through a difficult time.  The Government scrappage scheme gave it a short new burst of life, but it is very flat again and I hope it can recover.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to find the finance, there is a real concern that people may put off having their cars repaired.  For example, there is a noticeable increase in the number of cars with defective lights.  While driving at night, I have seen cars with headlights not correctly aligned, or with only one headlight, and being driven with the lights dimmed.  This seems to suggest that because of financial constraints people are not paying as much attention to improving their cars as they would have done heretofore.  That presents a problem, to which I would love to be able to offer a solution.  The Bill will obviously be rigorously enforced, which I welcome, because no one should drive a defective vehicle that poses a danger to others.  However, is there any thinking in the Government that might provide an incentive?  I know everybody is asking the Minister for an incentive for one thing or another, yet there is no money available.  Perhaps he might reflect on the consequences of the legislation and introduce some incentive to encourage people into garages to have their cars fixed.  I know the NCT obliges them to do so, but that is only after a period of two years and I am not so sure that <Col N="470"/>will address the problem to which I refer.  The incentive I would like to see introduced might also help to create jobs in the motor industry.  I am not sure exactly what incentive the Minister could introduce, but obviously it would have to have a financial base.  Perhaps the greater minds in his Department who will be drawing up budgets line by line to be presented to the Minister for Finance might look at this issue to see if some incentive could be given to help the motor industry, and by extension, reduce the amount of defective vehicles on the road.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support strongly much of what Senator Mooney said.  We have all noticed the poor lights on many vehicles on the road.  As public representatives, it is incumbent on us to highlight the need for people to examine the tyres and lights on their cars, especially as we approach winter.  People tend to cut corners in difficult economic circumstances and this contributes to road traffic accidents.  With all the new technology in motor vehicles, I often wonder why there is nothing to indicate a headlight or a break light is not working.  If the oil level is low, this is indicated, yet in most vehicles there is nothing to indicate that a brake light or headlight is not functioning properly.  Some people are rather careless about having these things checked.  I would like to see us highlighting the issue among our constituents and trying to get the Road Safety Authority to conduct a blitz to inform the public of the dangers posed by poor lighting and tyres.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the vast majority of what the two Senators said, especially the point made by Senator Mullins on conducting a road safety campaign to highlight the need for good visibility and tyres in wintertime.  However, I am not sure about Senator Mooney&rsquo;s point on providing an incentive to get people into garages.  Car owners have a duty of care to themselves and other road users and we cannot give them grants to have bulbs changed and so on.  That would be impractical.  If there is a defective light, it is up to the car owner to do something about it.  It is up to the Minister for Transport or Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enforces the law by stopping vehicles and thoroughly checking their lights.  I am aware that every two years, before the national car test is due, drivers bring their car to a garage and have it serviced, which will often include having bulbs fixed or replaced.  The question, however, is whether they continue to take an interest by asking a neighbour, for instance, whether their brake lights are working.  One will know if one&rsquo;s headlights are not working properly because visibility will be poor.  Motorists must fulfil their duty of care to other road users by ensuring their vehicles are not defective.  This message should be included in the advertising campaign advocated by Senator Mullins for the winter months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the Minister responds, I wish to clarify a matter.  What I had in mind when I spoke earlier was the possibility of reducing the VAT rate on motor repairs in much the same way as was done for the restaurant industry when it was incentivised by a reduction in VAT.  I am aware that Governments and civil servants in the Department of Finance traditionally abhor the prospect of any reduction in revenue.  As anyone involved in business will know and experience will also show, however, where reductions in VAT are implemented, as in the case of restaurants recently, more income is generated because the reductions incentivise people to spend more and result in lower costs.  The costs of motor repairs should be reduced.  I am almost certain the top rate of VAT is applied to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>If one buys a bulb, a VAT rate of 21% is applied, whereas if one has a bulb fitted by a garage, the VAT rate applied is 13.5%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Very good, but I understand labour is charged at the higher rate.  I am thinking of something that may not necessarily adversely impact on the Exchequer. <Col N="471"/> Senator O&rsquo;Neill is correct that it is incumbent on everyone who has a car to have bulbs replaced.  I am trying to show that people are cutting corners.  I fully concur with Senator Mullins that it would be as cheap and effective if the National Roads Authority, through the good offices of the Minister, were to have an advertising campaign as we approach the winter.  Many years ago, going back as far as my childhood, commercial television stations in the United Kingdom showed such advertisements but I see them less frequently.  Once the Bill is enacted, the Garda will correctly use its resources to enforce the legislation owing to the potentially fatal impact of people driving defective vehicles.  I suggest, however, that there may be a way of encouraging people to discharge their responsibilities, as Senator O&rsquo;Neill stated, while assisting the motor industry to create jobs.  I wish I could offer simple solutions because I know it is easy to raise problems but it is important to raise this matter in the context of the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senators&rsquo; points are well made.  It is envisaged that the Road Safety Authority will run a winter awareness campaign in the next few weeks.  Having ordered 150,000 tonnes of salt or 50% more than was available to us last year, we can be sure that the winter will be very warm and I will receive terrible abuse for spending millions of euro on salt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for imparting that information as I recently asked a question on the Order of Business about the quantity of salt available.</P>

	<P>Sometimes debates such as this elicit information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>If we do not need it all this winter, we will find an alternative use for it.  Older cars are definitely more dangerous than newer cars.  While I do not have precise statistics, I understand cars that are more than ten years old are twice as likely to be in an accident as cars that are less than ten years old.  I do not know whether the reason is that older cars are more likely to be defective or that modern cars have become safer.  In fairness to the previous Government, it took two measures to address this issue.  First, it introduced the scrappage scheme, about which I had doubts, which provided an incentive to change cars that were more than ten years old.  Many people availed of the scheme.  Second, it required that all cars older than ten years have an NCT done every year.  The latter measure was controversial and I received many representations complaining about it from individuals, Deputies and Senators.  It is being done for good reason, however, because cars of that age are more likely to be involved in accidents.  The measures introduced by the previous Government were correct.  I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Neill that individuals are ultimately responsible for maintaining their car and ensuring it operates within the law.</P>
        <P>As to what additional measures could be taken, many objections were raised when the scrappage scheme was introduced, with many people arguing that, notwithstanding the fact that it supported jobs in the retail motor sector, its real beneficiaries were those who needed the benefits least, namely, workers in Germany and other countries to which the money from car purchases flowed.  An alternative proposal made at that time was to introduce some form of tax write-off or discount for those having improvements or repairs done to their cars.  While this proposal may be worthy of consideration, it is a matter for the Minister for Finance rather than me.  None the less, I believe there may be merit in introducing such a measure rather than another scrappage scheme.</P>

        <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 7, lines 34 and 35, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;under&rdquo; in line 34 down to and including &ldquo;breath&rdquo; in line 35 and substitute the following:</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I must admit that the purpose of the amendment is to correct an error we spotted in the text.  Section 5 deals with the failure or refusal of a driver to produce a licence when a requirement is made to provide a breath specimen under sections 9 and 10 of the Road Traffic Act.  Essentially, one is required to produce one&rsquo;s driving licence if one is breath-tested under sections 9 and 10.  The issue relates to being a specified driver, that is, a novice, learner or professional driver, if one does not provide a licence after a breath test.  There is no requirement to provide a licence if one is arrested or taken to hospital first.  The purpose of the amendment is to extend the provision to ensure that if a person who is breath-tested is taken to hospital or arrested, he or she must provide a driver&rsquo;s licence.  If he or she fails to do so, it is assumed that he or she is a novice, learner or professional driver until he or she shows otherwise.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Minister for an assurance that the legislation does not contain legal loopholes which astute lawyers may exploit.  Drink driving cases have frequently been thrown out by courts on technicalities.  I appreciate that the Minister will not know definitively whether this is the case until the legislation is tested and can only do as much as he can on the basis of the legal advice made available to him.  This is a key area, however, and people are increasingly taking a zero tolerance approach to drink driving offences.  Daniel O&rsquo;Connell once famously declared with regard to legislation going through the British Parliament that one could drive a coach and four through it.  While I am not suggesting that is the case in respect of this Bill, there is no doubt lawyers will pore over this legislation because their clients will seek to avoid a drink driving conviction.  I raise this question in light of the likelihood and experience to date.  Particular sections of almost every Road Traffic Act have been challenged in the courts.  In some cases a judge has effectively thrown out cases and one then finds that several dozen other people are affected by the judgment because the initial case was a test case.  I raise the issue purely in that context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>Road traffic legislation is one of the most heavily litigated areas of the law and that is precisely why we must be so careful about it.  I would love to give the Senator that assurance but cannot.  It is the job of my officials, of me as Minister, and of Members of both Houses to ensure there are no loopholes.  Those are the four locks and one hopes they all work.  Unfortunately, there will be loopholes.  The point is pertinent, however, because the following amendment closes a loophole that has arisen in recent times.</P>

        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) in case the person is a specified person, 20 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.&rdquo;.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  The Minister is very welcome.  The Road Traffic (No. 2) Bill allows for mandatory breath testing at the new limits, which will be introduced next month.  It reduces the legal blood alcohol limit from 80 mg per 100 ml to 50 mg per 100 ml.  The current limit is the highest in Europe and is found only in Ireland and the UK.  My amendment seeks to resolve the unnecessary discrepancy between the 20 mg limit envisaged for learner and professional drivers and the 50 mg limit envisaged for all other drivers who hold a full licence.</P>
        <P>I refer to a zero limit for all road users, as adopted in a number of countries.  Some commentators have voiced what I believe to be legitimate fears, namely, that a zero limit would risk criminalising those whose driving is not impaired and that it would, in effect, criminalise those with small amounts of alcohol in their system perhaps because they had a couple of drinks the night before or have used alcohol in cooking.  Surely the answer to that difficulty would be to introduce the lowest possible limit above zero for all drivers, a level that avoids the problem of being an absolute zero limit but which would effectively act as a zero limit?  That is the reason for my amendment.  It seeks to apply the 20 mg limit to all drivers regardless of the type of licence held or the length of driving experience of the driver.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Those who drive professionally, such as truck drivers or learner drivers, will be subject under the Bill to what is virtually a zero limit of 20 mg per 100 ml of blood.  There is good international evidence to support such a limit.  When Sweden, for example, lowered its limit in 1990 to 20 mg, fatal alcohol related accidents were reduced by 10%.  I understand similar reductions occurred with similar beneficial effects in Austria, Belgium and France.  Drivers who currently drive just below the legally permitted maximum level are estimated to be two to three times as likely to be involved in an accident as drivers with a zero blood alcohol limit.  Dr. Denis Cusack of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety has stated in the media that the only way people can guarantee not being over the new lower limit is not to drink and drive.  That is the kind of clear message this Bill should send rather than the mixed message I believe it does in suggesting there are two classes of drivers who are allowed to take in differing amounts of alcohol.  I do not suggest that is the reality as proposed.  If we are to send a message today which would support such campaigns as those of the Road Safety Authority, we should provide that people should not drink any quantity of alcohol and attempt to drive.  We would not simply introduce a small reduction from the current level.</P><Col N="474"/>
        <P>I return to the distinction between learner and fully qualified drivers regarding the quantity of alcohol that may be consumed.  The Minister envisages that learner drivers and professional drivers would be liable for prosecution if found with a level of 20 mg, whereas drivers with a full licence for over two years are liable at a higher level.  There is no rational basis for such a dichotomy.  If we assume that a level of 20 mg above the level of absolute zero is necessary to avoid a scenario which may arise if an individual has consumed alcohol the previous day and may have residual alcohol in his or her bloodstream, there is a sound basis for having a 20 mg limit.  The increase of the limit from 20 mg to 50 mg for full licence holders is puzzling when we consider that the imperative of the Bill is to make roads safer for users by ensuring all drivers have the lowest possible quantity of alcohol in their systems.  I do not understand why a quantity of 20 mg in blood is considered as the safe limit for one class of driver and an additional 30 mg is allowed for another class of driver because up to 50 mg is considered safe.  On what basis is the higher limit permissible?  Is it the case that we think a driver of greater experience should be regarded as being better able to handle more alcohol in his or her system?  There is an oversight here which has confused the issue regarding the quantity of alcohol one may consume.  The message that should go out is that drivers should consume no alcohol.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I point to surveys that were undertaken in 2010 by the Royal College of Nursing in the United Kingdom.  These are surveys of the general public which reveal widespread confusion about what constitutes a measure of alcohol.  Most individuals are accustomed to taking alcohol in measures that are traditionally understood, for example, a pint, a half pint or a glass.  It is not clear to many what quantity of alcohol it is permissible to imbibe before one is over the limit to drive.  The distinction in the Bill between two quantities of alcohol for two classes of driver makes things worse and introduces a totally unnecessary element of confusion.  This Bill still sends a message that a quantity of alcohol is permissible before driving, which is wholly wrong.  It runs contrary to the good work of the Road Safety Authority as well as to the good intentions of the Minister.  It runs contrary to all our efforts to impress on people the danger of taking any alcohol and driving.</P>
        <P>I refer again to the findings of the Royal College of Nursing survey which found that an estimated 80 road deaths per year are caused by drivers who are under the current drink driving limit.  Studies show that even a small amount of alcohol results in slower reactions, longer stopping distances, a reduced field of vision and poor judgment of speed and distance in drivers.  Furthermore, drivers are more likely to take risks and to believe, mistakenly, that they are in control.  Once again this raises the problem of individuals, full licence holders, who as currently envisaged in the legislation may be under the limit of 50 mg but are above the lower 20 mg limit.  I pointed out that this 30 mg of difference would still allow a series of negative effects on the drivers&rsquo; reaction time, concentration and judgment.</P>
        <P>The central question to be resolved is how a learner driver can go through the two year period envisaged by the Act at a 20 mg limit and suddenly rise to a 50 mg limit.  Is it not the case that if there is a separate limit for young drivers, it could send out the message that once one gets through those two years one is then allowed to drink and drive, when the message we should give is that drinking and driving do not mix, whatever the age or experience involved?</P>
        <P>A number of issues tend to be introduced when we talk about permitted drink driving limits and people having alcohol in their system.  We must acknowledge there are serious vested interests involved &mdash; vintners, drink manufacturers, some politicians and perhaps even some members of the Judiciary.  At times, and on issues such as this, vested interests seek to bring up extraneous issues.  We will hear, for example, that people will lose jobs because they will lose their licence and a conviction of this kind is very serious.  We must note, however, there has been change in this regard.  Penalties are proportionate and loss of licence does not happen <Col N="475"/>at the lower level.  We hear arguments made about rural Ireland, from where I, too, come.  People talk about the impact of the recession, pubs closing, lifestyle changes and the smoking ban.  All sorts of issues are introduced.  Again, however, we cannot make the argument that we ought to contemplate a greater risk to people, or even the possibility of some individuals dying, simply to keep pubs open.  There is an argument in respect of the common good which must prevail.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An argument is also put forward to the effect that it is fine to drive when one has two or three pints on board or that the nanny state approach of using a mallet to crack a nut is being employed.  It is obvious that it is not only those who are well above the drink driving limit who are involved in fatal collisions.  The evidence shows that people who have consumed low amounts of alcohol can also be involved in such collisions.  We must be aware of the big picture and view this issue in the context of the common good.  I accept that there is a need to strike the correct balance between certain conflicting or opposing forces or arguments.  I refer to individual freedom and rights in a democratic republic on the one hand and our responsibility to ourselves and our fellow citizens on the other.  It is precisely because we are involved in trying to reconcile conflicting rights and aspirations that we must procure evidence-based research in respect of these issues.  There is such evidence and it is compelling and supports the argument that there should be zero tolerance.  The latter is what I am proposing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The actions taken on foot of the road safety strategy during the past five years have succeeded in reducing the number of fatalities dramatically.  It should be remembered that for every fatality, there are between seven and ten serious injuries.  Such injuries can give rise to the need for overnight hospital stays at the very least.  There are issues which arise in respect of definitions, especially in the context of the point at which an injury is classed as serious.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Seanad should not send the message that its objective is to dumb down the issues.  There are serious issues which underlie policy change and consideration must be given to a range of matters in that regard.  In outlining my thinking on this amendment, I have been obliged to explain such matters.  That is perfectly legitimate.  To the best of my knowledge, I have not repeated myself &mdash; I have sought, to the best of my ability, not to do so &mdash; but have, rather, raised a number of points in support of my point.  We will be sending the wrong message if we try to dumb down this issue, mock people or in some way cast doubt upon someone who is presenting a careful and considered case in respect of a particular amendment.  I am unapologetic, therefore, in asking for the Chair&rsquo;s indulgence for another couple of minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should carry on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As stated, when considering these issues we must not just think in terms of deaths, we must also consider the position regarding serious injuries, particularly as the figures relating to the latter are quite high.  The reduction in the numbers of fatalities is taking place against the background of an increase in both the number of vehicles using the roads and the number of young drivers.  We can state, therefore, that the strategy is positive, that it has been working and that we should support it not only with strong laws but also with serious enforcement of such laws.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Essentially, those are the points I wish to make and my colleagues will be glad to hear that my contribution is almost at an end.  We should not send out a mixed message but we will do so as long as there are two different drink driving limits in place.  Zero tolerance is the way to proceed.  There must be some permitted minimum to avoid the undesirable scenarios to which I referred, namely, consumption of alcohol on the day prior to being tested, consumption through the use of alcohol in cooking or whatever.  We must certainly avoid sending a mixed message to younger people, especially if they form the view that there is some kind of higher permitted drink driving limit to which they may aspire after a couple of years. This sends all the wrong signals.  The issue of the identifiable measurability of permitted drink intake also comes into play.  As matters stand, we have been presented with a recipe for unnecessary confusion and this could give rise to unfortunate consequences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Mullen for tabling the amendment.  The message is very clear &mdash; people should not drink and drive.  That will always be the message we will put forward to the public.  It is important to note that the law has always allowed for graduated penalties and still does so.  If a person is found to have between 80 ml and 100 ml of alcohol in his or her blood, he or she is banned for from driving for 12 months.  If he or she has between 100 ml and 150 ml in his or her blood, the ban is two years.  For people who are found to have more than 150 ml of alcohol in their blood, the ban is three years.  Graduated penalties are nothing new and they have been in place for quite some time.  We are applying the lower limit of 20 ml to novice, learner and professional drivers because those in the first two categories have the least experience and are more likely to be involved in accidents and because people in the third category drive more than others and are also at high risk of being in accidents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have some sympathy for the case the Senator makes.  This matter first arose in the context of the debate on the 2010 legislation.  I understand it was the intention of the previous Government to reduce the limit to 20 ml at that stage.  A decision was taken to put in place a limit of 50 ml, however, and also to have a special limit of 20 ml for certain specified drivers.  That matter was the subject of a lengthy debate in the context of the legislation to which I refer.  I <Col N="477"/>do not especially wish to reopen that debate in respect of this Bill.  In a few years the limit will be reduced to 20 ml for all drivers.</P>
        <P>There is another reason I cannot accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment and that is, unfortunately, because it is defective.  The amendment states:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) In section 4 substituting the following for subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>):</P>
        <P LI="3">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) 20 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, or</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) in case the person is a specified person, 20 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.&rdquo;,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) In section 5 substituting the following for subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>):</P>
        <P LI="3">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) 20 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, or</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) in case the person is a specified person, 20 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.&rdquo;.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">If Senators do not want to send mixed messages, then they should not vote for the amendment because if it were passed the limit would be 20 ml for blood but 50 ml and 20 ml for urine and breath.  This means that if a person gives a blood sample, there will be one alcohol limit, whereas there will be different limits in respect of urine or breath samples.  If the House really wants to send a mixed message, then Senators should vote for the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his reply.  The final point he made was his strongest.  I acknowledge what he said in that regard.  What would normally happen in a situation such as this &mdash; even when amendments are drafted perfectly &mdash; is that a Minister would ask that the amendment be withdrawn and that he or she would reflect on the matter and return to it on Report Stage.  That is really the logic of what the Minister said.  He reminded me of St. Augustine while he was speaking and his position could be summed up by use of the phrase &ldquo;Lord make me pure but not yet&rdquo;.  It is clear that the Minister is in perfect harmony with the intention behind my amendment and I do not believe he has given a good reason for not introducing the necessary change.  He indicated his sympathy but stated that he inherited a situation which he is going to allow to stand and that he is not willing to take the major step which, deep down, he believes should be taken.  In that context, it is not acceptable to argue that a technical deficiency in the drafting of the amendment prevents its acceptance.  I would be happy to withdraw the amendment if the Minister indicated his willingness to bring forward a corrected version on Report Stage.  For that reason, perhaps we should not take all Stages of the Bill today.  After all, the thrust of what the Minister said is that I am right.</P>
        <P>The Minister is quite correct with regard to graduated penalties.  He made a mistake, however, because there is a need to distinguish between penalties and offences.  The amendment relates to something being an offence and, as such, it does not refer to the penalties.  One can put in place all the graduated penalties one wishes but that is a different matter to deciding whether something should be an offence.  That is a distinction which the Minister ought to acknowledge.  It is certainly the case that it could be appropriate to have graduated penalties.  It is a different issue.  A penalty is a consequence of committing an offence but I am talking about what should or should not be an offence.  We ought to make that distinction.</P>
        <P>Given that I have spoken for the past couple of minutes I hope the Minister will have a massive change of heart.  I hope the good Senator acting for the Leader will now ask for a change to the Order of Business and we will not take Report Stage today.  Perhaps my na&iuml;vet&eacute; is showing.</P>

There are a few points to support the Minister, who is not sending mixed messages in the legislation to professional or young drivers.  As people gain experience, they become better at what they do.  We can see how much better Senator Mullen was after two years in this House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>After two years a young person will have learned a bit more about driving.  Senator Mullen&rsquo;s amendment should not be put to the House because it is too draconian.  We live in a rural country and although the Senator said he was from rural Ireland, he does not live there.  Some 64% of the population in this country live in rural areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All research has shown that one drink will put a person over the 50 milligram limit; therefore, there is effectively zero tolerance.  The system is graduated and a person will be given three penalty points and fined &euro;200 if he or she is caught over the limit.  That person will be put off the road for a second offence.  There is a small bit of leeway but this still affects those in rural Ireland.  This Christmas, every trifle that a mammy makes in the country will have alcohol in it.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no mixed messages.  The Minister&rsquo;s Bill equates to zero tolerance as all research has shown that one drink will put a person over the limit and facing the graduated penalties of three penalty points and a fine of &euro;200, with stiffer penalties if the blood alcohol level is above 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  I ask people in the House to vote against the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Minister&rsquo;s position.  There are two limits, with one for a standard driver and another for the learner and professional.  That is logical and reasonable so I accept there should be a graduation in that respect.  The Minister made the most salient point of the day and the Senator would admit that his amendment cannot stand because it would be reckless.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We know the 2010 Bill was difficult for the Government at the time and it had to face down serious lobbies.  It came up with a reasonable solution.  Half my water glass filled with beer would put a person over the limit.  Senator Mullen envisages a position where a person could be put over the limit with a particularly strong aftershave or using a mouthwash.  One could go <Col N="479"/>to a ridiculous extent.  The Minister has said we effectively have zero tolerance and we will be counting angels on the top of pins if we go down the road suggested by Senator Mullen in his amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mullen is correct that it is important to make a distinction between graduated penalties and graduated offences.  I accept that.  The limit will go to 50 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood for most drivers and that is a low limit.  As Senator O&rsquo;Neill noted, it will probably be less than a pint of beer, depending on the size of the person in question and other factors.  The evidence is that impairment kicks in around those levels, although any amount of alcohol will cause some impairment.</P>
        <P>When these lower limits were introduced in some of the states of Australia, there was a 10% reduction in deaths.  I hope we will be ready to go with these for the bank holiday weekend and the instruments will be calibrated for that reason.  I am not closed to the possibility that at a later stage, after we see how the limit operates, we can consider a limit of 20 mg for all drivers.</P>

        <P>Government amendment No. 7:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 12, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) in section 12(1), by inserting &ldquo;or hospital&rdquo; after &ldquo;at a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na station&rdquo;,&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Section 8 contains a number of technical amendments to the Road Traffic Act 2010.  This amendment relates to section 12 of the 2010 Act, which deals with the obligations on drivers to provide breath, blood or urine specimens following arrest at a Garda station.  The amendment extends the provision in order that a driver, following arrest, can be required to provide a specimen at a hospital if a position arises where a driver must be transferred to hospital before the requirement to provide a specimen can be made of him or her at the Garda station.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This arises from a loophole arising in recent months.  Essentially, if somebody has been arrested, the sample can only be taken at a Garda station and not at a hospital.  As it stands, if a person is involved in a collision the sample can be taken at a hospital or Garda station but if a person is arrested, the sample can only be taken at a Garda station.  A person who has been arrested may claim to be having a heart attack, stroke or some kind of health event before being taken to hospital.  Currently, that person could not have a sample taken and this will correct the anomaly.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised this matter on Second Stage.  The Bill allows for a garda to enter a hospital without a search warrant in order to take a sample from somebody admitted to hospital.  I understand this can only be taken if the medical authorities allow it and judge that it would not be injurious to an individual&rsquo;s health.  What implications will that have for medical practitioners such as junior doctors and others in accident and emergency departments?  Has there been a level of consultation with the medical profession in this regard?  What protections are envisaged for doctors and nurses who allow for a sample to be taken and where the patient has a sudden deterioration in health or even dies?  This is a significant question that was not really addressed on Second Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>If a doctor believes it would be prejudicial or injurious to the health of a patient, that doctor can direct that a sample not be taken.  Having worked in accident and emergency departments for a number of years, my practical experience is that any patient who <Col N="480"/>is seriously ill and requiring emergency treatment will have an intravenous line inserted either as a first or second step.  It would be sent for analysis.  Currently that blood sample cannot be used for testing because the examination must be done by a doctor using the chain of evidence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It would rarely be the case in a hospital setting that taking a blood sample from somebody would injure or damage health.  The only scenario where it might arise is when a person is having a cardiac or respiratory arrest and needs to be intubated or shocked.  The last thing one would want in that case is somebody taking a blood sample but there is no reason that half an hour or an hour later the sample could not be taken. However, it is important to point out that even if a sample is taken by a patient when he or she is in hospital or unconscious, it cannot be tested and used against him or her unless he or she consents to it.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for that information.  I am still not entirely happy about the position.  The last thing a genuinely ill patient in hospital, and that scenario in itself is traumatic, would want is to have invasive treatment on foot of the law of the land pursuing the person into the hospital.  Such a patient is in a very vulnerable position.  In addition, the doctor -  in many cases it will be junior doctors or nurses - may be forced into deciding that a sample can be given by a patient, who it could retrospectively be proved was not fit to have such invasive treatment at that time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>On the points raised by Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan, I know he has the interest of an injured person at heart but the medical profession in this country have the expertise, and the Minister&rsquo;s knowledge of the subject should be noted.  A doctor will not allow a person to have a blood sample taken if that may pose a danger to the person.  Some people involved in road accidents have feigned injury and appeared to faint and have been brought in an ambulance and no sample can be taken from them.  This provision is to close that loophole.  I support the Minister on this amendment.</P>

        <P>Government amendment No. 8:</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This amendment relates to section 29 of the 2010 Act which deals with the fixed penalty notice for drink driving.  Subsection (8) sets out the penalties and disqualifications in regard to certain limits.  However, the blood limits are the only limits set out in the subsection.  As a result, this amendment proposes to include the equivalent information in respect of breath and urine limits.  The amendment also makes a minor correction to a reference in subsection (11)(<i>b</i>).</P>
        <P Just="Left">A new subsection (18A) is being inserted to bring consistency to the legislation, as in all other provisions dealing with the fixed charge notices.  This amendment provides that the delivery docket or receipt by An Post or another postal provider is admissible as evidence as proof of postage in respect to a fixed penalty notice.  Essentially, this Government amendment does two things.  First, it corrects the mistake Senator Mullen almost made with there being mention in this section of blood only, not of urine and breath.  It corrects that error.  It allows for a delivery docket or receipt by An Post or another postal provider to be proof of postage in the case of a fixed penalty notice &mdash; in the case of a fine, not a summons.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>If I heard the Minister correctly, he indicated, based on his experience as a medical doctor in an accident and emergency department, that one of the first medical procedures carried out on an injured person is that a blood sample is taken.  He said that under existing law such a blood sample cannot be used and that he is amending the Act to change that.  Does that suggest that two blood samples would be taken, that one would be taken for internal medical use to treat the patient and, subsequent to that, a further blood sample would be taken?  I am thinking of a timeline where a garda would arrive subsequent to triage and treatment being administered.  Is there any suggestion or inference that two blood samples may be taken from the person?</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it, and I may not be 100% correct on this, when a person is brought to an accident and emergency department and that person is a genuine major emergency, first he or she will probably be given oxygen and, second, he or she will have an IV line inserted in a vein in order that the person can be given fluids.  However, before he or she is given fluids samples are drawn to be sent to the laboratory immediately to establish what is wrong with the person.</P><Col N="482"/>
        <P Just="Left">As I understand it, those samples are not used and cannot be used to test for alcohol and drugs &mdash; although they are often used to test for alcohol and drugs &mdash; as evidence against a person.  The sample that is used as evidence in court must be taken subsequently and put into a little white pot with red tape around it.  I am not 100% certain on that point.  I understand that in the UK that is not the case.  There the samples taken by doctors can be used in court but again the patient has to consent to this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Although not to labour the point as we are late in the day in our consideration of the Bill, would it not have been wiser to have legislated for making it possible to use the first medical sample that would have been taken, which would have been taken in a proper medical and non-confrontational way without any legal pressure on the patient?  That will have to be addressed sooner rather than later.</P>

	<P>I will not repeat what I said during this debate or the debate earlier in the week.  The House has done very good work today.  Road safety has been one of the big success stories of the past ten years with road deaths falling from more than 400 deaths a year ten years ago to, hopefully, fewer than 200 this year.  That has happened for a number of reasons, one being a crackdown on drink driving in particular.  The work that has been done by the House this week will allow us, hopefully in the next few weeks, either at the October bank holiday or a little later, to implement these new limits and breath tests, and based on what has occurred in other counties, to reduce the number of fatal collisions by, perhaps, 10%.  We could potentially today, having done this work, save 15 or 20 lives next year and every year thereafter.  I thank Senators for their co-operation in doing that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his attendance and compliment him on his handling of this Bill.  I also thank his officials.  The Minister was gracious enough to indicate on Second Stage that the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government was positive and proactive on road safety measures and some colleagues on the other side of the House were gracious enough to concur with that.  The Bill was in gestation during a very difficult time when there has been a good deal of pressure on people.  We have come to the end of the road now, pardon the pun, which I welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like to be associated with the remarks made by Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan.  I thank the Minister and his officials for coming to the House.  Road traffic legislation can be an emotive issue, especially in regard to some of the sections that we had to pass.  I thank all the Senators for their contributions.  The Bill will increase awareness among people of the danger of drink driving.  It sends out a strong message from this House and from all Members of the Oireachtas that drink driving will not be tolerated.  The Bill will help to protect the people.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="483"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the Members of the House in thanking the Minister.  This is a major issue.  In the period prior to our being given the number of road deaths, I believe 600 people used to be killed on our roads in the decade before that.  It is a success story to reduce the number of road deaths below 200.  That is an achievement by everybody concerned.  As Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan said, there were lobbies that fought this and I am glad they were resisted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The lifespan of the current road safety strategy that covered the time of the former Ministers, Martin Cullen and Noel Dempsey, ends in 2012.  It has been a huge success.  We have many other elements to consider when we come to tackle this problem and draw up the next one.  I thank the Minister for speaking of his experience in accident and emergency departments and should he wish to return to the House as he prepares the next strategy for the next shot at this problem, he will be most welcome.</P>
        <P>I would like to examine other issues, including the problem in regard to cross-Border driving in counties Donegal and Cavan, which was mentioned on Second Stage.     Men under 35 years of age are still a major casualty group.  What can be said about that?  There is also the lack of seatbelt use.  Could speed cameras tell us if mobile phones are being used?  People using mobile phones are a major source of complaint and our sanctions for that have not been a success.  However, that is all for the next strategy after 2012.  I welcome what the Minister has done here today.  He is aware of the co-operation he will receive from the House and he will be very welcome on the next occasion.</P>
        <P>Ireland has the second or third lowest accident rate in the OECD countries.  That is a huge success for all the people involved, despite the strange lobbying I used to encounter on the National Economic and Social Council where there was strong opposition from rural groups.  There is more in rural Ireland than rural publicans but they certainly raised a lobby.  Any activity that requires the deaths of so many people must be closely regulated.  I commend the Minister for all his initiatives in that regard.</P>

  <Sect LHead="Hospital" RHead="Services"> 
    <sTitle>Hospital Services</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this Adjournment matter.  The Minister for Health recently confirmed that there will be a reduction in the opening hours of the minor injuries unit in Monaghan General Hospital to an eight hour, five day service to take effect from 1 November.  Essentially, minor injuries will only be dealt with in Monaghan during business hours.  Who knew that medical injuries had business hours and could be dealt with in that way?  The reduction in hours for the minor injuries unit is a serious and life-threatening matter and it could be dealt with by the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government if there was a strong political will to do so.</P><Col N="484"/>
        <P Just="Left">The stripping of services from Monaghan General Hospital will have a massive knock-on effect on Cavan General Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  These hospitals are already unable to cope with the demands currently made on them.  Every day we hear about hospital overcrowding, with patients on trolleys, chairs and even on the floors of hospitals throughout the State.  In addition to these service cuts and the centralisation of services at Cavan and Drogheda, there are ongoing cuts in health spending and the embargo on recruitment in the health services.  Front-line staff in Cavan, like those in Monaghan, Drogheda and Dundalk, are doing their best in the face of insufficient resources and, indeed, poor planning by the HSE and the last Government.  Does the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, support his party&rsquo;s local councillors and some of his party&rsquo;s Deputies in the north-east region of Cavan, Monaghan and Louth who have opposed the transformation agenda?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The decision to reduce this unit&rsquo;s hours is more about saving money for the Government than about patient care and safety.  We are told the annual savings from the reduction will be approximately &euro;400,000.  What about the people who cannot travel to other hospitals outside these hours, the people who are living on the breadline and struggling to survive?  What about those who have a minor injury but who cannot arrange a lift to a hospital further away in Cavan and Louth?  The roads linking Cavan, Monaghan and Louth are not exactly the best.  What about the overcrowded accident and emergency departments where seriously ill people are already waiting for hours to be seen?  Is it prudent to reduce the hours of the minor injuries unit?  It means that outside these hours other hospital services will be flooded with minor injuries that could have been dealt with in a more timely and efficient manner.</P>
        <P>We should consider how the axe fell in this case.  The current Minister for Health promised the people of Monaghan before the election that there would not be a reduction in hours.  Post-election, however, the axe was sharpened and the services in Monaghan General Hospital have been hatcheted once more.  In a reply to a parliamentary question from my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, the Minister said: &ldquo;Underlying the health service is the principle that the patient should be treated at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as near to home as possible.&rdquo;  Now, however, the Minister is presiding over a reduction in hours for the most basic and closest services for the people of Monaghan.</P>
        <P>Has any consideration been given to the knock-on effects and to the effects of reducing the hours of a service for the lowest level of complexity at Monaghan General Hospital?  Will the Minister make a commitment to revisit the failed hospital configuration in the north east, specifically as it affects Monaghan General Hospital, while recognising the knock-on effects on Cavan General Hospital and the impact of the loss of services at both Louth County Hospital and Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Navan?</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, and I thank the Senator for raising it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In view of the current budgetary and financial position the efficiency of services is being reviewed by the HSE.  The Minister has emphasised to the HSE that budgetary compliance must be maintained alongside the delivery of service levels set out in the national service plan.  In this regard the minor injury unit in Monaghan General Hospital was analysed by the HSE in terms of risk assessment, patient activity levels, staff resources, service impact and service unit cost.  The review was undertaken in the context of addressing levels of agency and overtime costs in the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group.</P>        <P>The minor injury unit in Monaghan opened in July 2009 and currently provides a service seven days a week from 9 a.m. to 9.30 p.m., with two nursing staff and a registrar in emergency <Col N="485"/>medicine rostered on duty during these hours.  Based on statistics for the first six months of the year, the unit sees, on average, 23 patients a day, six of whom are repeat patients.  On average, seven patients a day attend the unit after 5 p.m.  In the light of this analysis, the HSE has decided to change the opening times to 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, and expects the revised hours to take effect from 1 November.  This change is the direct result of the current budgetary and financial position facing the health system.  While the HSE has reviewed other possible options to save money or increase revenue, it has concluded that they would not generate sufficient savings in the short term.  It has estimated that full year savings of almost &euro;400,000 would be generated with the alteration of opening hours.  The change to the unit in Monaghan is to be viewed as a temporary measure and will be reviewed in 2012 in the light of budgetary considerations and patient activity levels at the unit in the future.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health has emphasised to the HSE the need to ensure the impact of such changes on patients is minimised and that all changes are fully communicated.  The HSE has advised the Minister that patients attending the unit after 5 p.m. are mostly review patients who are recalled to the service and can be easily accommodated with minimal inconvenience within the changed opening times.  The Minister has also been informed that the internal communications to date in Monaghan hospital have included a series of meetings with key staff and their union representatives and that agreement has been reached on a number of staff redeployments to specific areas of choice.</P>
        <P>An external communication plan for members of the public, local GPs, public representatives, media and key stakeholders is being finalised.  Part of the plan will be a public awareness campaign to minimise the impact of the service change on patients.  All decisions on the alteration of patient services are carried out by the HSE in the interests of patient safety and kept under regular review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>When in 2012 will the review of this temporary measure be carried out?  There is a danger that the opening times will be further restricted.  Will an analysis be conducted of the patients who had to attend hospitals in Cavan, Dundalk and Drogheda outside the unit&rsquo;s opening hours?  If we are examining activity levels of patients who need minor injury care outside the unit&rsquo;s opening hours, it is important to determine how many had to travel elsewhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE will keep the matter under review.  The decision will be formally reviewed early next year once the new arrangements have been in place for some time to determine their impact on services for patients.  The majority of patients present within the proposed new opening hours and arrangements are being made to ensure repeat visits take place within these hours or are accommodated elsewhere where this is not possible.  The review will examine the impact of the decision and the difficulties which have arisen.  These issues will be addressed by the HSE.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I urge the Government to provide the same level of funding for the City of Dublin Youth Service Board as it has done heretofore in order that it can continue to support the Sphere 17 Regional Youth Service.  The project is based in Darndale and covers the entire area of Dublin 17, including Priorswood and Coolock, which as the Minister of State will be aware, is one of the most socially disadvantaged areas of the country.</P>
        <P>The Sphere 17 Regional Youth Service is doing fantastic work with young people in the area.  It deals with children from the age of ten years to the time they become young adults at the age of 21 and has been getting great results.  The new building constructed for it several <Col N="486"/>years ago contains excellent facilities and it has top quality staff and volunteers from the community, including individuals who benefited from the project and now want to give something back.  It is keeping children out of trouble and helping to increase their self-respect by offering a level of support they may not receive at home.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Youth projects such as the Sphere 17 Regional Youth Service play an important role in tackling problems such as social exclusion, mental health, youth suicide - one of the biggest problems the country faces, drug abuse and teen pregnancies.  It would be short-sighted to cut funding for the project in question if it meant it could no longer reach these children.  Earlier this week I joined other public representatives in attending a meeting to discuss the impact even a small cut would have on the project&rsquo;s services.  It has already pared back its activities to the limit and any further cuts would have a severely negative impact on young people in Darndale, Coolock and Priorswood.</P>
        <P>Has the funding level for next year for the City of Dublin Youth Service Board which, in turn, funds the Sphere 17 Regional Youth Service, been determined?  This issue has generated a degree of confusion locally.  The service has heard that the board knows how much it will receive in 2012, but project staff have not yet been informed.  I am sure the Minister of State will appreciate the level of stress caused by the inability to decide staffing and programmes for next year.  I am aware of the pressure under which the Government must operate and acknowledge the need to make cuts in the coming budget, but, from a long-term point of view, this is not the area to target because the children in question only have one chance.  It would be crazy to take it away from them now when we can prevent them from getting into trouble because we would otherwise have to spend multiple amounts to deal with the social costs that ensue for the children, their families and communities.  I urge the Minister of State to prevent this from happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  I welcome the opportunity to address the issue and thank the Senator for raising it.</P>
        <P>The Minister is conscious of the great benefits that can accrue to young people and society as a whole from involvement in youth work.  She is also aware this recognition requires appropriate support.  Through the youth affairs unit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, work is ongoing with the national youth work advisory committee which includes representatives of the National Youth Council of Ireland, the Irish Vocational Education Association and other Departments and interested parties to support youth work policy development and activities.  Support is provided by way of financial and other assistance.</P>
        <P>Youth work programmes and services are delivered to over 1.2 million participants in the various programmes by some 1,100 youth work staff and a volunteer base of 62,015.  Youth projects and organisations present valuable opportunities for the social and personal development of young people.  Qualities and skills such as leadership, co-operation, decision making, motivation and responsibility can be acquired through learning by doing.  The aim of the youth service is to assist all young people to become active participants in a democratic society.  In essence, the primary objective of the service is to help realise the potential of each young person and facilitate his or her full participation in community life.</P>
        <P>More than &euro;60 million is being provided in 2011 by the youth affairs unit of the Department to support the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and youth services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth work sector.  The focus of this financial support in 2011, as in previous years, is on the consolidation of existing youth work provision and safeguarding front-line programmes, services and jobs, <Col N="487"/>particularly in disadvantaged communities, through the youth service grants scheme, the special projects for youth scheme, the youth information centres, the young peoples&rsquo; facilities and services fund, the local drugs task forces, initiatives such as the local youth club grants scheme, the national youth health and arts programmes, as well as EU initiatives such as youth in action.</P>
        <P>In the light of budgetary constraints, the youth budgets in 2011 and 2012 will require careful management, with a focus on prioritising front-line services and protecting jobs and pay in so far as is possible.  Officials from the Department have met representatives of the youth sector, including the City of Dublin Youth Service Board, CDYSB, on an ongoing basis to ascertain the sector&rsquo;s views on how best to minimise the impact of budgetary constraints with a view to consolidating, in so far as is practicable, the progress made in previous years.  Every effort will be made to notify the various youth work organisations and administering agencies, including the CDYSB, of their 2012 allocations as speedily as possible.  The Department has also exhorted all of the national youth organisations and vocational education committees to revisit their level of expenditure to determine where cost savings can be achieved.</P>
        <P>The CDYSB is in receipt of funding from the youth affairs unit in the Department for a number of schemes and programmes.  These are the special projects for youth scheme, the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund, rounds one and two, and the local drugs task force initiative.  The 2011 allocation to the CDYSB for these schemes is almost &euro;14 million.</P>
        <P>The Minister is very much aware of the valuable services provided by the Sphere 17 Regional Youth Service for young people aged between ten and 21 years in such areas as Bonnybrook, Darndale and Priorswood across Dublin 17.   She visited the service last week.  It provides young people with a wide range of programmes and activities, seven days a week, which reflect their needs, interests, capacity and age profile.  These programmes and activities include personal and social development, with a particular focus on recreation, education and health.  The service also has a significant and impressive youth justice element aimed at addressing anti-social behaviour and under-age drinking.  Projects engage with young people in an open, creative and health focused way, using a variety of youth friendly approaches.  A team of trained and dedicated staff work with and for young people in the Dublin 17 area, supporting them to achieve their potential and contribute positively to their communities.</P>
        <P>In the context of the 2012 and future budgets, one of the key aims of youth policy development will be to ensure optimum use of all the financial and human resources available.  Accordingly, the development of the Department&rsquo;s policy on young people will focus specifically on ensuring greater coherence, co-ordination and impact in youth policy and provision so as to ensure quality outcomes for all.  It is intended that the policy framework will also facilitate and promote co-ordination and coherence across Departments and services and set out the priorities, rationale and criteria for future funding programmes.  It will also accommodate issues relevant to young people within the ten to 24 year age range in informal or out-of-school settings that fall within the remit of the Department.  The overall aim will be to clarify and enhance coherence, connectivity, co-ordination and delivery of youth and related out-of-school services for young people and to ensure such provision is both quality and outcomes-based.  As part of this approach, the Department is in the process of commissioning a review of international best practice in the area of youth development and support.  The findings from this work will inform the Department&rsquo;s policy objectives and future funding provision, with the aim of ensuring young people engaging in youth services derive maximum benefit from that engagement.  Projects such as the Sphere 17 Regional Youth Service will continue to play a central role in this provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that the Minister of State is here to represent the Minister and acknowledge that it is difficult for her to answer some of the more specific questions posed, <Col N="488"/>but I urge her to talk to the Minister about them.  While that was a good general response written by the Department in acknowledging the value of youth work, there was not a great deal in it about the Sphere 17 Regional Youth Service.  It certainly will not provide any comfort for those in Darndale, Priorswood, Bonnybrook and Coolock who are worried about the continuation of their services.  I would be a little concerned in that regard.  Of course, it is important to have the correct policy frameworks and reviews in place.  In fact, the Sphere 17 Regional Youth Service was one of the first to sign up to a new project in respect of a quality mark in evaluating youth services and is fully in favour of ensuring every euro is spent properly and in line with best practice.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned a review.  I would be surprised if it was finalised before the budgets are drawn up for next year.  I would be concerned if it was a holding tactic or to be used as an excuse to cut staff numbers.  Will the Minister of State ask the Minister if the funding for the City of Dublin Youth Service Board in 2012 and, in turn, for the Sphere 17 Regional Youth Service has been agreed to?  It is only fair, if it has been agreed to, that they be made aware of this.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister visited the service last week.  She is a good and decent person who would want to help the sector.  She needs to fight for it because, as I stated, cuts will have to be made somewhere.  This would be a crazy place to make them, given all of the statistics we have available for the challenges being faced in Dublin 17.  This is not the place to make cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is well aware of the excellent work being done by the Sphere 17 Regional Youth Service.  I am also conscious of the fact that in many areas youth workers and organisations are struggling.  As they do valuable work, we must protect these services to the greatest extent possible.  Regrettably, in the past three years the youth work budget was cut by 15%, as a result of which many youth organisations are struggling.  However, there is a commitment to ensuring youth work will continue.  We value very much the role it plays in communities, particularly in disadvantaged communities.  As the Senator is aware, decisions on budgetary provisions for the new year have not yet been taken, but there is a clear commitment to support youth work services because their value is recognised.</P>
