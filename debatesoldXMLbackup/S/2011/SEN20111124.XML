	<P>I have notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">Chun iarraidh ar an tAire Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta c&eacute;n pl&eacute; a bh&iacute; aige le hoifig an Ombudsman agus leis an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, roimh ar dhein s&eacute; an coinne oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga a ionchorpr&uacute; in oifig an Ombudsman.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have notice from Senator David Cullinane of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to discuss the importance of the domestic economy to economic recovery.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, address to the Seanad by Dr. Mary Robinson, president of the Mary Robinson Foundation &mdash; Climate Justice, former Senator and colleague of some Members who were present at the time, former President of Ireland and United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, to commence at 11.45 a.m. in accordance with the arrangements set out in the motion passed by the House on Tuesday, 22 November.  To facilitate a prompt start to Dr. Robinson&rsquo;s address, Senators are requested to be in their seats by 11.35 a.m.  On the conclusion of that business at 1.45 p.m. the sitting will be suspended until 6 p.m., at which time we will take No. 2, Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011 &mdash; Committee Stage (resumed), to conclude not later than 9 p.m., if not previously concluded.</P>
        <P>For the information of Members, Report and Final Stages of the Water Services (Amendment) Bill will be taken on Monday, 28 November from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  At the close of business tonight a motion will be put before the House on the arrangements for the sitting, and a Supplementary Order Paper will be circulated later today to cover the sitting.</P>
        <P>Between 2.30 p.m. and 6 p.m. today, the Seanad Public Consultation Committee will hear submissions in this Chamber from representatives of older people&rsquo;s advocacy groups on issues <Col N="796"/>affecting the rights of older people in society.  All Senators are very welcome and are invited to be present in the Chamber during the course of the afternoon for those hearings.  I understand nine groups will be making presentations based on written submissions already made to the committee.  They will be making oral submissions in the Chamber in groups of three, and Senators are invited to ask questions of the groups following each set of submissions.  All Senators are welcome to ask questions.  We will also be having a public consultation committee hearing on Tuesday, 29 November.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Government conceded to the Opposition&rsquo;s request regarding the means of dealing with the Water Services (Amendment) Bill.  It is very important.  We all agree that this House does its job properly in scrutinising legislation.  The idea of allowing but one day for Committee Stage is wrong.  I thank the Leader and the Whips on all sides for deciding on a reasonable arrangement such that Committee Stage will resume today and Report Stage will be on Monday.  That allows for proper consideration of this very important legislation.</P>
        <P>I raised yesterday a question to which I did not get an answer.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, said very clearly in the House three weeks ago that the Government would publish the mortgage arrears implementation strategy in advance of the budget.  This was said in response to a question from me and Members on the other side of the House.  The Minister for Finance, in response to our D&aacute;il spokesperson on finance, Deputy Michael McGrath, said it would probably not be published before the budget but that he will do his best to have it in place before Christmas.  This is not good enough.</P>
        <P>It is nine weeks since the publication of the Keane report and nine months since the Government, after the general election, made sweeping promises regarding what it would do for distressed mortgage holders.  Nothing has been done by it, with the exception of defeating a very substantial Bill brought forward by Members on this side of the House to protect the principal private residence or family home of individuals.  Circumstances are becoming increasingly worse and mortgage arrears cases account for nearly 10% of all mortgages.  When former Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, was in the House, I raised with him the issue of shared and affordable housing mortgages, in respect of which the average arrears rate is over 20%.  That local authorities are not governed by the statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears is a major problem.</P>
        <P>All I ask the Government to do is to keep one promise, namely, its promise to the hundreds of thousands of individuals in arrears with their mortgages.  What is the position?  I have immense respect for Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and I am sure he did not come into this House to mislead it intentionally.  However, he obviously has no idea what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is actually doing.  When will the Government publish its comprehensive mortgage arrears implementation strategy?  It said it would do so before the budget but this will not be done.</P><Col N="797"/>
        <P>Three weeks ago, I called for a debate in this House on the proposed appointment of an individual to the European Court of Auditors.  The Deputy Leader believed this appointment would be a good idea, as did the Leader, yet the debate thereon was never arranged.  Yesterday was an embarrassment for Ireland.  I am not being personal in saying so.  That our nominee was rejected by our peers in Europe is very serious.  We need to debate this, but not the individual concerned specifically.  The debate ought to happen next week.  The Government will continue to try to have the individual appointed, although our peers in Europe have rejected him.  I know Members on the other side of the House are very concerned about how this is done.  I propose a proper discussion on how we will deal with all appointments in the future.  My belief and that of my party is that, when the Government proposes someone for a job such as that with the European Court of Auditors, the nominee should, at the very least, be interviewed by a joint Oireachtas committee.  He or she should be interviewed in this House also.  We should try to achieve Irish consensus on nominating people for important EU jobs and others.  The job in question is not a doddle; it is important and the Irish people and their Government got a slap in the face yesterday from Europe.  The problem with this is that the Government knew it was coming.  It led with its chin and knew its nominee would be rejected.  I want a debate on this next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo yesterday&rsquo;s call by Senator David Norris for an early debate on the media, particularly on standards in the media.  I make my call having read late last night an article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> entitled &ldquo;Galling To See Politicians Order Inquiry Into RTE&rdquo;.  It states that while the Fr. Kevin Reynolds libel itself was disastrous, RTE&rsquo;s response was lame and self-protective, so much so that the station must now face the ignominy of having an investigation foisted on it by politicians.  The journalist states that is the worst possible scenario because politicians do not have the best interest of the public or RTE at heart.  He states that, although one may call him a cynic, he believes many politicians just want to see RTE get a good kicking.</P>
        <P>I take grave exception to that article.  It is outrageous.  I have no personal axe to grind with RTE.  I called in this House for an inquiry to get to the truth of how a good and decent man had his reputation destroyed by RTE.  I ask the Deputy Leader to confirm with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, that the independent inquiry he has set up will not alone deal with the injustice done to Fr. Reynolds but will also examine the case of the deceased missionary in South Africa whose family believe had his reputation destroyed also.  I take grave exception to what was written by Cormac Looney last night.  As politicians, we must take on this sort of journalism. It is appalling and calls into question the integrity of politicians in this House who called for an inquiry to put the record straight as to how the national broadcaster got it so wrong in the case of Fr. Kevin Reynolds and possibly others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As one can imagine, I agree very much with what Senator Mullins said.  I hope his comments will be borne in mind when the Committee on Procedure and Privileges examines three complaints I will be laying before it before the weekend.</P>
        <P>Let me consider the question of the appointment of Mr. Cardiff to the European Court of Auditors.  Everybody has named him.  I do not suppose we should but we know whom we are talking about.  I asked a question on this very same subject so I support strongly what the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il said.  I seems the problem is causing us embarrassment.  I asked yesterday whether instructions had gone out from party headquarters to Members of the European Parliament and it was indicated to me that no such instructions were given.  This does not seem to be accurate because the comments of Ms Nessa Childers, MEP, of the Labour Party, and the <Col N="798"/>position taken up by Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly, MEP, seem to be at variance with this.  I would like an explanation for that.</P>
        <P>Will the Deputy Leader state whether and when the Government will introduce proposed legislation on the issue of privacy, which legislation has been hanging in abeyance for many years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I reassure my colleague that the Government has certainly not conceded to the Opposition regarding the implementation of the Cavan model for the Water Services (Amendment) Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I just wanted to clarify something.  I know it was late at night and perhaps it was past the Senator&rsquo;s bedtime&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, the Minister did not seem to understand a lot yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does Senator Landy have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, to return to the House to follow up on the discussions we had with him and to address the questions put to him on the day in question.  He has not addressed them thus far.  My colleague, Senator Marie Moloney, raised with him the difficulties within the central processing unit for medical cards.  Responsibility for processing has been centralised, with responsibility having been transferred to Dublin from county clinics in order to provide a better service for medical card recipients.  Unfortunately, the outcome is the opposite.  It is with great regret that I am obliged to ask for the Minister&rsquo;s return to this House.  While both this House and the Lower House are very good at dealing with macro issues, Members sometimes must deal with micro issues.  This morning, I received information from a constituent with spina bifida, whose medication costs &euro;390 weekly.  Having visited his doctor last Friday, he was informed the doctor could not see him.  This was because a day earlier, that patient and 14 others were struck off from their GP&rsquo;s general medical services, GMS, list without any notification to any of them.  This is an absolute disgrace.  Moreover, when in this House, the Minister gave an assurance to Members that this issue would be dealt with and applications would be processed.  What actually happened is the Minister offered to deal with the cases about which the Senator involved had a concern, which is unacceptable.  Thousands of people are waiting for medical cards to be processed.  The individual to whom I referred sent in his renewal application last April and the card expired in June.  We are almost in December and without any notification or opportunity to appeal, he was struck off.  He now faces a bill of &euro;390 per week for medication&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash; plus a visit to the GP, which will cost another &euro;50.  He is obliged to attend each week.  The Minister must return to this House to deal with this micro issue.  Members cannot talk continually about macro issues while people are suffering nationwide.  They cannot get their medical cards processed and cannot go to their doctors because they lack the money.  I call on the Minister to return to this House next week to deal with this issue. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="799"/>
     <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">First, I commend Senator Landy for bringing up this issue, which he referred to as being a micro issue.  As Members discuss, as they must, bigger policies and as they look at the bigger picture, they often miss out on the individual suffering on theground.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is in the same context that I ask the Deputy Leader to lay aside some time fairly soon to discuss the issue of national self-reliance.  During the last couple of recessionary years, it has been quite evident that Ireland has become a much more competitive country and this should be borne in mind in the lead-up to Christmas.  While this may appear to be a micro issue, there is an opportunity to help those people, particularly in small businesses, who are exceptionally challenged, as well as those who are losing their jobs.  This could be done, were Members to focus on the same things on which there was a focus when the State was first set up, at which time it probably was led by organisations such as the GAA and Conradh na Gaeilge, namely, buying Irish-made goods.  First, because it is quite clear the quality of Irish-made goods is second to none.  Second, because, as I stated, Ireland has become much more competitive.  It is only a matter of making a conscious decision regarding the money one will spend, and a lot of money will be spent by those who have it, over the Christmas period.  However, if one makes such a conscious decision, one not only will be buying the item one wishes to buy butwill be helping those businesses which have three or four employees, particularly insmaller communities.  Were they to be helped, it might result in, when one puts it alltogether, between 10% and 20% more money staying at home instead of leaving thecountry.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge Members cannot legislate for this and am cognisant of the restrictions arising from being part of a European community.  However, I merely am putting forward one suggestion.  People will listen to Members&rsquo; debates on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; or will read a limited amount in the newspapers.  Generally, Members deal with issues that are somewhat contentious politically among themselves.  However, the issue to which I refer is not contentious because all Members seem to agree on one thing, namely, the need to be positive.  Members must ensure they are not simply paying lip-service to the sufferings of people but are taking practical steps.  Would it not be great, were Members to lay aside a half-day to debate self-reliance, as was practised in the early days of the State when we were challenged in the past?  Despite all the legislation with which Members must deal, I appeal to the Deputy Leader to ascertain whether it might be possible to lay aside a half day, because there would be no confrontational debate.  All Members would be singing from the same hymn sheet and above all else, they would be sending out a message that they are both genuine and sincere in trying to help those who cannot help themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Landy on the need to have the Minister come before the House once again at the earliest date possible to discuss health matters and medical card issues in particular.  All Members could recount similar examples of people whose medical card applications either are not being processed in sufficient time or are being refused.  The HSE has a substantial budget, not of hundreds of millions but of billions of euro.  It certainly has a high staffing level, of well in excess of 100,000 people.  While it is not short of offices or resources, it sometimes appears to be very short of humanity and common sense.  In particular, the centralisation of the medical card service has been quite disastrous because it has removed the discretion and common sense which was applicable when the local community welfare officer was in charge of issuing cards.  Consequently, an urgent review of that system is required.</P><Col N="800"/>
        <P Just="Left">The other issue I wish to raise briefly appears on the Order Paper under the heading, Papers laid before the Seanad.  I refer to the draft programme documents of November 2011 of the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland, that is, the documents relating to the famous bailout.  It would be helpful, sometime after the budget and perhaps in mid-December, were Members to have a debate with the appropriate Minister or Ministers on the current state of the programme, the level of progress made, the level of commitments given by Ireland and how they have been responded to and the level of commitments given by Europe and the IMF.  It would be helpful were all Members brought up to date on where that programme stands because virtually every debate in this House, be it about medical cards or jobs, really relates back to the bailout programme and the IMF.  On the anniversary of the signing of that agreement, it would be important that Members receive an official update on how now stand the workings of that agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I always find listening to Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; to be an inspiration because he speaks with such strength and such belief, as he did today.  The question of buying Irish is very important.  It is in our own hands and is something we can do and he worded this point very well.  However, I must sound a note of caution about one point he made, namely, that all Irish products are good.  One must buy critically, as one is not doing a favour to a producer of an Irish product if one buys something solely because it is Irish.  Were one to buy it because it is Irish and it is a poor product, one is not doing that company a favour.  Similarly, if one buys a food product that is not good, no favour is being done.  Irish people must learn to be critical.  In such cases, I suggest, that as a consumer, one should go back to whoever provided the service in question, whether it be a local shop or restaurant or the producer of a product.  It is one&rsquo;s obligation to help them by going back to tell them it was not good enough and to ask them to do their best to improve because one wishes to support them.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I believe this is an opportunity for this House to do something.  Would it be possible to have an all-party motion that could be agreed on by everyone, stating Members will set an example and will exhort everyone they come across this Christmas to do their best to buy not just Irish but to buy local as well?  I believe that in the case of foodstuffs, buying local is a huge benefit.  The other day, I mentioned a recent great campaign in Drogheda, in which 30 food producers from counties Louth and Meath got together in a hotel and met approximately 50 customers, by which I do not mean just consumers but eateries and people with restaurants or delicatessens.  The latter could not get over meeting people who were in their own locality for the first time.  There is a sense that if one buys something local, one can see the benefit that derives therefrom.  I remember the onset of the BSE scare some years ago and what impressed me was that people in France wanted to buy French beef and people in Germany wanted to buy German beef.  In other words, they were anxious to buy something not from far away but from their own territory and their own country.  This is something from which one can learn.  Moreover, one can learn this lesson at a local level.  Perhaps Members can manage to encourage our citizens to support Irish this year and even more so, to support local.  However, they should be critical if they do not get good service.  If they do not get the product they want, they should make sure to go back and help retailers or producers to improve it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like my colleague, Senator Mullins, I was perturbed by what appeared in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Evening Herald</i>.  The inquiry would not have happened but for the fact that politicians looked for it.  Twenty minutes was spent discussing this critical and serious matter at the Cabinet as a result of the public outcry, which was articulated by colleagues such <Col N="801"/>as Senator Mullins in recent days.  It is a bit rich to read headlines like &ldquo;Galling to See Politicians Order Inquiry into RTE.&rdquo;  The bottom line is that if British politicians had not looked for inquiries, the telephone hacking scandal would not have been exposed in the first place.</P>
         <P>I also agree with Senator Landy.  Merely because something is centralised does not mean it is done properly.  My experience in dealing with medical cards over the years has been positive because of the role the community welfare officers played in deciding on borderline cases, taking all the facts into consideration and making a recommendation.  We are now in a position where we cannot make that type of representation to the centralised body concerned because we do not know the staff, we have no personal relationships with them and we cannot really make a case.</P>
      </Speaker>
     <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not telephone contact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not even telephone contact.  They do not even return a call, which is appalling.  The Minister needs to take another look at how this medical card process is being dealt with and perhaps go back to the original model, which was doing it through the community welfare officers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support the call by Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Quinn on the Deputy Leader for a debate on buying Irish.  Perhaps she would include in that debate how we could deal with the e-tendering process for State companies and local authorities with projects valued in excess of &euro;50,000.  The e-tendering process is a system whereby people all over Europe tender for jobs in Ireland and, by and large, it goes to the cheapest.  It should apply to projects valued at &euro;500,000 or more.  In the case of a contract for &euro;100,000 where there is potential job creation here, the local authority should retain the flexibility to skip that process.  If that was done, one would see many more jobs created and many more companies getting State business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the call by Senator Landy that the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, come in to discuss medical card renewal.  We should be non-partisan on this because all of us made constructive proposals when the Minister was here.  The issue of medical card renewal is important.  Senator Landy gave examples with which he dealt and we all could give examples of those who have waited months for their cards to be renewed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The problem is that when the Minister was in this House, he informed us that the renewal time was on average two to three weeks.  That is not our experience and that of many who are waiting for their cards to be renewed.  Perhaps the Minister got incorrect information from an official.  He should come back into this House to clarify the position because we all can offer examples.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say, as Senator Landy said, &ldquo;Give me the examples and I will sort them out.&rdquo;  It is a systemic problem and it needs to be addressed.  That is important.  I support the Senator.</P>
        <P>I also support the call for a debate on media standards here.  The issue has been discussed in various different ways in this House over the course of recent weeks, but there were calls several months ago for this debate and then there was the Fr. Reynolds and &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; matter.  I ask the Leader to provide time to discuss media standards here.  Then we could have an opportunity to discuss the various related issues which arose in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>My intention was to call for a debate on the retail sector in Ireland.  That feeds into what has been asked for in terms of buying Irish and supporting Irish products.  The retail sector has been devastated by what has happened in the economy.  It is also planned, if we believe the Minister for Finance, that VAT will be increased by 2%.  I spoke to many retailers in Waterford in recent days, many of whom work for less than the minimum wage simply to keep their shops open and to keep people in employment.  Some of them work for nothing because they must <Col N="802"/>pay the rates, the rent and keep people employed.  If they were to give up and close their premises, they would see people lose their jobs and they would also not receive any benefits because they have been self-employed.  They are caught in a poverty trap.  Those retailers want to keep their businesses going but if the Government goes ahead with this 2% VAT increase, that will crucify many of them in Waterford and across the State.  It is important for this House to have a debate on this.  That is the Adjournment motion I put down which was ruled out of order and about which the Cathaoirleach stated that maybe a more substantive motion was necessary.  I agree.  I call on this House to have a full debate on the importance of the retail sector, the importance of supporting the retail sector and the positive impact that would have on the overall economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On the Order of Business yesterday a number of Members raised the issue of interruptions during the question and answer session on Tuesday evening with the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and I share those concerns. I have the transcript here. In my two-minute opportunity to put questions to the Minister, the Minister interrupted me on six occasions and there were six other interruptions, which was an interruption every ten seconds.  That should not be allowed.  Then, unfortunately, when I was endeavouring to assist the Minister later in the debate, he took the hump at my interventions. </P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We are not reopening that debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Walsh knows well, the Chair is the sole judge of order in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why I am asking that the Chair protect Members in these situations.</P>
        <P>The central point I wanted to make on which I am looking for a debate was that the failure of the Minister to extract any significant benefits fiscally from the Croke Park agreement, which the interim report illustrated clearly, meant that the cuts to the public capital programme are so severe that programmes which would generate jobs in the short term and improve our competitiveness in the future are being abandoned.  I ask for a debate on the published document, which is light.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not making a political point.  I am concerned about the comments from backbenchers, particularly within the Labour Party.  I refer Members to the front page of the <i>Irish Examiner</i> today.  It strikes me &mdash; I say this from experience &mdash; that we served in difficult times with a minor partner in Government that became flaky.  I am really amazed and concerned that the Labour Party backbench Members are becoming as flaky so early in the lifetime of the Government.</P>

	<P Just="Left">One issue that is really getting to me is the issue of jaywalking.  Yesterday I was saddened to learn of a pedestrian being struck on the N11 as he was crossing the road.  Although the person was injured, I thank God he did not die.  In the context of everything that is happening in Europe and Ireland, it does not seem like something that <Col N="804"/>warrants attention but of the approximately 200 fatalities on record for last year, 38 involved pedestrians.  Yesterday, I witnessed somebody walking across the road.  I was driving and visibility was not great because it was quite sunny.  The pedestrian knocked on my window as though I was in the wrong.  I do not know if I should table a Private Member&rsquo;s motion on the issue of jaywalking.  It is a practice that takes place under the radar and we are all guilty of it.  I do it myself on occasion but the practice is policed more heavily in other countries and something needs to be done about it in this country.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Mullen&rsquo;s comments on media standards.  It is not acceptable for a journalist to claim that politicians do not have the best interests of the public at heart.  That is the case for some politicians who have their own interests at heart.</P>

        <P>I welcome the calls for a debate on health issues.  It was alarming to learn this morning that the Government proposes to close 12 community hospitals and a total of 840 beds.  The proposed closures include a hospital in my constituency which was kept open by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party despite difficult circumstances.  A plan was put in place for the local community organisation to develop an alternative facility at Lifford community hospital.  There is now a threat of full closure and the loss of at least 20 beds at Lifford.  Long-term hospital beds are also threatened at Buncrana, Ramelton and Carndonagh community hospitals.  This is another attack on the elderly and those who cannot live unassisted.  I fail to understand the Government&rsquo;s lack of commitment in this area.  The Minister for Health must clarify to the House his stance on the closures that have being flagged as an imminent decision.</P>

        <P>In regard to the Holy See, the Leader has agreed to invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the House in due course.  It is not helpful to speak about the closure of the embassy.  Even though he is non-resident, our ambassador, David Cooney, is an eminent and senior figure.  I am sure he will be using that building on his frequent visits to Rome to work the diplomacy that is afoot.  We also have a new apostolic nuncio, the eminent and able Monsignor Brown, who I congratulate and welcome.  He is also fluent in English.  I do not suggest there were many misunderstandings in the past but this augurs well for the future.

        <P>I seek a debate on ministerial expenses.  It has come to light that Ministers are literally taking us to the cleaners by claiming up to &euro;3,500 in expenses for dry cleaning their clothes.  We are <Col N="807"/>not giving extra money to people on the dole or in receipt of pensions for their dry cleaning.  Carers do not seem to get money to do their dry cleaning.  Students do not get extra money to cover their washing and drying.  Why should a Minister who already receives a hefty salary receive up to &euro;3,500 per year for cleaning clothes?  It is an absolute scandal.  The Government told us that the regime was going to change but <i>plus &ccedil;a change, plus c&rsquo;est la m&ecirc;me chose</i>, as they say in France.  A debate on ministerial expenses would also allow us to ask whether it is working out cheaper now that we do not have ministerial cars.  How much is being spent on ministerial transport under the new regime?  How much are special advisers costing and how many of them are being paid more than the cap that was supposedly being imposed on salaries?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I was interested to establish whether a reference would be made to the unfolding euro crisis, especially the German failure to raise funds on the bond market.  Despite all the issues raised on the Order of Business, will the Deputy Leader, at the very least, convey the genuine concerns people have about their savings, the status of the currency and the ongoing crisis, which changes on a daily basis?  It is incumbent on the Government to issue a statement of intent.  What is its position in light of the most recent developments?  It seems as if eurozone countries, led by France, are initiating a process that Germany is resisting, whereby eurobonds will be issued and the ECB will act as a lender of last resort.</P>
        <P>The reason I raise this is all the commentary in the print and electronic media refers to the collapse of the euro.  To ensure people do not panic about this, it is incumbent on the Government to act in the national interest to allay the fears of citizens and it should outline its policy going forward.  I appreciate we are a small country subject to a bailout and our voice is not as strong in Europe as it used to be but when an editorial in the <i>Irish Independent </i>uses the chilling line that because of the euro currency crisis, what the Minister for Finance presents to the people in the D&aacute;il on budget day may be totally irrelevant, we are in a new, dangerous place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not anticipate that the Minister for Finance, the T&aacute;naiste or the Taoiseach will come to the House but, at the very least, will the Deputy Leader convey the serious concerns people have and respond accordingly?  Will the Government issue a public statement to reassure citizens about their savings, the status of the euro and, most important, outline policy in this area?  The policy seems to be somewhat fumbling and fudging.  I cannot get clarity in anything I have <Col N="808"/>read, seen, or heard in the past two weeks.  The Government parties are muddling through and they await the next crisis before giving a reaction.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Paul Coghlan&rsquo;s comments about the status of diplomatic relations with the Vatican.  It is not about whether Mr. David Cooney, who has been a friend of mine for many years and who is a respected Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs, is up to the job or whether he will be effective, it is about Vatican policy.  We are in the second tier of nations as a result of removing ourselves from being <i>in situ</i> in Vatican City.  That is the key issue and that is poor &ldquo;statecraft&rdquo;, as Senator Mullen described it a few weeks ago.  That is damaging to Irish interests.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I join Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill in requesting that the Minister for Health come to the House to discuss the reported closures of community hospitals throughout the country.  In particular, I would like to address the position of the Lisdarn unit for the elderly in Cavan town.  This is a 44-bed unit, of which six are for respite care.  Excellent care is provided for the vulnerable, older people of Cavan town and surrounding areas.  Its staff are excellent and news reports earlier indicate this is one of the proposed units for closure.  If that is the case, it is a disgrace and we will fight it in this House at every opportunity afforded to us.  The Minister and representatives of the Government say that this is only speculation and no decision has been made.  I refer them to similar comments they made regarding the VEC staff in Cavan.  Their office was closed and they were transferred to Monaghan.  I also refer them to the 140 troops based in Dun U&iacute; N&eacute;ill barracks in the town who were also told the proposed closure was only speculation and no decision had been made.  It will close in March and I have no doubt it is the intention of the Minister for Health to close this unit.  It is a disgrace and it will be fought in the House and by my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, in the other House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Brien asked for clarification on the mortgage arrears implementation strategy.  I am glad to inform him that the Government is moving forward as a matter of urgency with the strategy.  It is launching two mortgage-to-rent schemes on a pilot basis initially to test how they will operate ahead of a wider roll-out.  One of the pilot schemes will cover a broad range of 500 households.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has begun extensive work on the heads of a personal insolvency Bill, while the Department of Finance is speaking with the banks to ensure implementation of the measures in the Keane report and the Central Bank has asked all mortgage lenders to produce detailed mortgage arrears resolution strategies and implementation plans for submission by the end of November.  There is a speedy move on this issue, but the Minister for Finance wanted to ensure Deputies, Senators and other groups had the opportunity to make known their views and he will formally put proposals to the Government following conclusion of the D&aacute;il debate on the next steps, including an implementation mechanism.  Progress is being made but I will follow up the Senator&rsquo;s query to ascertain when the strategy will be published.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Brien and Norris also raised the issue of the rejection by the European Parliament committee of the appointment of Mr. Kevin Cardiff.  As I said previously, I would very much welcome a debate on appointments to the European Court of Auditors and similar appointments.

        <P Just="Left">Senators Mullins, Conway, Cullinane and Noone referred to the issue of media standards, RTE and the fallout from the Fr. Reynolds case and the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; documentary.  They mentioned the commentary in some newspapers and I agree it would be helpful to have such a debate.  I called for a debate some time ago in response to the <i>News of the World</i> crisis and will speak with the Leader about arranging one.  Senator Mullins sought clarification on the remit of the inquiry that is being set up.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has arranged for the establishment of an independent inquiry.  The terms have not been set.  The Senator sought an expansion of the terms but it is important that they are focused to ensure a speedy report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris called for clarification on the issue of privacy.  I will check the matter for him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Landy, Bradford, Conway, Cullinane, &Oacute; Domhnaill and Wilson sought debates with the Minister for Health on the centralisation of the processing of medical card applications and the delays in issuing same, hospital and nursing home closures.  I understand the Minister will appear before the Joint Committee on Health and Children this morning.  It would be helpful to have him back in the House.  He was present for a comprehensive debate recently but we should invite him to return early in the year, about which I will speak to the Leader.  I appreciate that the delay in the renewal of medical cards is causing immense suffering.  I am grateful to Senators, such as Senator Landy, for raising individual cases.  Of course, some issues might be suitable to be raised with the Minister as matters on the Adjournment, as well as having a broader debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many Senators also requested a debate on buying Irish, the retail sector and the issue of self-reliance.  I am grateful to Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for raising the issue, which was supported by Senators Quinn, Conway and Cullinane.  It would be very useful to have that debate and I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that it would be non-contentious and could bring forward creative ideas on the growth of the retail sector.  The RDS crafts fair will take place early in December, which is a good opportunity for people to support local, quality Irish produce.  The report of the small business forum established by the Taoiseach and chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, was published this week.  We might have a debate focusing on it, while also bringing in the broader issues of e-tendering and the retail sector generally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The final issue raised by many Senators was that of the closure of the embassies.  It was raised by Senators Walsh, &Oacute; Domhnaill, Paul Coghlan and Mooney, and an amendment to the Order of Business has been proposed.  I ask the Senators not to press the amendment today given the very heavy schedule we already have and given that today is an important day in terms of reform of standard procedures to allow a guest speaker and public consultation to take place.  The Leader and I have both been actively pursuing the T&aacute;naiste and his office to have him come in and deal with not just the issues the Senators have raised on the closure of embassies but also a number of other foreign policy issues that Senators, including me, have been raising in recent weeks.  Yesterday I finally got a response from the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s private secretary indicating that he will come here on a date early in January.  I had sought and hoped to get a date in December, but given the budget date that seems unlikely.  I am still hopeful that we might be able to get him here in the last sitting week &mdash; the week after the budget.  It may be impossible to get him here next week or in budget week, but I will get back to him again today following the calls from Senators this morning to ask that he come in before the end of this session, which would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of Ministers&rsquo; expenses, which is a debate we could well have.  Ministers &mdash; certainly the Labour Party Ministers with whom I have discussed it &mdash; are very concerned about the issue and want to see it reformed.  As the Senator knows, there have already been significant cuts in ministerial pay since the Government came into office, but it would be very good to have a broader debate on ministerial expenses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am grateful to Senator Mooney, who was the only Senator to raise this morning the biggest and most critical issue facing the country and the wider eurozone community, the crisis in the eurozone.  I will convey the concern he expressed about what is going on, which is shared by other colleagues.  It would be useful to have a public statement from the Government on it, but we need to be mindful that the situation is changing by the hour and the timing of such a statement would be critical &mdash; an intervention at the wrong time might not be helpful.  IMF economists have today issued a report suggesting that the decision to guarantee debts in Anglo Irish Bank might have been a precipitative factor of the eurozone crisis.  We need to be mindful of the timing and our role in the eurozone crisis.</P>

As the Cathaoirleach said, what is said in the House is on the record of the House.  If any Senator has a difficulty and disagrees with a statement to the press by another Senator, clearly he or she should take that up by issuing a counter-statement and, if necessary, including a transcript.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe I have responded to everybody at this point.  As I said, I will endeavour to get the T&aacute;naiste to come to the House before the end of this session.  In any case we have a commitment from him to come here early in January.  On that basis I ask colleagues not to press the amendment.</P>

    <Title>Address by Dr. Mary Robinson</Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of my fellow Senators I welcome to the House Dr. Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and a past Member of the House.  As you are all aware, this newly elected Seanad is determined to modernise its procedures and actively engage with the civic society.  To begin this process we have changed Standing Orders to allow persons and representatives of public and civic life to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Today our guest, Dr. Mary Robinson, will address Members on the importance of the Seanad in her career as a human rights activist.</P>
        <P>Dr. Robinson has had a very distinguished career as a politician, academic and human rights campaigner.  As well as being regarded in this country as a transforming President, Dr. Robinson is also renowned at home and abroad as an extremely successful, committed and skilled human rights activist.  At the age of 25, Dr. Mary Robinson became Ireland&rsquo;s youngest professor of law when she was appointed Reid Professor of Constitutional and Criminal Law at Trinity College where she also served as a lecturer in European Community law.  From 1969 to 1989, Dr. Robinson was a member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann where her legal expertise and advocacy skills had a major impact on the drafting of legislation.  During this time she was also committed to the promotion and protection of human rights.  In 1990 she became the first woman to be elected President of Ireland, and from 1997 to 2002 she was the United Nation&rsquo;s High Commissioner for Human Rights.</P>
        <P>Dr. Robinson now heads up the Mary Robinson Foundation &mdash; Climate Justice, a centre for thought leadership, education and advocacy on the struggle to secure global justice for those many victims of climate change who are usually forgotten, namely, the poor, the disempowered and the marginalised throughout the world.</P>
        <P>It is in recognition of her success and expertise in the area of human rights that she is invited here today to address the House.  We are delighted that a person of such reputation <Col N="812"/>and achievement at home and abroad has agreed to speak to the Seanad under the new rules.  Therefore, it is a great honour and privilege to ask Dr. Mary Robinson to address the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Dr. Mary Robinson</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cathaoirleach, Leas-Chathaoirleach, Members of the Seanad, I never thought for one minute when I was a Member of the House that I would be invited back to address you, least of all from the Minister&rsquo;s chair. I feel reassured that the Cathaoirleach is from County Mayo and will protect me.  I was so enthusiastic about attending that I arrived early, which made the protocol more difficult.</P>
        <P>As Senators have heard, I had the honour to spend 20 years in the House from 1969 until August 1989 when I believed I was retiring altogether from public life.  For nine of those years, I was a member of the Labour Party with Front Bench and back bench experience.  I am pleased that there is a better gender balance now &mdash; some 18 of the 60 Senators are women &mdash; than when I was first elected, but there is still room for improvement.  When I was elected in 1969 there were six women.  When I signed the roll as an overawed young Senator, I met Senator Kit Ahern, a long-standing Fianna F&aacute;il Senator who I am sure many Members remember.  She drew me aside and gave me a piece of advice, namely, that lady Members of the Seanad wore hats.  I did not like wearing hats, but I wore a small beret my first day.  I have always hated the photograph that was taken.  Subsequently, I learned that it was not necessary for ladies to wear hats.</P>
        <P>I have been asked to share some of my experiences as a Senator and to outline how it contributed to my later work.  I am pleased that the first discussion theme chosen by the Seanad relates to human rights and that a former Senator, Dr. Maurice Manning, the chair of the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, has already addressed the Chamber in that context.</P>
        <P>Four areas of my time in the Seanad contributed helpfully to my later work.  For example, my experience of contributing to the legislative process taught me to read closely the small print of legislation and to understand the technical side of drafting, amending and speaking on the different Stages of a Bill before the House.  It was an honour as President of Ireland to sign Bills into law or, after consulting the Council of State, to refer some of them to the Supreme Court under Article 26.  Obviously, one does not need to be a former Member of the D&aacute;il or Seanad to become Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, but it was undoubtedly helpful for me, particularly in respect of that function.</P>
        <P>My second reflection is on my first Bill that I sought to promote as a Private Members&rsquo; Bill, which was meant to amend the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935 as it related to access to contraceptives.  Two Senators &mdash; John Horgan and Dr. Trevor West &mdash; joined with me in tabling a short Private Members&rsquo; Bill, but it was never even given a First Reading.  This was unusual and I am unsure as to whether other Bills suffered a similar fate.  We tried a number of times to have it included on the Order of Business.  The day it was debated, it was done suddenly and defeated in a vote.</P>
        <P>When I announced that I was going to introduce the legislation, I was taken aback by the extent of the public outcry, the hate letters and being denounced from pulpits.  I had been focusing on the fact that the law was not in touch with reality.  As Senators may recall, married women could not avail of the contraceptive pill at the time unless their doctors certified that they had cycle regulation problems.  It must have been the weather because there was an awful lot of married women with cycle regulation problems.  Equally, it was not against the law to use a condom, but it was against criminal law to buy or sell one.  Coming from Harvard Law <Col N="813"/>School as I did, I did not believe the law was conforming with reality and it was obvious that it needed to be amended.</P>
        <P>I have since reflected a great deal on what I did not consider then, namely, the fact that I was touching on a sensitive part of Irish culture &mdash; the unwillingness to discuss sex even in the family, never mind in a public way.  I learned a valuable lesson that proved important when I became UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</P>
        <P>A major category of human rights violations is that of the harmful traditional practices applied to women, for example, genital mutilation, genital cutting, forced marriages, etc.  Supporters of these practices claim the human rights agenda is a Western agenda and that they have different cultural approaches.  One of my first acts as High Commissioner was to support those special rapporteurs on violence against women and relevant issues who were Muslim women.  They advocated that, as opposed to being cultural, these were harmful traditional practices.  Even so, it was clear that the only way one could achieve sustainable change was from within, be it in the village, the community or the country.  I brought my Seanad experience to the issue.  It took ten years for the Government to amend the law on contraceptives and to achieve what we called at the time an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  It presented an important opportunity to understand that, if one wants to change behaviours and attitudes, it is a slow, educational and awareness raising process that requires much patience, stamina and consistency.</P>
        <P>Although I mentioned that I do not like wearing hats, I now wear a different one and have been officially designated an elder in the sense that I was honoured to be included in The Elders group brought together by Nelson Mandela and chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu.  Given the participation of strong women like Gra&ccedil;a Machel, Gro Brundtland and Ela Bhatt, from the beginning The Elders have wanted to highlight the way in which the wrong application of religion and tradition can subjugate and hold back women in certain respects.  Our statement received strong support from the male members of The Elders, notably President Jimmy Carter, Archbishop Tutu, President Fernando Cardoso, Kofi Annan and others.</P>
        <P>We decided that we needed to highlight a practical area in which it was necessary to call on religious leaders and traditional chiefs to support the empowerment and rights of women.  We took the example of child marriage.  From my time as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, I knew that child marriage was a major issue, but I had underestimated the number of girls affected.  Approximately 10 million girls per year marry well below the age of 18 years, the recognised age under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">When Archbishop Tutu, Ms Machel, Ms Brundtland and I visited Ethiopia this year, I noted a difference between the law and the practice.  Ethiopia has a good law that states no one below the age of 18 years should marry, but we visited the Amhara region where the average age of marriage was 12 years.  We met eight, nine and ten year olds who had been married by their families.  More than anything else, the situation was brought home to me when I spoke with a 16 year old accompanied by her 30 year old husband in a village that was addressing the question of child marriage from within &mdash; increased education levels, keeping girls in school and involving the whole of the village and the imams.  To relax the 16 year old, I asked her to tell me about her wedding day.  She looked at me with the saddest eyes and said she had to drop out of school. I had a sudden picture of this 15 year old happily playing in school with her 15 year old companions and the next day her parents tell her she is now married and must move into her husband&rsquo;s family home and do whatever is asked of her, by a husband whom she has never met before. This is the reality of child marriage. The lessons I learned in Seanad &Eacute;ireann seeking to introduce that Bill stay with me. </P><Col N="814"/>
        
        <P>A third point is the ability to table motions on different issues.  It allows a very wide range of issues to be raised that otherwise probably would not be raised in the Oireachtas, issues of prison reform which can come up if there is a Bill but often need to come up on their own.  I remember raising an issue of the persecution of Jews in Russia.  I could raise issues on foreign affairs as well as local issues.  That was a reminder to me of constantly seeking to pursue human rights issues.  Sometimes I found there was a parallel between what I might be trying to do as a barrister in a case in court, instructed by my clients, and raising a matter in the Seanad.  The long litigation on Wood Quay crossed the courts,  Seanad &Eacute;ireann and Dublin City Council at different times.</P>
        <P>The fourth area, was the opportunity as a member of the Seanad to participate in international issues and discussions and, to some extent, to travel abroad in that context.  I took part in several meetings of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  It was interesting to see the different perspectives, not having had much experience before that.  I became an active member of AWEPA, and I know that some Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad are still very active in AWEPA, the link between European and African parliamentarians supporting parliamentary democracy in African countries.  When we started in the early days of AWEPA it was, of course, to address the apartheid issue.  It was important that strong members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad were speaking out on apartheid.  When I became High Commissioner for Human Rights, I had a letter from Archbishop Desmond Tutu, whom I adore, and he asked me to become a member of the eminent group of AWEPA, so I still have a strong link with AWEPA.  He sent me e-mail and I loved the way he was beginning to tell me the reasons that he would like me to serve on the eminent group of AWEPA.  He obviously got tired working and he said: &ldquo;Do this for me, Mary &mdash; how is that for whitemail?&rdquo;  I thought that was a lovely expression, instead of blackmail, it was whitemail.</P>
        <P>That early experience of linking with the issue of apartheid, the need to build up democracy in African countries, the opportunities in the Inter-Parliamentary Union certainly contributed to my growing interest in international human rights, going beyond the human rights at the European level that I was very much engaged in and taking cases to the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and the court in Luxembourg.  I became very interested in development issues, the issues of developing countries and, in particular, issues in Africa.  That is why, when I was elected President, I said at my inauguration that I hoped I would have an opportunity to in some way address international human rights issues.  I was very aware of the limits on the role and powers of the President.  They were more evident then because the office had not been fully developed as thankfully it is now.  It was a great honour to be the first Head of State to go to Somalia in 1992 and to make a number of subsequent visits to Rwanda, after the genocidal killing there, as Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was also an issue which as High Commissioner for Human Rights, I saw both the extent of violations of human rights and also the work of organisations on women&rsquo;s, children&rsquo;s and broad human rights issues and the need to be more supportive, in particular, of rights to food and safe water, health, education, which led to me establishing an organisation called Realising Rights, which was never intended to be permanent and which came to a planned end last December.  In the meantime, travelling in African countries, I became aware of the extent to which climate shocks were undermining poor livelihoods of indigenous farmers, of poor communities and of those in slums.  It was either flooding, prolonged drought and then flash flooding.  The farmers had no seasons to plan and sow.  That led to the establishment of my <Col N="815"/>current work, the Mary Robinson Foundation &mdash; Climate Justice.  This is my last endeavour.  I intend to work at this for the remainder of my time.  Again, I see the early seeds in the Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to turn to the way in which the Seanad itself and the Oireachtas has developed since my time.  There is a much more developed committee system now.  I believe this is a necessary feature of modern parliaments.  I would like to have us reflect a little on the role of elected assemblies in the modern world.  The elders have been very focused on the Arab Spring, on the way in which significant numbers of people were able to come out to the streets and squares because they had social media to contact each other and they knew there would be not just one or two, but ten or 20 or 1,000.  They would be protected by numbers.  I was recently in Tunisia and saw the good election that has taken place and the beginnings of a parliamentary assembly which will begin drafting a new constitution.  Obviously in Egypt there are more difficulties and in many of the countries of the region.  For me it was kind of affirmation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that those from countries where their leaders would have told me as High Commissioner that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is western rights, but these were the very rights that these people were coming out in the street and squares to proclaim.  They wanted human dignity, human rights, democracy, accountability and jobs.  I think we should think across to what is happening in many countries in the developed world, including Ireland.  You have occupy movements, that are questioning the <i>status quo</i>, that are looking for new systems, new approaches.  I wanted to quote from a speech made by Hillary Clinton in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, Women and the Economy Summit, APEC, which was meeting on women and the economy.  It was a very thoughtful speech.  There is a somewhat long passage in it that I think bears reflection:</P>
        <P LI="1">Because when everyone has a chance to participate in the economic life of a nation, we can all be richer.  More of us can contribute to the global GDP and the gap between the developed and the developing contries would narrow significantly as productivity rises in economies from Haiti to Papua New Guinea.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">But that great, global dream cannot be realised by tinkering around the edges of reform.  Nor, candidly, can it be secured though any singular commitment on the part of us here.  It requires, rather, a fundamental transformation, a paradigm shift in how governments make and enforce laws and policies, how businesses invest and operate, how people make choices in the marketplace.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The transformational nature of this undertaking that lies ahead is, in my view, not unlike other momentous shifts in the economic history of our world.  In the 19th century, many nations began moving from an agricultural to an industrial economy.  Then the inventions and mass productions of that era gave rise in the 20th century to the information age and the knowledge economy, with an unprecedented rise in innovation and prosperity.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">As information transcends borders and creates opportunities for farmers to bank on mobile phones and children in distant villages to learn remotely, I believe that here, at the beginning of the 21st century, we are entering the participation age, where every individual, regardless of gender or other characteristics, is poised to be a contributing and valued member of the global marketplace.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">That is a very interesting concept, the participation age.  I invite Members of the Seanad to reflect on what it means for this House that we are entering the participation age.  The Seanad has already begun that process by establishing the Seanad Public Petitions Committee, which I have learned a little more about from the Leader of the House. Having arrived early we had a chance to talk about it. It seems that it is bringing the Seanad closer to the public and hopefully will better inform the public of the work of the Seanad. I am particularly delighted <Col N="816"/>as an official designated elder that the Seanad has adopted the human rights of older people as the theme for this term. I was very pleased to learn that groups have been invited who will address Members on this subject on the floor of the Seanad this afternoon. That would never have happened in my time. That is progress. Things are moving on. I wish Members well in this endeavour and in particular in thinking about the participation age and how elected bodies can serve well and adapt to and become much more inclusive and open and set new trends. T&aacute; &aacute;thas an domhain orm bheith ar ais ar&iacute;s. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh go l&eacute;ir. </P>

	<P>As Leader of the 24th Seanad I am honoured to welcome back Dr. Robinson and I am pleased that she is here as a result of our invitation.  As one of the world&rsquo;s leading human rights advocates she is a most welcome guest here today.  The Seanad Public Petitions Committee has chosen the human rights of older people in Ireland as the focus of our work this term.  Later today for the first time representatives of older people&rsquo;s advocacy groups will address the committee in the Chamber and next Tuesday experts on issues affecting older people in our society will have the opportunity to address the House.  It has been said on several occasions since last May that the 24th Seanad may be the last one but we intend to make it the best one.</P>
        <P>As Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann and as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Dr. Robinson brought world attention to human rights challenges and called for a greater commitment to and action on human rights to make human rights a reality for all.  The presidency of an tIar-Uachtar&aacute;n Mary Robinson was special in many ways.  She will be forever associated with the faithful light in the window of Ar&aacute;s an Uachtar&aacute;in which, sadly, has renewed resonance now that we are witnessing emigration again on a scale not seen for many years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The people are proud of the pioneering role Dr. Robinson played as President of Ireland during her term of office.  She was a President for the people, meeting them in their communities to see at first hand the work of local groups.  She initiated the practice of inviting groups from every area of national life, North and South, to Ar&aacute;s an Uachtar&aacute;in to confirm to them that their work was important to the nation as a whole.  Naturally, she was an inspiration to the people, especially women, to come centre stage to speak of their aspirations and concerns and to show their achievements and success.  She evoked a strong empathy with the Irish Diaspora giving a new focus to their isolation and their wish to be re-included in the national awareness.  She championed the causes of those who strove to overcome barriers of disability, disadvantage, marginalisation to take their rightful place in education and employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On assuming office as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in 1997, Dr. Robinson continued to build on her remarkable achievements as Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann on the international stage as one of Ireland&rsquo;s greatest ambassadors and visionaries.  Throughout her five years of service as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights she achieved remarkable progress in raising the profile of human rights and making them a central issue in all societies.  Having travelled far and wide to promote respect for human rights, she was never afraid to take up the cause of victims of human rights abuses wherever they occurred, nor did she ever tire of lending her powerful voice to the cries of these victims which may not have been heard otherwise.  She gave priority to implementing the then Secretary General&rsquo;s reform proposal to integrate human rights to all activities of the United Nations and she strengthened human rights monitoring in conflict areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Dr. Robinson's relentless commitment in championing the cause of human rights was exemplified following the completion of her term as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in September 2002 by the foundation of Realizing Rights &mdash; The Ethical Globalization Initiative based at Columbia University in New York.  This organisation fostered ethical trade and decent <Col N="817"/>work and promoted the right to health and humane migration policies and encouraged women&rsquo;s participation and leadership in corporate responsibility.  In the course of her significant work with the Realizing Rights initiative, she became conscious of the issue of climate change and its impact especially on developing countries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To this end Dr. Robinson established the Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice to progress further her momentous work to date by endeavouring to address inequalities in climate change.  The fact that she chose to establish the foundation in Ireland to carry on its significant work shows her deep-rooted commitment to this country and to advancing the reputation of Ireland internationally as a society that cares deeply about the plight of those who live in the poorest countries in the world.  The creation of an alliance of innovation between the Mary Robinson Foundation, Trinity College and University College Dublin is noteworthy.  With the support of the foundation, Trinity College and UCD are now developing masters courses in development practice which have attracted a good deal of interest from other universities throughout the world.  I have no doubt these initiatives will raise the profile of these universities internationally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note Dr. Robinson&rsquo;s lifetime commitment to human rights was recognised by the award to her of the US presidential medal of freedom by President Barack Obama in 2009.  She has shown us time and again that with courage, imagination and integrity, everything is possible.  We are grateful that she accepted my invitation to address the House today and to share with us her vision for the future of Ireland. I believe strongly that her commitment to public service and positive communication are of particular relevance to this House as we endeavour to enhance the value and relevance of the Seanad for the benefit of the public. </P>
        
        <P>As Leader of the Upper House, I am committed to improving the way in which the Seanad does its business.  To this end, as Dr. Robinson remarked, the Seanad Public Petitions Committee has been created.  It represents a strong addition to the overall committee system and brings the Seanad closer to the citizen by allowing community representatives to appear before the House.  The Seanad Public Consultation Committee has chosen human rights for older people in Ireland as the focus of its work for this term.  Later this afternoon and for the first time representatives of older people&rsquo;s advocacy groups will address the committee in the Chamber and, next Tuesday, experts on issues affecting older people in our society will have the opportunity to address the House.  I hope that by highlighting these issues and by giving the opportunity to representatives of older people to address Members we will compliment in some way the significant contribution of Dr. Robinson to human rights.  The submissions received from older people&rsquo;s advocacy groups in advance of today&rsquo;s address were especially informative and contain some practical suggestions for consideration, such as the enactment of legislation to regulate the standard of home care services for older people and the provision of inspection for providers of home care services.  The advocacy groups were especially concerned about the introduction of a fuel strategy scheme and the extension of the Citizens Information Board advocacy services which provide advocacy services to older people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I congratulate Dr. Robinson on her trip to the Horn of Africa.  I believe Ireland can be a valuable bridge to the poorest countries in the world.  We have come from poverty and famine ourselves and we have a good record in development aid and, as such, we are uniquely placed to be a voice for the vulnerable and the marginalised throughout the world, just as Dr. Robinson has been for many years.  We are especially pleased to have her here and we wish her many more years of success.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I am delighted, Dr. Robinson, that you are here today.  My first memory of you, which shows my age, was during the year of my intermediate certificate when the presidential campaign was at its height.  Not only did you break new ground in the presidency, you broke new ground in my house in Malahide at the time, which was and still is a strong Fianna F&aacute;il household.  At the time there was a grave disagreement between my mother and father and they voted differently for the first time ever.  As they have continued to do so since, you performed a great service in my house.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have never had an opportunity to talk to you directly, but I personally want to thank you for all the work you have done on behalf of this country.  You have been an absolute credit in every role you played, particularly that of President, but also when you followed on as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. I remember your trip to Somalia vividly as if it was only yesterday. Lighting a candle in the window of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in was symbolic, but you did shine a light into the darkest corners of this world on behalf of the people. That is something the people of Ireland will never forget. I am delighted that you are continuing in your advocacy role and in your many other roles in this country. Your experience, along with the experience of our most recent President, is very valuable in these difficult times for Ireland, Europe and the rest of the world. </P><P Just="Left">Given that he is Leader of the Upper House, Senator Cummins gets the opportunity to say everything I was going to say; therefore, I will be brief. The Leader has outlined what we are trying to do in the Seanad. As someone who has served in the D&aacute;il and in the Seanad, I personally believe there is a great role for this Chamber in the future. I would be most interested, Dr. Robinson, to hear your views on how Seanad &Eacute;ireann can represent Irish citizens better in modern Ireland.</P><P Just="Left">The public consultation committee, on which Members from all groups serve, is a very important initiative. We have focused on the human rights of older people. It is incumbent on us &mdash; your reputation on this is second to none &mdash; to look after people who are vulnerable and marginalised, and that includes the elderly, the poor and people in the developing world. The narrative is all about the economy, which is understandable, but it is incumbent on us not to forget our society and not to forget those who are less well off than us and those who do not even have a house over their heads. </P><P Just="Left">My Fianna F&aacute;il Party colleagues and I are absolutely delighted you are here today. Your opening remarks were most interesting, but I would like to hear your views about the Seanad in the future, and also about Ireland&rsquo;s standing in the developing world. We have a great reputation here, but there is a debate on overseas development aid and whether the budget should be cut, and what this might do to Ireland&rsquo;s name in the developing world. Since you visited so many of these countries, I would be most interested to hear your views on how we should proceed with ensuring that foreign development aid is to the forefront of everything we do, but in this Government and any future government. </P><P Just="Left">I am delighted that you are here. My father forgives you. My parents are back talking after 20 years. I am delighted you have graced us with your presence. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party group, I am delighted, Dr. Robinson, to welcome you very warmly back to the Seanad after some years.  After hearing Senator O&rsquo;Brien describe his intermediate certificate year in 1990, we all feel like elders in this House.</P><Col N="819"/>
        <P>I am so glad you are here today.  Your career has been a credit to Ireland.  You have represented us so well on the international stage and you have been a powerful advocate for human rights &mdash; not just at home, but abroad as well &mdash; throughout your very distinguished career.</P>
        <P>Like Senator O&rsquo;Brien, I feel the Leader has said all I wanted to say in paying tribute to your long and distinguished career, both here in Ireland and overseas.  However, I should say a personal word of thanks to you, because I am the only person here to whom you were not only a lecturer in Trinity College, but also a client of yours as a barrister in a relatively profile case in the late 1980s involving the provision of information on abortion when I was a student leader.  Just as Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s parents have a view on your career, my mother is eternally grateful to you for keeping me out of jail, as she saw it at the time.  She and my grandmother were very enthusiastic footsoldiers for you during the presidential election campaign in 1990 as a direct result of the work you did in representing us in court.</P>
        <P>That work was one of the many ways in which you were prepared to take on issues that were not always popular and issues that often brought a great deal of hostility down upon you at the time, but issues on which you were subsequently vindicated.  Such issues include contraceptive rights and freedom of expression on information on abortion.  Those are issues which we should continue to work on in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I would like to comment briefly on the transformative role you played in the presidency and in the Seanad, before returning to the issue of what we can do in the Seanad to further your work.  You truly transformed the presidency on taking office in 1990 and made it a revitalised office.  It is fair to say that tradition was continued by your successor, Mary McAleese, and I am sure it will be continued by President Michael D. Higgins.  With characteristic modesty, you have not spoken about many of the other aspects of work which you have done since leaving the presidency not only as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, but also as honorary president of Oxfam International, as well as work with the Realizing Rights initiative and the Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice.  I should also mention, as a Trinity College Senator, your work as Chancellor of the University of Dublin, for which we are very grateful.</P>
        <P>During your career in the Seanad, you also took on quite a range of different issues, and you only touched on a few of those.  Your work made a significant contribution in bringing about subsequent change.  Examples include the rights of women to sit on juries, the requirement that all women resign from the Civil Service on marriage, gay rights and changes in the law on homosexuality, work on penal reform and work on heritage and on preserving Wood Quay.</P>
        <P>The work you are doing now with the Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice is extremely exciting and it touches on perhaps the most pressing issue facing us today, although it is hard to look beyond the crisis in eurozone countries.  Clearly, climate change is a genuinely international threat to us all.  The principles of climate justice, which your organisation has adopted and which inform all the activities in which you are engaged, are extremely exciting and extremely important, particularly the need to link human rights with climate justice.  Too often they are seen as two separate things, environmental rights and human rights.  As you say, the international rights framework must encompass the right to climate justice.  I am also glad to see that you have encompassed issues of gender in your work on climate justice.  Climate change impacts differently upon women and men.  This is a very exciting project and I am sure I am not alone in hoping it will not be your last project.  We will endeavour to promote the principles on which you are working in this term in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I would like to finish by speaking again about the Seanad.  Senator O&rsquo;Brien asked how the Seanad can be used in the best way to be representative of people and to express the sort of <Col N="820"/>democracy and participation that you spoke of in your address to us.  How best can we make the Seanad a meaningful and useful forum?  We are trying to do that, as the Leader has said, in what may be the last Seanad, but what we hope will be the best and most effective Seanad.  The fact that you are here addressing us, the fact that Dr. Manning has already been here and the fact that we have a range of groups addressing us in the Chamber this afternoon as part of our public consultation process, are all important reforms to make the Seanad more engaged with the public, more meaningful and to give us more of a role in changing public policy.</P>
        <P>I think there are other areas where the Seanad could again take a leading role on issues such as climate justice and women&rsquo;s rights.  There are still challenging issues that may be better addressed in the Seanad, given our traditional role as a forum for such issues.  I speak, in particular, about women&rsquo;s reproductive rights, the right to abortion and issues to do with the ABC judgment of the European Court of Human Rights last December and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to establish an expert group.  These are issues we need to discuss in the House.</P>
        <P>Dr. Robinson mentioned the strong women&rsquo;s representation in the House.  Some 50% of the members of the Labour Party group are women &mdash; six out of 12 &mdash; about which we are delighted.  However, it is also important that we consider the rights of those in minorities generally, including people with disabilities.  In this term we are focusing on the rights of older people, but we will be focusing, I hope, on other aspects of human rights in the future.</P>
        <P>It is important that we continue to table legislation that would not perhaps get the same hearing in the D&aacute;il, that touches on issues of direct relevance to people and on which the law is still out of date.  I am talking, for example, about changing the law to ensure religions will not have an unduly dominant status, in view of the fact that when it comes to religion persons who describe themselves as having no faith now make up the largest minority group in this country &mdash; Catholics make up the largest religious grouping.  We need to consider all of these issues, even if they are challenging or controversial.  This would be in keeping with the tradition of which Dr. Robinson is the best exemplar in the Seanad but which is and was espoused by others such as Senator Norris and former Senator Mary Henry who took on challenging issues, brought forward matters of social policy and directly helped to bring about social change.  With all of this, we salute Dr. Robinson and look forward to her responses to the questions we all have about how we can best use the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Independent group of Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees, I warmly welcome Dr. Robinson back to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and congratulate her on her truly formidable career to date.  I thank her so much for her inspiration.  She has clearly articulated and illustrated to us the tremendous role she has played as a human rights activist.  I commend her particularly for her steadfast and committed work in the fields of human rights, justice and equality, both in Ireland and internationally.  In 1999, when she was United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, she articulated her understanding of the aim of human rights as follows: </P>
        <P LI="1">To push beyond standard-setting and asserting human rights to make those standards a living reality for people everywhere ... to move beyond the design and drawing-board phase, to move beyond thinking and talking about the foundation stones, to laying those foundation stones, inch by inch, together.</P>
        <P FLI="0">She was true to this understanding of human rights long before her appointment as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  During her 20 years as a Senator she was a human rights activist in the truest sense.  She was never afraid to engage with difficult and controversial issues.  Her vocal opposition and active campaigning on different issues have been instrumental <Col N="821"/>in shaping the Ireland we, as Irish women, live in today.  In her campaign to eliminate discrimination against women she was a key player in improving the living reality for women in Irish society.  Many of the present generation of Irish women entering into employment in the Civil Service are blissfully unaware that until as recently as 1973 they would have been legally obliged to leave their employment upon marriage.  It is equally difficult to comprehend that it was not until 1975 that women were deemed eligible for jury service.</P>
        <P>There have undeniably been advances in the promotion of gender equality in recent years.  However, considering the fact that there have been only 86 female Senators since the first Seanad, as Dr. Robinson said, there is room for improvement.  To share my own memories, almost 20 years ago I attended a training course of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts in Mexico on the diversity of women in our cultures and how we could achieve leadership.  At the time Dr. Robinson was President of Ireland and I can tell her she clearly inspired so many women from around the world, both at the time and afterwards.  In fact, I admire her because she has never deviated from her principles, irrespective of the high level political positions she has held.  Like my colleagues, I would be interested to hear her opinions.  If she were a Member of the 24th Seanad, on what issues would she focus?</P>
        <P>As the outgoing chief executive of the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance, I have been campaigning for many years to strengthen children&rsquo;s rights in the Constitution.  In 1976 Dr. Robinson was, in fact, the first public representative to recognise the need to insert some changes in the Constitution to safeguard the welfare of children.  During the Seanad debate on the Adoption Bill 1976 she expressed her disappointment that a constitutional amendment on adoption would only paper over some of the defects and consequently fail to deliver a broad-based reform of the law in line with the charter on children&rsquo;s rights.  While it is beyond disappointing that in the subsequent 35 years we have not managed to ensure children&rsquo;s rights are upheld in the Constitution, we have arrived at a unique juncture at which there is consensus across the Houses on the need to strengthen children&rsquo;s rights in the Constitution and we have an assurance from the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, that a referendum will be held in 2012.  This action is necessary to positively change the living reality for children in Ireland.  I ask Dr. Robinson for any advice she might give us on how we can get over the line in this referendum.</P>
        <P>I wonder whether Dr. Robinson would share with us her thinking on how best to implement and breathe life into the human rights recommendations made to Ireland during the universal periodic review in Geneva in October.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I echo the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s words of welcome and those of Senators Maurice Cummins, Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, Ivana Bacik and Jillian van Turnhout. Mary Robinson was elected to this House on 2 August 1969 and President 21 years later. Next Saturday week, 3 December, marks the 21st anniversary of her inauguration as President. I wish the party every success and I am sure it will be most enjoyable. She has shaken the hands of tens of thousands of graduates of Trinity College Dublin where she serves with distinction, as Senator Bacik said, as chancellor. In her maiden speech to the House on 2 December 1969 she referred to the gross underuse of the Seanad by the Government. That issue is still topical today, as she will gather. </P>
	<P Just="Left">Mary Robinson&rsquo;s first family planning Bill was launched on 3 March 1971 but was defeated on 7 July. However, that did not deter her in her advocacy of human rights. She sought to allow couples of different religions to be eligible to adopt children. With Trevor West and John Horgan, she introduced family planning Bills in 1973 and 1974. She represented the plaintiffs <Col N="822"/>in an amazing array of cases, including some dealing with the right to import contraceptives, the right of women to serve on juries &mdash; it is incredible that this was actually an issue in our lifetimes &mdash; free legal aid and family law, the succession rights of non-married persons, the right to remarry where a spouse was still alive, and the right to information. She adopted all of these great causes. She is good at the catchphrase too: in its time &ldquo;Mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann&rdquo; was the equivalent of &ldquo;Yes we can.&rdquo; </P>
        <P Just="Left">We remember warmly Mary Robinson&rsquo;s contributions to reconciling the traditions on the island.  She was the first President to attend Remembrance Day ceremonies.  In May 1993 she visited the Queen in Buckingham Palace and three weeks later the west Belfast community festival.  We remember her visits to Somalia and Rwanda and the Irish famine memorial at Grosse-&Icirc;le near Montreal, a deeply moving place which must have influenced her in her concern for places in which famine occurs today and her work on climate change.  We also remember her visit to Manchester after an IRA bomb attack in June 1996 and Enniskillen for the funeral of a Member of this House, Gordon Wilson.</P>
        <P>Mary Robinson is a proud representative of the west and, following her example, the posts of President, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Cathaoirleach of the Seanad are all now held by people from there.  The other three provinces may well need the advocacy of somebody such as Mary Robinson to ensure they will have access to major political posts in Irish public life.  She has also put down roots in this city, especially in this neighbourhood.  She led an early conservation movement to save Wood Quay.  Her husband Nicholas has strong connections with Westland Row and they first met at TCD.  Her climate change work takes place at the end of Kildare Street, on the first turn right.  In a little garden at the back of the Rubrics in TCD Professor George Dawson developed a new variety of daffodil called &ldquo;Mary Robinson&rdquo;.  I hope they grow well and that Dr. Robinson enjoys every spring as they come to life again.  I understand they also grow in the grounds of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.</P>
        <P>I wish to end with a note on Dr. Robinson&rsquo;s kindness.  It is taken from the biography by Olivia O&rsquo;Leary and Helen Burke and refers to the legal work she undertook when Senator David Norris, who is beside me now and who will be asking questions presently along with Senator Crown, challenged the laws against homosexual practice in 1980.  The the book states:</P>
        <P LI="1">I asked David to write down for me what it was like as a boy and as a teenager.  He handwrote for me one of the most moving accounts and the tears came to my eyes as I read of the hurt and pain; the raw pain is what I remember.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I commend these emotions. I thank Dr. Robinson profusely for coming to the House and I wish her well in all her many endeavours on addressing climate change.</P>

	<P>I was completing my intermediate certificate when Dr. Robinson stood in the presidential campaign in 1990.  My family was also divided.  It was always divided between the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il but rather than doing what Senator O&rsquo;Brien did and take sides, I took the best of both parties and joined the republican labour party of Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Dr. Robinson mentioned her activism with regard to her work in the Seanad and after her time in the Seanad in terms of her presidential role and as a High Commissioner in the United <Col N="823"/>Nations.  However, she was also a young activist and her activism preceded her time in the Seanad.  She referred to young people beginning to ask questions.  It is interesting that many of the issues she raised, contraception being one, were seen at the time as radical.  Would anyone see these issues as radical today?  It is important to create space for young people.  Today, we will have older people and representatives of older groups before the Seanad Public Consultation Committee but I hope that we will invite representatives of youth groups to address the Seanad as well.</P>
        <P>I am proud of the work Dr. Robinson did as President of Ireland.  When she met the now Deputy Gerry Adams on the Falls Road in west Belfast many years ago, it was seen as a brave move.  Dr. Robinson mentioned Dr. Maurice Manning&rsquo;s visit to the House some weeks ago and referred to the good, frank and straight discussion in the House about human and civil rights.  He made the point that human and civil rights abuses are not only issues for developing countries but that human rights abuses take place in the developed world and in this country as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I seek Dr. Robinson&rsquo;s opinion on two issues.  There is a need for an all-Ireland Bill of Rights.  This is committed to in the Good Friday agreement.  It is important to establish what exactly human rights are and to put them on a statutory footing.  This would enable legislators and Government to vindicate the rights of citizens and this is the most important thing that we can do.  The second question relates to the UN millennium development goals and the need for us to continue to support overseas aid.  Despite the fact that we have significant problems in this country, sometimes they pale in comparison to what is taking place in developing countries.  We must continue to support people living in real poverty and in situations where there is famine in the world.  I seek Dr. Robinson&rsquo;s opinion on these issues.</P>

As a west of Ireland Senator I am particularly honoured to welcome Dr. Robinson home to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Her visit today brings back happy memories of a special day in 1993 when, as Chairman of Galway County Council, I welcomed her as Uachtar&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann to the county hall.  It goes without saying that we are particularly proud of her achievements as an academic, a barrister, a politician, a UN high commissioner and as President.

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Docht&uacute;ir Mhic R&oacute;ib&iacute;n freisin.  I am honoured to be given the opportunity to offer a few words and to ask a question as well.  My memory goes back to 1990 when I was a new teacher in a small, four-teacher school in Athenry, Galway, in the west of Ireland.  I remember the great joy we experienced together on her election.  It was perhaps the first time we had ever spoken as a small staff in that way about what turned out to be a coming of age and a coming out for Ireland which Dr. Robinson began.  In many ways she started what she has spoken of today as the new age of participation.  Dr. Robinson started that journey for us a long time ago.  It has struck me &mdash; Senator van Turnhout <Col N="824"/>remarked on this as well &mdash; that she has never deviated from her principles.  I would be obliged if she would say something today about the key influences in her life growing up in the west.  What drove her on, despite remarkable opposition at times, to fight injustice and to become a champion of human rights in Ireland and throughout the world at so many levels?  For me, she has never simply lived in Ireland; she has been of the world.  What were the key influences for her which spurred this on?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have a specific question about injustice against girls and I was struck by the way she spoke about the issue of child marriages.  Recently in the House we held a debate on gendercide and the selective abortion of baby girls or the fatal neglect of baby girls in China and India as a means of population control.  What leadership does Dr. Robinson believe we in the Seanad could offer to fight this problem from an Irish perspective?  What is her view on how we can lead this forward?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I echo all that has been said.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Docht&uacute;ir Mhic R&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  Like others I have reminiscences about her time in public life.  I have had the honour on more than one occasion of visiting her office in Geneva as part of a parliamentary delegation when she was the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  I will always remember the great honour we felt at having an Irish woman in such a key, important role at international level at a time when we remained somewhat under the colonial yoke and when we were still emerging as a nation.  As Senator Healy Eames suggested, Dr. Robinson&rsquo;s period of office as President was a coming out.  I remember especially the deep feeling of patriotic joy we experienced because she was in such a pivotal position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have another memory of one of our visits to Geneva.  As Dr. Robinson was reflecting on some incidents in her life I recall the inevitable family photograph was to be taken in her office.  The UN flag was placed behind her desk but it was destined to be not quite in the frame of the photograph.  Me being me, I decided I would move it because no one else was going to move it.  There was a spike on the top of the flag pole and, as I moved it, it shot straight up through the ceiling and created a large hole.  I have often reflected on it since and whether it was fixed subsequently or whether Dr. Robinson got into trouble because some mad Irish people had come in and trashed her office.</P>
        <P>On another occasion we were there when Dr. Robinson was in the process of leaving office and I believe she was subject to a considerable personal dilemma.  If memory serves me correctly she had been offered a second term and she was anguishing over the option.  I felt privileged, as did the group with us, that we were discussing these issues and the wider implications of the move she inevitably made.  I believe that Dr. Robinson upon reflection has no doubt that she made the right decision because she has managed to stride the world stage in a continuing and important role.  She brings great credit and pride to this country as a result of the activities in which she is involved.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like to ask Dr. Robinson a variation of the question on the role of the Seanad.  As a constitutional lawyer and former Senator, how would she justify the continuance of the second Chamber against a somewhat indifferent public fuelled by an equally indifferent media which seems to have obscured the original intention of this House, which was to act as a check and balance against big government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I warmly welcome Dr. Robinson to the House.  I am delighted she took time out to be here.  It is a great honour for the House.  When I told my wife Mary she <Col N="825"/>was coming, she could not resist the opportunity to sit in Visitors Gallery because she is a great admirer of hers.</P>
        <P>Today is a significant day for Dr. Robinson to come to the House because it starts the 16 days of action opposing violence against women here and throughout the world.  As a member of the Council of Europe, Dr. Robinson is particularly active in this regard and nobody has been a greater advocate of fighting for the rights of women than she has, in particular on the issue of violence against women.  I thank the Leader of the House for inviting her here today.</P>
        <P>When I was Minister of State at the Department of Health from 1987 to 1989, Dr. Robinson was a Senator.  We were in the antechamber when this room was undergoing reconstruction.  My officials hoped she would not be present not because they did not like or admire her, but because they knew she would be incisive on a Bill.  We had a great discussion on the removal of the word &ldquo;illegitimacy&rdquo; from what was a very good Bill.  The then Senator played a very important role and, like everything she contributes to, she was very incisive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In her role as a former High Commissioner for Human Rights, I hope Dr. Robinson gets an opportunity, with The Elders, to visit Gaza and Palestine.  They have taken a particular interest in the area.  Gaza is an open prison and a sore in the region.  I hope she helps to bring peace and harmony between Israel and Palestine.  I was asked by Senator Power, who could not be here for her speech because she had other commitments, to raise that issue.</P>
        <P>As Dr. Robinson is well aware, the report of the Basuni commission has just been published.  It vindicates the testimony of Irish trained medics and other Bahrainians regarding torture in custody following the anti-government protests earlier this year.  It also highlights the increased repression by the Bahrain regime of the civil and political rights of its people, in particular the Shi&rsquo;ite minority.  Have The Elders discussed the situation in Bahrain with Dr. Robinson?  I urge her to do anything she can to help them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is good to have Dr. Robinson in the House.  I stand here, proud to be hatless and a woman in the Seanad.  I take this opportunity to thank her for standing up for mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wanted to touch on the issue of participation, which Dr. Robinson raised.  I would like to pay tribute to a group of women who were well ahead of their time, namely, the women who educated Dr. Robinson and me.  They were a group of nuns who took the view that women had an equal right to take part in public life.  They encouraged me, and I have no doubt they encouraged Dr. Robinson, to stand up and take our place in the public arena if that is what we wanted to do.  They believed women had that right.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Today, I would like to ask Dr. Robinson to dwell on the thought that we are here at a time when the representation of women is falling or stagnant in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am part of an organisation, the 5050 Group, which is trying to achieve 50% representation by 2020.  I am sure Dr. Robinson is aware of it.  I would welcome her views on whether this is appropriate and whether the Seanad could have a role in it.  The issue is of the utmost urgency.  I am tired of listening to people say we have an economic and financial crisis and will deal with the women thing later.  We have to deal with it now given that 50% of the population in the country are women.</P>
        <P>As Senator Leyden mentioned, I would like to support women who are struggling with domestic violence in this country.  Dr. Robinson mentioned being in the Seanad means having patience and stamina, yet thousands of women every year are telephoning and looking for assistance.  Women are the subject of abuse and violence of all kinds every day and there are still a number of counties in Ireland, including Sligo where I live, Roscommon and Longford, where there are no emergency shelters.</P><Col N="826"/>
        <P>I would like to hear the views of Dr. Robinson on how the Seanad could become involved.  We talk about participation.  First, we do not have enough women.  Second, many women cannot and will never be able, because of the way they are being treated in this State, to be able to participate in public life.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, would like to be associated with the fitting tributes paid by leaders to Dr. Robinson and welcome her to the House.  As a member of the Labour Party, I was very privileged and honoured to be part of her campaign team during the presidential election.  What I most admired about her was the minute she took up the Office of the President, she no longer represented the people who campaigned for her but every citizen in the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Dr. Robinson is the most successful woman to have ever sat in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  She has gone onto become renowned worldwide.  She is an iconic figure and a very well respected opinion shaper.  It is a great boost to all of us here to note that she started her political career in this House.  My question is similar to Senator Mooney&rsquo;s.  I would be interested to know her opinion on the proposal to abolish the Seanad.  Is she in favour of reform and retention, as she reformed the Office of the President?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish Dr. Robinson well and continued good work.  I hope, like her daffodils, she will continue blooming.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Dr. Robinson for her unceasing commitment to and inspiring authority in human rights activism, as her life and address gave witness to us today.  I have been given one minute to ask her a question.  If I had one billion minutes it would not be enough time to affirm, acknowledge and thank her for all she has done, particularly the way in which she has inspired my life path.  As she knows, this Seanad, as the Leader and Deputy Leader have outlined, has focused on the protection and championing of human rights and equality. It is our primary theme and I thank her for her contribution to this work. It will stay with us for a long time. </P>
        
        <P>My question centres on what I consider a key human rights issue for Ireland today, namely, the proposed merger of the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission.  In order to get this merger right, the Bill to establish the new commission must include a crystal clear guarantee of its independence, that the legislative and European concept of equal treatment is a core component, that its functions in regard to independent assistance for victims of discrimination must be protected and enhanced and that it promotes social dialogue with NGOs and social partners.  What advice would Dr. Robinson give to us for our upcoming scrutiny of the Bill to establish a human rights and equality commission?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome Dr. Robinson.  As we are on the theme of showing one&rsquo;s age, my parents decided that instead of attending civic classes in school in 1977, I would be sent out to support her in her campaign for the Dublin Rathmines West constituency.  I was a lot younger than I should have been, about 11 or 12 years of age.  I learned a lot about political culture and Dr. Robinson&rsquo;s wonderful vision and commitment as a member of civil society.  I admire her.  When I was director of the Project Arts Centre, she visited as President and she also attended many productions by little known companies and artists who are now some of the leading champions of the arts.  She made that connection with them at a young, emerging age, which I appreciate.</P><Col N="827"/>
        <P Just="Left">I will not dwell on the Seanad reform question but Dr. Robinson will acknowledge that we have an appetite within to change.  Many of the changes initiated by the House were proposed by the group of Independent Senators, on which I would like her to comment.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the notion of the age of participation and using social media such as Facebook to make connections.  Young people, in particular, feel alienated from what they see as a traditional, centralised part of the democratic system which is at a remove.  This is a reminder that in my role as a Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominee I need to make sure connections continue in this age of participation.</P>
        <P>Will Dr. Robinson outline her sense of what is happening on the Horn of Africa in order that we might be able to pursue her insight into the current plight there?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I take great pleasure in welcoming Dr. Robinson back to the House.  We were fellow scholars many years ago in Trinity College and I have followed her career with the greatest of admiration, as it evolved from membership of Dublin City Council to the Seanad to Aras an Uachtar&aacute;in and the Office of the UN High Commission for Human Rights.  She then worked on a group that initially was supposed to consider ethical globalisation but I gather that was regarded as a bit of a mouthful and it became Realizing Rights.  The notion that financial globalisation should be unaccompanied by the development of an ethical system to support and regulate it would be disastrous and I applaud her for taking this initiative but perhaps she was correct to change the name to Realizing Rights.  The principles that have underlain her career support the pursuit of human rights and dignity not just theoretically but in action.</P>
        <P>I would like Dr. Robinson to comment on the question of population because it seems that the extraordinary expansion in population in my lifetime &mdash; the global population was 3 billion when I did my intermediate certificate and it has now reached 7 billion &mdash; is having a huge impact on resources, the environment, political tensions and relations between nations and it also raises economic issues.  Previous speakers obliquely referred to the situation that obtains in this House and generally throughout the world where human rights considerations are ruthlessly driven off the agenda by the priorities associated with the economic difficulties the entire planet is facing.  Does she have any comment on that?  I believe they are all interconnected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will Dr. Robinson comment on the status of gay people and organisations throughout the world?  I acknowledge one or two respected international organisations have received accreditation at bodies such as the UN but we still have the situation where in Uganda right wing Christian groups have almost succeeded in introducing the death penalty for consensual relations.  There was an appalling incident, of which I am sure Dr. Robinson is aware, where two young men were hanged from the back of a lorry in Iran simply for the crime of private expression of their love for each other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I echo the remarks about Dr. Robinson&rsquo;s achievements and, as somebody who was a member of the Diaspora when she was President, I experienced a surge of pride in the Irish community when somebody who had been as outward looking, internationalist and mould breaking in the context of Irish politics had been elected to the position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am fascinated and impressed by Dr. Robinson's commitment to spreading democracy.  Has she given thought to the current threats to democracy?  I am worried and part of my worry stems from the fact that in many mature, established democracies such as ours we have become somewhat complacent.  We have not had the experience of not knowing what it is like to live in a democracy or the more direct experience of living in a polity that is not democratic.  We sometimes blithely assume that even if we show an ongoing level of disrespect for our democracy, it will always be there.  I do not necessarily believe there is an inevitability about that.</P><Col N="828"/>
        <P Just="Left">I draw Dr. Robinson's attention to two specific rights issues that she might endorse in this phase of her career.  I have, perhaps indelicately on a number of occasions, when Ministers or other guests were sitting in her chair and they were doing a wonderful, vigorous and outstanding job, reminded them that they had passed the mandatory age of retirement.  I would never be so indelicate as to personalise this in Dr. Robinson&rsquo;s case but I had to politely remind a number of Ministers and other high achievers who sat in her seat that if they had been in the health service or other parts of the public service, they would have been subject to mandatory retirement and, in effect, denied the right to continue working if they wished to do so.  I was equally intrigued to go through the list of the wonderful older people who continue to contribute, including Nelson Mandela, 95, Desmond Tutu, 81, and Jimmy Carter, 87.  We are cutting off our noses to spite our face if we think that in future we will not be able to tap into the expertise of such people bring.</P>
        <P>One of the most fundamental rights deficiencies in this country is citizens not having the right to elect Members of this House.  It is an affront to democracy.  I believe, for complex reasons I should not go into now, that a fine argument can be advanced for bicameral representation but there is a clear need for people of vision and experience who have worked within our system and who have examined other systems to advocate for more fundamental constitutional and Oireachtas reform because whatever mess we find ourselves in now and whatever blame can be laid at the door of the Government, little of it can be laid at the door of this House, which, at worst, was asleep at the tiller while errors and sins of commission were perpetrated by successive Governments and D&aacute;ileanna.</P>
        <P>Would Dr. Robinson consider taking on a position of public advocacy for a more nuanced, comprehensive vision of Oireachtas reform and not merely a &ldquo;Yes or No, let&rsquo;s abolish it&rdquo; forum?  It must be recalled that 38 esteemed and respected Members are either members of political parties or were nominated by the leaders of parties that are committed to the abolition of the House.  For us to discuss today how the Seanad can be made a little more worthwhile is a little like going to the stereotypical character on death row in Alabama who has had his last meal but has not yet been executed and asking how the last few hours of his life could be made more relevant to the rest of society.  Should we think about a more healthy and long-term future for a thoroughly reformed Oireachtas?</P>
        <P>I very much thank Dr. Robinson for what she has done for our generation and generations to come.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I have long been an admirer of Dr. Robinson and her work, although I was only two when she was elected Uachtar&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann.  </P>
        <P>I was struck by the Hillary Clinton passage she read in her address and the statement that when everybody has the opportunity to participate, the economy will be richer.  She asked us to reflect on the participation age and she mentioned the improved gender balance in this Seanad.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe, I would like to know Dr. Robinson&rsquo;s reflections on female participation in public life and, more specifically, on gender quotas.  In her view of the role of elected assemblies in the modern world, does she see a role for quotas to maximise all participation in public life where it is needed?  How can we, or should we, change our political system, whether that is through the vehicle of Seanad reform, to bring in, for example, more young people and minorities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Dr. Mary Robinson</NameTxt>
	<P>I begin with an apology.  I have breached protocol twice.  I arrived half an hour early &mdash; the Captain of the Guard and everybody else was not expecting me to arrive so soon &mdash; and then sat down to deliver my speech.  However, there was no insult intended.  I <Col N="829"/>realised immediately that I should have stood when Senators started to ask their questions.  I think it is because I have never sat in this chair before.</P>
        <P>I may disappoint those who asked some very good questions because as an iar-Uachtar&aacute;n, a former President, I do not intend to go into the specific details of Irish policy.  I will speak in general terms, but to make my points I may sometimes come near to the wire, as I have always tried to do.  I will try to answer the questions posed, but if they have been too specific, I ask the Members to bear with me because it is an honourable tradition.  There are two former Presidents and we will both continue in the tradition of former Presidents.  I remember learning so much from President Hillery and how he conducted himself as an iar-Uachtar&aacute;n and I will try to do the same.</P>
        <P>I will begin by responding to Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.  His tributes moved me very much, not just the nice things said but also the warmth of the voice will stay with me.  He evoked a memory.  About five years ago I gave a talk in the United States, in Boise, Idaho which is almost in the middle of that large country.  There was a relatively good audience and, understandably, there was an Irish contingent.  I spoke about ethical globalisation or human rights.  At the end of the session a relatively young woman &mdash; perhaps in her early 30s &mdash; came forward and she had an air of purpose.  She put out her hand as I got down from the rostrum and said, &ldquo;I want to shake your hand.  You got my first vote.  I was 19 at the time and when I told my father, he nearly killed me.&rdquo;   I will tie in that moment with the question which I can only answer in the following way.  I was asked what would I regard as my greatest achievements.  Certainly, the greatest honour was being elected President of Ireland, Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann.  As my successor Mary McAleese said about her time as President, every day is special, every day is precious and it is an incredible honour.  I do not think anything else compares with it.</P>
        <P>On Ireland&rsquo;s standing in the developing world, we can reflect on the fact &mdash; I hear it all the time &mdash; that it has good standing, particularly in African countries but also in Bangladesh and parts of Latin America.  I made many state and some working visits when I was President and had the privilege of meeting the Irish community.  One facet of the Irish community that touched me deeply and still does is the priests and nuns who have spent periods of 27, 30, 40 or 42 years in various countries.  I remember the time when I was on a State visit to Brazil, having completed similar visits to Argentina and Chile.  A reception was held in Rio de Janeiro which focused, in particular, on the Irish who had served in Brazil in many ways but particularly the religious and aid workers.  When I asked a priest where he had come from, he said I would not know it; it had taken him 43 hours by bus to get to Rio de Janeiro.  He was working in a very remote part of Brazil.</P>
        <P>The reception provided generous hospitality with smoked salmon and all kinds of nice things being served, but I noticed a group of priests and nuns who were eating only rice.  I invited them to help themselves to the different foods on offer, but they explained that their stomachs would not be able to deal with them.  They were living in poor communities and could no longer each rich food.  On many occasions ambassadors presenting their credentials told me they had been educated by the Christian Brothers or the Loreto nuns, even though they themselves were Muslim.  This has been a wonderful contribution to education and the Irish aid agencies and Irish Aid have built on this tradition.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt in my mind that we have a reputation because we have never offered tied aid or had any self-interest in our aid programme.  There are compelling reasons we should continue this tradition as strongly as possible.  There is, first, a moral imperative and a huge need for this, a point to which I will return briefly.  Second, we are forming relations with parts of the world that are becoming more empowered.</P><Col N="830"/>
        <P>To say the least, communications in our world have become much more global and the participation of countries has become more significant.  In many cases, what is happening in developing countries, including in African countries, is very positive.  They are beginning not only to develop their political systems but also their economies.  I saw a statistic at a recent conference on African agriculture and wealth creation held in Tunisia by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation &mdash; the population of Africa will double by 2050.  It is a continent with huge potential and I will deal with the question about population in that context.</P>
        <P>It is true that the population of the world is increasing very rapidly.  The birth of the seven billionth children was acknowledged by the Secretary General of the United Nations at the end of October.  The six billionth child is now 12 years old, which means one billion children were born in that short space of time.  I understand it will be 16 years before the eight billionth child is born.  Therefore, the rate is slowing down slightly, but there is still a very rapid increase.</P>
        <P>The only health hat I wear is that of the chairperson of a global leaders council on reproductive health.  We are trying to make the case in the UN system and globally that access to family planning and reproductive health services is absolutely essential.  It is a right which must be supported strongly by governments.  There has been some retrenchment in funding in some countries, in particular, as we know very well.  There is, however, a very clear way by which it is possible to have a welcome reduction in population size in places where there are strains on population, that is, by way of the education of girls and women and providing access to reasonable health care services.  In fact, access to health care services is as important as access to education.  If maternal and child mortality rates were to be reduced, the number of children each woman would have would be reduced.  There are many statistics to prove this fact and it is a very important one.</P>
        <P>A reference was made to the rights of children under the Constitution and the universal periodic review.  I will not be too specific in my response.  The universal periodic review marks a real step forward.  Under the Human Rights Council, all governments submit to the review and there is strength in numbers in this regard.  It is important that Ireland take seriously the results of the review in order that we will reinforce the responsibility to ensure the protection and promotion of human rights.</P>
        <P>I wish to answer the questions about the Seanad and its reform but not in specific terms because it is a matter for Members.  However, a number of the issues raised by Senators are ones on which the Seanad could play a more active role.  I note the hearings to take place this afternoon on issues affecting the elderly and next week with experts.  There is plenty of expertise in Ireland in the consortium dealing with issues related to ageing, and there are others with very good ideas.  I very much agree with the suggestion that young people&rsquo;s groups should be included.  A start has been made on ensuring the human rights of the elderly, and it might be very useful to give a real opportunity to representatives of young people and people with disabilities.  There is a variety of such groups and it should not always be related to requests for more funding and resources.  There is a need for a thoughtful contribution which the Seanad can make.</P>
        <P>It has been noted that the 16 day campaign to combat violence against women has just commenced.  I am glad that Ireland has a good reputation and a role to play in this regard.  I am glad to support the consortium combatting violence against women which is now in its seventh year.  The consortium will meet tomorrow to discuss the latest developments.  At that meeting the T&aacute;naiste will launch the plan of action of Ireland under Security Council Resolution 1325.  I am aware of no other country with this type of consortium, which includes the Government, through Irish Aid; the Defence Forces; the Garda, which has participated though <Col N="831"/>involvement in overseas missions; and all of the NGOs which deal in humanitarian and development issues.  It is a very good practice and I have praised it abroad.</P>
        <P>There was a reference to representatives of The Elders visiting Gaza; in fact, that has already happened.  Anybody who is interested in The Elders should visit its website, <i>theelders.org</i>.  I agree with Senators&rsquo; points regarding the problems in Bahrain, as highlighted by The Elders, and other countries in that region.  The  head of the independent commission which investigated abuses in Bahrain, Cherif Bassiouni, an eminent lawyer, produced his report yesterday.  The King of Bahrain was obliged to sit and listen as Mr. Bassiouni outlined his hard-hitting conclusions.</P>
        <P>In regard to my personal influences, reference was made to the Sacred Heart nuns.  They were certainly an influence during my six years as a boarder in Mount Anville.  We were very much encouraged by them to consider how issues of poverty and development in poor countries might be addressed.  I was also fortunate enough to have a reference point within my family.  My father had two sisters, both of whom became nuns.  One of them worked in India for more than 30 years where she learned several local languages.  When she returned to Ireland as an older woman we soon discovered her yoga skills.  She startled my children and me when we first saw her swimming in cold water in Mayo or Kerry.  We were very disinclined to join her.  In school, I read the works of some of those who sought to change the world based on ethical values, including Ghandi, Eleanor Roosevelt &mdash; who played a key role in the development of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights &mdash; and Martin Luther King.  These were the types of influences which helped to shape me and I hope they continue to be widely read.</P>
        <P>Women&rsquo;s participation and empowerment is an issue about which I continue to feel strongly.  Members may be interested in some of the work we are doing in this regard by way of the Mary Robinson Foundation &mdash; Climate Justice.  For example, I recently moderated the COP 16 conference in Cancun in Mexico on gender and climate change.  This meeting involved several important contributors &mdash; the Mexican Foreign Minister, who was chair of the conference; the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, Christiana Figueres; the European Union Commissioner on climate action, Connie Hedegaarde; together with a Minister from Denmark and one from Ecuador.  The delegates indicated their pleasure at having an opportunity to address a conference which specifically linked gender issues and climate change.  The gender dimensions are very evident when one sees how it is undermining poor, indigenous farmers.</P>
        <P>This brought home to me something I learned in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  When I was first elected to the House I was one of only six female Senators.  We did not have a significant impact on the types of issues which were of particular relevance to women such as reform of the adoption law, although we did some work on that, maternity law and so on.  It was only when our number subsequently grew to 13 that we achieved the critical mass necessary to make a difference and influence the agenda.  I have realised that we will not have progress on gender and climate change unless we create a platform of female leaders.  That is what we have done; we have created a troika plus of women leaders on gender and climate change.</P>
        <P>I will travel to Durban this weekend for the next conference, which is being hosted by South Africa.  On the first day of the conference, which is Monday, three women will handle the hand-over from Mexico to South Africa, namely, the Mexican Foreign Minister and her South African counterpart, in the presence of the executive secretary of the UNFCCC process.  All three women have committed to highlighting gender and women&rsquo;s leadership in the context of climate.  There will be other meetings in South Africa of a similar nature.  It is something to reflect on for those who see the need, as I do, to improve participation of women in Ireland.  Critical mass is important and probably, since we are not looking as good as we should be <Col N="832"/>internationally, special steps, even if they are temporary, to improve the situation.  As I said, I have to speak in very general terms.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was asked to comment on my impressions on returning to Somalia and the Horn of Africa.  I am haunted by the things I saw.  My first impression was that everything was worse than when I was there as President of Ireland in 1992.  On that occasion, we went in October and the same group was involved, comprising Concern, Tr&oacute;caire and Oxfam.  At the time of our first visit in October 1992 the rainy season was almost at an end and there were significant difficulties in getting food to the feeding stations, past Dhahar and Mogadishu, because of the conflict between warlords.  During our visit in July of this year a state of famine was declared by the United Nations.  The criteria for that are very strict and we were told at the time that some 28,000 children had died of hunger.  The toll has increased since.</P>
        <P>The situation overall has improved slightly because of the huge support from this country and elsewhere, but it is still quite severe.  In 1992, I spoke to the two warlords who were primarily responsible for problems in the region.  Nick even accused me of poking them in the stomach, which I did not do, but I did speak rather severely to them about letting the food through to the feeding stations.  One could have that type of discussion, even in difficult circumstances, but there is no way one could talk to al-Shabaab.  It is a vicious group, linked to al-Qaeda, which inflicts horrible wrongs on its own people.</P>
        <P>One of the most concerning aspects from my point of view was the realisation that in 1992 we did not even mention climate.  We knew that Ethiopia, parts of Kenya and the Horn of Africa generally suffered from time to time from drought and earlier periods of food shortage or famine, but that was all.  The latest statistics on the Horn of Africa are very compelling, with the region experiencing its eight hottest years ever in succession.  We will not have to wait 19 years for the next severe drought.  Already some 13 million people in the wider Horn of Africa are suffering from problems of food shortage.  On the issue of development aid, Ireland has a very good reputation in regard to hunger and food security, thanks to Irish Aid and to people like Tom Arnold who are recognised internationally as experts on the issue.  We have developed important links in this regard and Ireland is regarded as a leader on hunger and food security.  Those needs will be there in the future as the undermining of climate places increasing numbers of people at risk of starvation or severe malnutrition.</P>
        <P>One of the most difficult experiences of our recent visit to Somalia was visiting the health clinic in Dilla &mdash; there is a photograph there of my previous visit, 19 years before, which I found affecting &mdash; where we saw severely malnourished children being weighed and their mothers given packets of Plumpy&rsquo;nut.  They were told that if the children took two portions a day over a period of two weeks, they would stabilise and be able to gain weight.  However, I was told that in many cases, when the mothers return home, their other children, who are desperately hungry, would take some of the Plumpy&rsquo;nut rations.  Even the mothers, desperate to stay alive, sometimes take them.  That is the hardest part.  If children become stunted because of severe malnutrition in the first two years, they will never regain their full physical and mental capability.  This goes to the core of human rights &mdash; how can we do this to children?</P>
        <P>I am very appreciative that even at a time of severe economic recession and family suffering in this country, the generosity of the Irish people to the Horn of Africa, and specifically to Somalia, is something of which we can be proud and on which we can build.</P>
        <P>I was asked to reflect briefly on how gay people were treated internationally.  It is true that the United Nations has very late in the day been willing to appreciate work done elsewhere on a declaration in this regard.  However, it is also true that many countries, particularly those on the African continent &mdash; specifically, Uganda and Iran &mdash; have been savage in the way they <Col N="833"/>have addressed the issue of gay people.  I was very troubled by the idea of threatening to cut off aid to countries which had bad policies in this area.  That would not be helpful because it would immediately evoke a kind of post-colonial relationship and have a counter-impact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Dr. Mary Robinson</NameTxt>
	<P>It would also be likely to encourage people to dig in.  This matter must be addressed with a great deal of discernment and subtlety.</P>
        <P>To return to the question of what I would do if I was a Member of the Seanad today, in the current climate every institution and organisation in modern Ireland will be obliged to justify its existence.  There is a great deal more scrutiny and &mdash; this is a good development &mdash; accountability.  In this age of participation, the level of that accountability will increase.  It may be good that a question mark has been placed over the 24th Seanad.  What has happened means Members are thinking about the matter in a way all institutions should be doing in the context of evaluating whether they are responding to the needs of the age of participation.  Those in the Seanad are not only thinking, they are also changing their ways of operating.</P>
        <P>My final message would be to offer huge encouragement to Members in what they are doing.  Whatever the future holds, it is out of the hands of Senators, as well as those of everyone else.  Members should take heart from the fact that, to some extent, they are being obliged to justify themselves more publicly in order to provide leadership in a way which makes them more relevant.  This does not just include the Seanad, it also includes what individual Senators do in their ways of operating.  Like many others, I was listening to the radio this morning and heard a Member of this House refer to the need for children to take more exercise.  I thought that this resonated well because the individual in question was speaking as a Senator and indicating that he was a Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominee and, therefore, had to find a way in which he could be more effective.  I encourage individual Senators, regardless of whether they represent a party or of how they gained membership of the House, to voice whatever concerns they may have in public.  They must make the point that they care about the issues at a time when there are many such issues about which to be concerned.  They should proceed in a way that allows them to link what they are doing with this Chamber and must also take account of the possibility that issues with which they might be involved could be dealt with here at a later date.</P>
        <P>I could go on, but my time is probably exhausted.  Again, I thank Senators warmly.  It was difficult to sit here and listen to such tributes.  There is a downside and if my husband, Nick, were here, he would indicate what it is.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Dr. Robinson.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, will formally thank her on behalf of Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am honoured to have the privilege to propose a vote of thanks to Dr. Robinson.  Before doing so, I wish to dwell on a couple of minor issues of relevance to our guest.  Dr. Robinson, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Cathaoirleach and the President all come from the west.  If that proves anything, it is that Oliver Cromwell was wrong.</P>
        <P>I became a Member of the Seanad in the year Dr. Robinson left, 1989.  In 1990, when Dr. Robinson was travelling the country and fighting her presidential campaign, my sister and I visited Romania.  The purpose of our going there was to enable my sister to adopt two Romanian boys who are now adults.  On the day Dr. Robinson was elected President, I recall leaving Bucharest at approximately 4 a.m.  This was just after the overthrow of Ceaucescu and in addition to it being a cold morning, the general atmosphere was chilly.  As a result, we encountered difficulty in flying back to London.  I must confess that when I eventually arrived <Col N="834"/>back in Bantry in west Cork at 8 p.m., I cast my vote for the late Brian Lenihan Snr.  When my sister eventually adopted her two children and brought them back to Ireland, I had the good fortune to act as godfather to one of them.  At the christening my sister informed me that she had been privileged and honoured to vote for Mary Robinson.  I have seven sisters, most of whom live abroad.  However, if the others lived here, I believe they would have followed her example.</P>
        <P>As a person from west Cork and as Leas-Chathaoirleach, I am honoured to inform the House &mdash; many Senators will already know this &mdash; that Dr. Robinson launched her presidential campaign in Allihies on the Beara Peninsula.  As one of the people who founded the Sheep&rsquo;s Head Way &mdash; Sl&iacute; Muintir Bh&aacute;ire &mdash; walk, I have very fond memories of being master of ceremonies at the top of the Goat&rsquo;s Path on the occasion Dr. Robinson unveiled a beautiful stone seat on which is inscribed some of Seamus Heaney&rsquo;s poetry.  I spoke to her, as Gaelige, that morning about the ceo dra&iacute;ochta.  There was a wonderful mist hanging over the peninsula on that occasion but it cleared once Dr. Robinson arrived.  I do not know if she exercised any spiritual influence over the mist, but it was a wonderful occasion.</P>
        <P>I have fond memories of the way in which the role of President evolved during Dr. Robinson&rsquo;s term of office.  While in office, she visited St. James&rsquo;s Church &mdash; Church of Ireland &mdash; in Durrus and, close to where I live in Bantry, CoAction West Cork&rsquo;s St. Joseph&rsquo;s workshop for the mentally disadvantaged.  She also visited places in Schull and Mizen Head.  I have great memories of her visits to west Cork.</P>
        <P>Recently I was honoured to represent this Parliament at a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Bern where I spoke about Ireland&rsquo;s contribution in dealing with the terrible situation on the Horn of Africa and was fortunate enough to hear a speech delivered by Ban Ki-Moon.  On the night before I returned home I was having a meal when I was approached by an African gentleman who was approximately 60 years of age.  He had probably heard the old west Cork brogue and asked, &ldquo;Conas at&aacute; t&uacute;?&rdquo;  I was somewhat startled, but he smiled and informed me that he had attended UCC and played rugby for, I believe, Dolphin in Cork.  He then asked, &ldquo;How is the esteemed Mary Robinson?&rdquo;  I think he was Nigerian and certainly caught me off guard when he asked, &ldquo;Conas at&aacute; t&uacute;?&rdquo;  It is interesting that when one visits different parts of the world, one can be reminded of the importance &mdash; in more ways than one &mdash; of Dr. Robinson to Ireland.</P>
        <P>It is a singular privilege and honour for me to propose a vote of thanks to Dr. Robinson.  I extend our gratitude and express very deep appreciation for the honour she has bestowed on this Chamber and every Member present.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith ag an Docht&uacute;ir M&aacute;ire Mhic R&oacute;ib&iacute;n, duine f&iacute;or-uasal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Leader, I am deeply honoured to be asked to make some brief concluding comments and thank Dr. Robinson on behalf of the Leader of the House, Senator Cummins, and all our colleagues.  We are so grateful to Dr. Robinson for accepting Senator Cummins&rsquo;s invitation to come before the Seanad to address us.  We all thank her very much for her powerful advocacy over many years in promoting and advancing human rights and equality.  She has made such an immense contribution and, as others have said, she has been an inspiration and an iconic figure to many across the world.</P>
        <P>I thank Dr. Robinson also for her very full, considered, gracious and warm response to the wide range of questions and comments that colleagues have put to her today.  We very much appreciate her responding so fully and for coming close to the wire, as she said, on a number of occasions.  We all find her words very moving, particularly when she referred again to her <Col N="835"/>visit to the Horn of Africa and to the impact she saw there of climate change, war and poverty on so many children in particular.  We will all take inspiration from what she has said.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Just as Dr. Robinson was a transformative President and her work continues to transform the human rights landscape internationally, so too, I hope, we can be a transformative Seanad in this 24th Seanad.  Her words have certainly given us all an inspiration and an example.  Her contribution today has been greatly encouraging to all of us in trying to make the 24th Seanad a more accountable, democratic and effective body in future.  I very much hope we will welcome her back to a truly reformed and transformed 25th Seanad at some point in the future.  I wish her the best of luck and thank her.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 22: </P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, to delete lines 28 to 31.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendments relate to sections 70B(9)(<i>g</i>) and (<i>h</i>).  We wish to delete those two paragraphs because, for example, 70B(9)(<i>g</i>) provides details of any prosecutions for an offence under this Part brought by the water services authority concerned.  No offences should be introduced for septic tanks.  We appreciate that pollution is an issue across the country, as was acknowledged last night.  We respect the fact that it needs to be targeted, in particular fly-tipping and such practices that are dealt with under the 2007 Act.  It is going down the wrong road to criminalise people for septic tank infringements.  A person with a septic tank could be prosecuted for reasons given by an inspector.  People can also be prosecuted under the Act for failing to register a septic tank.</P>
        <P>The Minister may outline details of any prosecutions.  I assume that relates to the prosecutions referred to in the Bill and that there are no other hidden prosecutions that could emerge in future under regulation.  Will the Minister confirm that there is no intention to introduce further prosecutions by way of regulation as an addition to the Act?  The prosecutions that are set out under the legislation would affect owners of private dwelling houses who <Col N="836"/>have domestic septic tank treatment systems.  They will, in effect, be prosecuted for the non-compliances which are listed in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister clarify the position on individuals found to be in breach of the Bill which the Government is attempting to introduce?  If the local authority or the agency were to take a prosecution against that person to court would the local authority or the agency compel the applicant to carry out the work in the event the applicant is not in a position financially to carry out the work?  Will the Minister clarify whether, under this legislation, the local authority or the agency would go onto the person&rsquo;s property with excavation machinery, carry out the work concerned and then seek reimbursement for the cost of that work from the individual concerned?  I want clarification from the Minister as to whether that is the case under this legislation because it is important there would be absolute clarity in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are hidden elements of the Bill in certain sections.  Under section 4(9)(<i>h</i>) refers to &ldquo;such other information as may be determined by the Agency from time to time&rdquo;.  What is that other information?  We do not agree with those words but what does &ldquo;such other information as may be determined by the agency from time to time mean?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment relates to prosecutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thought we were discussing amendments Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Apologies, yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 23 refers to sweeping powers that would be given to the agency to alter the criteria and require the applicant and the householder to provide new information.  Can the Minister clarify for the record the details of that information?  If we and the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues on the Government side are expected to vote through those three lines in this section I am sure he will be happy to provide clarification as to the exact nature of what is meant by &ldquo;such other information as may be determined by the Agency from time to time&rdquo;.  Does that mean the Environmental Protection Agency has the power to make the decision on the information that will be required?  For example, does it mean that it does not have to come back to Members of the Oireachtas?  Of course it does.  I am not questioning the agency.  The Environmental Protection Agency is a reputable and responsible organisation which is carrying out its functions in accordance with guidelines from Europe, and we can extend the debate on that as the evening progresses.</P>
        <P>The Minister might also clarify the details of any prosecutions.  I ask him to outline to the House all the prosecutions covered under section 4(9)(<i>g</i>) and answer my initial question as to whether any of those prosecutions could result, either following on from a prosecution having been taken or prior to a prosecution being taken, in the local authority, the water services authority or the agency going into the person&rsquo;s dwelling house without the person&rsquo;s authority, carrying out the prescribed work under the legislation and then endeavouring to recoup the money from that through the courts or directly from the individual.  Will he clarify whether that is the case?</P>

	<P Just="Left">My colleague, Deputy Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, has covered many of our objections to this element of the Bill.  The Bill itself is objectionable.  In his water services programme as part of the capital review the Minister has allocated &euro;1.6 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money towards improving water and wastewater treatment, which is welcome.  I put it to the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Howlin, and I stated on Second Stage also, that instead of attempting to prosecute people who have built dwellings, and paid significant development <Col N="837"/>levies to their local authorities in not all but many instances for services that are not provided, as well as the registration fee, the inspection fee and any remediation works&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I refer to the remediation work that will be required.  That is a grave concern.  There is no indication that regarding any of the remediation works that would be required the cost could be borne fully by the home owner but people in my area in rural north County Dublin will be charged for having their septic tank.  They will not be charged for inspections, as the Minister stated, but they will be charged for all the remediation work while at the same time the Department, under the capital programme, has a massive scheme that will cost anything between &euro;2.3 billion and &euro;2.7 billion where he has allowed for costs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have not got any answers from the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  If the Minister&rsquo;s Department proceeds with its plans, and I refer specifically to north County Dublin, hundreds of home owners will be charged to have a septic tank while on their doorstep they will have a massive sewerage treatment plant that will serve all of Dublin, north Wicklow, Kildare, east Meath and parts of Louth.  They will not be able even to connect to the sewerage mains.  These people have already paid development levies.</P>

I am telling the Minister where he could save a great deal of money, time and effort.

	<P Just="Left">I am trying to ascertain information from the Minister.  The Government wants to pass this Bill which is setting in law a series of prosecutions that, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said also, refers to other information as the agency may determine from time to time.  We do not know the parameters or what the prosecutions will be in that regard and we are expected to pass this legislation that will criminalise people living in rural areas throughout Ireland, including in my own area of north Dublin.  I am trying to be helpful to the Minister.  I am telling him he would not have to charge a registration fee if his Department managed its budget properly and if it did not proceed with crazy plans such as the plan in my area of north County Dublin to install a massive treatment plant in that area.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I refer to amendment No. 22 and the prosecutions.  I accept that inspectors must have powers.  We must ensure that the public good is protected.  I have no difficulty with that at all.  The public good is paramount in these circumstances.  Will the Minister clarify whether the Bill has been proofed legally?  We are talking about prosecutions and somebody may be prosecuted.  There are private property rights in the State and people have constitutional rights.  This Bill may be subject to a court challenge if somebody is prosecuted.  Has the Minister sought the advice of the Attorney General?  If so, could he make it available to us?</P>
        <P>If somebody is prosecuted, what will be the nature of the offence?  Will one have a criminal record?  If somebody has a criminal record, it will prevent him from travelling, for example.  There are many implications that need to be to teased out to which the Minister should respond.</P>
        <P>Subsection (9)(<i>h</i>) of the proposed Part to be inserted in the existing legislation states: &ldquo;such other information as may be determined by the Agency from time to time&rdquo;.  I support the call by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill for the Minister to define clearly the kind of information he is talking about in this respect.  The statement seems to be sweeping and could be open to misinterpretation.  Could the Minister give us an example of what information the agency may seek that would not be included under subsections (9)(<i>a</i>) to (9)(<i>g</i>), inclusive?</P>

	<P>With regard to the fines issue, when the Minister is drawing up the regulations, perhaps he might insert what I propose, in respect of class A fines.  Senator O&rsquo;Brien, I believe, asked whether a person in a holiday home who did not really receive notification would be fined.  What could the Minister do on foot of non-delivery of notification, for example, such that one would not be prosecuted automatically?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Last night I referred to the fines that can be imposed under the by-laws in operation in County Cavan.  It is stated a person who contravenes the by-laws is guilty of an offence under section 40 of the Local Government Act 1994 and is liable on summary conviction or a fine of up to &euro;1,270.  This fine will be updated under the Fines Act 2010, becoming a class C fine.  Once that Act is commenced, the fine, upon summary conviction, will be up to &euro;2,500.  Why is it necessary to double the fine under the legislation?</P>
        <P>When the Minister is giving his response to colleagues, I would like to afford him the opportunity to correct the record of the House.  Given that I have the height of respect for him and <Col N="840"/>know he would not knowingly mislead the House, I will give him the benefit of the doubt and contend that his officials might have been misinformed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>We did, but it is important at all times that the record of the House be corrected if there has been an untruth or misleading information put on it.  I am attempting to afford the Minister an opportunity to address this matter this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>What am I to correct?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the Minister&rsquo;s reply to one of my contributions, in which I pointed out that Cavan County Council was exempt from the European Court of Justice&rsquo;s finding and in which I outlined the advantages of the by-laws in operation in County Cavan and the fact that there was a register in existence.  The Department&rsquo;s officials informed the Minister that there was no such register.  There is a voluntary register in operation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Senator clarified that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no fee charged for registering a septic tank but there is a fee of &euro;100 for the assessment.  I am glad to clarify that for the Minister and I hope he will accept it and correct his contribution to the House.  Cavan County Council has in operation a panel of independent assessors.  The minimum qualification is that one be an engineer or architect.  The council is currently advertising more such posts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>How, then, does the Senator explain Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s point on local authority staff involvement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There are independent assessors and the maximum fee they charge is &euro;100.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The de-sludging takes place every 18 months for a standard house.  The fee for this is between &euro;80 and &euro;100.  That is my clear understanding having spoken to staff in the council.  To date, the rate of compliance with the by-laws is 33%, which is very high for a voluntary code.</P>

	<P>It is important that this be corrected because the Minister, to whom I give the benefit of the doubt because he is a decent and honourable man for whom I have great time &mdash; I  mean that and am not being cynical&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="841"/>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his latitude.  I just want to clarify the circumstances regarding Cavan County Council.  The council was exempt from the judgment.  The point I was making last night was that if the system is not broken, it should not be fixed.  We were asking that Cavan County Council be exempt from the new legislation because its model is in compliance and is working very well.  The European Court of Justice said so.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister will be allowed to speak to it but I assure Senator Wilson that there will be no other Senator doing so.  I allowed Senator Wilson some latitude.  Unless the subject is covered by an amendment or is referred to in the relevant section, it may not be discussed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was important that the Cathaoirleach allowed Senator Wilson to correct the record appropriately.  I am sure the Minister will acknowledge that.</P>
        <P>I have a couple of questions for the Minister on amendments Nos. 22 and 23.  Subparagraph (<i>g</i>) of the proposed new section states: &ldquo;details of any prosecutions for an offence under this Part brought by the water services authority concerned&rdquo;.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s amendment suggests that this be excluded.  I am concerned that the register contains certain information that will be in the system for the longer term.  I made this point last night.  Does registration attach to one&rsquo;s property?  If I sell my property in Sheep&rsquo;s Head or Bantry and move from west Cork to Mayo, will the registration continue to pertain to that property?  My reason for making this point is that it would be unfair were this criminal record to attach to the person rather than the property.  This is the reason it is so important that heed be taken of Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Moreover, section 4(9)(<i>h</i>), the deletion of which the Senator also seeks, provides for &ldquo;such other information as may be determined by the Agency from time to time&rdquo;, the agency being the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  As this country is burdened with regulations and so on, perhaps a more simple register should be kept.  Obviously, when anyone sells a property from A to B to C, one must do one&rsquo;s searches.  Any solicitor or person purchasing on behalf of a purchaser must insist on clear title because it clearly would be negligent of anyone to close a sale in the knowledge that a notice of inspection was pending or that a certificate of registration existed.  While I do not expect the Minister to have the answer to hand, he might consider before Report Stage the implications of having a register that clearly would attach to the property.  It could be something that the local authority, in the event of a serious breach, should register as a burden on the property in order that it is plain to be seen.  Buying a house entails checking all these records, performing all these searches and so forth and this proposal constitutes an additional piece of work that is coming down the track.  Once this legislation is passed, were I purchasing a 20 or 25 year old house anywhere in the country, I would first wish to ensure there had been no inspection.  Obviously, a register will be kept because everyone will be obliged to register.</P>
        <P>In supporting Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s call to have sections 4(9)(<i>g</i>) and 4(9)(<i>h</i>) deleted, I suggest the Minister might consider a more simplified form of registration that would attach to the property and not the individual.  While I may be completely wrong in this regard, this should not warrant a criminal record.  I consider this to be a minor offence unless there was a clear breach of the law.  However, if one has had a septic tank for 40 years but finds out it is not working in 2011, 2012 or 2013, that should be a matter for a civil action rather than being a criminal offence.  This is the reason the register should be much simpler than is being proposed.  It should attach to the property and, if necessary, should be registered by the local authority.  In my experience, the local authorities have the capacity to do this.  I refer to what happens in my neck of the woods as soon as one applies for planning permission and tries to <Col N="842"/>make the case that it pertains to a family need in which the person or couple have no other house.  If the local authority has any suspicion that one may have had a property previously, its planning section conducts a search in the Land Registry to find out whether Denis O&rsquo;Donovan or Diarmuid Wilson ever owned a property previously.  In this instance, it should attach to the property and be registered as a burden.  This is a serious issue and in three, five or ten years&rsquo; time, it will become part of the transaction of conveyancing in the purchase and selling of a house.  I merely ask that this should be <i>simpliciter</i> and be attached to the property, not to the individual.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The EPA guidelines regarding re-registration were discussed at length last night.  I am prepared to take on board some of the suggestions made about how re-registration should be done and whether it is necessary at all.  However, because a universal inspection system is not envisaged, it is necessary to know the level of interaction those who are not inspected are having with the system to ascertain whether improvements have been carried out and what is the state of play in respect of the people who wish to register.  This is the reason I wish to put in place a re-registration process.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned criminalising people.  While memory loss is a problem from which the Senator does not suffer, he does suffer from hypocrisy.  The Water Services Act 2007, which was introduced by his party to this House and which was approved by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party in government, provides for a penalty of up to &euro;15 million and five years in prison.  This is for being in breach of the Water Services Act and not the Waste Management Acts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>In this legislation, I propose to impose a fine of up to &euro;5,000 and no imprisonment.  Who is criminalising who?  The provisions about which the Senator speaks already are contained in the primary legislation and if he has not read it, he should.  Fianna F&aacute;il is responsible for introducing this criminal legislation, which constitutes an outrageous attack on ordinary people.  However, it now expects me to take on board its bona fides to the effect it is worried about the problem, when I am only imposing a fraction of what that party imposed.  Fianna F&aacute;il cannot have it every way and Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill should stop digging.  He should not be hypocritical about this as the principal Act as introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il sets out &euro;15 million in fines.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No further offences are to be brought in by regulation and that can only be done in the context of primary legislation.  However, the Act of 2007 introduced by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s party already includes the power to carry out environmental work and seek reimbursement for that work from the owner.  As this power already is included in the legislation, the Senator is asking me to eliminate something that was brought in by his own party.  It is in the principal Act and the Senator should read it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As discussed, the additional information that might be sought relates to technical details of improvements to the system and I already have covered this matter.  As for the notification timescale spotted by Senator Keane for holiday homes, this issue was raised last night and I am prepared to take this on board.  There are practical reasons that must be applied in respect of giving people a chance to be notified.</P>
        <P>On the question of registration in general, the reason one is obliged to bring in registration for people in general, including those in County Cavan, is that under the law one cannot have voluntary registration.  Cavan County Council brought in its regulations in 2004 and fair play to it.  It was dealing with an extremely difficult situation and because those regulations were<i> in situ</i>, Cavan was exempt from the European Court of Justice judgment.  However, the latest information I have from County Cavan is that of approximately 11,000 septic tanks, 3,500 have complied.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>That is 33%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>In other words, only one third are complying and two thirds are not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>That is disingenuous.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As I stated, the fines are considerably lower than those already contained in the principal Act introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il, namely, the Water Services Act 2007 but I have dealt with this.  Moreover, the Government has received the advice of the Attorney General to the effect that everything is in order with regard to access to property.  The environment is also important under environmental law and the common good is often dictated by the level of the environment.  As I noted, the court&rsquo;s ruling exempts County Cavan in the light of legislation, in the form of by-laws, being <i>in situ</i>.  However, it did not comment on the implementation of the by-laws.  Consequently, the absence of a register and of a proper risk assessment programme based on a full legal register leaves Cavan in a non-compliant position with the ruling.  This is the reason County Cavan must be included.  In the context of the interests of public health and the environment, it also comes under the legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien raised many issues.  He may not be aware of this point but development levies are discounted by the local authority if connection to either drinking water supply or the <Col N="844"/>public sewerage network is not possible.  Rural people are looked after by having an exemption and a reduction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, if water and sewerage services are supplied by the local authority, the cost is &euro;49.91 per sq. m but it is &euro;38.74 per sq. m when a connection is not possible.</P>

	<P>There is a big reduction for people in rural areas who are unable to connect.  Moreover, I am sure the Senator voted for that as a county councillor.</P>
        <P>As for people who wish to connect into existing public group sewage schemes, I stated I was considering the support currently provided in respect of water and sewage on a group basis.  It may be possible to help people connect to existing schemes.  We mentioned that last night when Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien was not here.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I wanted to clarify the arrangements in Cavan.  The by-laws in Cavan required all persons served by an on-site system to have their systems assessed every seven years by a competent, independent, private contractor, not a local authority staff member as Senator Wilson spoke at length about last night.  Any faults identified have to be provided to the council within seven days &mdash; that is a short time &mdash; as well as a programme of repair.  Systems have to be desludged at prescribed intervals and the sludge must be disposed of appropriately.  No financial assistance is provided to households by the council for any of these requirements.  The average cost of assessment, as confirmed by Cavan County Council to the Department, is &euro;200.</P>

	<P>What legal advice was sought from the Attorney General on this matter?  Have any flaws in the 2007 Water Services Act been rectified in this Bill?  Many people are unhappy with this legislation and have said they will oppose assessors coming on to their land.  We must ensure the legislation is watertight.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has an issue with failure to adhere to these regulations leading to a criminal offence.  In the fishing industry, regulations set by EU directives were introduced for the landing of catches.  Now, for example, a prosecution for an improperly marked catch logbook means a criminal offence for the fisherman in question.  Some Aran Islands fishermen have received criminal records because of such administrative misdemeanours.  In the case of the Water Services (Amendment) Bill, a person with a faulty septic tank may be charged with a criminal offence and suffer the same fate as the Aran Islands fishermen.  This is unacceptable to Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>
        <P>We have had the example of the builders who did not construct the Priory Hall apartments to the proper specifications.  Many other houses have been built across the country in the past 20 years.  Not everyone will have checked their septic tank and will have depended in good faith on the builder or engineer to inform them it is up the required standard.  If a fault were found with a septic tank in such circumstances, to whom does the criminal offence pertain?  Is it the owner of the septic tank or the person who put in a faulty tank?  It could also happen in the case of a house sold on.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will confine myself to the section.  In fairness, the comparison with the 2007 Act is like comparing fish to meat.  It is a totally different scenario.  The story of the Act is nothing to do with septic tanks.  It is nothing to do with this issue.</P>
        <P>It is important to come back to the point I was making on which I have not got clarification.  First, the Act should describe the owner.  Is the owner a lessee, a temporary tenant, the registered owner, the occupant or, maybe in this case, NAMA, the bank or whoever?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other point is that there is a perception being given by the Minister, not to mislead intentionally, that registration is compulsory but inspection may or may not fall over a period of time.  A prudent purchaser of a house &mdash; I refer to what Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is trying to delete in the two amendments &mdash; or his agent or solicitor will want to know if the septic tank on the property he or she is buying complies with this new law.  He or she will check with the local authority and verify that, for example, whether Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s house and septic tank is registered.  In a case where it does not comply, the first thing that will have to be done is the local authority will initiate an inspection, either directly or indirectly.  That is my concern.  Whether we like it and while it is fine to say there is registration, there is a knock-on effect.  That is why I say this about the registration and certificate of compliance which will be sought in the closing of any sale of any property.  It will inevitably follow because property keeps changing hands, even if there might not be much movement at present, but the market will turn again.  What I am concerned about in this regard is that the simple act of paying &euro;50 for registration, in itself, comes close to compulsory inspection because I certainly would not close <Col N="850"/>on a sale unless I had a compliance certificate from a competent engineer or architect verifying that an inspection, not merely registration, had taken place.  That is my worry.  It will cause delays and it will also initiate that process.</P>
        <P>That is why this type of registration should attach to the property, not to the individual.  It would be simple to incorporate this in the Act.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill wishes it to be deleted and I support that view.  If the Minister is pursuing the other line, the registration, apart from the local authority, would probably have to go on the title of the property.</P>

	<P>To expand on the good point Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh made about who exactly is liable, the Minister stated it is the individual.  As Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh stated, somebody could in good faith have paid a contractor to install a septic tank system, that system may be faulty, an inspection is carried out and then, at the end of the process, there could well be a prosecution.  It goes back to the earlier point I made about the legal aspect of this.  That individual, if he or she was prosecuted on foot of a company either putting in a faulty system or not installing the system properly, could challenge the Act then and also bring the contractor who installed the system to court.  That is the problem.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On amendments Nos. 22 and 23, I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan on what he has raised here.  The legal implications are wide ranging and they have all sorts of connotations from a conveyancing point of view.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">They also have all sorts of connotations, for example, in a situation where a septic tank is built on a neighbour&rsquo;s land.  Who is liable for a septic tank if it is built on a third party&rsquo;s land or if it is built on commonage, as in a case that was brought to my attention today?  There are 166 landowners linked to the commonage and the septic tank is on the commonage.  What will happen in a case like that?  It is in bog as well and it certainly will not comply.  The costs will be colossal.  In a situation like that or where, for example a septic tank is built on a neighbour&rsquo;s land where the neighbours are not talking to each other, which is a case of which I am aware as well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important before legislation would come in that these matters would be teased out in the Oireachtas.  What are the legal ramifications and the cost ramifications, first, to the Department, and by extension to the taxpayer, if there was a case brought against it because the legislation was brought in, and second, to the individuals concerned?  With some of these individuals, for example, the 166 commonage owners, the likelihood is that permission was not even given for the septic tank to be built where it is built.  Planning permission was given, the local authority oversaw the process and gave its permission knowing where the septic tank was constructed.  Who is liable here?  Is it the local authority, the Department, the commonage owner or the owner of the property?  The owner of the property is not defined in the legislation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">If the owner of a septic tank or wastewater treatment plant does not provide a valid certificate of registration, the maximum fine is &euro;5,000.  I have no difficulty with the provision that inspectors can be subjected to class A fines.  However, I have serious difficulties with the prospect of fines being issued for obstructing inspectors.  If an elderly person obstructs an inspector out of fear, he or she could face a fine of &euro;5,000.  That is not contained in the 2007 Act, nor does it make reference to failures to comply with advisory notices.  The broad argument that it was done in 2007 and we are only following through on it is nonsense.  It is similar to the accusations made against my colleague from County Cavan, which were unjustified, unfounded and misleading.

	<P>We are amending the principal Act which Fianna F&aacute;il introduced.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan expressed concern about the impact of these matters on house sales.  If I was buying a house I would seek an engineer&rsquo;s report to ensure everything was in order before I closed the sale.  Under consumer protection legislation I would be able to sue the solicitors and other professionals who advised me if their surveys and investigations were not carried out properly.  The building energy rating certificate is an example of certification to indicate a house&rsquo;s energy rating. This Bill will operate in a similar manner.  The owner of a property is responsible for it.  If property cannot move, the owner can.  It is in the interest of a property owner, as well as his or her neighbours, to ensure his or her septic tank is functioning properly because otherwise there will be serious implications for public health.  It is in everybody&rsquo;s interest to make sure our wastewater systems function properly.</P>

	<P>I did not interrupt the Senators.  I ask them to allow me to speak.  This legislation has, in the normal way, gone to the Attorney General and we are satisfied that the protections for property rights are in order and it complies with the judgments of the European Court of Justice in terms of the common good as set out in environmental law and property law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to labour the point but I am aware of at least half a dozen cases involving problems with septic tanks.  In one case a women in my constituency purchased a house in good faith only to discover many years later &mdash; she is now an elderly lady &mdash; that her septic tank was built on a neighbour&rsquo;s property.  It was done 30 or 40 years ago on a word of mouth basis and she is not able to access the neighbouring land to service or clean the tank.  She has tried the legal route to access the land because the other party refused her <Col N="855"/>right of way.  In such a situation, one may be serving a notice on the owner of the land on which the septic tank was built rather than the owner of the house.  That might be a good thing for my constituent because she is very worried about the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having closed hundreds, if not thousands, of sales in my time, I am aware that architects, engineers and solicitors are responsible for certificates of compliance.  However, this is a new kettle of fish whereby a property owner is obliged to register his or her septic tank with the local authority.  Does the owner hire his or her own engineer to inspect the property?  If I was advising the owner I would suggest that he or she should go to the local authority to ensure it is happy with the situation.  That would require two inspections.  As the local authority is responsible for registration, it would have to inspect the septic tank for compliance.</P>
        <P>Contrary to the arguments made by the Minister last night, it is almost certain that local authority inspections of septic tanks will become compulsory and routine.  Perhaps that is a good thing but it will also create additional problems when buying or selling land.  If I was buying property, I would write to my local authority to ask whether it carried out an inspection and before I closed the sale I would demand that the tank be inspected either by the authority or an approved inspector.  That is different from putting the onus on an independent engineer or architect or solicitor in closing the sale.  I accept that we all have professional negligence cover, but this will add another layer of bureaucracy and cost.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has stated the 2007 Act criminalises people; therefore, we will table an amendment on Report Stage to change this.  It is the same point, on which I agree with the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should table the amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that there is a great deal of jousting going on, but this is a serious issue.  If a builder was to do a botched job on a septic tank, the householder would know about it because the septic tank would not work, but if the tank was polluting groundwater, he or she might not know about this.  The issue is he or she will be prosecuted if groundwater is polluted, not if the septic tank is not working.  The level of contamination can fluctuate in a septic tank.  There has been plenty of botched building work in recent years and if work on a septic tank has been botched, the householder can take a civil case against the builder.  In contrast, if the householder is prosecuted for causing pollution, he or she will be criminalised, even though he or she bought a septic tank in good faith.  That is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not doing that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has said the owner is responsible.  If he comes to my house, I may not be sure what state the septic tank is in until the test is done.  If the tank is working but the groundwater is polluted and I fight the issue in the courts, under the legislation, I will be criminalised if the Minister is found to be right and I am found to be wrong.  I could still sue my builder who botched the job and might win a civil case against him or her, but I will be left with a criminal record.  This is what will be on the register.  That will go against me, for example, if I want to travel.  That is the issue Sinn F&eacute;in has with this provision.  This is happening in the case of fishermen from the Aran Islands who have been subject to European sanctions for administrative mistakes in log books.  It is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>As a member of the professions, Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan will be aware that one delegates and devolves functions to architects and engineers to make sure everything is in order before one buys a house.  What is required in this case is a certificate of <Col N="856"/>compliance for a septic tank signed by an engineer.  There is no need for another inspection to be carried out by a local authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>The householder must also conform to local authority regulations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The engineer signs up to the fact that the septic tank is working.  That is what a professional does.  An architect signs off that a house is in compliance with regulations, while an engineer signs a certificate of compliance indicating that the septic tank is working.  If an inspection takes place in a few years at random, for example, in a high risk area, that is a separate issue.  The engineer&rsquo;s report is all that is required to close the sale on a house.</P>

	<P>Unlike Fianna F&aacute;il, I am fallible.</P>
        <P>On the issue raised by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, we have provisions in place to ensure groundwater is protected and the owner is responsible, no matter where the septic tank is located.  There is an owner who must be responsible and he or she has to be in compliance.  There are consumer protections in place regarding professionals if they do not comply with the appropriate certification procedures.</P>

	<P>We had a good example recently in Priory Hall.  Professionals signed off on certificates without hardly having looked at the place.  The system put trust in professionals by devolving functions to them to do the job properly for consumers, local authorities and householders.  As they did not do so, I am changing the regulations to ensure this will not happen again and that there will be mandatory inspections rather than putting trust in professionals to do the right thing for consumers.</P>

	<P>The amendment is with regard to the powers the authorised person, namely, the inspector appointed by the water service authority, may have to request a certificate of registration in respect of the system.  We appreciate the inspector needs to have certain functions and authority to carry out his or her duties.  However, the authority being given to private inspectors under the legislation is far beyond the call of duty with regard to the requesting of a registration certificate.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to provide a valid reason for this.  I have no difficulty with the request for a registration certificate <i>per se</i>, but the difficulty is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I have one concern and will make a brief comment.  If an inspector calls to an elderly person in a remote area and demands to see a certificate of registration, but the person does not have it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Elderly people seem to be everywhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Senator Landy to follow my scenario.  The inspector demands a certificate and if the person cannot find the certificate or has it somewhere else, on a technical point that inspector can haul the landowner, property owner or householder into court and state the date of the visit on which the owner did not provide the certificate demanded.  This is a very draconian power for a technical issue and time should be given.  If a garda stops me in my car, I have ten days in which to produce my insurance and most garda&iacute; will accept it within 20 days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>To reiterate Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position, we have no problem with inspections or with people being required to have a valid certificate of registration.  We do not have any great difficulty with inspectors&rsquo; powers either, our difficulty is with private inspectors.  As we stated on Second Stage and during the debate on previous amendments, there is a wealth of individuals within local authorities who are qualified to carry out these inspections.  In addition, many local authorities&rsquo; planning offices are not as busy as they once were.  For these reasons, we fail to understand why the Minister would appoint private inspectors instead of using persons already employed by the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">These provisions are consistent with the Water Services Act 2007 and relate to local authority compliance rather than inspections.  The Senator stated ten days would be a reasonable length of time in which to comply, but that provision is contained on page 6 of the Bill.</P>

	<P>The Senator is very kind.  </P><Col N="860"/>
        <P>Amendment No. 25 addresses the ten day period subsequent to an offence being committed.  While I appreciate what the Minister is trying to achieve, leeway should be given.  For example, the French Government and local authorities in France are trying to comply with Directive 75/442/EEC, but the timeframe for individuals to comply with the regulations was changed to four years.  The timeframe outlined in the Bill is too tight.  Section 4(12) reads: &ldquo;A person who fails to comply with a request under subsection (11) within 10 days, commits an offence.&rdquo;  Is failing to comply with a request to carry out extensive works included in this provision, or does it only apply to a failure to comply with a request to produce a certificate of registration?  Will the Minister consider the method used in France, by which people are allowed four years to carry out works recommended by the French equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency?  Although France introduced its law in 2007, the works in question will only be assessed in 2012.  France gave people a reasonable timeframe in which to carry out works and local authorities were given discretion to provide funding of various amounts.</P>
        <P>The second amendment in the group is No. 31 which relates to a person who has committed an offence being criminalised under the legislation.  We have a difficulty in this regard and do not agree with section 4, as constituted, since it introduces criminal sanctions for what the Minister deems minor offences.  As both he and the explanatory memorandum state, few septic tanks will not meet the standard.  If so, only a small number of people will be involved.  For the purpose of clarity, how many does the Department estimate there are?  It must have done some homework.  How many of the estimated 475,000 septic tanks does the Department believe are meeting the required European standard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter is outside the scope of the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>It relates to offences and the number of people in contravention of the legislation.  Is the Department stating few septic tanks are not meeting the standard?  That is what the Minister said on Second Stage.  If so, I fail to understand why a retrofit grant scheme is not being introduced under the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of a grants scheme is a separate matter.  The amendment deals with contraventions of the legislation.</P>

	<P>The amendment concerns a person contravening a requirement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  All of the amendments are interlinked and I appreciate the reason they are being grouped.  Amendment No. 66 relates to fines and the criminal aspects of the Bill.  The Minister&rsquo;s justification is that when the 2007 Act was introduced, the fine set was &euro;15 million.  The Act was introduced to deal with major developers who were causing substantial and massive pollution, including in County Wicklow.  I understand the case in question might still be ongoing.  The Act was introduced to protect the environment in extreme and difficult cases.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister referred to the issue, it is only fair that I be given an opportunity to refer to it.  That legislation had nothing to do with septic tanks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is straying from the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="861"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>My point relates to the offence committed.  The Minister is introducing various offences under the legislation, whereby if septic tank owners do not comply with specific criteria, they will be deemed to have committed an offence.  He did not need to introduce these offences under the legislation.  In fact, he did not need to introduce any legal sanctions.  Instead of introducing offences, people should be encouraged to upgrade their septic tanks if they&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a different issue, as the Senator well knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Encouragement and offences are like night and day.  We are creating offences and criminalising people instead of trying to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We discussed all of these issues while debating the other amendments.  There are 77 amendments to this section alone.  These are specific elements relating to non-compliance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This relates to offences and penalties.  The line we propose to delete is in section 70L(2), &ldquo;A person who contravenes a regulation made under this section commits an offence.&rdquo;  What are the regulations?  As we do not know what they are, what offence could someone commit as a result?  We are giving sweeping powers here.  A regulation which has not been made could constitute an offence.  We are throwing something into the open, saying we might create a law and people will make an offence as a result.  It is wholly unacceptable to bring in an offence with a Bill while the regulation surrounding the offence has not been made available to us.  Does the Minister expect us to support it?</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 75 deals with the line the provision under section 70M, at page 18 of the Bill, which states: &ldquo;A person guilty of an offence under sections 70B(12), 70C(2), 70E(10), 70G(5), 70H(18), or 70L(2) is liable, on summary conviction, to a class A fine.&rdquo;  Senator Wilson outlined very clearly the position in County Cavan.  It may be easy to criticise what is being done there but it has taken a considerable lead in the matter.  There should have been a grant scheme available in Cavan but the county council did not have the support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is moving outside the scope of these amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is relevant to fines.  The fine in County Cavan, if I am correct&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;is currently &euro;1,270.  The class A fines proposed under the Minister&rsquo;s legislation amount to &euro;5,000.  Cavan County Council is controlled by the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues, councillors from Fine Gael, and they are proposing to increase the fines to class C fines, or &euro;2,500.  There is a big difference between &euro;1,270 and &euro;5,000, as is proposed in this legislation.  Using fines is the wrong way to go and the Minister is not encouraging people to protect the environment.  There are 475,000 septic tanks in the country and the people who own them have an excellent appreciation of the protection of the environment.  Many of those people are farmers or farm families, involved in REPS or agri-environment options schemes.  They are involved in farm water conservation and rain water harvesting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>It is wrong to criminalise those people and bring in fines, whether they are &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000.  I am pleading with the Minister as people have made the <Col N="862"/>following point at meetings in Donegal.  Many people are saying they will not pay the registration fee and if they are brought to court and fined, as the judge is entitled to impose a class A fine of &euro;5,000, what happens if it is not paid?  People will not be able to pay the fines and will end up in jail.  The Minister said the local authority carries out the work, and he is not willing to correct the legislation.  When those people come out of jail they may have a bill of &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 for the work of the local authority and they will be billed again.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should speak to the amendment.  When we listen to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill speaking about criminalising people, it appears he does not understand what legislation is about.  When a Bill is turned into an Act and made law, it is not a guideline and there are consequences to breaking the law.  It seems that Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is suggesting this is some sort of opt-in scheme as opposed to the law of the land.  If there are breaches of the legislation, there must be consequences or otherwise it will not work as a law.</P>

	<P>Section 43 is related to amendment No. 24 and it concerns the powers of the inspector.  The amendment seeks to remove powers from the inspector.  I have made the point about a law being meaningless, which I am glad to see Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has accepted.  Amendment No. 66 again proposes that it would not be an offence to contravene a law, and I cannot understand that.  I do not believe any sensible person would understand it either.  Amendment No. 75 would also remove the offence coming from breaking the law.  This is completely meaningless if the law is to have any force.</P>

	<P>This partly relates to what we have discussed about criminality in this Bill.  I do not want to labour the point too much but it is a very serious issue.  We are raising a serious issue about criminalisation and why we are tabling an amendment in this group of amendments.  We do not feel there should be such serious sanctions, as they strike me as a draconian and heavy-handed way of dealing with citizens.  There is no clause about inability to pay, which is significant, and there is no acceptance that people might not be able to pay the initial registration fee or upgrade the septic tank.  There is no inability to pay clause in any of the Bill, and as a result we suggest that the making of an offence should be taken out.  People are not being given the option of making a case for themselves if they are not in a position to pay.</P>
        <P>We are trying to highlight the economic position and there are people who cannot and will not pay.  There are people who have indicated at public meetings around the country that they will stop inspectors and refuse to allow people on their property.

With regard to the Attorney General, doctors differ and patients die, and an Attorney General&rsquo;s advice is certainly not infallible.

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">However, sin sc&eacute;al eile.  I will stick to the amendments.  One of the amendments relates to section 70A which provides that a person who contravenes a regulation made under this section commits an offence.  I might be wrong but I wish to make a general point on this.  I have a grave difficulty with taking a leap of faith on regulations in this regard.  It might be commonplace but it is bad legislative practice to introduce legislation, be it primary or secondary, and then subsequently bring forward regulations.  They might not necessarily be brought in by this Minister; there could be a change of Minister or a change of emphasis.  If and when a regulation or series of regulations is introduced next year or the year after &mdash; under the Bill they could be introduced in ten years &mdash; an offence can be committed under those regulations.  I have a difficulty with that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The best experts in preparing legislation have sometimes got it wrong, although I am subject to correction.  I support the point made by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill regarding the provision for regulations which in themselves will create criminal offences.  The regulations are not available and Minister probably does not know what they are.  They will be introduced by him or by a subsequent Minister.  That is a dangerous precedent.  It is like taking a leap of faith or playing a game of poker, and I did some of that when I was a student.  It is like betting in the dark, and that is a dangerous policy.</P>

Would the Minister consider grading it by providing another maximum for an initial conviction, for example, a grade C fine of a maximum of &euro;2,500, with a fine of &euro;5,000 for a second conviction?  As has been said by a number of my colleagues, people are in severe financial difficulties and might not be in a position to carry out the works that are necessary.  They will end up in court.

	<P>To reply to Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and Wilson and the question of fines, fines are already graded on the basis of a maximum of &euro;5,000.  The court will take into account the risk to public health, the environment and the environmental damage done.  That is how the courts work.  Whatever the maximum, the judge has the opportunity to apply less than the maximum.  I am sure judges will do so, based on the evidence before the court.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan can confirm this.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned people having 12 months to avoid registration but people have 12 months to register in 2012.  No inspections will be carried out until 2013.

	<P>I acknowledge that Cavan County Council has been very responsible, has increased public awareness and is taking responsibility for on-site systems and charging people for the privilege.  There are amendments to delete the subsection regarding the timeframe but we cannot accept them because no alternative timeframe is proposed.  This is solely to do with producing a certificate of registration.  The regulations will take account of what Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh mentioned about duplication.  This has nothing to do with timeframes for remedial works.  All it has to do with is establishing a timeframe for producing a certificate.</P>

        <P>This is the crux of the Bill.  I appreciate that Government Members may not fully realise the implications of the legislation when it is implemented.  Under section 70(<i>l</i>), the Minister, following consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, may make regulations for the purpose of this Part and the regulations may make provision for maintenance plans for treatment plant systems, performance standards for treatments systems or septic tanks, standards and procedures to apply where domestic wastewater treatment systems are being emptied, the sludge going to a designated site, desludging, the contents being disposed of and the manner in which they are disposed of and any other matters the Minister may prescribe.  Under the Bill, the Minister will forever have the power to introduce any matters he may prescribe.</P>
        <P>The major difficulty with this section of the Bill is that it refers to the maintenance and operation standards for septic tanks and treatments systems.  As these standards have not yet been published, no one in this room knows what they will be.  The Minister has not published them or answered any questions in the Houses on them.</P>

        <P>Let us look at the two scenarios brought forward by the Minister in terms of maintenance and servicing standards.  He would have everyone believe there is an easy way, that we can bring forward his guidelines.  He does not work in the EPA; he is the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The EPA has adopted a code of practice that is to be implemented by all local authorities.  Under the directive for which the European Union is looking and which An Taisce is getting ready to monitor, if the Minister does not put in place sufficient standards, the matter will be referred back to the Commission and Ireland will before the European Court again.  It is fair enough for the Minister to say there is an easy way, but he has not told us what it is or what the standards will be.  Will he adopt the 2010 EPA guidelines?</P>

        <P>If we look at the 2010 EPA guidelines, they are very stringent and aim to protect the water supply.  Everything the Minister has spoken about relates to protecting the groundwater supplies.  All septic tanks would have to come in under inspections and upgrades, retrospectively, if that were to be the case.  That is the point I am making.  If that is the case, according to the Environmental Protection Agency officials to whom I have spoken, the Minister would have to adopt the 2010 EPA guidelines.  If that is the case, we are looking at massive costs for people living in rural areas.  In fact, the regulatory impact assessment, RIA, which I outlined before that goes with the Bill outlines costs of up to &euro;17,000, if one takes areas like west Connemara.</P>

	<P>I have not made this point.  In areas such as Connemara, and Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh&rsquo;s area or even parts of my constituency, which the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley would be aware of, percolation areas have been built on rock and may have soil of only between 1 ft. and 1.5 ft.  Soil, to a depth of 5 ft., would have to be imported into that site to meet the standards that Europe is looking for in percolation areas.  The standards will also mean that the percolation area pipe will have to be increased in those dwelling houses.  A three bedroom dwelling house would require 18 m of pipe per person multiplied by six.</P>

	<P>If I can delve into the decision of the European Court of Justice.  I am trying to outline what the scenario will be.</P>
        <P>What the European Court of Justice states is that Ireland is obliged to transpose and apply the requirements of the direction to such waste waters.  However, Ireland has not transposed nor claimed to have transposed these requirements.  That is true. Furthermore it has not complied with these requirements in practice, more particularly Ireland has not complied for the wastewaters in question.  That is right.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to Articles 4 and 8 of the directive.  Article 4, according to the court judgment is important because it sets out environmental objectives that should be pursed and respected in relation to other duties of the directive.  The Commission submits in the case that was taken against Ireland that there is also a failure to comply with Article 4 in practice in the Lough Leane catchment, with which members might be familiar.  This is borne out by evidence, adduced of the environmental harm resulting from a failure to control adequately septic tanks.  We have had no explanation as to what &ldquo;control adequately&rdquo; will mean.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The directive and the judgement goes on that Article 8, which was referred to by the Minister, is important because it stipulates that waste is disposed of in accordance with the directive.  Waste must be disposed of in accordance with the directives.  There is also a failure to comply with Article 8 practice in Ireland since Ireland does not ensure that domestic wastewaters are disposed of in accordance with the directive.  It goes on to Article 12 of the judgement,</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">I fail to understand why the Minister would not add in the provision under Article 12 to this regulation before the regulation is adopted.  Article 12 of the European Court of Justice judgment provides that in relation to septic tanks and other individual treatment systems, in as much as to operative effectively, such systems require periodic removal and disposal of sludges, and that they are done in a professional manner involving such removal and disposal.  This is not addressed in Irish law currently.  There is an opportunity for the Minister to take on board, as we on this side of the House were proposing, that the desludging programme could come in as part of this regulation.  If the Minister wanted to introduce a de-sludging programme, we would support him.  In our view it is reasonable that it would be paid for from the money available under the urban wastewater servicing programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I fail to understand why that could not be done.  It would comply with Article 12 of the judgment and once compliance had been achieved under Article 12 we could try in the intervening years to deal with Articles 4 and 8 to at least show the Commission and the European Court of Justice that something is being done and that a plan is in place. <Col N="876"/> The people should be consulted and the Oireachtas Members and the public should know what standards will be achieved prior to the legislation coming through the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>When this Bill is passed the Minister will meet the EPA.  Officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency will sit down with the Minister and they will come up with a maintenance and operations standard that will apply to every septic tank in the country because it just cannot apply to one in five.  That will not satisfy Europe according to the judgment I have read.</P>
        <P>The other issue is that Minister is missing a golden opportunity to bring in a programme that could fast-track our compliance under the directive by bringing in the national desludging programme.  What is the Minister actually doing?  He is leaving scope to make the households of Ireland pay for the desludging programme themselves.

T&aacute; ceist fh&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach ardaithe againn, ceist at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh tinnis do phobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta <Col N="880"/>maidir leis an sc&eacute;al a chuireadh amach an tseachtain seo caite faoi na hathruithe sa seirbh&iacute;s poibl&iacute;, go h&aacute;irithe an t-athr&uacute; at&aacute; molta go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; c&oacute;nascadh idir Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga agus Oifig an Ombudsman.  Arda&iacute;m an cheist seo anocht chun soil&eacute;iri&uacute; a fh&aacute;il ar seo.  T&aacute; thart ar seisear daoine fostaithe go l&aacute;n-aimseartha in Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga, at&aacute; lonnaithe sa Spid&eacute;al agus t&aacute; an obair at&aacute; ar bun acu bunaithe ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&oacute;gartha ag an Aire St&aacute;it go bhfuil athbhreithni&uacute; le d&eacute;anamh ar an Acht c&eacute;anna.  Is cos&uacute;il gur th&aacute;inig an sc&eacute;al seo anoir aduaidh ar an gcoimisin&eacute;ir f&eacute;in agus nach bhfuair s&eacute; an sc&eacute;al go dt&iacute; an tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na roimhr&eacute; &oacute;n tAire St&aacute;it agus feidhmeannach sa Roinn ag r&aacute; go raibh an c&oacute;nascadh seo le d&eacute;anamh.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir domsa n&aacute; don phobal fi&uacute; an raibh an Ombudsman ar an eolas go raibh an t-athr&uacute; seo molta.</P>
        <P Just="Left">&Oacute; thaobh an staid&eacute;ir at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag pobal na Gaeilge ar an cheist, t&aacute; feachtas Ghuth na Gaeltachta, Aontas Phobal na Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge agus eagrais eile tagtha amach go l&aacute;idir i gcoinne an mholta at&aacute; d&eacute;anta.  N&iacute; l&eacute;ir go mbeidh coigilt ollmh&oacute;r i gceist anseo. An imn&iacute; at&aacute; ar an bpobal n&aacute; go bhfuil an Rialtas ag cur cuma ar an sc&eacute;al go bhfuiltear ag gearradh siar ar quangos, ach i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re nach bhfuil bun&uacute;s n&aacute; ciall leis an gcinneadh at&aacute; molta, mar t&aacute; an dream at&aacute; fostaithe in Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga fostaithe go buan ag an St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras ar aon n&oacute;s agus beidh siad f&oacute;s fostaithe.  De r&eacute;ir mar a thuigim &oacute; thaobh an choimisin&eacute;ara teanga &eacute; f&eacute;in, n&iacute;l s&eacute; i bhfad &oacute; cheap an tAire don athuair &eacute; mar choimisin&eacute;ir teanga ar feadh tr&eacute;imhse s&eacute; n&oacute; seacht mbliana.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom gur f&eacute;idir &eacute; a bhriseadh as a phost gan sin a chur tr&iacute;d Tithe an Oireachtais.  N&iacute;l ach tr&iacute; ch&uacute;is gur f&eacute;idir coimisin&eacute;ir teanga a bhriseadh as a phost agus leis sin a dh&eacute;anamh caithfear &eacute; a chur tr&iacute;d Tithe an Oireachtais.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, t&aacute; an coimisin&eacute;ir le fanacht ins an oifig in a bhfuil s&eacute; n&oacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; mar choimisin&eacute;ir.  Mar sin, c&eacute;n f&aacute;th n&oacute; c&eacute;n bun&uacute;s at&aacute; leis an gcinneadh.  C&eacute;n idirphl&eacute; a ndearnadh roimhr&eacute;?  Ar pl&eacute;adh an cinneadh leis an Ombudsman agus leis an gcoimisin&eacute;ir roimhr&eacute; ar bhealach nach bhfuil fhios againn?  C&eacute;n coigilt at&aacute; i gceist a dh&eacute;anamh agus c&eacute;n chaoi a fheidhmeoidh an cinneadh seo?  An bhfuil an fhoireann le bogadh go Baile &Aacute;tha Cliath le feidhmi&uacute; taobh istigh d&rsquo;Oifig an Ombudsman?  M&aacute; t&aacute;, an bhfuil costais ag baint leis sin &oacute; thaobh athlonnaithe as Conamara?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Rud eile, m&aacute; t&aacute;thar le c&oacute;nascadh na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur i bhfeidhm tr&iacute;d Oifig an Ombudsman, c&eacute;n cumas at&aacute; in Oifig an Ombudsman le tac&uacute; le seirbh&iacute;s an choimisin&eacute;ara teanga n&oacute; &oacute; thaobh cumas Gaeilge agus mar sin de agus c&eacute;n saineolas at&aacute; ann i r&eacute;ims&iacute; teanga?  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite agam go minic ar an taifead anseo sa Seanad go bhfuil m&eacute; d&iacute;om&aacute;ch maidir leis an dul chun cinn at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an Rialtas a bh&iacute; ann romhainn agus an Rialtas reatha maidir le cur i bhfeidhm for&aacute;lacha Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la.  Dar liomsa, n&iacute;l d&oacute;thain comhoibri&uacute; &aacute; fh&aacute;il ag an gcoimisin&eacute;ir teanga &oacute; na Ranna St&aacute;it agus &oacute; na heagrais a thagann faoi sc&aacute;th an Achta.   Go deimhin, t&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite ag tuairisceoir&iacute; &aacute;irithe agus daoine a bhfuil eolas acu ar shaol na Gaeilge agus pobal na Gaeilge go gceapann siad go bhfuil go leor feidhmeannaigh agus St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh naimhdeach go leor maidir le hobair an choimisin&eacute;ara.  In aon turas, n&iacute;l na sc&eacute;imeanna &eacute;ags&uacute;la a tharla&iacute;onn faoi sc&aacute;th an Achta &aacute; chur i bhfeidhm acu.  T&aacute; doicheall &aacute; l&eacute;iri&uacute; acu.  Luaigh an coimisin&eacute;ar ina thuarasc&aacute;il tamall &oacute; shin nach raibh s&eacute; in ann chomhoibri&uacute; a fh&aacute;il &oacute; dh&aacute; eagras St&aacute;it &mdash; Ard-Mh&uacute;saem na h&Eacute;ireann agus Feidhmeannacht na Seirbh&iacute;se Sl&aacute;inte &mdash; maidir le c&aacute;sanna a chuireadh os a chomhair.  Ghlan s&eacute; a l&aacute;mha d&oacute;ibh agus d&uacute;irt s&eacute; go raibh s&eacute; in am do Thithe an Oireachtais an ch&eacute;ad ch&eacute;im eile a th&oacute;g&aacute;il agus d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leo.  T&aacute; m&eacute; den tuairim go bhfuil buille tubaisteach beartaithe d&rsquo;Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga.  T&aacute; an oifig l&aacute;rnach sa strait&eacute;is agus i ndul chun cinn na teanga.  M&aacute; leantar ar aghaidh leis an gcinneadh seo, beidh s&eacute; tubaisteach ar fad do shaol agus do phobal na Gaeilge.  Chreid muid go l&aacute;idir in Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la 2003.  N&iacute;limid chun scaoileadh leis an gcoimisin&eacute;ir chomh r&eacute;idh sin.  Ba <Col N="881"/>bhre&aacute; liom soil&eacute;iri&uacute; a fh&aacute;il uaidh.
