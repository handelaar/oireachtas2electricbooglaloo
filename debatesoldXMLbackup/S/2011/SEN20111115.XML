	<P Just="Left">I have received notice from Senator Tom Sheahan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Health to clarify the reason Valentia Community Hospital, a voluntary not-for-profit institution, was classified as a private nursing home under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Deirdre Clune of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to develop a national dementia strategy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">Go dtabharfaidh an tAire Comhshaoil, Pobail agus Rialtais &Aacute;iti&uacute;il soil&eacute;iri&uacute; maidir leis na pleananna at&aacute; ann ionad briog&aacute;id d&oacute;ite&aacute;in a lonn&uacute; i gConamara theas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to outline the benefits of socially monitored alarms for older people in terms of independent living and longevity, and to ensure funding is maintained at current levels in the 2012 budget.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jimmy Harte of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to make a statement on the problem where developers in receivership are not paying ESB bills for sewage pumps in housing estates, in particular, in the Letterkenny area of Glencar and Glenoughty, where the ESB has given notice that power will be switched off on 20 November.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Sheahan, Clune, &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Healy Eames <Col N="340"/>and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Harte may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to inform the House that, as of 2 p.m. today, proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas will be broadcast on channel 801 on the UPC network as part of a trial initiative over a six month period.  This trial initiative is being provided for at no cost to the Exchequer.  As part of our agreement with UPC, Oireachtas proceedings will be carried live from 2 p.m. on Tuesday until the close of business on Thursday, with coverage of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Coverage of sittings of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and committees will be broadcast from Thursday evening until 2 p.m. on the following Tuesday.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In light of what the Cathaoirleach has announced, I am proposing that from next week we start on Tuesday at 12.30 p.m. in order that proceedings can be broadcast live on the television channel.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 17, motion No. 6 re sentencing of Pastor Jousef Nadarkhani by the Iranian authorities, to be taken without debate; No. 1, Nurses and Midwives Bill 2010 &mdash; Second Stage, to commence at the conclusion of No. 17, motionNo. 6; and conclude not later than 5.45 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes, and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than 5.40 p.m.; and No. 2, ministerial statement and questions and answers on the ECB interest rate reduction, to be taken at 6 p.m. and conclude not later than 7 p.m., with questions to the Minister to be taken in the same order as on the Order of Business, and Senators not to exceed one minute when asking questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senators that the time limits for contributions are three minutes for party and group leaders and two minutes for other Senators.  It is unfair to other Members to eat into their time, particularly under the new system in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a glaring omission from the schedule of business for this week published by the Leader&rsquo;s office.  A debate is not scheduled on the Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-16 plan published last week.  Once again, it was published by way of a press conference outside the Houses of the Oireachtas and was not debated.  Will the Leader allocate sufficient time next week to examine the vast number of projects throughout the country that have been axed by the Government and the implications that will have for employment here?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Next Thursday the Government will publish its comprehensive spending review and, like every other initiative introduced by the Government, it will do so outside the Houses of the Oireachtas by way of a press conference for the media.  Will we be given ample time this week to discuss the comprehensive spending review?  The Government must remember that it is answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas, not the media.  My advice to the Government is that it should respect the Houses and make such announcements in the Houses.</P>
        <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, to invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who is responsible for public sector reform, to the House to explain to me and my colleagues why he, the Taoiseach and a number of other Ministers propose to continue with the dual abode allowance.  Under this allowance, the Taoiseach will be able to claim 100% mortgage interest relief on his apartment down the road on Fenian Street, to the tune of &euro;4,000, while the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has also indicated that he will claim this allowance.  In addition, they will claim allowances for their <Col N="341"/>utility bills.  This is the Government that cut the allowances for utility bills for the elderly several months ago.</P>
        <P>When I was a Member of the last D&aacute;il I opposed the dual abode allowance and agreed with the then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Enda Kenny, that it should be abolished.  The Taoiseach said at the time, as he said about many other matters, that if he was in Government, he would get rid of this allowance.  Now he will claim &euro;4,000 in mortgage interest relief and will claim for his utility bills.  That is in the context of the Keane report having been published almost nine weeks ago, with no action having been taken.  The Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brian Hayes, came to the Seanad and told us he would publish an implementation strategy on mortgages well in advance of the budget.  The Government also said it would implement an increase in mortgage interest relief to 30% for people who bought houses between 2004 and 2008, leading to an average saving of &euro;166 for hard pressed mortgage holders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator, do you have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.  I am putting the question in context&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are points the Senator can make during the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the Government that has reneged on its promise to give hard pressed mortgage holders an extra benefit of &euro;166 net per month, based on a &euro;300,000 mortgage, while its Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform &mdash; it would be funny if it was not so serious &mdash; will proceed with the dual abode allowance and claim for themselves.  I move an amendment to the Order of Business, to call for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to come to the House and answer questions as to why this Government will continue the dual abode allowance, which will cost taxpayers thousands of euro, while it is still not dealing with the mortgage crisis.</P>
        <P>I will get an opportunity to discuss the fact that the Government has also reneged on the commitment to introduce legislation to ensure the banks pass on interest rate cuts by the ECB when the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, comes to the House later this afternoon.  I will reserve my questions until then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Leader&rsquo;s announcement that a cross-party motion has been agreed on the sentencing to death of Pastor Nadarkhani in Iran, which is helpful.  I remind leaders of the other groups that I have e-mailed an updated wording of a motion on Syria and would be grateful for cross-party support on that motion, particularly in light of recent reports of further abuses and killings by the Syrian Government and the suspension of Syria by the Arab League in a really dramatic move.  This is a sign of how serious have become developments and how seriously repressive is the regime there.  In this context, I would be grateful for an early response to the motion on the continued detention of the Syrian psychoanalyst, Dr. Rafah Nashed.  The motion has been broadened to take account of other developments and of the repression and violence that has been used by the Syrian Government against peaceful protesters who have been protesting for democracy.  I hope this motion also can be taken on an agreed basis.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on prison policy in Ireland in light of the publication of the capital expenditure plan last week, which showed that further spending on Thornton Hall has been deferred.  While many Members will be quite glad of that, they also need to ascertain what other resourcing can be done to ensure, for example, the phasing out of the brutal slopping-out <Col N="342"/>practices in Mountjoy Prison.  I acknowledge work is ongoing in Mountjoy as many members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will have seen in recent weeks.  However, they need to know whether resources can be put in place to ensure that conditions in Mountjoy Prison will become better for inmates and staff alike, as well as to ascertain what plans are in place to move children out of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  The commitment in the programme for Government is to end the practice of detention of children, that is, those under 18, in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  However, those of us who visited recently saw that more than 30 children remain in detention there.  In conclusion, I wish to inform colleagues that I will hold a seminar with Dr. Harry Kennedy and Ms Emily Logan, Ombudsman for Children, at 4.30 p.m. today in the AV room to discuss the conditions in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should get her own party to do something about this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Bacik to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be grateful for the support of colleagues of all parties on this issue.  Again, it is a matter on which there was cross-party support in the last Seanad from both Government and Opposition parties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has a different attitude.  She is rolling over constantly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator White, please.  I call Senator van Turnhout.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; as leader of the Labour Party in the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to address the infrastructure and capital investment plan, which I believe needs to be debated in this House.  In line with the questions put forward by Senator Bacik, I also wish to raise the question of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  As Senator Bacik has stated, the Government has committed in the programme for Government to end the practice of sending children to the aforementioned institution and has put forward the new national children&rsquo;s detention facility on the Oberstown campus in Lusk as a solution to the unacceptable and untenable position that obtains at present.  For example, in 2010, 221 children aged between 16 and 17 were committed to adult prisons, of whom 219 were boys who were committed to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  On average, that facility has 40 boys in detention.</P>
        <P>In response to a D&aacute;il question on 20 September last on the plans to proceed with the development of the first phase of the said project, the Minister of Justice and Equality stated the Office of Public Works was &ldquo;in the process of preparing the required tender documentation for the project&rdquo; and that the Government&rsquo;s decision on funding, approval for which is required before tendering for the construction phase, would be informed by the outcome of the Government&rsquo;s capital expenditure review.  Unfortunately, when this review was published, it was silent on what would happen.</P>
        <P>Therefore, given that development of the Oberstown project is now the responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, I ask that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, come into the House to clarify the position, to outline her plans on how to proceed with the project as a matter of urgency, to confirm whether one can expect the project to be completed by mid-2013, as was the commitment given by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in December 2009, and to address formally the concerns expressed by the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, in her press release this morning.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="343"/>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, to come to the House to consider my proposal that he give consideration to the postponement of the review of county development plans on the basis of vast savings for councils at this difficult time.  From my experience as an architect, very little development will take place over the next five years and any plan can be revised as a county council can put forward a material contravention.  For example, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has estimated a cost of &euro;2 million to carry out the review of the county development plans, Kerry County Council has an estimate of &euro;200,000 for that review, Meath County Council has allocated &euro;200,000, Cork County Council is working on the costings, Sligo County Council has allocated a massive amount for its review and Galway County Council has allocated in the region of &euro;175,000.  The list goes on and the figures vary a bit.  Monaghan County Council has a figure of &euro;265,000, Westmeath has allocated in the region of &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000, Waterford County Council, the Leader&rsquo;s area, has included &euro;50,000, which is very economical, and Mayo County Council, in the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s area, had a sum of approximately &euro;78,000 in 2009 and it put &euro;150,000&mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">These are points that can be made in the debate.  Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I had a brief discussion with the Minister and he is very anxious to get the submission.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House.  There is vast experience in the House on this issue.  It is, I hope, a helpful suggestion to the Government which would save a considerable amount of money and, in the circumstances, I feel it is worthwhile.  As part of a constructive and very helpful Opposition, it is appropriate that I would put forward the proposal.  I would like the opposite side of the House to look at this situation.  I will certainly put down a matter on the Adjournment if I cannot get results directly.  I ask the Cathaoirleach to accede to that on Wednesday, if possible.</P>
        <P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to the Government and the relevant authorities that the iconic new bridge spanning the River Boyne be named the Mary McAleese bridge.  She has served this country as President for 14 extraordinary years and there would be no more fitting monument to her great work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the county council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The bridge will stand as a constant reminder of her great work and it will show the constant need to keep alive links between the two parts of this island.  I also draw to the attention of the House that it would be the first monumental civic structure to be named after a lady.  It is more than time that this be done in this country. I ask the Leader to convey what I have said, and to consider this.  I would be interested in the response.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.</P>
      
	<P Just="Left">I congratulate President Michael D. Higgins on his inauguration.  I had to pinch myself to know I was there at the inauguration.  The last time I did that was when Haggardstown Geraldines won the senior championship.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>How appropriate that Haggardstown should come into the situation.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="344"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to raise two issues with the Leader.  First, there is a need for a debate on accountability in Government and I ask that the Leader would provide space to have that discussion in the course of the coming weeks.  People are rightly outraged at news of the outrageous pension payments which have been made to senior civil servants and politicians in recent years.  This includes retired Ministers and all those who lost their seats, and not only politicians but also senior civil servants.  A county manager in Waterford retired and received a lump sum payment of &euro;200,000 tax free, and he got that on the basis of eight years of work which he did not do to bring him up to the 40 years of service.  These kinds of payments are causing outrage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot raise personalities in this way.  The person is not here to defend himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter of public record.  There is nothing to defend.  This is wrong, it is outrageous and it should not be happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should refrain from mentioning people&rsquo;s names in the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on the general issue of those kinds of pensions being paid to senior civil servants and politicians, and also in regard to appointments to State boards and judicial positions because of political patronage.  We were told this was something from the past but it most certainly is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>They were only appointed because they were eminently qualified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>There is also need for a proper pre-budget debate in the House.  We are all being lobbied by many organisations that are hosting pre-budget submissions, all of which are doing good work.  Political parties will launch their pre-budget submissions; we launched ours earlier.  I ask that a half day be set aside in the House for us to discuss the upcoming budget.  There is no point in the Minister for Finance coming to the House after he proposes his budget.  He should come to the House before he announces the budget to listen to alternative voices, opinions and proposals from parties and Independent groupings and to give us an opportunity to relay to him the lobbying we have received from groups ranging from the Carers Association and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to the trade union movement and others, which are putting forward realistic, genuine alternatives that should be considered.  It would be important for the Leader to provide time in the coming weeks for a proper pre-budget debate and not to have the Minister come to the House after he has put the budget in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>We have no difficulty with Senator Cullinane and his party giving us a detailed written submission on their proposals.  I am sure the Minister for Finance will take on board all proposals furnished&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is missing the point.  The Minister should debate them with us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;but we will arrive at decisions which are in the best interests of the country.</P><Col N="345"/>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the role of VHI in the private health care sector.  The company has taken a decision not to cover patients who wish to avail of services at a brand new hospital in Cork.  The hospital cost &euro;75 million to build.  It is fully equipped with MRI scanners, four new operating theatres and state-of-the-art facilities.  The other two health insurers are prepared to provide cover but the VHI is not.  I filed a complaint with the Competition Authority because this is anti-competitive.  Will the Leader bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Health?  It is important that there be a debate on the matter, given VHI is adopting a role it was not set up to perform, which is to decide who can and cannot provide health care.  Patients who are prepared to use the Cork hospital or the Mater Private Hospital, which has an established record in Dublin, are being provided with cover for the Dublin facility but not for the Cork facility.  It is a disgrace and this matter needs to be debated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s suggestion and compliment him on his generosity of intent in this regard.  It is a great idea to thank a former President who has given such service to the State.  She enjoys the affection and appreciation of all the people, irrespective of politics or religion, and she is a symbol of sincerity, courage and hope.  Doing what the Senator suggests will remind us of what is expected of public figures in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We had a debate not so long ago on the closure of several Army barracks.  The Minister of State attended the House for the debate, which was not the most edifying debate, but those things happens.  He indicated at the time that a decision had not been made.  Since then all the towns that are likely to be affected have made their case.  I accompanied a delegation from Clonmel to meet the Minister for Defence and, last week, the people of Clonmel delivered a petition of 8,000 signatures to him asking that he reconsider any negative decision that might be made.  The main argument is that there is no saving involved in the closure of the barracks. It will cause considerable upheaval among the families involved.  In the case of Clonmel, for instance, the husbands and fathers will have to travel to the barracks in Limerick.  The cost of this is not being taken into account and, where there are young families, children will be unnecessarily denied the company and support of their fathers throughout the week.  There will be further expenditure in Limerick.  I am not too sure where the decision is coming from.  It certainly does not result in savings and will have a considerable social impact on the towns involved.  Clonmel will lose &euro;10 million per year.  The decision results in the opposite of savings in that there will be huge losses involved.  I appeal to the Leader, at this late hour and irrespective of whether decisions are made, to revisit this issue because of the social and economic impact.  We could never justify the closure and would regret such a negative decision.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am concerned about the impact that certain elements of the capital expenditure review programme have had or will have, particularly in the area of juvenile detention.  There is a clear commitment in the programme for Government that youths of 16 and 17 will no longer be detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, which is part of the Mountjoy campus.  Members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, including me, visited the facility approximately two weeks ago.  I would be far more comfortable if the proposed facility in Oberstown were developed properly.  I call on the Leader to invite both the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to the House as soon as possible, particularly in light of the comments made today by the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan.  The latter has overall responsibility for ensuring the rights of children are protected.  Her intervention today is very timely and worrying.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the country has, for the first time, a senior Minister with responsibility for children, but we need clarity urgently.  In the absence of funding being made available to <Col N="346"/>upgrade the facility in Oberstown, we need both Ministers to tell the House their plans to cease detaining children in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, given that the incarceration of 16 and 17 year olds in a prison environment is completely inappropriate and goes against all forms of international human rights.  I would like the debate to be held as a matter of urgency, with the Ministers in attendance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; in requesting the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to the House today to obtain clarification on the strong rumours that have been circulating, not only today but also for the past three months, in regard to four barracks, three in particular.  One is in Castlebar, which is basically a store.  I assume it is being closed to make the Taoiseach look good in that he will appear to have sacrificed a barracks in his own county.  The other three barracks are in Clonmel, Mullingar and Cavan town, my county town.</P>
        <P>The decision to close the barracks involves 700 personnel, as the Army would refer to them.  These are 700 human beings, men and women, who have served this country well both at home and abroad.  The closures involve their families, wives, husbands, partners and children.  The decisions involve the communities the barracks have served since the foundation of the State.  They involve the economies of the towns in which the barracks are based and the surrounding areas.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has alluded to this.  If the barracks in Cavan is closed, it will cost the local economy &euro;3 million annually.  In respect of the other two towns involved, it will cost in the region of &euro;15 million.  It will cost more than &euro;30 million to re-accommodate these people.  This does not make economic sense nor does it make any sense from a security point of view.  The barracks in Cavan is the first and only purpose-built barracks since the foundation of the State.  It accommodates 140 personnel and 100 reservists.  The only barracks between south-west Donegal and Dundalk is now on the cards for closure.  I accepted the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides when he stated in response to an Adjournment matter I tabled several weeks ago that no decision had then been made.  However, while he may not have brought a decision to the Cabinet, a decision has been made by the overpaid bureaucrats in the Army.  One fewer bureaucrat would keep the Army barracks in Cavan open for one year.  We have the most officer heavy Army in the world, with one officer per six soldiers.  That is a fact.</P>

	<P>I am sure Sinn F&eacute;in could pick a Minister from the Stormont Assembly to explain why the &pound;400 million allocated by the British Government to the Northern Ireland Executive for the A5 motorway is being spent on other projects.  This project was mentioned in last week&rsquo;s review of the programme on capital expenditure.  Roads investment has been halted for a period of five years according to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, and a contribution from the Irish Government of &euro;500 million for the A5 is being deferred.  However, the Northern Ireland Minister for Finance and Personnel, Sammy Wilson, MLA, has <Col N="347"/>stated that the &pound;400 million allocated by the British Government for the A5 will be spent on other projects in Northern Ireland.  I propose that the money be spent to commence the road between Aughnacloy and Derry because &pound;400 million would build more than 50% of the route.</P>

	<P>To answer that question, we ask that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport discuss the capital investment plan with the House.  We could probably put Senator Harte&rsquo;s question to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  Apparently, the matching funding that was supposed to be available from this side of the Border for the A5 was not available, so perhaps we should get that clarified by the Government parties.  Ba mhaith liom, freisin, &eacute; seo a iarraidh ar an gCeannaire.  The Sinn F&eacute;in delegation wrote to all Members of the Seanad about speaking time.  We made some positive recommendations as regards allocating speaking time to Sinn F&eacute;in Members of the House.  Has a decision has been reached on that?  We have been told by numerous Members from across the House that they are in favour of the recommendations.  We are anxious to know if any decision has been reached by the Leader or the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Will he clarify if that will appertain to today&rsquo;s debates?  We hope it will.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the inquiry into the Ballymurphy massacre of August 1971.  The Attorney General for Northern Ireland, Mr. John Larkin, has announced there will be an inquiry into this atrocity, in which ten civilians were killed.  They were shot dead by British troops.

        <P Just="Left">I called last week, and the Leader appeared to be amenable, go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta.  There is a timescale to this because a deadline of two months has been given for the review of the samhl&uacute; maoinithe, the new funding model that is being proposed through For&aacute;s na Gaeilge, to be negotiated and put in place.

I have a question for the Minister about the bridge.  It was built during her magnificent presidency and it would be an everlasting symbol of the part Mary McAleese personally played in bringing peace to this island and her role in building bridges between all communities in Northern Ireland.  The naming of this bridge after her would be a most deserved tribute to her memorable 14 years.  All Members will be unanimous on the truly magnificent contribution she has made.  Will the Leader bring this worthwhile suggestion to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar?  I also call on Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy to bring it to the attention of Meath County Council and Louth County Council, who would have a part to play.  I congratulate my colleague on his wonderful idea.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to cut capital spending by &euro;700 million per year over and above what Fianna F&aacute;il had agreed with the EU and IMF, to avoid making more difficult political decisions.  In County Meath, the Slane bypass has been cut, despite the Minister of State, Deputy Shane McEntee, telling us after the election that a secret deal had been done with the Labour Party to bring it back, in the same way as he said the Ward Union would also be brought back under a secret deal with the Labour Party.  He also asserted that the Slane bypass was a top five priority project for the Government.  Instead, it has been cut completely from the programme.  Moreover, the Navan rail line has been cut completely from the programme.  As for the proposed regional hospital for the north east, the four Fine Gael Deputies, as well as the Minister, Deputy Reilly, told the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> about a month before the election <Col N="349"/>that not only were they going to promise to deliver it, but that they already had met investors who would fund the construction of that hospital.

	<P Just="Left">I wish to support my two colleagues from County Louth on the naming of the bridge and to pay tribute to Mary McAleese on the wonderful job she did in the past 14 years.  It would be a fitting testament to her work.  As I did not do so last week, I join in the congratulations extended to our new President, Michael D. Higgins, to wish him well in the &Aacute;ras and to compliment everyone who was involved in the highly impressive inauguration ceremony last Friday of which the country can be duly proud.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to come into the House to discuss the behaviour of energy suppliers.  I refer in particular to Airtricity, as I have reason to believe its treatment of some customers leaves much to be desired.  A case recently was brought to my attention concerning a couple who had made an arrangement with the company to pay a certain amount per week but who were cut off without notice.</P>

	<P>It is important to raise such an issue in this House.  Even when the arrears were cleared for the aforementioned struggling young couple by family members, it took five days before their supply was reinstated.  This is not acceptable in this day andage and the Minister should discuss the behaviour of energy suppliers with Members in this Chamber.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Leader might arrange for the Minister for Justice and Equality to provide an update to Members on the progress being made on the drafting of the proposed landlord and tenant business leases review Bill, which is due to be introduced to the House fairly shortly.  There is concern among the business community that this may not be making the progress that was expected.  Many jobs are at stake and all Members have been contacted recently by several businesses with grave concerns regarding any potential delay in the introduction of this badly-needed legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the all-party motion on the Order of Business today with regard to Pastor Jousef Nadarkhani.  That issue was taken up by the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and me with the Iranian ambassador only two weeks ago.  He undertook to revert to us with a comprehensive reply to our queries.  In this context, I also welcome the letter I received from the T&aacute;naiste which expressed his concerns on this and other human rights issues in Iran.  Therefore, I was greatly surprised to learn, on the day I received this letter, that he had decided to close the Irish Embassy in Iran, as well as two other embassies.  Iran is a country with which Ireland had &euro;86 million of trade last year, &euro;82 million of which was in exports.  Ireland has embassies in many countries with which we do not have anything like the level of trade we enjoy with Iran.  The reasons advanced do not hold water when one examines the position with regard to other embassies.  Like many people, I was appalled to see the closure of the embassy to the Holy See. That embassy was opened in 1929 at a time when we only had three other embassies or delegations, one in Washington in the US, one in London and the other to the League of Nations, so there is a long history of association with the Vatican.  Given the fact 90% of our population is Catholic, I thought it was an amazing decision to take.</P>
      
	<P Just="Left">I do not want to accuse the Minister of having more to do with ideology than anything else, but it is certainly short-sighted.  I ask that the T&aacute;naiste come to the House to address this issue &mdash; to the best of my knowledge, he has not been in the House at all since the election.  I was not surprised that it came from a member of the Labour Party, given it would represent and accord with the views of people in the Labour Party, but I was very surprised with the suppliant attitude of Fine Gael in that regard.  I thought it would have been a much more majorissue within that party.  I am glad the Fianna F&aacute;il party spokesman in the D&aacute;il has put it on the record that, should Fianna F&aacute;il be returned to office in the future, it intends to reopen that embassy.</P>

It is an anti-jobs move and is biting off the hand that feeds us.  Employers are multipliers.  They need to be encouraged, not discouraged.  We know that SMEs are the lifeblood of this country.</P>
        <P>This morning, I received three calls from employers, and I am sure others in the House received similar calls.  One was from the operator of an SME employing seven people who said that the staff would have to be called in this morning and told they would be without jobs if this went ahead, and that the business would downsize to being a sole trader.  Two other employers in Galway city told me they would offer their employees the opportunity to be subcontractors.  What is the outcome?  It is less revenue for the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us be reasonable and get a message straight through to the Minister, Deputy Burton, that this must be changed.  It is a bad move for jobs and the mantra of the Government is about jobs and getting people back to work.</P>

	<P>Fine Gael people, many of whom feel this was a wrong-headed move, know what they have to do on this issue.  I do not believe it will go away because it was unnecessarily hurtful.  Not only was it a hurtful gesture, it is quite interesting to note that many eminent, neutral commentators in the media, including people like Mr. Stephen Collins, Mr. Deagl&aacute;n de Br&eacute;ad&uacute;n and Mr. Eamon Delaney, a writer and former employee of the Depart<Col N="352"/>ment of Foreign Affairs, also think it is a wrong-headed move.  It is not just a particular sector of society that is concerned about this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been many calls for debates on political reform.  <i>The Irish Times</i> and its journalist Mr. Paul Cullen have done us a service by pointing to the failure of the current Government to end the culture of cronyism when it comes to making political appointments. I do not like having to say this but many people welcomed what the Taoiseach had to say when he was running for office about the new approach that would be taken and they will be disappointed to see that he is back to old, bad practices.  I spend a great deal of time showing school and college groups and others around Leinster House and I talk to them very often about the separation of powers and how important it is that the Executive is separate from the Legislature and from the Judiciary and so on.</P>

	<P>It does not help the perception around our separation of powers when there is such an obvious link between political participation and appointment to the Judiciary, in particular.  We need to debate that and other appointments to State agencies.  The people are looking and they want to see whether Ireland is turning a corner in terms of new, better and more ethical practices.  We should have a debate at an early stage about the way in which appointments are made and the Government needs to show it is getting away from the bad old culture of appointing friends.  There should only be one criterion when it comes to making appointments of this kind and that is merit.</P>

A number of extremely important projects have been dropped, including the Slane bypass which, as previous speakers stated, could save lives, and the upgrading of the A5 road into the North.  The previous Government committed to spend &euro;480 million on the A5 project.  What the Government is doing is not only an attack on funding that was previously allocated, it is also an attack on what has been achieved on the island of Ireland in the context of bringing about peace.  This project is a fundamental aspect of the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement and it was signed up to by the previous Government and the Administration in the North.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise two issues.  First, will the Leader ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to come before the House for a debate on the review by the Valuation Office of rateable valuations nationally?  The process in this regard began in 2005.  In 2008, it was estimated that the process would not be concluded until 2018.  However, I spoke to the Commissioner of Valuation recently and he informed me that it will not be possible to conclude it until at least 2020.</P>

	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Three local authorities in Dublin have reduced the rates relating to certain sectors &mdash; the hospitality sector is most notable among these &mdash; by 30%.  There is a need to expedite matters in respect of the review of rateable valuations nationally.  If he is <Col N="358"/>available, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, should be brought before the House in order that we might engage in a discussion on this matter.  Rate reductions will not be much good to people if they are only introduced in 2020 because many individuals will have gone out of business by then.</P>
        <P>The second issue to which I wish to refer is quite alarming and perhaps other Senators might indicate whether it affects their areas.  I refer to the fact that companies are making small numbers of people redundant every week.  There is a company which operates in my locality which has let 25 people go on each of the past two Fridays.  The individuals to whom I refer had been employed on temporary contracts.  Some of them worked for the company for a year and others had done so for two years.</P>

	<P>Absolutely.  I would ask the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Bruton, into the House to discuss this.  If there were 50 lay-offs anywhere in the country today there would be uproar, but it is the way it is being done.  I wonder if it is legal.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I echo the comments of other Senators, especially Senator Wilson, on the Army barracks closures.  The Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, has resigned on the basis that the decision to close the Army barracks was not backed up by facts and figures.  Like other Senators, I call for the Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter, to come into this House and show us his part of the comprehensive spending review, the cost benefit analysis and the impact assessment being made because this decision makes no economic sense.  If a Cabinet Minister resigns because he has no faith in a decision and the reason for it, then we cannot have faith.  The Minister of State needs to come here to clarify the issue.  We can look at the decision only when we see the figures.</P>
     
	<P Just="Left">The memorandum of understanding with the EU-IMF includes a commitment that by the end of the third quarter of 2011 the Government must establish an independent regulator to implement the outstanding recommendations of the Competition Authority aimed at reducing legal costs.  I note that the Legal Services Regulation Bill was published in October.  I ask that the Minister come to the House to provide an update on the implementation of the Competition authority&rsquo;s recommendation and if the Leader can indicate when that legislation is expected to come before this House.  Of late, and especially in terms of the economic circumstances, I have heard stories from many people about cowboy solicitors and barristers exploiting people who have little or no redress from the Bar Council and the Law Society.  When can we expect that legislation to come before this House?</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for letting me in to defend myself.  I am disappointed with my friend.  It is a wonder that we can be friends because we disagree so regularly.

	<P>My question for the Leader relates to the point made by my colleague, Senator Paul Coghlan, on the banks.  Who exactly do Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank think they are?  The Taoiseach asked them, because he wanted to avoid us investing time in having to bring legislation into both Houses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and others raised the issue of the capital programme.  Its focus is on jobs, education and health care and it is certainly arealistic plan, bearing out the reality of the economic situation in which we find ourselves.  The reality is that the country simply cannot afford to do everything the Government wants todo.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The plan is based on what we can afford to do.  I am awaiting confirmation from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, that he can come to the House on Tuesday.  He has promised that he will do so to speak on the matter and it is just a question of finding out what time he will be here.  I assure the House on this, as I did last week with regard to requests to bring the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, to the House to discuss the rate cut as he will do today.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, will come to the House, I hope next week, to discuss the capital plan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Brien also raised the question of the second home tax relief for Ministers.  Cutting costs at the top has been ongoing since the Government came to office.  Previously, it announced a reduction in the pay of the Taoiseach and Ministers, changes to ministerial transport arrangements and the top level appointments commission terms that apply to Secretaries General on retirement.</P>

I will certainly ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and perhaps the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to address the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden raised the matter of deferring county development plans.  The Minister will come to the House tomorrow and perhaps the Senator can raise it then.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senators Jim D&rsquo;Arcy, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Brennan, Byrne, Paul Coghlan, White and Moran raised the issue of the Boyne bridge and its possible renaming to the Mary McAleese bridge.  I apologise if I missed out on other Senators who also raised this matter.  Senator D&rsquo;Arcy should be complimented on his excellent suggestion. As has been stated, the former President built many bridges between communities in Northern Ireland in her term of office.  The matter may have to be addressed by local authorities and the NRA but I assure the Senator I will discuss it with the Minister and the Taoiseach, if necessary, to see whether we can progress this excellent suggestion.</P>
      
	<P>Senator Cullinane raised the matter of pension payments.  The Government has taken action on this matter.  The Senator also raised the question of political patronage.

The Government has also decided that chairpersons of boards will make themselves available to the appropriate Oireachtas committee where they can be questioned on their potential contribution to the board.

        <P Just="Left">Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Wilson and Reilly mentioned army barracks closures, which certainly will have a major impact on the communities in question, in the same way they had an impact on the communities where 11 barracks were closed under the Fianna F&aacute;il regime in the past ten years.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Those closures created major upheaval for families in those communities.  We all realise that it will create problems for all the families concerned, but we must look at expenditure.  We also have to examine the various commissions&rsquo; reports and studies going back to the 1990s that have identified barracks closures as a fundamental requirement in improving military effectiveness and efficiency.  The Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, is a man of principle.  I understand, as the Taoiseach has announced in the other House, that the Minister of State has decided to resign as a result of proposed barracks closures.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I will certainly seek a debate on the question of the Irish language and the funding model.  I am glad the Senator has said that a timescale is involved in this, but I am sure the Minister will attend the House to address those problems.</P>
        <P>Senator Byrne is seeking a debate on the capital programme.  The Government is not afraid to take tough decisions.  We were elected by the people to sort out the mess, which is what we will do.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullins mentioned problems with energy suppliers and sought clarity on theLandlord and Tenants Review Bill.  I will find out for the Senator when that matter will be addressed.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh and other Members referred to the closure of embassies.  We discussed this matter at length last week on the Order of Business.  I will endeavour to have the T&aacute;naiste attend the House shortly to address the many foreign affairs items that the House needs to discuss.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames raised problems which were a news item today in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I do not think we should believe everything we read in the newspaper.  The Minister will be in the Chamber on Thursday and that matter can be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have addressed the issue of appointments to State bodies raised by Senator Mullen.  The criteria for appointment are ability and merit.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator Coghlan raised the question of interest rates and was hoping that Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank would follow the lead of AIB.  We all agree with him.  We will have a discussion on the matter this evening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We can debate the matter raised by Senator White on Thursday.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the closure of embassies.  I would be pleased if he could provide a list of embassies that we could close.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade would welcome a copy of the list, if he has another list of embassies that could be closed.</P>

There is a need to speed up the process and I hope the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, will come to the House next week.  In respect of the temporary workers on contract who are being let go, perhaps the Senator will raise the issue on the Adjournment when he will get a more detailed reply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Reilly has asked when the legal services Bill will be brought to the House.  I will revert to the Senator on the matter.</P>

    <Title>Nurses and Midwives Bill 2010: Second Stage</Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the Nurses and Midwives Bill is to enhance the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and to ensure the integrity of the practice of nursing and midwifery.  The Bill provides for this in a number of ways.  It is the stated object of the board that the regulatory structure for the professions of nursing and midwifery would be brought up to date and in line with those for other health care <Col N="366"/>professions, and this has been done.  Accountability and governance are at the heart of the structure of the regulatory body.</P>
        <P>As I am sure many Members are aware, the legislation before the House has been examined in great detail.  I am aware that a number of groups have raised issues about some provisions of the Bill and I and my colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputies Shortall and Lynch, as well as officials in my Department have undertaken detailed examinations of the issues raised.  I refer in particular to the issue of the midwifery provisions contained in the Bill and I will address these in more detail later.</P>
        <P>Before I go into more detail on the key elements of the Bill I would like to set out the intention behind this legislation and provide Members with a brief outline of its key features.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister to proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate the fact that the purpose of the Bill is to enhance the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and to ensure the integrity of the practice of nursing and midwifery.  This legislation will provide for a modern, efficient, transparent and accountable system for the regulation of the nursing and midwifery professions, which will satisfy the public and these professions that all nurses and midwives are appropriately qualified and competent to practice in a safe manner on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>The principal features of the Bill are the enhanced protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives, the repeal of the Nurses Act 1985 and for a new legislative framework in respect of nurses and midwives.  The regulatory body, Bord Altranais agus Cn&aacute;imhseachais na h&Eacute;ireann &mdash; the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, will have a stronger governance and accountability structure.  It provides for a non-nursing-midwifery majority on the board and on the fitness to practise committees.  It recognises midwifery as a separate and distinct profession and provides that midwives attending a woman in childbirth must have adequate clinical indemnity insurance.  It provides for improved investigation mechanisms for complaints about nurses and midwives, including the creation of an assessment committee prior to fitness-to-practice investigations, and the appointment of investigators to facilitate such preliminary investigations.  Fitness-to-practice inquiries will generally be held in public.  The legislation provides for the registration of nurses and midwives, the establishment of a register of those training to be a nurse or midwife and the prohibition of unregistered nurses and midwives engaging in the practices of nursing and midwifery.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the approval of programmes of education and further education necessary for the purpose of registration, the specification of standards of practice for registered nurses and midwives, and guidance on all matters related to professional conduct and ethics.  It further provides for a new statutory framework for the maintenance of professional competence of registered nurses and midwives, including an obligation on employers to facilitate the maintenance of professional competence and midwives, in particular by providing learning opportunities in the workplace.  It also provides for the dissolution of the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery.</P>
        <P>I will outline in more detail the various Parts of the Bill.   Part 1 contains preliminary and general information and provides the Title of the legislation.  It sets out the definitions of words and terms used throughout the Bill and that midwifery is recognised as a separate profession from nursing.  It provides the Minister with the power to make regulations under the legislation.  It provides for the repeal of the Nurses Act 1985 and that any expenses incurred by the Minister <Col N="367"/>in the administration of the Act can be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas to the extent approved by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>Part 2 contains provisions related to the board.  The board will continue but will be renamed Bord Altranais agus Cn&aacute;imheaschais na h&Eacute;ireann, or, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.  This not only reiterates the recognition of midwifery as a separate profession but helps to herald the new era in nursing and midwifery regulation.</P>
        <P>I will outline some of the more important sections in this Part of the Bill, commencing with sections 8, 9, 13 and 15.  Section 8 sets out that the objective of the board is protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the integrity of the practice of nursing and midwifery through the promotion of high standards of processional education, training and practice and professional conduct among nurses and midwives.  I cannot stress enough that the protection of the public will be central to the regulation of nurses and midwives.</P>
        <P>Section 9 outlines the functions of the board.  These include the registration of nurses, midwives and candidates for these professions, the regulation of education and training and recognition of qualifications of nurses and midwives, including qualifications awarded in other countries.  Other functions will be the setting of standards of practice and ethical guidance for nurses and midwives, the maintenance of their professional competence, the establishment of a code of professional conduct for registered nurses and midwives, the specification of criteria for the creation by employers of specialist posts, the handling of complaints and inquiries relating to the conduct of nurses and midwives and advising the public on all matters of general interest relating to the functions of the board and to nurses, midwives and their practice.</P>
        <P>The board will also advise the Minister on all matters relating to the functions conferred on it by this legislation.  It must have regard to the functions of other bodies and the policies and objectives of the Government to the extent that they relate to the board&rsquo;s functions.  The Minister for Health will have the power to confer additional functions on the board.</P>
        <P>Section 13 sets out the board&rsquo;s power to make rules for the purpose of the better operation of any provision of this legislation or at the request of the Minister.  The board will make rules for the operation of committees; registration; receipt of evidence by the preliminary proceedings and fitness-to-practice committees; the establishment, membership, functions and procedures of sub-committees; the setting of standards and criteria for nursing and midwifery education and training; requirements for indemnity insurance for midwives and any professional competence scheme.  To provide for greater accountability, draft rules will be subject to a period of public consultation and rules will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Health.  In addition, the Minister for Finance must approve any rules relating to a professional competence scheme.  Rules will be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Section 15 allows the board to enter into co-operation agreements with prescribed bodies to avoid duplication of activities and to allow for appropriate consultation and joint studies.  It also provides for information to be shared.  Section 16 allows the board to pass on information regarding the commission of an indictable offence, while section 17 prohibits the disclosure of confidential information unless it authorised by the board.</P>
        <P>Part 3 sets out the board&rsquo;s obligations in regard to the preparation of a statement of strategy for its term of office and the preparation of annual business plans and annual reports.  Part 4 sets out provisions for membership, committees and employees of the board.  The key sections of this Part are sections 22 and 24.</P>
        <P>Section 22 provides that the board shall have 23 members representing nursing and midwifery, educational bodies and stakeholders.  Eleven members shall be nurses or midwives, of whom eight shall be elected.  There will also be nurse representatives from general nursing, children&rsquo;s nursing, psychiatric nursing, intellectual disability nursing, public health nursing and <Col N="368"/>nurses engaged in the care of older persons.  In addition, there will be a midwife or nurse employed in the public health sector and engaged in the education of nurses or midwives.  At least three of the elected members must be engaged in clinical practice.  In addition, a director of nursing or midwifery and one nurse and one midwife from the third level education sector will be appointed as board members.  The non-nursing or midwifery members of the board will be appointed from a variety of areas.  The Medical Council, Health and Social Care Professionals Council and Health Information and Quality Authority will each nominate a member, the Health Service Executive will nominate two members and a member will be appointed from the voluntary sector.  The Minister for Education and Skills will also nominate a member from a third level establishment.  A further five members of the board who are not nurses or midwives and who have such qualifications, expertise, interests or experience that, in the opinion of the Minister, would enable them to make a contribution to the performance of the board&rsquo;s functions will be appointed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The president and vice president will be elected by the board from among its members.  The president of the first board does not have to be a nurse or midwife.  However, subsequent board presidents will have to be nurses or midwives.  The vice-president will always be a nurse or midwife.</P>
        <P>The board&rsquo;s power to establish committees to fulfil any of its functions is set out in section 24.  These committees will be established under board rules.  Five committees will be established on a statutory basis.  The preliminary proceedings and the fitness to practise committees will be established, respectively, to investigate complaints and to inquire into complaints made under the board&rsquo;s disciplinary procedures under Parts 7, 8 and 9.  At least one third of the members of each of these committees will be board members and the majority of members will not be nurses or midwives.</P>
        <P>The midwives committee will advise the board on matters relating to midwifery practice.  Following further consideration during this Bill&rsquo;s passage through the D&aacute;il, the minimum membership of this committee has been increased.  The midwives committee will comprise at least eight members, including two registered midwife practitioners, two other midwives, of whom one may be a self-employed community midwife, a medical practitioner in obstetrics or gynaecology, a registered nurse board member and two persons who are representative of the public interest and who are not nurses or midwives.</P>
        <P>I have received a number of representations in regard to the functions of this committee.  In particular, an amendment has been sought to provide that decisions made by the midwives committee would be binding on the board.  However, it is not possible for a committee of a board to make binding decisions on the board.  This would be contrary to good governance because the board is accountable and responsible for decisions.</P>
        <P>Two other committees will be established on a statutory basis.  The education and training committee will perform functions in relation to the education and training of nurses and midwives and the health committee will support nurses and midwives with relevant medical disabilities or who have given consent to medical treatment under fitness to practise procedures.  The Part also includes provisions for the appointment and terms and conditions of the chief executive officer, CEO, and employees of the board.</P>
        <P>Part 5 contains provisions relating to the accounts and finances of the board, including provision that the board&rsquo;s accounts will be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P>Part 6 sets out the requirements for the registration of nurses and midwives.  Unregistered nurses and midwives will not be allowed to practise, except where rendering first aid.  The <Col N="369"/>board can issue a permit to a nurse or midwife who is registered in another country in circumstances where they are entering Ireland for a short period for humanitarian purposes for a period of no more than 30 days.  The Bill sets out the penalties and offences for contravening these provisions.  I intend to speak in more detail about the midwifery provisions of this legislation later, including the necessity for midwives who attend a woman in childbirth to have adequate clinical indemnity insurance.</P>
        <P>I refer Members to sections 40(1), 46 and 50.  Section 40(1) of the Bill provides that no person shall, for reward, attend a woman in childbirth unless the person is a registered midwife who maintains adequate clinical indemnity insurance in accordance with the rules.  The provision continues on to list others who can attend a woman in childbirth.  This includes a registered medical practitioner, a person undergoing training to be a registered medical practitioner or a registered midwife who gives such attention as part of a course of professional training or a person undergoing training in obstetrics who gives such attention as part of a course of professional training.</P>
        <P>This provision is included as there is a need to ensure that midwives have adequate insurance lest a case of negligence is taken, as court cases relating to a birth where negligence is proven often result in very high damages being awarded.  It would add further to the distress of the parents if a case of negligence was proven and the midwife involved was not insured.  However, I will address this matter further later.</P>
        <P>Another important section is section 46 which provides for the establishment of two registers.  The nurses and midwives register will include the names and qualifications of registered nurses and midwives and will consist of at least two divisions &mdash; the nurses division and the midwives division.  The board can create other divisions in the register.  The candidate register will include the names and details of all those pursuing education and training leading to first time registration with the board.  It, too, will contain a nurses division and a midwives division.  The Bill provides that the registration of a nurse or midwife can be annotated to include additional qualifications.  Both registers will be published.  However, I assure Members of the House that personal information will be protected from disclosure.  Conditions can be attached to a nurse&rsquo;s or midwife&rsquo;s registration as a result of a fitness to practise inquiry or a declared medical disability.</P>
        <P>Section 50 sets out that a nurse or midwife can apply to have his or her name removed from the register unless they are the subject of a complaint under the board&rsquo;s fitness to practise procedures.  The board may remove a nurse or midwife from the register if they are suffering from an illness or terminal illness which would render their practice unsafe and where they are unable to self-remove from the register.  This Part also includes the board&rsquo;s and the nurse&rsquo;s or midwife&rsquo;s responsibilities relating to the maintenance of registers.</P>
        <P>Parts 7, 8 and 9 set out the provisions with regard to the board&rsquo;s fitness to practise functions.  Part 7 provides for the function of the preliminary proceedings committee, which will given initial consideration to complaints.  It is section 55 in this Part of the Bill which provides that complaints can be made relating to professional misconduct, poor professional performance, non-compliance with a code of professional conduct, relevant medical disabilities, failure to comply with a relevant condition, failure to comply with an undertaking or to take any action specified in a consent given in response to a request under section 65 &mdash; where a registered nurse or midwife consents to a censure or remedial action, an irregularity relating to the custody, prescription or supply of a controlled drug or a conviction for an indictable offence in the State or in another jurisdiction.  Part 7 also contains provisions for the appointment by the board of investigators to assist the preliminary proceedings committee, the ability of the board to make an <i>ex parte</i> application to the High Court for an order to suspend the registration of <Col N="370"/>a nurse or midwife should this be deemed necessary for the protection of the public, the referral of complaints to another body, should this be more appropriate to the functions of another body, or to mediate.  Section 60 sets out that the board may prepare guidelines for the resolution of complaints by mediation or other informal means.  Both the complainant and the nurse or midwife must agree to participate in mediation.  Complaints cannot be resolved through the giving or receiving of financial compensation.  I am sure Members will agree there may be cases in which the use of mediation would be the most appropriate method of complaint resolution.  This legislation will provide for its use but only as and when it is appropriate to so do.  Each complaint to the preliminary proceedings committee will be examined case by case.</P>
        <P>Part 8 sets out the role and duties of the fitness to practise committee and how hearings should be conducted.  Provisions are included to ensure all parties involved in a complaint are kept informed regarding that complaint.  For the purposes of an inquiry, the fitness to practise committee will have the rights and privileges vested in the High Court.  In general, hearings of this committee will be held in public in a measure to improve openness and transparency.  However, if an application is made by the nurse or midwife or witness, part or all of the inquiry may be held in private.  I should mention section 65, which provides that the fitness to practise committee, with the consent of the board, may at any time during an inquiry request the nurse or midwife to give consent in respect of a board censure, undergo medical treatment or give an undertaking to take a course of action the committee deems the appropriate with regard to the resolution of the complaint.  Where a required undertaking or consent is given, then the inquiry is considered complete.  If a nurse or midwife refuses to give such an undertaking or complaint, the committee can proceed with the inquiry.</P>
        <P>Part 9 sets out the duties of the board and the chief executive officer were complaints have been referred to the fitness to practise committee to inquire into.  While the role of this committee will be to inquire into complaints, it is the board, as the regulatory body for nurses and midwives, that will decide on the appropriate measure to be imposed against a nurse or midwife.  A key section within this Part is section 69, which sets out these measures, namely, an advice or admonishment or a censure in writing, a censure in writing and a fine not exceeding &euro;2,000, the attachment of conditions to registration, the transfer of a nurse or midwife&rsquo;s registration to another division of the register, suspension of registration, cancellation of registration and prohibition from applying for restoration for a specified period.  The imposition of sanctions is subject to High Court approval, except a decision regarding an advice, admonishment or censure in writing, and is subject to the right to appeal.  The board is obliged to inform the Minister and the employer regarding the imposition of sanctions and to notify a registration body in another jurisdiction where it is appropriate to so do.  Further to this, if the board deems it necessary in the public interest, the public can be informed of sanctions against a nurse or midwife and the board can publish all or some of an inquiry transcript.</P>
        <P>Part 10 sets out the duties of the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the board with regard to education and training.  The HSE will, in so far as is possible, facilitate the education and training of candidates for registration and will promote and co-ordinate the development of specialist education and training.  It will co-operate with the board and training bodies in respect of workforce planning.  The board will set and publish standards of education and training and will have the power to approve programmes and bodies for the delivery of these and to recognise qualifications awarded in other jurisdictions and will be responsible for the provision of career information on nursing and midwifery.</P>
        <P>Part 11 contains provisions for the maintenance of professional competence by all midwives.  It states explicitly that it is the duty of each nurse and midwife to maintain their professional competence, in particular through the provision of workplace learning opportunities.  The board <Col N="371"/>will establish a professional competence scheme or schemes to monitor the competence of all registered nurses and midwives in the State.</P>
        <P>The demonstration of professional competence by nurses and midwives is a method of enhancing protection of the public.  Many nurses and midwives already actively pursue the maintenance, if not the further development, of their own individual practise and many employers facilitate this.  However, by placing the maintenance of professional competence on a statutory basis, all nurses and midwives will be obliged to maintain their competence.  Where a nurse or midwife fails to demonstrate their competence at the request of the board, they will be subject to a number of actions which can include a requirement for training to ensure their practise is brought up to an adequate standard, or in more severe cases, the referral of the nurse or midwife to the board&rsquo;s fitness to practise procedures.</P>
        <P>The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery is dissolved under Part 12 of this legislation.  The council was established in 1999 to further develop nursing and midwifery and has done excellent work.  However, I consider that some of the work of the council is more appropriate to the board as the regulatory body for the professions of nursing and midwifery.  Those functions that are not appropriate to the role of the regulatory body will be undertaken by the Health Service Executive under the provisions of the Health Act 2004.  Furthermore, the dissolution of the council is in line with the rationalisation of State agencies.</P>
        <P>I ask that my thanks to the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery, its employees, its CEO, Dr. Yvonne O&rsquo;Shea and its chair, Dr. Laraine Joyce, are read into the record of this House.  This Part also provides for the transfer of the council&rsquo;s employees, assets and liabilities from the council to the board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 13 sets out a number of miscellaneous provisions, including the provision that the board may investigate unregistered persons suspected of practising nursing or midwifery or claiming to be registered in contravention of this legislation and that summary offences under this legislation may be prosecuted by the board.  The Schedule outlines the matters relating to the board and its members including its tenure, the split term of office for board members, resignations or determinations of membership, quorums for meetings, structure of meetings and the role of the president and vice president of the board.</P>
        <P>I have just given an outline of the structure and contents of the Bill.  I will now say a few words in regard to specific issues that have come to the forefront in the development of the Bill.  Midwifery is now a separate and distinct profession, with its own direct entry career path via the undergraduate midwifery education programme, which commenced in 2006.  The Title of this legislation, the Nurses and Midwives Bill, supports this distinction.  The Bill also recognises that midwifery is a separate professional area to nursing.</P>
        <P>I refer in particular to the provision that all midwives attending a woman in childbirth must have adequate clinical indemnity insurance.  I am aware that concerns have been raised about the intention of this provision.  I consider this provision necessary for the protection of the public.  I consider it essential that all midwives possess adequate clinical indemnity when attending a woman in childbirth and that it is necessary that the penalties for any contravention of this are robust enough to deter any contravention.  Midwives must have adequate insurance to ensure, in the tragic event of a catastrophic incident during a birth, where negligence is proven against a midwife and a court action results in damages being awarded, that these can be paid.  It would add further to the distress of parents if the midwife involved was not insured.  Damages in these cases are often very high.</P>
        <P>It is only in regard to attending a woman in childbirth, that is, a woman&rsquo;s labour and delivery of the baby, that a midwife needs indemnity.  A midwife is not required to have indemnity for <Col N="372"/>other areas of her or his work.  A midwife does not require indemnity, for example, to run prenatal classes or breast-feeding classes or any other services which do not involve attending at the delivery of a baby.  In many cases, as midwives are employees of hospitals or other maternity providers that practise, their practices will be covered under the employer&rsquo;s liability cover.</P>
        <P>However, there are a number of self-employed community midwives in the State.  To facilitate them obtaining indemnity, an arrangement has been put in place to allow them to access the State&rsquo;s clinical indemnity scheme via the HSE.  A self-employed community midwife who signs a memorandum of understanding, MOU, with the HSE and abides by its terms is covered by the scheme.  The MOU is constructed on the basis of appropriate forms of governance, clinical supervision, clinical care pathways, performance management and audit frameworks being in place.  The MOU outlines conditions and factors which indicate increased risk.  There is a need to ensure that where the State provides clinical indemnity, a midwife adheres to the standards set out by the HSE.  A national steering committee on home births has been established by the HSE and it is reviewing the implications of the MOU for the provision of a safe, evidence-based home births service for low risk women.</P>
        <P>The committee is also drafting policy guidelines for cases that do not meet the inclusion criteria set out in the MOU.  The committee comprises representatives of a wide range of stakeholders, including self-employed community midwives.  The inclusive nature of the committee facilitates discussions on key areas of concern and will inform future guidelines and developments.  A review of the MOU is progressing.  I stress that access to the clinical indemnity scheme via the signing of the MOU is designed to facilitate self-employed community midwives to obtain indemnity for their continued practise as self-employed individuals.  There is nothing in the legislation to prevent such a midwife from obtaining indemnity cover from a private insurance provider, should he or she wish.  However, some midwives seek unlimited indemnity from the State.  The State cannot indemnify midwives for high risk cases and it cannot be expected to provide unlimited indemnity without a governance structure.  All insurance policies are replete with terms and conditions.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that midwives must have adequate indemnity cover in regard to their attendance of a woman in childbirth.  This is a  recognition that, while childbirth is a normal life event, it can have serious consequences if something goes wrong.  It is not possible to legislate against catastrophic occurrences.  However, the public can be protected, in so far as it is possible, through continuing professional development, lifelong learning and the maintenance of professional competence.  After all, the primary intention of this Bill and the primary objective of the board is the protection of the public.</P>
        <P>I support choice for women but the option of home births must be provided in a safe manner.  Home births can be a safe option for low risk, healthy women.  Low risk means no history of medical or surgical problems that might affect pregnancy and no present or previous pregnancy complications.</P>
        <P>A second issue raised by Opposition colleagues in the passage of the legislation was the belief that decisions of the midwives committee would have a binding effect on the board but this is not possible.  The board is the regulatory body for nurses and midwives.  The decisions of a committee cannot be binding on a board.  The committee structure of the board is designed to provide that people who are not board members can be members of a committee.  This is to ensure board committees have a membership with adequate knowledge to fulfil the functions delegated to it by the board.  However, the board has responsibility for the regulation of nursing and midwifery.  I have ensured there is an obligation on the board to consider the advice of the midwives committee.</P><Col N="373"/>
        <P>The legislation places the protection of the public at its core.  This is reflected throughout its provisions and in the new governance structures for the board which focus on openness, transparency and accountability.  It modernises the regulatory structure and places it firmly within the domain of protection of the public.</P>
        <P>I thank the House and commend the Bill to it.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister for Health to the House.  The Bill was introduced by the former Minister, Mary Harney, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green-PD-Independent Government.  The Minister stated in the D&aacute;il on 6 May 2010 that there had been public submissions from more than 200 individuals and organisations.  On 13 May 2010, on Second Stage, as then Opposition spokesman on health, Deputy Reilly raised certain issues and concerns he had at the time.  It is interesting he is now in charge and the Bill is going through.  I wonder if he allayed the fears he had at that point on the Bill?</P>
        <P>Deputy Reilly said the board, at 23 members, was small.  Time changes and with the advice from officials, the Minister has decided 23 is enough.  He said at that time:</P>
        <P LI="1">The board, at 23, must be compared with a 25 member board for the Medical Council.  These numbers beg questions.  I accept that the Minister cannot have a board of 50 as it would be far too unwieldy.  Nonetheless, the Minister has a 25 member board looking after 7,000 medical practitioners and she will have a 23 member board looking after perhaps 35,000 nurses &mdash; certainly more than 25,000 practising general nurses. These numbers beg questions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister seems to have accepted that Mary Harney and her officials were right in their assessment.</P>
        <P>The Minister also said when in opposition:</P>
        <P LI="1">Every action the board takes must be directed by the Minister, with the agreement of the Minister.  The independence of the board will be severely undermined in this case considering the number of individual board members appointed by the Minister.  The Minister now wants the right to nominate the president of the board.  This does not happen on any other registration board of which I am aware, such as the medical and dental councils who elect their own presidents.  This is an extraordinary development.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Somehow, the Minister may have dealt with this in the Bill; the president will now be nominated by the board members for which I commend him.  Last year the Minister said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Minister will need to explain the thinking behind this proposal. It leaves the Minister wide open to the accusation of political interference, not something the Minister would wish to be accused of. Fine Gael will oppose this provision.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Reading through the Bill he has dealt with those issues, for which I commend him also.  As Opposition spokesman he saw these issues and made changes.</P>
        <P>On home births, the midwifery aspect of the Bill is very important.  When I was chairman of the Western Health Board, this issue arose many times.  The Minister, as a doctor, would have views on this and would know that it is a serious question.  Every birth is serious and can give rise to difficulties, even in the best possible circumstances.  Safety is the main factor for midwifery and home births.  As a father and a man, I acknowledge it is a woman&rsquo;s choice.  The Minister said that in his summary and I respect his point, although he did say that everything must be equal and the health of the expectant mother must be practically perfect so no difficulties arise.  If a problem arises in a rural area that is not near a maternity hospital, there can be catastrophic consequences.</P><Col N="374"/>
        <P>The Minister already made that point.</P>
        <P>Advice has been forthcoming from different quarters.  I am the youngest in a family of eight and I was born in Roscommon County Hospital.  My mother often informed me about the problems she experienced when giving birth at home.  Things were very difficult at that time and I do not know whether my mother ever really advocated home birth.  Women who gave birth at home during the period to which I refer were very courageous because they only had the support of midwives on which to rely.  Some of the latter lived in rural areas and there only qualification came through experience.  As the Minister stated, if a difficulty arose during childbirth at that time it could have catastrophic consequences.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I read the Minister&rsquo;s script in great detail and I am aware that he is being very fair and balanced.  As he indicated, a national steering committee on home births has been established by the Health Service Executive.  There are those who state that being able to give birth at home is a human right.  That is fine but these individuals must be protected.  The Bill stipulates that anyone involved in a home birth must have proper insurance cover in order that he or she cannot be sued at a later date if something goes wrong.  Giving birth is difficult.  I was chairman of my local health board when the Department purchased Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe.  That was a major decision on the part of the Department at the time, particularly as it was aware that it would be assuming responsibility from the difficulties which had arisen on foot of certain historical cases.  Such cases arise all the time.  There is more litigation now than ever before because if anything goes wrong, the hospital, doctors and midwives can be held liable and responsible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill is both good and comprehensive and I commend the Minister for bringing it forward as quickly as he has done.  Most Senators in this House have gained election over the years by seeking the votes of other public representatives.  I would be pleased, therefore, if the Minister would consider changing section 22(5) which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">(5) A person is not eligible for appointment as a member of the Board, or of a committee, if the person is&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) a member of either House of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) regarded, pursuant to section 19 of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997, as having been elected to the European Parliament to fill a vacancy, or</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) a member of a local authority.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Why would a member of a local authority who is a properly qualified midwife or nurse be deemed ineligible to be appointed by the Minister to the board?  There might not be anyone else available to serve on the board at a particular point in time.  A former Member of the Seanad, Ms Phil Prendergast, MEP, who made a great contribution to the work of the House from her election in 2007 until she replaced the current Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Alan Kelly, worked previously as both a nurse and a midwife.  I wish to illustrate for the Minister an example for the former Senator&rsquo;s generosity of spirit.  I refer to the time when another colleague in the House was expecting a baby and when Ms Prendergast entered a pairing arrangement with her in order that she might have every possible opportunity to spend as much time as possible at home prior to and after giving birth.  That was a very generous thing for Ms Prendergast to do and her actions arose out of her concerns as a qualified midwife.</P><Col N="375"/>
        <P>The Minister has a long record of public service and I believe he served as a councillor before being elected to the Lower House.  I am of the view that it is a slight on the members of local authorities that the provision to which I refer is included in every item of legislation.  This practice has obtained for some time.  It was employed by the previous Administration and the current Government has adopted it.  We had great difficulty in persuading previous Ministers to remove provisions of this nature from legislation.  It must be remembered, however, that in the context of what became the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act, a former Senator was allowed to become vice chairman of the board of the PIAB.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Would it be possible for the Minister and the HSE to consider the possibility of providing outreach facilities to Roscommon County Hospital from Portiuncula Hospital and University College Hospital Galway, UCHG.  The latter are hospitals of the highest quality and I commend the staff who work at each for the fabulous work they do.  All of my four children and my grandchild were born at these hospitals.  The staff there &mdash; consultants, midwives, etc. &mdash; are public servants, are extremely well qualified and provide tremendous support to expectant mothers.  I request that instead of obliging expectant mothers and their spouses or partners travelling long distances to attend prenatal appointments, outreach facilities should be provided in a quality environment as near as possible to their homes.  I am sure this could be arranged and I ask the Minister to give consideration to my proposal.</P>
        <P>There was a maternity unit at Roscommon County Hospital in the past and when I became a Deputy in 1977, this was the most important local issue of the day.  We tried to have an obstetrician-gynaecologist appointed to the hospital and the Minister will be able to peruse the file relating to the matter in his Department.  The then Minister, the late Charles J. Haughey, made every effort to facilitate us.  When I supported Charles J. Haughey in 1979 &mdash; this is a true story &mdash; I made just one request of him, namely, that Roscommon County Hospital would be retained, that services would continue to be provide there, that an obstetrician-gynaecologist be appointed and that the maternity unit be restored.  He went as far as he could and even directed the officials of the Department to vote a certain way at meetings of the board.  However, that is history and the facts relating to it are all a matter of record.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister, who has an extremely busy schedule, for coming before the House and for remaining here for as long as possible.  It is always great when a Minister, particularly one of Deputy James Reilly&rsquo;s experience, comes to the House and listens to the views of Senators.  I commend the Bill, which has my full support, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and thank him for dealing with this matter in a comprehensive manner.  This is a wide-ranging item of legislation.  I read the debates which took place when the previous Minister was involved with the Bill and it was interesting to note the contributions made at the time.  A number of people made detailed submissions in respect of what should be included in the Bill.  It is good to see the Bill continuing its passage through the Houses and I look forward to its enactment into law.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to modernise the legislation relating to nursing and midwifery in Ireland.  It has been warmly welcomed by the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery.  Members of the health profession are anxious that it should be implemented at an early date in order to facilitate the modernisation of the law in this area.  Nursing graduates in this country have excellent qualifications &mdash; degrees and diplomas &mdash; and their duties in the health service should reflect this.  The enactment of the Bill into law will ensure that the nursing board, An Bord Altranais, will be in a position to register Irish, European and third country nurses in order that the health service might meet the demands and challenges it faces.</P><Col N="376"/>
        <P>As the Minister indicated, the Bill recognises midwifery as a separate profession.  The services provided by nurses and midwives form the backbone of the health system.  The Bill will enhance and protect the reputation of Irish nurses.  Existing legislation is outdated and the Bill will, therefore, be gladly welcomed.  It is encouraging that there was a broad consultation process, involving the relevant stakeholders and representative bodies, in respect of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I obtained some interesting statistics from An Bord Altranais which indicate that there are over 90,000 registered nurses in this country.  Of these, in the region of 67,000 are active while the other 23,000 are inactive.  The statistics to which I refer also indicate that these individuals possess over 122,000 qualifications between them.  Therefore, the legislation relates to a large group of people who possess a broad range of qualifications.  Those whom it covers are nurse practitioners, those involved in general practice, those who care for people with intellectual disabilities, midwives and psychiatric nurses.  The Bill deals in a very comprehensive manner with each of the disciplines to which I refer.</P>
        <P>The figures supplied to me by An Bord Altranais relate to 2010.  They indicate that in Ireland, there were 1,873 newly registered qualifications in 2010.  Some 292 of these were from EU countries and 46 from other countries.  It is good to see that number getting the qualification and available to come into the health service.  It is important to ensure that there are opportunities available for them to be part of the workforce in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The interesting change in health care relates to the numbers being dealt with by the hospitals over the past ten years.  In maternity care, the number of births has increased from 54,000 to 76,000 per annum.  In that period, between 2000 and 2009, which are the years for which I have figures, despite the substantial increase in the numbers delivered, the perinatal mortality rate has decreased from 8.9 per 1,000 to 6.9 per 1,000.  This achievement is a true reflection of the commitment of nurses, medical staff and all of those involved in the health care area.  When compared to other European countries, Ireland has a far lower rate than some of our European partners.  In three countries in Europe, France, Bulgaria and Malta, the perinatal mortality rate is greater than ten per 1,000 and Ireland&rsquo;s rate is 6.9 per 1,000.  It is a credit to the health care service and to the nurses involved in that area.</P>
        <P>The Nurses and Midwives Bill was restored in March 2011 and Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann was taken on 20 April.  This Bill represents practical reform and transparency for the appointments to the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.  The current fitness to practice committee is governed by the Nurses Act 1985 and with the introduction of the Bill, a preliminary proceedings committee will be established under Part 7 of the Act which will update the law on complaints against nurses.  The Minister outlined this clearly.  This is a welcome change in the procedure for dealing with complaints.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill is important also because of how we now deal with our international partners.  An Bord Altranais has joined seven international nursing and midwifery regulatory organisations in signing a memorandum of understanding.  The memorandum of understanding outlines the signatories&rsquo; common agenda of co-operation to confirm closer links between the organisations to develop standards for the regulation of nurses, midwives and nursing practise and to facilitate the free exchange of professional knowledge that can contribute to the development of standards.  This agreement was signed in May 2011.  Basically, it is about arranging and having consultation between these seven international organisations including setting up project partnerships and joint committee memberships.  This is a welcome development but it also outlines why we need this amending legislation on keeping up to date with our colleagues throughout Europe.</P><Col N="377"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill is designed to update provisions relating to the regulation of nurses and midwives by the regulatory body and to enhance protection of the public in its dealing with these professions.  The Minister outlined the principal elements of the Bill.  The provisions include: the repeal of the Nurses Act 1985 to bring the legislation up to date; provision for a regulatory body to be known as the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland; a non-nursing midwifery majority on the board and the fitness to practise committee; and a prohibition on unregistered nurses and midwives engaging in the practice of nursing or midwifery, which is a welcome development.  The Bill also provides that fitness to practise inquiries will generally be held in public.  This is about the transparency which the Minister outlined.  The Bill also brings into place the dissolution of the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery.  The Minister covered all of these matters in his presentation.</P>
        <P>I refer briefly to one or two items.  The board&rsquo;s functions will include: the setting of standards of practice and ethical guidance for nurses and midwives and the maintenance of their professional competence.  The maintenance of professional competence is extremely welcome.  It is also about ensuring that the bodies such as the HSE will make available the opportunity for nurses to continue to update their training and skills.</P>
        <P>Section 8 provides for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the integrity of the practice of nursing in general.</P>
        <P>Section 39 provides that unregistered nurses and midwives may not practise nursing or midwifery or advertise that they practise that profession.  In line with this provision, section 40 prohibits a person from attending a woman in childbirth for payment, unless the person is a midwife with adequate indemnity insurance.  The Minister has dealt with this issue of insurance.</P>
        <P>Coming from the legal profession, I am aware that this is one of the health care areas where there have been significant claims in maternity hospitals generally.  It is an area of which we need to be careful, ensuring that there is adequate insurance cover for those working in that area.  The Minister is correct in insisting on insurance.  One of the submissions I received suggested that there is not a requirement for doctors to hold insurance, but that submission is incorrect.  In fact, all doctors are adequately insured.  Otherwise, they would not be entitled to work among the general public.</P>
        <P>Section 45 states that a nurse or midwife who is not registered cannot charge or recover fees for nursing while he or she is not registered.  It is important that there are such provisions in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Bill is comprehensive.  There are more than 109 sections in it.  It is well thought-out.  I thank the Minister for dealing with it.  It is important that it is put in place as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  As the Minister stated in his opening statement, the Bill has been a long time coming.  It is to be welcomed as a mechanism to reform the regulatory framework surrounding the best practice and placing accountability and public safety to the forefront for all practitioners.  I will have much more to say about the Bill on Committee Stage and will reserve most of my comments until then.  However, there are one or two points I want to make.  For simplicity sake, it is as well to speak about the Bill as it relates, in the first instance, to nurses and, in the second, to midwives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The important point is that in repealing the Nurses Act 1985 we ensure that the powers conferred on the regulatory board are transferred in their entirety to the new proposed board as well as ensuring the enhancement of the authority of the new board.  Nurses and midwives are the backbone of the health services and the importance of both as professions in their own right needs to be acknowledged, and the regulation of these services is particularly important.</P><Col N="378"/>
        <P>I welcome the idea that we are taking a more strategic approach to regulation, particularly on the requirement of the proposed board to prepare a business plan for planned activities and an annual report to review activities.  That is an important step.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The composition of the board, as laid out in the Bill, causes a little confusion.  This might well be due to the wording and the way it is phrased.  There is a requirement that eight registered nurses shall be elected to sit on the board.  However, the paragraphs describing those nurses and from what part of the register they come leaves room for semantic confusion.  For example, the Bill refers to clinical nursing in this regard.  There is a grade of nurse called a clinical nurse manager.  There seems to be some room for confusion on the semantics.</P>
        <P>In addition to the registered nurses, section 22(1)(<i>d</i>) requires one person nominated by the Medical Council.  This seems to be a legacy issue, perhaps a hangover from the past where it was considered that nurses are somehow accountable to the medical profession for their work practices.  While it is acknowledged that all professions work closely in the clinical setting, the sometimes perceived hierarchy where the nursing profession is seen as ancillary to the medical profession needs to be addressed.  While I have no real concern about this element of the Bill I am not sure the inclusion of medical personnel on the regulatory board of the nursing and midwife professions sends out the required message of professional autonomy.  I ask the Minister to examine this.</P>
        <P>Section 27 debars bankrupt people or those who make compensation arrangements with creditors from sitting on the board and I see little enough reason for such a provision.  It appears to be out of tune with modern thinking on the matter and perhaps out of tune with emerging thought in other policy areas.</P>
        <P>Midwives are greatly concerned that the Bill, particularly section 40 which the Minister mentioned, requires them to maintain adequate legal indemnity.  Naturally, and obviously, nobody objects to being indemnified, but the manner in which it is provided for in the Bill may have a significant unintended consequence.  A self-employed midwife must sign up to a memorandum of understanding with the HSE to obtain affordable indemnity insurance.  The real issue which arises is that if a local hospital provides a home birth service, the self-employed midwife who operates locally will have no difficulty in obtaining indemnity cover.  However, if there is no locally-based home birth service in operation in a particular HSE area , the major question remains as to whether a self-employed midwife can operate at all.  This needs to be addressed and I have little confidence in the HSE to answer the question.  The problem is probably related to how the rules will be formulated.  A legislative text is required to oblige the HSE to do this.  The implications of not doing it include leaving the provision of home births subject to the decision of a local HSE manager and not as a right of an expectant mother.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the contributions of the other Senators.  The Minister referred to the importance of protecting patients and citizens.  This is absolutely vital and I share his concerns in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The NTMA annual report shows on page 29 that at the end of 2010 the State Claims Agency had clinical claims outstanding of &euro;786 million.  This refers to 1,935 cases at almost &euro;400,000 per case.  If it is divided among the 7,000 medical and allied dental personnel in the health service it comes to &euro;112,000 for each member of that staff.  Reducing claims, providing indemnity and improving the safety of the health service, measures for which the Minister has put <Col N="379"/>before us are necessary.  This is a huge expense which I am sure the Minister and his colleagues at Cabinet, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, are also examining.  I welcome this aspect of the Bill as there is such a level of claims against the health service, as notified by the NTMA annual report, that we must act .  I commend the Minister for so doing.  This is the major point I wish to make, that promoting safety and higher standards, particularly where the costs are so huge as the NTMA report shows, is a very important function.  I commend the Minister for this.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that, as Senator Burke stated, the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery supports the legislation.  It is very important that we have this.  I also welcome the consumer aspects of the Bill.  There are some minor aspects I will refer to on Committee Stage.  There is a requirement for retirement at age 65 for officers of the board.  This appears to contravene the IMF-EU-ECB agreement where as a society as a whole we have agreed to raise retirement ages.  I referred this back to the Minister to see whether what he proposes is compatible with what we have agreed at national level.</P>
        <P>Since 1985, the key development which has taken place in the sector is the recognition of nursing as a degree qualification.  Perhaps I will suggest later to the Minister that he includes the deans of medicine and the degree-awarding institutions in his goal of increasing, maintaining and promoting professional competence.  If these degrees are awarded then the degree-awarding bodies have a function to advise the Minister and his successors.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes that the Minister for Finance will give permission to borrow for current and capital purposes.  I wonder whether the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform should also be invoked in this.  It has happened in other legislation which has come before the House.  At this time we would be reluctant to think borrowing for current purposes by a State body is a good idea when we are facing so many problems with it at a national level and so much national effort is being put into bringing the national finances back in order.</P>
        <P>These are minor points.  We have a safety problem in the health service, which costs an estimated &euro;786 million.  This is a vast amount of money, and measures to improve professional standards and competence, to provide indemnity and to protect the public against unauthorised practices of midwifery and nursing deserve our support.  I commend the Minister for bringing forward the measure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been very interesting to hear the Minister and what he is trying to achieve with the Bill.  I do not envy him his task because it will cost money.  I note the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has warned that patient safety is being jeopardised.  The area of midwifery is of particular concern.</P>
        <P>I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the director of the Mid-Staffordshire Health Service in the UK, Mr. Mike Gill, who was very concerned about cuts in patient care and a number of investigations were carried out between 2008 and 2010.  Mr. Gill spoke about how initial achievements in meeting financial targets were overshadowed by a dramatic fall in the standard of care which it is estimated led to approximately 400 unnecessary deaths.  We must ensure the same thing does not happen here.  I am aware the Minister does not have the amount of money he would like to have.</P>
        <P>I also draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to another situation in Britain whereby Diageo sponsored alcohol warnings to potential mothers.  Ms Anne Milton, the UK Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Public Health stated that midwives are one of the most trusted sources of information and advice for pregnant women and that the pledge by Diageo was a great example of how business can work with NHS staff to provide women with valuable information.  People will ask why Diageo which is a drinks company should help people to drink less but it is a <Col N="380"/>reminder that perhaps other sources of funding are available to help ensure that we achieve our aims.</P>
        <P>We have a strong nurses&rsquo; body here.  Recently, I was in Greece and I was frustrated at the number of strikes taking place, with various strikes held on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  People there said to me that we seem to have managed it well in Ireland.  However, on my return it was announced that one of the hospitals in the south of Ireland was going to close for four hours because of objections to the number of people on trolleys.  It is frustrating to think that people believe they can solve things in this manner.  We must put our heart into this.</P>
        <P>I know what the Minister is attempting to do, and as everyone here has stated we fully support it.  Let us ensure we get it right, however, and that the cuts we must have will not impinge on the successful efforts the Minister is making in this area.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am glad to be present to support this Bill.  I commend the Minister and his Department for the work that has been put into the legislation.  The Bill includes a number of provisions that represent positive progress in the field of midwifery.  I also commend my colleague Senator Leyden on his balanced and experienced approach to this matter.  It is good to hear him being so positive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>This new legislative framework will allow for greater protection of the public in their dealings with nurses and midwives.  In addition, the Bill protects nurses and midwives themselves.  I have worked in the area of medical negligence, and the Minister will be pleased to hear that it was invariably on the defence side.  It is very important that midwives are properly insured and indemnified.  It will thus be much easier to defend all cases because they will be properly regulated and represented.  It is an absolute no-brainer that this Bill is more than welcome.  Similarly, the recognition of midwifery as a profession in itself, distinct from other medical specialties, is most welcome.  In addition, the Bill provides for the clinical supervision of midwives who must have adequate indemnity insurance and allows us to prevent potential difficulties from occurring, which surely is the job of Government in this field.</P>
        <P>While there can be no doubt that midwives do a wonderful job every day, we must ensure we have adequate oversight in case any incidents should occur.  As such, an improved investigation mechanism for complaints about nurses or midwives seems like a positive and appropriate step.  Moreover, it is praiseworthy that this mechanism is being put in place as a proactive step, rather than being reactive, which things regularly are.  While I understand that some of these rules add complexity to the profession of midwifery and add complications for midwives practising independently, I feel these standards and rules are the very least that the profession deserves.</P>
        <P>I am also glad to see the introduction of the registration of nurses and midwives, as well as the registration of candidates.  This step will increase oversight as well as increasing the identity of midwives as a separate profession.</P>
        <P>I am glad to support the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister and his Department on their work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  A Senator who has jut left the Chamber, has on a number of occasions mentioned strike action in the hospital concerned.  Of course, strike action is a last resort but it is open to workers in this State to withdraw their labour.  We should concentrate on dealing with the issues as to why people go on strike in the first place.  We know that many health professionals work in difficult circumstances as the <Col N="381"/>vanguard of the medical sector.  Despite this, they are in the front line for many of the cuts we have seen in the health service.  That is what motivates many people to engage in strike action if they feel their issues have not been addressed.  The right to strike is enshrined in the fundamental European rights that were sold to us in the context of the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>This is an important and long awaited Bill.  New legislation to replace the Nurses Act 1985 was recommended by the Commission on Nursing in 1998.  In 2001, the government&rsquo;s health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, promised that: &ldquo;Provisions for the statutory registration of health professionals will be strengthened and expanded.&rdquo;  We have been waiting many years for such a Bill to be presented.  I give credit to the Minister for introducing the legislation.  The Bill contains important aspects for the statutory registration and recognition of midwifery.  There are many provisions in the Bill that I support.  However, Sinn F&eacute;in has some concerns about the Bill, which were articulated in the D&aacute;il when the measure came through the Lower House.  Unless these concerns are assuaged by the Minister, we are unlikely to be able to support the Bill in either House, notwithstanding the importance and value of many of the provisions therein.</P>
        <P>It is important to put the Nurses and Midwives Bill in context.  We had a lengthy discussion with the Minister recently concerning the perpetual crisis in the health service.  Many issues were raised by Senators on that occasion concerning, for example, the recruitment embargo and its impact on front-line services.  In addition, hospital ward closures were raised.  We have seen closures of accident and emergency units and hospital wards, which put severe pressure on neighbouring hospitals without additional resources being allocated to support this increased demand.  Senator Leyden cited the example of Roscommon but there are other examples throughout the State.</P>
        <P>The people on the front line who have to cope with the outcome of the cuts in patient care are the nurses and midwives we are discussing now in the context of this Bill.  They are bearing the full brunt of the cuts and are trying to manage a difficult situation.  They are, however, hampered by a fundamentally flawed system, mismanagement at Government and HSE level, cuts and also by the absurd recruitment embargo.  This is a suitable occasion on which to commend nurses and midwives on their work against this deeply stressful and high pressure background.</P>
        <P>There are some who would like to blame public sector workers for all the problems in the country.  The Minister will be aware that many people outside the political system have been on a crusade against those in the public sector for a long time.  They seek to convey the idea that everyone in the public sector has been cushioned and pampered, but we know that is not the case.  Many nurses and others who work in the health care system do difficult jobs in difficult circumstances, as I am sure the Minister will agree.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The problem is that consistently for many years &mdash; I am talking primarily about previous Governments &mdash; we have been holding many health care professionals back, including nurses and midwives.  On a number of occasions in this House, I have said how absurd the current public sector embargo is.  It is a blunt instrument, which has forced hospitals &mdash; some in my own city and county &mdash; to incur increased costs by having to use agency workers to provide support.</P>
        <P>The Government moratorium on staffing in the public health service has seen the non-replacement of more than 1,900 nursing and midwifery posts.  If the Government gets its way, the recruitment ban will continue and potentially a further 6,000 posts in the public health services will be lost in the next three years.  In recent days, Sinn F&eacute;in Members have indicated to the Taoiseach that potentially another 3,500 acute hospital beds will be lost unless corrective action is taken.</P><Col N="382"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and the Community Midwives Association have been active in campaigning against the unjust cuts imposed on them, as well as the impact those cuts have on patient care, as I outlined earlier.  They have proven themselves to be the most vigilant watchdog for the health care system, exposing malpractice, accident and emergency unit overcrowding and excessive waiting times.  These are all issues about which the Minister spoke passionately when he was an Opposition spokesperson on health.  I am sure he will agree with many of the points I am making.  I recognise that the Minister has only been in his current role for a short period.  I have put on the record my confidence that he will attempt to tackle many of the problems in the health service.</P>
        <P>The INMO and the Community Midwives Association add to the debate and provide us, as public representatives, with information which otherwise might not be available, thus allowing us to hold the Minister and the HSE to account.  On numerous occasions, I have dealt with the lack of accountability concerning the HSE.  I know the Minister has policies in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is clear that nurses and midwives are a crucial part of our health care system.  Our chief concerns arise in relation to midwives, including many of the points which have been flagged by the Community Midwives Association.  The enhanced recognition of midwifery is welcome.  However, concerns have been raised that the representation of midwifery on the new board is not sufficient and, in particular, about the way in which the Bill addresses the legal requirement for indemnity for midwives.</P>
        <P>There is concern that the Bill may not go far enough in recognising midwifery as a distinct profession.  These issues of recognition and representation have been raised by the INMO and the Community Midwives Association.  It is their view that the midwifery profession, in terms of the midwives committee, has not been properly recognised and provided for in this legislation.  The Bill feeds into the view, rightly or wrongly, that if it is passed, the role of midwives will be undermined.  The Community Midwives Association has concerns about sections 24 and 40, which I will deal with briefly.</P>
        <P>There is a strongly held view that this provision could severely curtail the ability of women to have access to midwife-led childbirth.  This has long-term implications for childbirth in this State, given the overcrowding in maternity hospitals and the loss of maternity units in different hospitals.  The requirements for proper qualification registration, complaints procedures and sanctions, where necessary, are appropriate.  I note also that section 86 outlines the duties of the HSE to facilitate education and training of student nurses and midwives, and the Bill will provide the legal basis for this, but from where will the resources come to enable that education and training to be provided?  I accept this is a positive provision in the Bill, but the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the Community Midwives Association have posed that question.  It is all right to have such a provision, but will the resources be forthcoming?  Will the Minister assure us categorically that he will be able to provide the appropriate training and education places?</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator Leyden made some very valuable comments and I assure him that while I disagreed with much of the previous Minister&rsquo;s policies and actions, I did not disagree with all of them.  The Senator mentioned the issue of a member of a local authority not being allowed on the board.

	<P>I was never a member of a local authority but I did have the honour of serving on health boards, the NHA, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the Eastern Health Board, EHB.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am supportive of an outreach service for Roscommon County Hospital.  I would go further and say I would prefer the outreach service to be in a primary care centre in Roscommon town.  We want to bring the services as close to the patient as possible.  As I have said before, we want to have patients treated at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely and efficient and as near to home as possible.  One cannot get much closer than home delivery of babies.  We did point out, however, which the Senator acknowledged, that we must ensure the service is safe and that those who are at risk are advised of that and encouraged to attend a hospital rather than have a home birth.  We will be expanding the range of services at Roscommon County Hospital and that will become apparent as time passes.  Since I was last in the House, plastic surgery outpatient and day case services have commenced, rheumatology is due to commence and other services will start in the new year.</P>
        <P>The issues that Senator Burke raised are in the main addressed in the Bill.  We will certainly look at the wording that was a cause of concern to Senator Gilroy.  He was concerned that there is a doctor on the board, but one medical representative out of 23 members hardly undermines the nursing profession.  Indeed there is a nursing member on the Medical Council.  Senator Gilroy was also concerned that self-employed community midwives would not be able to sign the memorandum of understanding close to a hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the point I was making on the memorandum of understanding relates to clinical supervision.  If there is no suitable locally based supervisor in an area, which may apply in a particular area peripheral to Dublin, those independent midwives would not have clinical supervision available to them and therefore would not be able to operate as an independent community midwife.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will address that point.  Of course the memorandum of understanding is available to all community midwives who can abide by its terms and conditions.  The issue of supervision is of significant importance and it would not be safe to allow people to take off on a career without further continuing professional development.  That is an area we have sought <Col N="384"/>to address in the medical and nursing profession as well as in other professions.  I think that is good.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett spoke about promoting safety to reduce costs.  We absolutely share his views on safety to reduce costs as well as our primary concern to reduce harm to unborn and new born children and women.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The compulsory retirement at 65 years for those who work for the board relates only to those who have been with the board before 2004.  I do not think it applies to personnel employed since 2004.  I am very open to that issue because I do not believe in ageism.  One&rsquo;s ability to work should be based on competence, not on chronological age.  Many people under 65 years would not be half as competent as some of those over 65 years. I would be the first to put up my hand.</P>
      
	<P Just="Left">Senator Quinn asked that we ensure the cuts we must make because of the economic mess we have inherited do not make hospitals unsafe.  It is certainly our intention to make hospitals safer.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Cullinane for his expression of confidence in us.  It will not be from lack of trying and effort that it will not happen, because we will give it everything we have got.  We have gone further and, with the special delivery unit, we are now getting an analysis of what is going on in our hospitals.  We can see where problems are arising, where we are not succeeding having taken measures, and where we can take further action.  I concur completely with the Senator that industrial action is a right that every worker should have, but it is hardly appropriate in a scenario where the service is under strain because it makes the strain worse.  That does not seem to me to be the appropriate route to take.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should deal with the reasons for the strain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I might also advise the Senator that it is outside the Croke Park agreement, which is very clear: no pay cuts, no industrial action, and <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
        <P>The Senator mentioned resources for education.   All the other professions are being asked to fund their own education out of their own resources.  The taxpayer cannot be expected to continue to fund continuing professional development.  That is the responsibility of the professional and will be increasingly the case into the future because the State does not have the money to fund it.  The professionals themselves must do that.</P>
        <P>It would be unfortunate if Senator Cullinane were to oppose the Bill.  The phrase &ldquo;throw out the baby with the bathwater&rdquo; is particularly apt in this case as the baby will be thrown out with the bathwater, which would be unfortunate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If I have not covered all the points raised, Members will remind me on Committee Stage where the matters can be addressed further.  I thank Members for their contributions.  The purpose of this Bill is to enhance the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and this is the framework on which the Bill is based.  I continue to emphasise this point as it is at the core of the provisions of the Bill and the concerns of Members.  I look forward to the Committee Stage debate and the passage of the Bill.</P>

	<P>I am glad to come to the Seanad to speak about this important matter.  As Senators are well aware, this is getting extensive coverage in the media and it is a very important issue for the Government.</P>
        <P>I want to reiterate some of the points made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in the other House today and during the course of the past few days.  The Government welcomes the decision by the lenders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">There should be copies of the speech.  I apologise to the Senator.</P>
        <P>Any reduction, however small, is welcome by all mortgage holders but especially by those who are in arrears or who are experiencing difficulty meeting repayments.  To that end, the Government wants all lending institutions to pass on the ECB interest rate cut for a number of reasons.  Senators will be aware that the Economic Management Council met with the chief executives of three lending institutions last week.  Following the meeting, the Taoiseach requested a report from Mr. Matthew Elderfield, deputy governor of the Central Bank.  The Government was particularly interested to know if the Central Bank required more powers in this area.  I should say, at this point, that one of the banks present, AIB, which had previously declined to pass on the interest rate reduction, has now decided to do so.  The Government welcomes that decision.  The Government would encourage the other two institutions present and which were made well aware of the Government&rsquo;s concerns to follow suit.</P>
        <P>The report from the deputy governor was received on Friday last.  I will outline briefly for Senators what the report contained, although I am aware that some of its contents have already been discussed in the media.  The deputy governor acknowledges that the Government is not unjustified in having concerns for particular banks regarding the widening of the spreads by which their standard variable rate exceeds their cost of funds and how they are still so far above the prevailing rates of their industry peers.</P>
        <P>The essential points which Mr Elderfield makes are as follows.  Standard variable rates of mortgage interest from Irish banks reached historically low levels in early 2009 but several forces have contributed to the subsequent increases in such rates.  First, the access of the Irish banks to wholesale funding from the market was sharply curtailed, especially from mid 2010, and there was a sharp increase in the interest rate cost of what market funding was secured.  Second, whereas the ECB policy rate is only 0.25% higher now than it was in 2009, the total cost to the banks of some of the sizeable drawings that they have made on Central Bank funding is much higher than the policy rate.  Third, the banks appear to have increased &mdash; at different times and to different degrees &mdash; the spread by which the standard variable rate exceeds their costs of funds.</P>
        <P>As Senators are only too well aware, it is the third issue on which the current debate is mainly focused.  Mr. Elderfield mentioned in his report that a somewhat wider spread of new <Col N="386"/>loans could be rationalised on the basis of the banks&rsquo; belated realisation of the credit risk that may be involved in mortgage lending.  He also states that a significant widening of mortgage interest rate spreads has been happening in other countries.  An important point which the deputy governor has made is that it is less clear that retroactively applying a risk spread to existing loans is fully consistent with fair practice in view of the fact that in the past standard variable rates have generally moved broadly in line with the cost of funds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Finance has mentioned a number of times in the D&aacute;il in replies to parliamentary questions that neither the Central Bank nor he has a statutory role in the setting of interest rates charged or paid by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank.  This is a commercial decision for the institution concerned.  Each institution determines the rate which it charges or pays depending on a number of factors, such as the cost of funds, competition in the market, risk pricing and the impact of deposit rates.  The deputy governor has indicated in his report that the power to exercise close regulatory control over retail interest rates is not sought by the Central Bank at this time.  He has outlined the difficulties which could result from Central Bank powers to set interest rates and these views emanate from experience in the past and in other countries.  These include a reduction in the availability of credit, particularly to less secure customers, a chilling effect on entry of sound competition in the market and an impediment to progress towards the re-establishment of bank management practices that could ensure a healthy and free standing banking system that is no longer dependent on the Government for bail-outs.</P>
        <P>Taking into account the advice from the Central Bank, the Minister for Finance has indicated that while the matter will be kept under review, he has no plans to recommend to the Government that legislation in this area should be introduced.  In the event that the introduction of legislation is considered, the matter of what interest rates are paid on deposits will also have to be examined, and this particular aspect may not be welcome by depositors and institutions.</P>
        <P>I draw attention in particular to the concluding comments of the deputy governor&rsquo;s letter.  He clearly states that the Central Bank&rsquo;s strategy is to ensure that lenders treat their customers fairly and comply with the bank&rsquo;s code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  He states that he will take stronger action to resolve the position of customers in unstainable mortgages while at the same time prudently conserving their capital, which in many cases has been replenished by taxpayers.  The Central Bank is requiring mortgage arrears resolution strategies from all lenders by the end of this month.  The deputy governor intends to engage with the lenders on the arrears issue, pressing for progress on a number of fronts, such as the unsustainable mortgage question.  I am advised that the Minister for Finance will, along with the Central Bank, continue to monitor developments in this important area and will keep under review all options for further action available to him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When one considers the totality of the mortgage loan book in this country, we have roughly 750,000 mortgages, with 400,000 of these tracker mortgages.  Consequently, as the ECB rate falls, so does the mortgage rate in those mortgages.  I understand approximately 150,000 mortgages operate on a fixed rate, and their prevailing rate is clear to the consumer.  We are therefore left with approximately 200,000 mortgages coming under a variable interest rate.  The great majority of banks have passed on the reduced rate decided by the ECB in such mortgages.  I refer to AIB, EBS, Irish Nationwide Building Society, KBC, National Irish Bank and Permanent TSB.  The two banks which have not passed on the cut are Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.  When we address the issue of ECB changes not being passed on, it is important to state that this is a minority issue as the great majority of people with mortgages are unaffected; some 400,000 have tracker mortgages and another 150,000 have fixed rate mortgages.  This is a relatively small group.  In that context, I humbly submit that it makes no sense for the banks in <Col N="387"/>this circumstance not to pass on the cut, as the numbers concerned are relatively small in comparison to the great majority of customers, who either have fixed or tracker products.  A matter of particular concern is a point that has already been referred to by the deputy governor when he said it had come to his attention that it could well be the case that banks have decided to effectively allow those on fixed variable rates to subsidise the loss-making tracker rates.  Our position is clear and those changes should be passed on for the purposes of helping the domestic economy as they do in other eurozone countries.</P>
        <P>I learned the basic economic tenet years ago that the way to provoke domestic demand and business activity is to reduce interest rates.  The logic of that position is that these rates should be passed on.  The Government is fully aware of its role and that of the independent regulator.  We do not want a scenario where we dictate to anybody and we will not return to the broken regulatory past that got us into this mess in the first place.  The Government&rsquo;s view is that if Mr. Elderfield, the deputy governor, requires further powers, we will consider the matter.  In his reply to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance he has made it clear he does not require them at this stage but he will examine further regulatory changes, particularly with more of a consumer focus.  That has been made abundantly clear.  It is the firm view of the Government that these rates should be passed on and it is important for the domestic economy.  It is also important for householders with a strangling debt problem.</P>
        <P>I have stated to this House for some months that we must bring forward the implementation plan following the Keane report.  The Minister stated in the other House that this is still the view of the Government and we are working on it.  We seek the support of parties in this House, as in the other House, to ensure the successful implementation of those measures.</P>

Once again we have had optics from the Government but little in the way of action.  We had the Keane report many weeks ago and we are still getting the call from the Government for cross-party co-operation as it deliberates, yet again, on what to do about mortgages.</P>
        <P>Last week there was a major meeting, with bankers summoned to speak to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, and on my Facebook page I expressed disdain and shock at the attitude which the bankers seem to display towards the public and the elected Government in television interviews on the news.  We were promised action on foot of this and one bank, wholly State-owned, has given in.  Nothing else has happened and we have now been told the meeting was a public relations exercise; the Government succeeded with one bank but the other main institution, which may have more than 40% of the market, would do nothing.  Ulster Bank, a large player, also would not be required to do anything.  We have been told nothing can be done and action is not required.</P>
        <P>The original reason for seeking the interest rate reductions in banks was not to give everybody on a variable rate mortgage a tracker mortgage but rather that the regulator originally stated that high interest rates were having an effect on the arrears problem.  In such circumstances legislation is warranted, although I acknowledge that the issue is complex.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has been considering the issue and is drafting a Bill, although it is not yet complete.</P>
        <P>We have done much research on models in other countries.  Section 47 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 has not been mentioned in this debate, which allows any consumer to go to court to have an interest rate adjusted for various reasons, including prevailing interest rates, age, business competence, level of literacy of the consumer, degree of risk or costs for the creditor and the extent of competition for the type of credit required.  The provision already exists in the Consumer Credit Act but it has not been reflected in any of the debate up to now. <Col N="389"/> It may provide a template for action by the regulator.  No party is looking for everybody to have a tracker mortgage, where rates would move with ECB rates, but there may well be circumstances where high interest rates would affect arrears and people&rsquo;s ability to pay mortgages and stay in their houses.  The regulator must be given the power to deal with that position.</P>
        <P>The policy making body is the Oireachtas, which instructs the Government, rather than the regulator.  In this case it seems the regulator is telling the Government that it does not want the work.  The regulator may have reasons for not wanting more work and it is understaffed.  There is much to do in the office.  That should not prevent a policy response from the Government and the Oireachtas.  It is disappointing that the policy response does not seem to be forthcoming.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We will put together a Bill which will probably be debated in our next Private Members&rsquo; business slot in the Seanad, although there is much ongoing work.  People are demanding action and those on the ground cannot believe the inaction.  The Keane report was a reflection of a report from a year ago, with a couple of changes.  The Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, has now resigned and the mortgage-to-rent scheme was his and the Labour Party&rsquo;s baby.  What is happening?  People are sick of optics and spin.  We have seen the newspaper articles and people want real work and change in order to foster hope.  The people gave the Government a good wind in February and even when some of us lost our seats we hoped, for the sake of the country, that the Government would do a good job.  Spin has followed stories and people have banged their fists on the table.  However, when real action is required, it has not been forthcoming.  People want to see action.</P>
        <P>I urge the Government to consider the matter again and examine existing precedents in Irish legislation and abroad.  They can be used.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will not get into an argument with the Senator and although he espoused some points well, I do not agree with some others at all.  All of the focus is on the &euro;116 billion in the mortgage loan book with the five covered banks but we have not considered the commercial loan book.  The analysis of the commercial loan book is as fraught in terms of the over-extension of individuals in that regard.  With the increase in the interest rate here &mdash; I consider that an increase by Bank of Ireland is particularly belligerent.  If we are being honest and fair, by virtue of the fact that AIB did not pass on the two 0.25% increases that were introduced in the past 12 months, in truth there were perhaps some grounds for it to say it would not pass on the decrease.  Bank of Ireland did pass on the two 0.25% increases and it is particularly belligerent in its insistence that it will not pass on the decrease.</P>
        <P>I had the experience of dealing with a senior official in Bank of Ireland.  I am satisfied now that the banks have no intention of using the recapitalisation fund the State put into that particular bank in the past 18 months to write down mortgage and commercial loan books.  Bank of Ireland is intent on sitting on the funds in order to say the bank is tier 1 capitalised.  I am clear on that.  The information came to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in recent weeks.  When Bank of Ireland came before the committee it had written down none of its mortgage loan book.  We did not get information on the commercial loan book.  The assessment of Blackstone is that X number of billions of euro was required to write those loans down.  It has not happened and it is not happening.  Bank of Ireland is being belligerent.  Its belligerence is also evident in the discussion on the parliament building on College Green.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Governor of the Central Bank and the deputy governor have a stick to use.  I would prefer if it were a carrot and a stick rather than just a big stick.  The exceptional liquidity <Col N="390"/>assistance, ELA, funding which is being given to the banks every two weeks can be increased or decreased as the Central Bank deems necessary.  I propose that the Minister would consider using the measure as a carrot and a stick or as the big stick to beat up Bank of Ireland, whichever way he deems necessary.  The measure should be considered for Bank of Ireland in particular because it has been treasonous and treacherous in terms of how it is dealing with its clients.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to the House.  I will not dwell overly on the spin issue but I accept there is a danger, first, that it raises hopes for people that their mortgages will be reduced, which subsequently the Government is not able to deliver.  That is one downside.  The second issue about which I am concerned is that the more interventionist the Government is in the operation of the banking system, the more we may scare and discourage the markets which would prevent us getting back to being able to borrow on the bond market as against where we are at the moment.  I accept it is a difficult issue.  I share the Government&rsquo;s concern about mortgage holders.  People are very distressed and in a difficult situation.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a couple of requests of the Minister of State.  The first relates to the letter that came from the Financial Regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield.  It would be useful if the letter to the Taoiseach was published.  I accept the Minister of State quoted from it but I would welcome if the letter was published in its entirety.  I call upon the Minister of State to do that.</P>
        <P>Second, could I try to elicit a response from the Minister of State on the collapse of the Custom House Capital financial institution?  It raised questions about the failure of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator to react, specifically when they were put on notice in 2009 that issues arose surrounding the company and how it was functioning and that a dearth of information was given to investors.  Given the history of what has happened in the regulatory area, it is imperative that we are vigilant now.  We need specific answers.  I accept the matter is being examined by the regulator but we need to get specific answers in that regard.</P>
        <P>People applauded the previous Minister for Finance, the late Mr. Brian Lenihan, for the changes he made at the top of the Central Bank and to the Financial Regulator.  The previous Financial Regulator failed miserably to do his job.  The change is good.  However, all of the staff who were working under the previous Financial Regulator are still in place.  We need some assurance that they are performing to a higher level than they did in the past.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need competition.  I have sympathy for passing on the ECB rate decrease but it is a peripheral issue.  The more fundamental issue is the huge disparity that exists at present in the charging of interest rates by the various financial institutions.  We need far greater transparency.  I urge the Minister of State to examine the possibility of the cost of funds being published by each financial institution on almost a daily basis in order that those who borrow from the banks would receive on their statements the cost of funds and the margin they are being charged.  A creeping situation arises in that regard and people are in distress.  We must be mindful of the history of the banks with regard to unethical practices on interest rate charges and other banking charges.  We must be much more vigilant but I would be slow to intervene too much in the market.  We need a functioning banking system that I hope will get back to prudential banking and be able to lend to customers.  I hope we can dispose of the banks in time and recover the taxpayers&rsquo; investment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  The level of arrogance displayed by the banking industry, especially in recent days, continues.  It need hardly <Col N="391"/>surprise us.  Since the meeting between the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and the banking industry, AIB has said it will pass on the standard variable rate cut.  That is welcome, but Bank of Ireland is a different problem.  There is a clear obligation on the banking industry to take responsibility for the recklessness in which it has engaged that has led us to the current position.  The nature of the obligation is contested.  It is not legal but there must be some type of obligation which would go some way towards restoring confidence between the banks and their customers.  Some of the reported practices of lenders in ensuring distressed borrowers continue to pay down their debt is particularly worrying.  We hear stories of intimidation and harassment.  We have already taken steps to address that.  When the banks had an opportunity to restore the good will and good faith with their customers they spurned the chance to do so.  It seems that they wish to remain as pariahs in society indefinitely.  That does not seem to worry them.</P>
        <P>Borrowers are being hit on the double.  Not alone have some lenders refused to pass on the rate decrease; they seem to have increased rates on other types of household debt such as credit card debt and overdrafts.  That is a serious worry.  The immediate focus is on the passing on of interest rate cuts but we must consider it in the context of a wider debate about lenders and how they treat clients.  We must deal with the issue and find a balance between how the banks protect their balance sheets and their responsibilities to their shareholders, which is important, but we must also bear in mind that one of the lenders is wholly owned by the State.  We must ask whether it is desirable for the State to move to direct the bank to pursue a particular policy.  I am not sure whether it is.  It certainly would not be in normal times but these are not normal times.  The deputy governor of the Central Bank appears to agree with that position.</P>
        <P>We find ourselves in a circular argument that the banks must be healthy if we are to restore confidence in the banking sector and in order for credit to flow.  That would seem sensible.  It would suggest that we should not interfere but in order for confidence to be restored in society we must find a way to ensure that the banks wear the green jersey.  We have heard reference to that often enough.  We need to break the circle and however we do it, now is as good a time to start as any.  The decisive action taken by the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach last week has been a small step in the right direction but I would welcome further developments in that regard.  In normal times we would not contemplate such a course of action but these are not normal times.  We have turned the markets on their heads and socialised private debt &mdash; the previous Government did so &mdash; and we find that the answer to capitalism is socialism.  Perhaps now we should see the State intervene in some manner directly in the markets in this exceptional circumstance to force a confidence building exercise in our financial and societal situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to be as brief as possible and merely ask some questions.  Can the Minister of State tell us when the Government will act on the programme for Government commitments regarding mortgage debt relief and those in mortgage distress?  We all know that hundreds of families fall into mortgage distress every week.  We expect figures for the third quarter to show a significant increase in mortgage distress on the 100,000 reported in the second quarter.  Only a few months ago, the Minister&rsquo;s party made a pre-election promise to increase mortgage interest relief for those in negative equity.  The programme for Government promised to direct any mortgage provider in receipt of State support to present Government with a plan of how it intends to cut its costs over and above existing plans in a fair manner by a sufficient amount to forgo a 25 basis points increase on its variable mortgage rate.  Throughout the country, hundreds of people are falling into serious mortgage debt.  In view of that and in light of these interest rate cuts, can the Minister of State outline what other avenues may be pursued for the relief of mortgage distress?</P><Col N="392"/>
        <P>The report of the interdepartmental working group on mortgage arrears chaired by Mr. Declan Keane was a disappointment to these families.  It did not come close enough to a comprehensive solution to the issue of mortgage distress.  Even after all that has happened in the State, it is remarkable that the main conclusion of the three reports produced in the past three years has been to leave it to the banks to fix the problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State said the Central Bank is requiring mortgage arrears resolution strategies from all lenders by the end of this month.  What role will the Minister of State have in assessing these strategies?  Who else will be involved in assessing them?  More important, will there be a tie-in with organisations such as the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, on these strategies and their practical application?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  The European Central Bank lowered its interest rate in order that banks could pass it on and not pocket it.  That is one statement.  Another statement made is that banks will only be able to heal themselves and reduce their dependence on the State if they return to profitability.  We are between a rock and a hard place.  What is good for the goose, the borrowers, is good for the gander, the depositors.</P>
        <P>Some banks operating in Ireland are not eurozone banks.  Danske Bank, for example, gets its money from Denmark and is outside the eurozone altogether.  Would it not be difficult for the Government to introduce regulation for one bank while foreign banks operating in Ireland are not governed by that regulation because they do not get money from Ireland and are outside the eurozone?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to see a strengthening of regulation.  Has the Minister of State any intention of strengthening the role of the Competition Authority?  Another Senator referred to the role of this authority.  I would like to see guidelines put to the Competition Authority, as well as supervisory interventions, written on paper, which the authority could put into effect.  Does the Minister of State have any proposals to do that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise if I took too much time for the debate.  I did not want to prevent colleagues from speaking.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In a nutshell, we all want to get our money back from these banks.  That is the objective of the exercise.  Senators are aware of the proposal in the programme for Government to raise &euro;2 billion from the sale of non-strategic State assets.  If we were to get back even 20% of what we have put into the banks over the past three years, we would be talking about &euro;15 billion or &euro;20 billion.  The objective of the exercise, for a period of years, is to get back one third or half the money we put into the banks.  That will become the new pension reserve fund and the stimulus for the future.  We all want that.</P>
        <P>I was struck by the temperate language used by all sides in the debate.  A balance must be struck.  Some 50% of all mortgages in Ireland are from mortgage companies that are not covered by the guarantee.  They have their bases in other countries and are not being propped up by the ECB or by our funds.  We have a Common Market, not only in goods and services but also in this area.  There are EU competition rules and before any intervention is made, we must make it clear that it is consistent with the Common Market and with our need to get our banks going again so that we can get our money back.</P>
        <P>We are in extraordinary circumstances.  To reflect that, the Government has taken a strong view that these rate reductions need to be passed on.  The deputy governor of the Central Bank is clearly not looking for legislative powers as of now.  He has spoken about a regulatory <Col N="393"/>framework.  A number of Senators asked what else can be done.  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011, currently before the Houses, provides for the strengthening of the ability of the Central Bank to police, investigate and punish malpractice when it comes to consumer protection.  To answer Senator Keane&rsquo;s question, we have new powers which will be in place in a short number of weeks and months.  They will allow greater intervention by the Central Bank and impose a much more serious financial penalty on banks where there are clear breaches of consumer practice.  Consumer practice is the area we need to get to.</P>
        <P>The point was made, I think by Senator Walsh, that we should publish the letter from the Financial Regulator.  The letter was to the Taoiseach and not to me, so I cannot speak on his behalf.  It is a matter for the Taoiseach.  However, I think the Minister for Finance accurately reflected the points made by the deputy governor in his very quick response to the issues.</P>
        <P>Senator Reilly raised the question of mortgage interest relief.  This is an important issue for my own and other parties.  I am proud of the commitment in the programme for Government.  We gave a clear commitment before the recent general election that those who bought mortgages at the top of the market, between 2004 and 2008, and who are most indebted and in greatest negative equity should have some additional help through the taxation system.  We suggested doing this by ending the provision to first-time buyers, because they bought in different circumstances.  The stamp duty has changed, the market has collapsed and those buyers are getting better value.  That is still my view and the Government&rsquo;s view.  It is in the programme for Government.  However, it can only come about in the context of a finance Bill.  We wait with eager anticipation for what the Minister for Finance will say on budget day.  This is a live and significant issue.  We have a social responsibility for people who bought at the top of the boom.  We should use the taxation system to help them in this really difficult time, assuming they can pay back some of their mortgage at present.</P>
        <P>Senator Reilly and other colleagues asked about the implementation of the recommendations in the Keane report.  The Minister for Finance made it clear that he is bringing forward a co-ordinated implementation plan, including some of the measures recommended in the Keane report as well as other measures which were reflected in both Houses.  We had very good debates in this House, in the D&aacute;il and at the joint committee when a number of suggestions were brought into the debate.  We need to follow up on those suggestions and we will do so.  I welcome Senator Thomas Byrne&rsquo;s promise to bring forward new legislation.  The Government will look at any proposal in this area, and not from a party political or partisan view.  We want every Member of the Oireachtas &mdash; Senators and Deputies, party and non-party &mdash; to contribute to this.  I say this genuinely and not as some kind of patronising response.  I hope good ideas will come out of this.  The Government is going through the debates in both Houses on the Keane report to see what additional measures can be brought to bear.</P>
        <P>The biggest measure that would help the problem of mortgage indebtedness would be the radical alteration of the existing legislative framework for personal insolvency where people are put into a financial cold room for a period of 12 years, when the equivalent period in the UK is, in some cases, only one year.  We need to make progress in this matter.  It is under active consideration by the Government.  We know it is the significant stick, as Senator D&rsquo;Arcy said, that can be used in the commercial courts and elsewhere where persons who have a personal or commercial mortgage can attempt to get some realistic write-down of their debt.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the banks were recapitalised &mdash; they are now more capitalised than Swiss banks in terms of the tier capital ratio &mdash; the money was put in for the purpose of allowing write-downs to occur.  We have been saying clearly to the Minister for Finance and to the banking unit within the Department of Finance that they need to get on with the task.  That was part and <Col N="394"/>parcel of the meeting that occurred last week between the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the banks in question.  We must get on with this, but there is no perfect solution.  Ultimately, a number of different solutions will be found.  The Government endorsed the Keane report which was brought to the House by the former Minister, Deputy Penrose, on the day the report was published.  Its first recommendation is now being tested in a pilot scheme.  Case by case, proposal by proposal and pilot scheme by pilot scheme, we will get there.  We look for the support of the House, which I know we have, in bringing those measures forward.  The objective of this exercise is to ensure that the burden of debt, not just to the State but to individuals in the State, is lessened over time.  The recalibration of our economy depends on the resuscitation of the Irish banking sector after this enormous collapse.  The banks have been recapitalised and the taxpayer has taken an enormous hit to ensure that we have a proper functioning banking system as the engine of our economy.  Without that, we will not return to the levels of growth required to sustain the economy.  That is our objective and the support this House can give to the Government&rsquo;s efforts is very much appreciated.  I expect I will be back here on this issue again and rightly so, because it is an issue of huge concern.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Walsh raised the issue of the Custom House Capital.  I will follow up on that issue.  I understand the matter is being investigated currently by the regulator and do not feel it would be appropriate for me to comment on it at this stage.  However, I will follow up on the issue and will send any further information to the Senator.  The Senator is right with regard to the publication of the costs of funds.  When we put this to the banks in the past, they said the information was commercially sensitive and publication removed their competitive advantage.  We need to have a competitive banking system and do not want a duopoly.  Senator Barrett made the point previously that we need a banking system that works and that is made up of international and local lenders.  However, there is merit in having a much greater degree of transparency with regard to the distinction between the rate at which the banks borrow and lend the money.  I agree with the Senator in that regard.  The letter in question was sent to the Taoiseach and, consequently, I cannot say whether it will be published, but I will raise the matter with him.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators raised the question of whether we have the appropriate staff in place.  I understand from my officials that close to 1,500 people are currently employed within the Central Bank across all of the regulatory frameworks that have been established since the collapse occurred.  We are confident that they have the expertise required to have a strong, robust &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We have new regulators.  They are accountable to Government and to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The people who serve under those regulators are responsible for the performance of the tasks.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned in the context of the Keane report, the Minister is working out a comprehensive implementation plan, which will be announced in due course.  When it comes to the Consumer Credit Act, interest is set on a commercial basis and the regulator will be given powers, if they are required, to deal with issues.  As he said in his correspondence, it is his view that legislation is not required at this stage, but that may change.  When, on his first day in office, the president of the ECB took the bold but correct step to reduce the ECB basic rate by 25 basis points, that sent a signal to domestic economies across the eurozone.  He added that he <Col N="395"/>intended to reduce the rate further over the course of the next few months.  This issue should not just arise when the ECB reduces its rate.  We need a clear plan in place with the banks and they need to listen to the Government and to the people.  I understand that they want to be profitable, sustainable banks again and that the profile of their lending books bank to bank is different.  Much of the mistake made in the past was to go after the aggressive model of banking, which was not sustainable in the long run.  As the banks try to resuscitate a more sustainable model, the Government, on behalf of the taxpayers and citizens, has a responsibility to resuscitate the economy.  The way to do that is to hand on ECB rate reductions.</P>
        <P>I thank colleagues for their constructive remarks, but I expect we will return to this issue in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest to the Acting Leader given that we have six or seven minutes left, that we could use that time to put a few short questions to the Minister of State, if he agrees.  I have one or two concise questions if the Acting Leader agrees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  I am aware of the challenges facing him and the Minister in trying to rectify the situation.  I have three specific questions.  I understand that in his letter, the deputy governor mentioned supervisory intervention as, perhaps, an effective, alternative <i>modus operandi</i> at this stage, whereby they would audit the loan books of the banks and try to identify those that are overcharging.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?  The banks hide behind unpublished rates.  In many instances, that is bona fide, but in some it is a way to exploit and &ldquo;defraud&rdquo; &mdash; I use that word advisedly &mdash; some of their customers.  We need to be careful that does not happen.</P>
        <P>The margin is the issue.  Given that we do not have a competitive banking system currently and probably will not have for several years, would the Department consider setting a maximum margin by which the banks can charge?  They would be able to compete within that, but would not be able to go beyond that level.  Would it also consider putting a provision in place for distressed borrowers who find themselves in breach of their loan agreement preventing the banks from charging them penalty interest rates.  Such rates only make a bad situation worse and place clients in dire difficulties.</P>
        <P>My final query relates to management practices and has more to do with the flow of funds and credit to consumers.  Increasingly, people in the business sector dealing with banks have difficulties.  In the past, they went in and dealt with their local bank manager who knew them and their integrity and business, but now everything goes to Dublin and is decided there.  This means decisions are taken clinically, without due regard to the quality of the customer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>The banks have their own ideas with regard to the loan books.  Evidence given before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the two pillar banks showed that to date, Bank of Ireland had written down the mortgage loan book zero this year.  AIB, which had a larger mortgage loan book than Bank of Ireland had only written down &euro;600,000.  The two banks are not participating in writing down the mortgage loan book although the funds were put in place to allow them be written down.  This is belligerence by the banks towards their clients.  I suggest this matter be raised.  We need some movement on this issue immediately, whether via the Minister for Finance, the regulator or the Governor of the Central Bank.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="396"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The level of bilateral discussion between the Department and the banks, whether pillar or non-pillar banks, is extensive.  It is only right that I should say that the new banking unit within the Department of Finance has been significantly beefed up to have that engagement.  Much of that engagement is across table, through negotiation and is attempting to move on the model.  In February 2011, the Central Bank informed lenders that they should allow 30 days notice to be given in advance of any standard variable rate mortgage increases.  This is now being introduced as part of the revised code. The code is important and consumers need to be aware of the fundamental rights it contains.  Where banks breach the code, we need to be aware of it because they have signed up to implementing it.  The question is whether this is happening.</P>
        
        <P>Senator Walsh asked about additional supervisory powers.  The deputy governor&rsquo;s opinion is that he does not need further legislation and his existing powers suffice, but he will use greater persuasive techniques and determine whether progress can be made.  If further measures are required at the end of that process, he will report to the Government.  This is his firm opinion.</P>
        <P>Regarding margins, I was asked whether a maximum rate could be set.  I will find additional information.  If there is to be competition, various banks need to be in place.  The nature of competition is choice.  EU rules are in place in terms of the setting of maximum rates, but I am unaware as to whether we have the power to set them.  One might persuasively argue that, given our current circumstances and the fact that the banks are coming out of a resuscitation period, maximum rates might be to the advantage of the economy.  However, Community rules are in place regardless of what circumstances we face and irrespective of recapitalisation.  I will consider this matter to determine what additional measures can be taken.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>On the commercial side, I recently heard a lovely phrase, in that all banks need to have a &ldquo;relationship manager&rdquo; with all of their customers, be they commercial or non-commercial.  I am unsure what this means, but the Senator is correct.  The dilemma is that, because the banks are in this position, they have strict lending practices from the centre.  It seems to be the case that local banks do not have the discretion to make those decisions, yet the objective of a local banking system is that staff know people locally, their ability to repay, their business models, their plans, etc.  For many years, the main crisis in the banking system was the dreadful surge of money from the centre that effectively took out of existence local commonsensical people, for example, bank managers.  I would describe them as the Arthur Lowes of the &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s Army&rdquo; generation, those who knew people locally, knew the community&rsquo;s circumstances and were prepared to make decisions.  We need to return to a model of banking in which there is a stronger connection between the bank and its community, akin to the credit union model, where people know what is occurring and have confidence in the decisions they are making.  We will not get out of this crisis or be able to reboot the economy and put the &euro;30 billion promised to us into the system unless local banks can make these decisions.  We need to free up this lending process.  The Government is in discussions with the banks and the regulator as to what we can do to help that process.</P>
        <P>I note Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s comments about the failure of the write-down.  We will see if we can get additional information so that there can be some transparency in the banks.  There is no point in us asking for confidence and saying something is happening if it is not.</P>

        <P>I am raising the issue of the fire brigade service in south Connemara.  The 1981 Act states that a timely and fast fire service should be available in all areas covered by the local authorities providing those services.  There are seven fire brigade stations in the east of County Galway, one in the city, one on the Aran Islands and one in Clifden in Connemara.  During the years there have been a number of fires in the area.  When there was one in Carraroe a number of years ago, it took an hour for the fire brigade to reach it.  Another fire in Tirnee took an hour and a quarter to reach.  A third in Lettermullen took an hour and three quarters to reach.  These times are unacceptable to our community.  Many groups have been pushing for a better fire service in our area, among them Coiste Chearta Chonamara.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A great deal of work has been done at county council level.  While the will is there, we are unsure as to whether the resources are being put in place.  We keep getting sent from pillar to post by the council.  T&aacute;imid ag lorg soil&eacute;iri&uacute; ar an gceist seo &oacute;n Aire St&aacute;it anocht.

Is l&eacute;ir dom go bhfuil &aacute;rd-mheas ag daoine orthu.</P>
        <P>Fire services for Galway city and county are delivered by Galway County Council on the basis of an agreement between both authorities.  The service serves a population of 250,000 and responds to 2,200 call-outs annually.  There are ten fire stations in the county &mdash; Galway city, Athenry, Ballinasloe, Clifden, Gort, Loughrea, Mountbellew, Portumna, Tuam and Inis Mor.  The Galway city brigade is staffed by 36 full-time firefighters with backup from rostered and retained city firefighters.  The brigade covers the city and areas west of it, including south Connemara.  Fire cover in all the other brigade areas are provided by a retained system.</P><Col N="398"/>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government supports Galway County Council through the setting of general policy and guidance and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment &mdash; within the overall funding available &mdash; of costs incurred by it in respect of the construction and upgrading of fire stations as well as the approved purchase of fire appliances and emergency equipment.  Capital investment of some &euro;8.28 million has been grant aided to the council under the annual fire services capital programme from 2002 to 2010.</P>
        <P>A review of fire services in Galway is being undertaken by Galway County Council.  This review, which is being conducted throughout the city and county, including the Connemara region, is being informed by an integrated risk management analysis.  The output from the analysis will inform local decision making on the effective deployment and use of resources with a view to ensuring an appropriate balance between prevention, protection and response measures.  In addition, national guidance on a wide variety of community fire safety issues is being developed by the Department&rsquo;s national directorate for fire and emergency management in collaboration with fire services.  This guidance will also be of assistance to Galway County Council in the work that is under way.</P>
        <P>A primary concern of the national directorate is the development of consistent and effective fire services to keep communities safe from fire and other emergencies.  Value for money is also a key concern and future developments, including investment in infrastructure, will need to be brought to fruition within tighter resource constraints.  Further support from the Department&rsquo;s fire services capital programme to Galway County Council in the period ahead will have regard to the council&rsquo;s priorities, the extent of previous investment, the value for money offered by proposals, the spread of existing facilities and the totality of demands from fire authorities countrywide.</P>

It is blatantly obvious that, with call-out times of one and a quarter hours in Connemara, it is completely unacceptable.  A service much closer to south Connemara must be made available.  If it is decided, under the national framework, that there is a service needed in Connemara, will the Government make available the resources to provide it?</P>

    <sTitle>Nursing Homes Support Scheme</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This matter concerns the change in respect of Valentia Community Hospital, which is now being classified as a private nursing home.  This is a retrograde step and a mistake.  It should not have happened.  The Health Act 2007 provided for three categories of nursing homes &mdash; public, private and voluntary.  By its name, Valentia Community Hospital should be classified as a public facility.  The Act, which predates the fair deal scheme, stated that each bed in a public facility was funded by the State up to the maximum of 90% and the people in public beds paid a nominal fee from their pensions.  However, beds in private nursing homes were only funded to the tune of 40% by the State and the person in the bed had to make a contribution of 60%.  The practice in Valentia Community Hospital was for all patients to make a small contribution on the basis that the hospital had public beds.  The State was paying up to 90% of the sum.  I cannot understand how Valentia Community Hospital was <Col N="399"/>categorised as a private hospital in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009, nor can I accept it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Pearl S. Buck, who won the Nobel Prize for literature, stated: &ldquo;Our society must make it right and possible for old people not to fear the young or be deserted by them, for the test of a civilization is the way that it cares for its helpless members.&rdquo;  The hospital, from the ground it is built on to each and every one who receives or provides a service, is part of the social fabric that is the community in Valentia and Iveragh, a community of family, neighbours and the area at large.  This is a community whose members can avail of a resource when they are at their most vulnerable.  It is a time none of us wishes for, the day one has to decide that one is no longer able to cope alone, to admit this to the wider community, to give up and allow and trust the staff of Valentia Community Hospital to provide the care needed.  This is not an easy decision to make and sometimes medical necessity saves the individual from making it.  Having someone cared for in their community by an extended community who will support them until death is the reality of long-stay care.  The value it has for the people affected is beyond fiscal calculation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At present there is a capacity of 65 beds in Iveragh between Valentia and Caherciveen hospitals for a population of 7,500.  If Valentia hospital is not reclassified as a public facility, we will only have 33 beds for a population of 7,500.  That is not a great delivery of service because the consequence is that people will have to be facilitated in Killarney, representing a round trip of 110 miles.  The fair deal scheme was about giving everyone equal access so that they would be looked after in the community.  The consequence will be beds located 55 miles away.  This does not involve fiscal prudence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Today, people from Valentia who are in Kerry General Hospital require a bed in Valentia or Caherciveen.  While the bed manager is awaiting a bed in Caherciveen, the people in question have not been offered a bed in Valentia.  I wonder if there is an agenda to close Valentia by stealth and maintain it as a private nursing home.  In that case, the subvention from the NTPF amounts to &euro;750 per bed if it is classified as a private nursing home.  However, Caherciveen is classified as a public hospital and is in receipt of a subvention of &euro;1,150.  By stealth, Valentia hospital will close.  Those awaiting discharge in Tralee must remain in their Tralee hospital beds, thus reducing the capacity of Tralee to facilitate new admissions.  This is not an unfamiliar story and the disputed bed lists are now a part of any hospital day.  If the patients in question were discharged to Valentia hospital, it would mean that Valentia would be working at capacity and working at maximum value in terms of the staff to patient ratio.  Beds would become available in Kerry General Hospital for those waiting on trolleys or those walking in the doors for the six-hour person centred care on arrival at Kerry General Hospital.</P>
        <P>What are the social and human costs in the long term in terms of the reduction in service if we reduce the number of beds to 33?  It is devastating in the short term to think of moving the existing patients to another care facility, if indeed it exists.  What is the social damage to the existing families and support systems, such as friends and neighbours dropping in to visit one person but calling on everyone?  The existing 66 beds in Iveragh help to alleviate the stress on Kerry General Hospital.  However, at peak admission times, such as in winter, the existing capacity is challenged.  Surely, maintaining this existing infrastructure is key to the long-term sustainability of our community and its vulnerable people.  We should be thinking of increasing capacity in the long term and not this potentially devastating reduction in services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister of State, on behalf of the people of Valentia and Iveragh to assist the committee of the Valentia Community Hospital in its endeavours to secure the future of the hospital.  Valentia Community Hospital needs to be reclassified similar to public providers and the State funding per bed needs to be increased to a level that makes the service sustainable. <Col N="400"/> As a public representative, I ask the Minister of State to make this happen and to maintain what is a community, voluntary, not-for-profit hospital.  The people of Valentia and Iveragh will do the rest.  As citizens of the State, they want a fair deal and a people first health service equal to any citizen of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue and I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Health.</P>
	<P Just="Left">Valentia Community Hospital provides long-term and respite care for older people.  It is run by a voluntary organisation, Valentia Community Health and Welfare Association Limited, and has a service level agreement with the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act 2004.  All organisations with service level agreements under this section of the Health Act 2004 are required to negotiate with the NTPF as they provide services in addition to, not on behalf of, the HSE, and are therefore not legally regarded as public services.</P>
        <P>In the past, Valentia Community Hospital was allocated a lump sum annually by the HSE.  The nursing homes support scheme, the fair deal, was introduced in October 2009 in order to address the fundamental inequity in the treatment of public and private long-term nursing home residents and to alleviate the financial hardship being experienced by long-term residents in private nursing homes.  Prior to the introduction of the fair deal scheme, many people in long-term nursing home care experienced unaffordable care costs over periods of many years.  The result was that many people had to sell or remortgage their houses or had to turn to family and friends in order to find the money to meet their care costs.  A fundamental purpose of the scheme, therefore, was to offer assurance to one of the most vulnerable groups in society, those in need of long-term nursing home care, that such care will be affordable and will remain affordable for as long as they need it.</P>
        <P>In order to achieve these objectives of equity and affordability, fair deal involves a fundamental change in the way in which long-term nursing home care is funded and, consequently, the way in which nursing homes and community hospitals are funded.  The new scheme supports the individuals in need of long-term nursing home care, not the facilities providing the care.  This means that money follows the patient regardless of whether they choose public, private or voluntary nursing homes.  It ensures that these facilities are not being funded for empty beds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In order to qualify for the scheme all private nursing homes and voluntary nursing homes which previously received funding for long-term residential care under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, including Valentia Community Hospital, must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This is a necessary feature of the scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person&rsquo;s contribution.  The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and in carrying it out it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State.   The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.  This method of negotiation is necessary in order to ensure that the State obtains the best value for each individual in a nursing home and to comply with competition law.  As already stated, the nursing homes support scheme only applies to long-term nursing home care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Valentia Community Hospital can continue to have separate agreements with the Health Service Executive for the provision of other services such as day care, respite and convalescence.  There have been ongoing discussions between the board of management of Valentia Community Health and Welfare Association Limited and the HSE with regard to future service provision.  In addition, the Minister for Health met a delegation from Valentia Community Hospital in June.  I understand that following the meeting the HSE is continuing to engage with the board of management with regard to the future of the service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive response, yet it does not go to the kernel of the problem.  If Valentia Community Hospital is not classified as a public facility, as it has always operated and was funded accordingly, we will be down to 33 beds for a population of 7,500 people.  We have been told by the health service to excel, to provide the best possible care and to place the patient at the centre of the service but it would appear, in this case, that fiscal policy, not the people, is the central component.  It has been argued that Valentia Community Hospital is a private facility, which is untrue, because of what was happening there, where the State was covering the beds up to 90%.  That is what happened in public facilities, whereas private facilities were funded only up to 40%.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Health re the reduction in funding for Valentia Community Hospital per bed, the significant difference whereby in the case of two hospitals providing the same service, approximately 15 miles apart, that one receives &euro;750 per bed while the other receives &euro;1,100 per bed.</P>

	<P>I note the Senator&rsquo;s comments.  It is an unfortunate downside of the scheme as it operates that a voluntary organisation and a hospital are regarded as private facilities rather than as a public hospital.  That is the way the scheme operates.  I am not sure there is much scope in terms of the long stay beds.  Clearly, in regard to the other facilities provided, there is scope for the hospital to make arrangements with the HSE and to agree pricing.  In the manner in which the fair deal scheme operates, I am not sure there is much scope.  I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point that they are losing out but I will relay his concerns.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue and I am pleased the Minister of State is here to respond.  The issue I wish to raise is the need to develop a dementia strategy.  I thank the Alzheimer Society of Ireland for constantly keeping this issue to the fore.  Recently it provided a briefing for Oireachtas members at which it outlined the need to put a dementia strategy in place.  As the population ages and lives longer such a strategy is important.  It is estimated that there are 44,000 people with dementia in Ireland.  It is estimated that in 15 years&rsquo; time there will be 70,000 with dementia and in 25 years&rsquo; time there will be 104,000 with dementia.  We all know somebody or some family who is affected by dementia.</P>
        <P>We speak a great deal about the condition and its growing numbers.  In many ways it is hidden in society, because we do not see people on trolleys.  Generally speaking there is no need for medical care, except towards the end, but there is a need for care and caring services to be available in our communities.  In many ways we are playing catch-up.  There are large gaps in our services and it appears there are different services available in different areas, which is not satisfactory; hence the need for a strategy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Prior to the last general election, the Minister of State as well as myself were asked to follow this through and pledge to do what we could to develop a strategy for dementia.   We need to establish the facts, the trends, the costs associated with such a strategy, the services that need to be put in place, the gaps in the service, best practice and how best we can serve the needs of the individual who has dementia or Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and their carers and families.  A timely diagnosis will always be important.</P><Col N="402"/>
        <P>Primary health care provision will be extremely important initially to support families.  This is all about supporting families and their carers.  My experience is that families do not want the care of the individual taken over by the State but want to be supported and helped.  Community services are very important in this area.  On average a dementia patient, with medical intervention for treating physical needs, can live for seven to ten years and longer in some cases.  Therefore, it is important that local community services, public health nurse and occupational therapy services are available.  I realise there are costs associated with the strategy.</P>
        <P>If planned properly we can have a strategy where individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s can look to see what the State can provide or where they will fit in the years to come.  It is not about money all the time but it will be about providing essential primary care services.</P>
        <P>An issue I have come across recently in my constituency, which was mentioned by families seeking services, is that the public health nurse is not available to patients who do not have a medical card.  I would have thought the services would be provided based on the care needs of the individual irrespective of whether they have a medical card.  If patients do not have the support of a public health nurse in the community, the only recourse is the hospital or nursing care.  I recognise the strain on services but care should be provided on the basis of need and eligibility for aids appliances, nursing home care, respite can be based on medical card.  Clearly, a public health nurse is essential to supporting those needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to update the House on the matter.  </P>
	<P Just="Left">Dementia is a most distressing condition for those suffering from it and for their families and presents a significant and growing challenge to health and social services.  Alzheimer's disease represents about 70% of the cases of dementia.  People are living longer and, as a consequence, they are more likely to develop some form of dementia.  While dementia is not solely related to age, the prevalence is higher in older people and increases with age.  It is estimated that about 5% of people aged over 65 have some form of dementia with this figure increasing to 20% for people aged over 80.  Research and published work on dementia has outlined the complexity and range of issues involved in its effective management.  This work also emphasises the need for co-ordinated, multi-layered and well-resourced services that respond to the individual needs of people with dementia and of those who care for them.</P>
        <P>There is an intimate link in Government policy between the care of older people and that of people with dementia.  It stresses the need to provide support in dignity and independence, through the provision of appropriate services to the people concerned and their carers.  The person with dementia can be supported through a range of core community services provided by the public health nurse or the psychiatry old age team, home help service, therapy services, assistive technology and other such services.  Attendance at day care and the provision of respite care can also assist greatly in supporting the person to live at home.  These services are provided directly by the HSE and voluntary agencies such as the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society.  In recent years, the availability of home care packages has also contributed significantly to assisting older people to continue to live at home.</P>
        <P>Since 1 July 2009, all designated centres for older people are subject to independent registration and inspection by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres) Regulations 2009 underpin the National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.  These standards include supplementary criteria for dementia specific residential care units which should be read in conjunction with the general standards.</P><Col N="403"/>
        <P>The Government is fully aware of the challenges that Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and other dementia pose and will continue to pose for us in the coming years.  A commitment was given in the programme for Government to develop a national Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other dementia strategy by 2013.  The Department of Health has started the process of developing a policy on dementia that will support the delivery of long-term care services, having regard to future demographic trends and the consequential increase in demand for long-term care.  This policy will be developed on the basis of the best evidence available from national and international sources.  Officials in the Department have engaged with relevant stakeholder groups in the first stage of the process, which is to assemble the research and evidence upon which the policy will be developed. I expect this will be received shortly, at which stage work on the policy will commence formally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  I am aware of the commitment in the programme for  Government and I am glad work has begun on developing a strategy.  Can she reply to my question about the provision of care for medical card holders and non-medical card holders?  Does she have that information?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has raised a valid point.  Health services do not operate uniformly across the State and, for historic and other reasons, people without a medical card have access to services in certain areas while, in other areas, medical card holders have difficulty accessing the same services.  There is an uneven pattern in respect of many services and the Department is committed to introducing legislation on eligibility, which is a thorny issue.  That has been promised for several years and we have not seen a result from that work.  However, it is an issue.</P>
        <P>In general, we should move towards a model where services are provided locally as far as possible, whether those are services for the elderly, mental health services or general health services.  That means providing services at the lowest level of complexity to people.  Public health nurses are a key component of such services in local communities and I am concerned about current gaps in community services.  There are more than 400 vacancies at primary care level for public health nurses and a range of other allied health professionals.  That will be the greatest challenge to rolling out the primary care reforms promised in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no standard approach.  While in theory there is, the practice is different around the country.  Public health nurses will be the mainstay of the health service in the future and we want to develop their role.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to raise the benefits of social monitored alarms for older people in terms of independent living and longevity and to request that funding be maintained at current levels in the budget.  This is an important principle and it should underpin any older people&rsquo;s strategy.  Community Supports for Older People, CSOP, is currently funded through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Under this scheme, anybody aged over 65 can apply for a social monitored alarm.  It also covers monitored smoke alarms, carbon monoxide detectors and security lighting.  This means that once the alarms are installed in older people&rsquo;s homes, they are centrally monitored by a company whose staff can respond to the call of an older person.  Each application needs to be made through a recognised community group such as Community Alert or Neighbourhood Watch, which make an application to the Department on behalf of a number of such local people within their respective communities.  The scheme then provides funding for the group per piece of equipment.  For example, &euro;250 is provided for a social monitored alarm, &euro;65 for a smoke alarm, &euro;100 <Col N="404"/>for a carbon monoxide alarm, and &euro;120 for security lighting.  Carbon monoxide and smoke alarms can save a person&rsquo;s life while security lighting gives peace of mind and a social monitored alarm means somebody is at the end of a telephone line when an older person needs help.</P>
        <P>This funding allows some or all of this equipment to be installed in the older person&rsquo;s home and, importantly, it promotes independence and peace of mind for them.  Funding this year will be approximately &euro;1 million, which is a significant reduction on the allocation of approximately &euro;4 million in 2007 but, nonetheless, it is greatly necessary, no matter how small.  In excess of 3,000 people benefit from this funding and in light of the increasing feeling of insecurity and isolation among older people, it is imperative that funding be retained to ensure this service can be rolled out to more people in need of these supports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the funding has been significantly reduced, maintaining the current funding of &euro;1 million annually would be of great value societally.  Older people are one of the most vulnerable groups in society and anything that helps them to remain in their own homes free of fear and with peace of mind is an investment in their quality of life.  In the past three years, the number of calls made to one company with 35,000 clients has dramatically increased by approximately 30% to 350,000 calls per annum, which is incredible.  The company receives an average of ten calls per older person.  The main drivers of this increase are attempted burglaries, increasing isolation, fraud being perpetrated on the elderly and vulnerable, and a fear factor that exists among that demographic.</P>
        <P>I asked what fraud means and the example I was given was of somebody knocking an older person&rsquo;s door to say he had found a &euro;20 note outside the door and asking whether it was his or hers.  It is a way of getting into the house.  Isolation can range from people living rurally to others in cities who have no family members and who see themselves as easy targets and, ultimately, victims of crime.  One company regularly has clients contact them merely to speak to another human as it may have been days since they last spoke to somebody.  Up to 85% of all its calls are to reassure clients who feel isolated or vulnerable or who are in genuine need of help.  The isolation felt by older people is stark.  The number of lives saved over the years by this service is incalculable.  When funding was suspended by our predecessors for six months in 2008, there was a huge backlash against them.  A recent HSE-sponsored project that involved the installation of such equipment in 120 older people&rsquo;s homes on a national basis and which was assessed by public health nurses found that telecare should be regarded as a substantive ingredient of home care services, especially for people with high levels of need and those who are assessed as likely to need residential or similar forms of care.  It also found that the HSE and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government should further develop assessment arrangements and facilities to support the deployment of telecare services that will support dependant persons.</P>
        <P>I was struck by the results of the study by the public health nurses.  They found it gave older people peace of mind, kept people in their own homes and assessed some as likely to need to go into care within six months.  It would save the State millions of euro and is a good preventive measure.  In terms of the Minister&rsquo;s brief of primary health care and health in the community, it is very important.</P>
        <P>Usage by the most needy and high risk clients reflected the level of dependency described in the assessments undertaken by HSE staff.  Usage of the telecare system was highest among those who had chronic, painful and disabling physical health conditions and those who had mobility problems, when those who used it a lot for reassurance are excluded from activation data.  Those are the people we want to use it so it is great they are using it.  By supporting clients&rsquo; preferences to remain at home, telecare is likely to contribute to the appropriate use of limited and specialist resources and support the most effective use of finances.  It is a good <Col N="405"/>investment in older people&rsquo;s health.  Telecare is considered by users and carers to be easy to use and is well received.</P>
        <P>I am seeking a commitment from the Minister of State that the budget for this project will not be cut and that she will communicate the importance of this at Cabinet level and to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>
        <P>I have given to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government the accounts of one publicly supported company in Ireland that provides these socially monitored alarms that is undercutting a private company that provides the same supports.  The company&rsquo;s details show it got Government grants of &euro;165,000 in 2010 and &euro;195,000 in 2009.  I mention that because the private company is providing the same service without any support.  There is no need for the Government grants when companies can work through the fund given to older people&rsquo;s supports.  It is a waste of public money if the service can be privately provided.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must maintain the supports in the community for older people in order that they can live a life as free of fear as possible while allowing them to stay in their own homes for as long as they can.  At the same time, we should be aware of where money is being wasted.  I do not know if the grants were paid in 2011, but they certainly were in 2009 and 2010.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to address the Seanad on the benefits of socially monitored alarms for older people to promote independent living.  This year alone the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will assist over 7,000 older people by providing grants for this vital equipment.</P>
        <P>The new seniors alert scheme was introduced on 24 May 2010 and replaced the scheme of community support for older people.  The scheme provides grant support towards the cost of supplying and installing items of safety and security equipment to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind.  The eligibility criteria have remained broadly the same as they were under the CSOP but community groups have been given improved guidance and information on how to determine eligibility.  This is central to the improvements introduced in the new scheme.  The CSOP was confined to those aged 65 years and older who were considered vulnerable and this left a lot to the discretion of volunteers.  Community groups requested greater guidance in this regard and the revised scheme states more explicitly the criteria to be used.</P>
        <P>Generally, a person will be eligible for grant support if he or she is aged 65 years or older, of limited means and resources, living alone or with another person who meets the eligibility criteria and is able to benefit from the equipment supplied.  Grants may be provided towards the cost of supplying and installing equipment.  The grants include up to &euro;240 for personal monitored alert systems with pendant, up to &euro;75 for monitored smoke detectors, &euro;100 for monitored carbon monoxide detectors, up to &euro;50 for additional pendants or reinstallation, as much as &euro;120 for internal emergency lighting, and &euro;50 for external security lighting.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;2.35 million has been provided for the seniors alert scheme in 2011.  The Minister anticipates that some 7,000 older persons will benefit from the scheme this year.  To the end of October 2011, some &euro;2.054 million in grant support has been provided to 374 community groups for the provision of items of safety and security equipment to 6,539 older people.</P>
        <P>The changes introduced as part of the review of the scheme have made a significant impact on its operation and availability.  The Minister is very conscious of the benefits of the seniors alert scheme, which provides security and the ability to achieve independent living at home.  He will do his utmost to ensure that this scheme can continue into the future.  This will be in the context, however, of reduced funding being made available to Departments in 2012.  Per<Col N="406"/>sonal security is a critical factor in people being able to remain in their homes and in many cases this has been a life-saver for people.</P>
        <P>The Minister will take into account the benefits of this scheme in promoting independent living for so many and the possibility of doing this at a limited cost to the State in any future decisions on funding of the seniors alert scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and congratulate her as the figures are more positive than I thought.  The key point I made about the publicly supported company that is undercutting the private company is that in its accounts, it awarded administrative expenses of &euro;486,000 in 2010 and &euro;492,000 in 2009.  Is that money going to individuals&rsquo; salaries as opposed to the administration of the scheme?  This issue must be addressed because the service can be provided privately.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s response is positive but we must follow up on any waste in the system.</P>
