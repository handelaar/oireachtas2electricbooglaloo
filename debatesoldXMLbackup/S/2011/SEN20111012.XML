	<P>I have received notice from Senator Martin Conway that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to amend the Equal Status Act to prevent the Equality Tribunal from being abused by people making fictitious and unnecessary complaints.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mary White of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to reform legislation relating to inquests involving Northern Ireland residents who die in the Republic of Ireland, particularly in the light of the request of the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Northern Irish Human Rights Commission on 5 May for an inquest under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights into the murder of a person (details supplied) in County Donegal in 2006; and to indicate whether he will take the necessary steps to facilitate this request.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Approximately three weeks ago in the House I raised the issue of the ongoing review at Aviva.  I now understand from reports that Aviva is looking to shed anything from 800 to 1,000 posts in this country.  At the time I asked what contact the Govern<Col N="714"/>ment had with Aviva.  Has the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, been in contact with that company?  Last week, the Taoiseach was asked whether progress was being made in Aviva.  As all Members will appreciate, the loss of 1,000 jobs located less than one mile from Leinster House would be a significant loss for the city of Dublin and the 1,000 families involved.  I was a little concerned last week when the Taoiseach stated that he would await Aviva&rsquo;s completion of its review, as I suggest it will be too late at that stage.  Aviva will have made its decision by then and up to 1,000 jobs could be lost.  If one takes the example of Quinn Insurance, which was a difficult issue for the previous Government to deal with, most jobs there were retained because the relevant Ministers became involved at the review stage before a decision was taken to decrease numbers at that company.  The Leader should indicate what contacts the Government has made with Aviva to ascertain whether it can address some of the concerns Aviva may have in order to save these jobs.  This is to avoid arriving at a point on the company&rsquo;s completion of its review next month at which it announces that due to rationalisation, it intends to decrease its workforce by 1,000, after which Ireland runs off to Europe to seek retraining funds and so on because everything has already happened.</P>
        <P>Second, several weeks ago Senator Quinn raised the issue of illegal diesel and the many new petrol stations that have opened up around the city and nationwide that are selling illegal diesel at a loss to the Exchequer of approximately &euro;300 million per annum.  At the time, Senator Quinn rightly mentioned that the maximum penalties at present are the closure of the offending garage for 24 hours and a &euro;3,000 fine.  While this issue should have been dealt with before now &mdash; by the previous Government &mdash; this practice is becoming more prevalent and is being run by subversive organised crime elements.  The Leader should indicate whether the Government has plans to introduce legislation to amend existing legislation to increase dramatically the penalties against such operations in the first instance.  The penalty at present is a &euro;3,000 fine and a closure order of 24 hours&rsquo; duration.  The profit derived from a single full container of illegal diesel can be as much as &euro;19,000 and it pays those involved to break the law.  Are plans afoot to introduce legislation, which would be supported from this side of the House, to increase these penalties?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe all Members share the concerns expressed by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien on the reports of potential job losses at Aviva.  As Senator O&rsquo;Brien is aware, the Labour Party group already has devoted specific Private Members&rsquo; Business time to the plight of the workers at TalkTalk in Waterford, during which debate there was much talk of other projected job losses, including those at Aviva, and of what the Government can do in circumstances in which large-scale collective redundancies are faced.  It is a highly disturbing situation and at that time, Labour Party Members called for consideration of a review of the notice period that companies must give, which also would be useful in the context of the Aviva reports.</P>
        <P>I renew the call on the Leader for a debate on Government housing policy.  Yesterday, Members, myself included, called for a debate in the context of the Keane report on protection for those in difficulty with mortgages.  Such a debate in this House would be timely and the D&aacute;il will debate this issue for at least one day and potentially two days next week.  However, it would be useful to have a broader debate on the Keane report and on housing policy more generally, in which I would include the issue of the provision of rent supplement.  There are reports in today&rsquo;s newspapers about the nature of rent supplement and how it is being considered in the comprehensive spending review in the context of the social protection budget.  However, it is a matter of concern when one notes that the &euro;500 million spent on rent supplement effectively amounts to a subsidy to private landlords.  The effect is that the State is subsidising 50% of private rented accommodation, which clearly distorts the market and keeps rents high, unsustainably so in many cases.  A question arises as to whether this is an effective <Col N="715"/>use of Government funding to protect the most vulnerable.  Consequently, it would be worth having a debate in this House on the broader issue of housing policy.  It should not simply be on those who require protection because they are in difficulties with mortgages, although this is a critical issue, but it should be on the manner in which State spending is targeted and whether it could be targeted better.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Carers Association on its briefing today.  It made a pre-budget submission and a highly compelling case for maintaining levels of carer&rsquo;s allowance.  All Members recognise that family caring, much of which is unpaid, constitutes an enormous saving to the Exchequer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a question for the Leader this morning.  However, I offer a word of public thanks to him on a matter that is related to the Order of Business and that has significance beyond how Members order their business.  Is this acceptable?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Not really but the Senator can frame her point as a question.  She may have a question for the Leader in what she intends to say.</P>

	<P>This has not happened before today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I am about to get to a serious moment now.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leader for his agreement to sponsor my request that a loop system to support those with a hearing disability be installed in the Seanad Chamber.  For those Members who may be unfamiliar with the expression, a loop system effectively is a technological system installed in a closed environment that enables those with digital hearing aids to access the sound of a human voice in a highly effective manner, which is considerably more effective than the microphone system in use at present, and many public buildings are installed with such systems.  To be honest, although I wear hearing aids, my severe hearing loss means I have only been able to hear approximately between 50% and 75% of what goes on within the Chamber during a debate.  Some Members might think this is not such a bad thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Lucky you.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash; but I have been impressed by the quality of the debate I have heard.  However, Members can imagine this places me and others with a hearing disability at a considerable disadvantage, especially when one must engage in an exchange or a debate with a Minister when he or she comes into the Chamber.  In this case, the headphones really do not work.  I will not demonstrate with the headphones but effectively I would be obliged to take out my hearing aids and put on my headphones.  However, if I take out my hearing aids, I cannot hear with the headphones.  If I put on the headphones on top of my hearing aids, as I am doing now, it generates that feedback Members may be able to hear and consequently, it does not work.</P><Col N="716"/>
        <P Just="Left">In part, this is educational and I express my thanks to the Clerk&rsquo;s office, to my colleagues the Independent Senators and to the Superintendent of Leinster House for their support in this request.  I thank them and the Leader in particular because as a person with a disability or as a disabled person, I was not obliged to engage in a protracted struggle for the support service.  As a citizen and as an Oireachtas Member, I should have a right to participate in a public sphere without shame.  Often, people with disabilities feel a sense of shame.  While it is a conditioned sense of shame, it is shame nonetheless and can be exacerbated, even implicitly, when those who are disabled are told they should have supports but the organisation in question simply cannot afford them at present.  I again express my thanks to the Leader and my colleagues.  My understanding from the Superintendent&rsquo;s office is that the Seanad Chamber will be fitted with a loop system first within three weeks, after which the D&aacute;il Chamber also will be fitted.  This constitutes an important advance for people with disabilities.  Our Chambers will become considerably more accessible for public representatives and members of the public who view or even participate in what Members do.  When this happens, it will be a good day.  In addition to thanking the Leader, perhaps I could ask him whether Members could eventually have a debate on the issue of people with disabilities and on ways to increase support services for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Well done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has done the State some service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Zappone for an education and the activity she has created in this regard.  I did not know anything about the loop system and did not realise this.  I also thank Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien for raising again the question regarding illegal diesel I introduced some time ago.  It is a matter of huge concern for the State because the money involved runs to hundreds of millions of euros and because it encourages crime.</P>
        <P>I wish to introduce one other point about which something should be done.  My attention has been drawn to carbon monoxide, which is a silent killer that some estimates suggest kills more than 40 people each year in Ireland, although there is some doubt about how many it kills.  Carbon monoxide is a gas that is produced when fuel is burned.  It is extremely dangerous to people when emitted in an enclosed and unventilated area such as a house, garage or car.  The major problem is that because carbon monoxide is odourless, colourless and tasteless, it is a silent killer.  The solution is to have a carbon monoxide detector which can be bought for approximately &euro;30.  Someone told me he bought a Chinese made one for only &euro;10, which indicates the possibility of being able to do something about it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Northern Ireland has introduced regulations requiring new houses being built to be fitted with such a detector.  We have not done that, yet it is a simple thing to do.  The regulation was introduced in Northern Ireland following the deaths in County Donegal last year of two people, who were, I believe, from the North of Ireland.  When the Northern Ireland authorities visited and discovered that the cause was carbon monoxide poisoning, they introduced legislation to ensure every house in Northern Ireland will have a carbon monoxide detector.  We can do the same and I ask the Leader to draw the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the matter and to initiate legislation promptly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s comments on Aviva.  Recently the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, announced a number of jobs &mdash; perhaps one of my Kerry colleagues can assist me with how many.  Those jobs had come back from India or another country in the east having previously gone there because it was more economical.  Now <Col N="717"/>these jobs are starting to come back to Ireland.  We need to regard this as something about which we can do something.  I ask the Leader to open a debate on jobs that went abroad coming back, which would be useful.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien is correct in saying that we need to act now to get something done about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator Zappone on an excellent demonstration.  She has done the State some service.  I also thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for supporting her worthwhile motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to move, in coming weeks, No. 12 on the Order Paper relating to the Palestinian state and non-Government motion No. 4.  On Tuesday, 4 October, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe voted to grant partner for democracy status to the Palestinian National Council.  As one of the delegation, with Senators Clune and Reilly, I was delighted to represent this House in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, where we had the opportunity to support the motion which was carried by 110 to five with ten abstentions.  The Irish delegation voted very much for the proposal.</P>
        <P>I welcome the decision by the Palestinian Authority to release Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier kidnapped by Hamas in 2006, in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian detainees.  It is a good day for this conflict.  At some stage it would be useful to have a discussion on the role of the Council of Europe, representing 800 million people.  It comprises 47 countries and Ireland was a founding member.  Ireland has a delegation of eight very active members of that organisation.  Today&rsquo;s release of the Israeli soldier is a very good day for relations between Palestine and Israel.  It is a new beginning in a sense and I hope we could have a useful debate &mdash; as we had in the previous Seanad &mdash; on the Middle East situation.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade could brief the House on current developments and Ireland&rsquo;s progressive role as the first country to recognise the two-state solution proposed by the late Brian Lenihan Snr. when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two questions for the Leader, one of which is specific and the other general.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General again draws our attention to the confusion that is the fair deal nursing home support scheme, which scheme is vital for a great number of our older people and their families.  Perhaps the Leader could ascertain from the Minister how the National Treatment Purchase Fund managed to enter into agreements with a significant number of private nursing homes resulting in the State paying in excess of &euro;20 million more than it should have.  It is odd that no standard pricing model was used and basic information such as the level of dependency was not taken into account during these negotiations.  It suggests that questions need to be asked about the negotiating skills of those involved and I ask the Leader to ascertain from the Minister, the Department or the HSE what happened in that regard.</P>
        <P>Each year when the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is published it causes a certain level of furore among the public, in the media and in political circles, which generally lasts for one or two days.  It revealed certain levels of waste and mismanagement across Departments and agencies.  Invariably this fuss dies down with seemingly no consequence for those who make poor decisions.  I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on the issue in the House and perhaps invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to come to the House to discuss his report in greater detail.  While we are at it, perhaps we could make it an annual event on our calendar or schedule of work.  There is a valuable role for this House in ensuring accountability everywhere and we should be striving to expand this role wherever we can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join Senator Bacik in commending the Carers Association, which is giving a number of briefings to Deputies and Senators today, for its pre-budget submission. <Col N="718"/> It hopes it will get the support it seeks in the upcoming budget.  We had a very useful discussion with the association which represents tens of thousands of people who care for others.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I praise the Leader of the House in respect of changes which have been made in recent weeks regarding Ministers coming into the Chamber.  On six occasions we have had Ministers in for statements followed by question-and-answer sessions, which is a very welcome departure from the old way of simply having statements without further interaction.  I qualify that by saying that on the first four occasions, a Sinn F&eacute;in Member was given an opportunity to make statements, but on the last two occasions when the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State with responsibility for science and innovation came into the House a Sinn F&eacute;in Member was not given an opportunity.  We were told by the Acting Chairman at the time that we would have one minute to address the Minister for Finance and one minute to address the Minister of State with responsibility for science and innovation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">It is not unreasonable for our party to refuse to accept one minute in a two and a half hour debate.  It is important to recognise that we have three Senators in this House.  This is not about Standing Orders because I have outlined the precedent that on four occasions we were given the opportunity.  Why were we given the time to make statements on the first four occasions and not given that time on the last two occasions?  I formally request and we can put this in writing, that a representative of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party meet the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, to discuss these issues.We do not want to have to continue to raise these issues on the Order of Business.  Wewould like them resolved.  The Leader of the House and other Senators have said theywant all debates and discussions in the House to be inclusive and that all opinions and ideas are valued.  In that context it is important that our voices are heard.  I hope the Leaderof the House will facilitate a Member of my party addressing the CPP.  I ask the Leader to respond and indicate why on the last two occasions we were not given an opportunity to make statements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I bring to the attention of the House an article written by Mr. Bill Hobbs in last Monday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> which stated it was inappropriate for politicians to comment on or question the Financial Regulator regarding his dealings with credit unions.  Mr. Hobbs describes himself as a former ACC Bank official, banking commentator&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.  I am coming to my point.  He failed to inform that he was a former CEO of the credit union development agency himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have ruled on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is about freedom of speech, and he is stating that it is inappropriate for politicians to question the regulator&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Then I would suggest that the Leader either contacts the Press Council of Ireland about this man&rsquo;s article, in which he states what politicians should and should not comment on, when he himself had a vested interest.  It brings to mind the image of having a chip on one&rsquo;s shoulder.  He has a six inch block on his shoulder.</P>

	<P>I bring to the attention of the Leader the plight of property owners in various towns who in 2009 suffered severe losses due to flooding.  The night of 19 November 2009 was an appalling night.  There was six feet of water in some properties in Bandon, Skibbereen was flooded on three occasions, as was Clonakilty and many other towns.  Many of these properties, not all of them commercial, cannot get insurance because once bitten, twice shy.  If any of us was driving a car and we had an accident, we would expect to pay an extra premium to be reinsured, but there seems to be a blanket shutdown in these cases.  Some of these towns have recurring problems with flooding, I hope not this year.  I am not too sure of the appropriate Minister, but I would ask for a debate in the House on that issue.  A popular hostelry in Bandon was closed for eight months because the flooding was so severe.  Dance floors had to be ripped up and so on.  There were three incidences of flooding in Skibbereen in November and December 2009.</P>
        <P>I have been contacted by many homeowners about the issue.  Would the Leader ask the Government whether a universal system of insurance could be introduced?  These floods are an act of God.  Sometimes they occur every ten years and sometimes every 50 years, but owing to our wet climate, they are likely to occur again.  We should have a debate in this House and I hope that this could be done before the end of November, which is the anniversary of the serious flooding, which also occurred in Galway, Clonmel and many other towns.  It is unfair that householders, elderly people and commercial owners, who have suffered enough, now cannot get insurance.  It is nothing short of scandalous and I hope we can have a debate in this House as soon as is practicable on that issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is &euro;70 million outstanding to farmers for payments under the various schemes such as disadvantaged area scheme, AEOS and REPS.  That is not just money sitting there; it is the livelihood of thousands of people.  I would like the Leader to seek an assurance from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that all these payments will be cleared by his deadline of November.  There has been recurring delays and it is simply impossible for farmers, who cannot get credit from banks and who have spent money based on the assumption they would get this money, to keep going.  Coupled with this is the uncertainty that will be brought about by the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, proposals to be published today.  The CAP reform will go on for years.  There is also the forthcoming budget.  Can the Minister give the assurance that the November is indeed the date by which these &euro;70 million in payments will be made?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I notice the young students in the Visitors Gallery today, who are all looking very fit and obviously come from a very good school.  I was watching the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; television programme last night, which dealt with the epidemic of obesity that is facing Ireland and much of the rest of the world.  The forecast is not very good for our nation.  I am currently doing some research on schools in Ireland which I hope to present to the House in the near future.  Recommendations are being made for a sugar tax.  I am not sure whether I agree with that or whether it is the answer to our problems. This is not just a health issue but <Col N="720"/>also an education issue.  When I am ready to present my findings to the House, will it be possible to bring both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education and Skills into the House at the one time?  I do not want to be pointing this directly at the Department of Education and Skills or to the Department of Health, but when my findings are presented, we may save the Government a lot of money in 15 or 20 years if the recommendations are implemented.  The only way we can do this is through bringing both Departments together at the one time.  I am wondering whether this can happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I had the privilege of visiting the Johnson &amp; Johnson plant in Ringaskiddy on Monday.  This week is known as national corporate responsibility week, and 65 of the largest companies in Ireland are involved in helping students in certain schools to remain in education.  It is a very important process for both the companies and the students.  The programme has assisted more than 18,000 students to date.  It is something that should be encouraged.  Some of the biggest companies are involved in this project, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Musgraves, IBM, Diageo and Ulster Bank.  We were informed by a person from Musgraves that the company assigned seven staff to seven students in schools in disadvantaged areas to help those students remain in the education system.</P>
        <P>Perhaps this is an area where the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation could work with these companies and schools to devise a national programme and get more companies involved.  An explanation was given about one of the staff being assigned to a student who wanted to drop out of school, but because the staff from Musgraves provided mentoring, that student stayed in the system.  It was a learning process for the company because they found people who could provide leadership to young people and who could then go on to provide leadership in the company.  There is a benefit for the employers, the employees and the students, and this is something that should be encouraged.</P>

	<P>An article was published in <i>The Sunday Times </i>this week which highlighted the issue of apparent parliamentary interference in the appointment of members of the Judiciary.  As Members are aware, I attempted several weeks ago, in the context of criminal trials, to introduce legislation which would have attempted to regularise any connections made between Members of Parliament and the Judiciary.  It was, as they say, shot down in flames.  I was told that a wall of separation existed between the Parliament and the Judiciary and that such legislation was an attempt to breach that.  It would appear from this article that such a wall of separation truly is in ruins.  It is very endemic to the culture of this country and to the culture of public life that representations were made.  To preserve the integrity of the process and the good names of members of the Judiciary, who I am sure have acted in good faith at all times, we need to have a definite code of conduct which clearly states that such representations must never happen in future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As documents were available on a limited number of individual cases, one or two people were highlighted, one of whom was the late Judge Miriam Reynolds.  While I am very much in favour of ending the practice of any such interference being made, I would like, in the context of what was a good piece of journalism published by <i>The Sunday Times</i>, to state a couple of facts about the judge, who sadly died from cancer two years ago at a very young age.  It will not be widely known that at the time Judge Reynolds presided over the horrific Roscommon incest case, she was on chemotherapy for cancer throughout her skeleton.  She was a wonderful woman who behaved with great courage and fortitude, and great devotion to duty, when she could just have gone on disability.  The final case she took part in wasone which coincided exactly with her final illness.  She had to be persuaded by colleagues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I commend Senator Zappone for her achievement in having the loop system included in the Seanad Chamber.  As someone who suffers from a hearing disability, I have quite a lot of difficulty in this Chamber so I hope it will improve my ability to understand.  Perhaps &ldquo;understand&rdquo; is the wrong word because sometimes one may not understand what is going on in the House regardless of whether one can hear it.  At least I will be able to hear what is going on, so well done to Senator Zappone.  I commend her for that.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise two items.  The first concerns the theft of overhead telephone cables by unscrupulous gangs.  This is causing great difficulty, so I ask the Leader to bring it to the attention to the Minister for Justice and Equality in order that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should take a greater interest in this matter.  In my own area alone in recent months, telephone cables have been stolen in three locations.  The effect of such thefts is serious for private houses and businesses that operate on the periphery of towns, particularly concerning the loss of Internet usage.  On one such occasion, five businesses were out of operation for four days until Eircom could replace and repair the cables.  We have moved away from the tradition whereby Eircom was the only company visible to the public through its vehicles.  In recent years, many subcontractors have come on board.  Consequently, no one takes any notice of an unmarked cherry-picker doing work at a telephone pole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why I am asking the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to take up this issue with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is becoming prevalent in rural Ireland with a consequent negative effect for businesses.  The stolen telephone cable is being illegally exported to Bristol where it is stripped for its copper value.  There is quite a lucrative business going on around the theft of telephone cables.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to discuss Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s point about illegal diesel that is being sold throughout the country.  I have some knowledge of this subject because I have fallen victim to it in recent weeks.  About three weeks ago in Dublin, I bought &euro;50 worth of diesel in a garage.  When I attempted to return home that evening, I had to be towed 100 miles to Carrick-on-Suir by a garage man from my own area.  I have since done some research into this problem.  There are approximately 120 garages in the country that are taking part in this.  The cost of repairing a vehicle ranges from &euro;2,500 to &euro;15,000 and the vehicle could require a new engine.  Individuals in suits are going around, particularly to smaller units that are not part of garage chains, offering this diesel 30 cent or 40 cent per litre cheaper than the normal price.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If the Cathaoirleach will allow me to do so, I will put a question to the Leader.  I have been in contact with the Customs Service, whose representatives met me in Leinster House.  They told me that the technology being used by those who are washing diesel <Col N="722"/>has outpaced their ability to detect it.  They do not have the necessary resources and funding to bring such people to court.  I brought a sample of the diesel to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am just finishing.  I brought a sample of the diesel to the Customs Service representatives.  Even though I could tell them where and when I bought it, and they were already watching the garage, because the scientific methodology is far ahead of their ability to detect it, they need more funding to bring such illegal activities to book.  The Leader should raise the matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Customs Service should have the required funding because the Exchequer is losing massive sums of money.  Something needs to be done about this cross-Border racket.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe that the delay in payments to farmers under various schemes is unacceptable.  This money is vital for the families concerned as well as for the real economy with people facing into pre-Christmas expenditure.  State payments should be among the first to be made.  If it was in the commercial world, people would be seeking legal advice to secure payment more quickly.  This is simply unacceptable.  There are many reasons for failure but there are no excuses.  I ask the Leader to speak directly with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coveney, to get assurances on the dates for final payments to farmers under these schemes.  While there may be a delay in a small number of cases from time to time where documentation is incorrect, it is ridiculous in the extreme that &euro;70 million that should be in the economy is still in the Government&rsquo;s coffers as a result of having been delayed in this way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As we approach Christmas, we are also approaching our own national budget as well as the budgets of local authorities throughout the country.  I seek a debate on local government funding.  Local authorities are recording annual deficits of &euro;6 million.  Meanwhile, it is alleged &mdash; I ask the Leader to check this &mdash; that one of the Dublin authorities has in excess of &euro;120 million on deposit.  If so, we should examine our national approach to local government funding.  We cannot tolerate a scenario where smaller local authorities without the commercial rates base are struggling to maintain employment and a basic level of community services, while at the same time wealthy Dublin authorities have the arrogance to invest &euro;120 million of public money to secure the best rate of return rather than using it to supply public services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>There was disappointment yesterday when it was announced that the British Government did not appear to be allowing a full and substantive inquiry into the murder of the solicitor Pat Finucane.  I recall meeting some of his family members in Leinster House some years ago, and they wanted truth and justice for their late father, as we all should.  I hope that matter will be revisited and that the Government will be able to put whatever pressure is possible on the British Government to bring the case to a full conclusion.</P>
        <P>Having checked the records, I note that I first asked the House back in February 2004 to consider the possibility of establishing a truth and reconciliation commission.  I ask the Leader to liaise with the appropriate Government officials to inquire about having such a debate in this House.  There are too many unanswered questions, hidden bodies, other victims that are unaccounted for and crimes across this island for us to remain silent.  Part of the healing process, North and South, should include a truth and reconciliation commission where all the questions, no matter how difficult, can be raised and all the answers given.  It appeared at the weekend that we have new converts to the cause of truth and reconciliation.  We should attempt to put in place such a mechanism as we know it worked very well in South Africa.  We have a different problem and different requirements, but too many bodies remain unaccounted for and too <Col N="723"/>many families cannot mourn their loved ones because they cannot find the bodies to bury.  While these questions remain unanswered, there is a duty on us to try to bring some degree of closure.  I am not saying a truth and reconciliation would solve all the problems, but it would be a step in the right direction.  We should consider all these issues in a balanced fashion.  On the day I ask the Government to pressurise the British Government to act more openly on the Pat Finucane case, equally I want us to contemplate a truth and reconciliation commission to ask the hard questions which remain to be posed.</P>

I commend Senator Bacik and the Carers Association for their fantastic presentation this morning.  I ask the Senator to intervene with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the question the carers raised about the loss of electricity units.  How come these have been lost?  They should be reinstated.</P>
        <P>Very much pressing this morning is the European scenario.  When the first and second Lisbon treaties were being peddled by all the major parties in the State, we were told about a Europe of equals.  Is it a Europe of equals as long as we are equal to France and Germany?  That would appear to be the case.  President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel met over the weekend to come to some kind of arrangement.  Where is the Europe of equals?  Are we not supposed to have all member states sitting around the table making decisions, or do we leave it to France and Germany, which tell us afterwards what is happening?  President Barroso is announcing a new policy initiative today in Brussels and is to come tomorrow to the Taoiseach to tell him what is to happen.  Is that the Europe of equals we were promised?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Government representatives seem to be at sixes and sevens on this issue.  The Germans have suggested that there needs to be a third Lisbon treaty, whereas the Taoiseach&rsquo;s stated aim is that we should regain sovereignty.  He said we do not need a treaty.  The Minister of State responsible for European affairs, Deputy Creighton, said she would consider a treaty whereas the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, told us we would not need a treaty and that whateverchanges would be required under Lisbon 3 would be brought in surreptitiously through some legislation.</P>

Is there to be a third Lisbon treaty?  Is one being proposed?  Where does the Government stand on the question of trying to regain our economic sovereignty from the European Union?  Are we always to be at the beck and call of France and Germany, or are we to stand <Col N="724"/>up for our national interests, as the Slovakians seem to have done last night?  We call for a debate on these issues because they are really the pertinent issues of the day.</P>

	<P>I join Senator Kathryn Reilly in requesting the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House to discuss the amalgamation of VECs and, in particular, the criteria used to decide on the location of the headquarters of the newly amalgamated VECs.  It will be very interesting to hear the criteria the Minister used to decide on the locations.  What savings, if any, will be made on foot of the amalgamations?  From information I have gleaned, I believe it will cost rather than save money to amalgamate the VECs.</P>
        <P>I will ask the Minister to reassure the staff in the VECs concerned that their jobs are secure and that nobody will be forced to move from their present location.  Cavan and Monaghan VECs have been amalgamated and the headquarters is to be located in Monaghan town.  While I welcome this on behalf of my constituents in Monaghan, I draw attention to the fact that Cavan town has a new purpose-built, fully fitted VEC office that is capable of accommodating twice as many staff as are currently located there.  The office in Monaghan is much older and basing the headquarters there will necessitate the building of new premises.  What savings will be made?  I suggest to the Minister that a new location halfway between Cavan and Monaghan, at Cootehill, could be considered.  I very much welcome the fact that Senator Reilly raised this issue yesterday.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Quinn, to the House as a matter of urgency.</P>

	<P>It can only be helpful to our deliberations to have all diverse views put forward.  Perhaps the CPP would again consider this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I compliment Senator Zappone on her very graphic contribution this morning on impaired hearing and on her desire that all Members of this House should play a full  and meaningful role.  The Senator has done a service not just to the operation of the Oireachtas but to all those people who have impaired hearing.  If one recalls the taboo that was once attached to disability, one can now see how ridiculous it was.  Society has moved forward and has become much more mature in this regard.  The points made by Senator Zappone are worthy of much broader consideration.  I ask the Leader to arrange, with the appropriate Oireachtas committee, or as part of the new consultative process we are considering, for Senator Zappone to be invited to one of the meetings, with other Members who have an interest in this area.  Those interests are very wide and deep.</P>
        <P>To some extent, there is still a stigma, or a perceived stigma, attached to some disabilities.  This is certainly true regarding impaired hearing.  I hope this matter will not be allowed to slide away to the sidelines.  We have an opportunity based on the research Senator Zappone has done and on her graphic contribution this morning.  Let it not pass without our availing of it.  There are opportunities within the committee structure to do as proposed.  If so, the Seanad will be to the fore in taking a stand on this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>

On a number of occasions, I have referred to the laundering of diesel, the loss of revenue owing to cigarette smuggling, cross-Border illegal activities and VAT scams.  Many people, such as Senator Landy, experience great losses and damage to their property and vehicles, and this needs to be tackled as a matter of urgency.  If the agents of the State are under-resourced and incapable of tackling the problem, we have a serious issue on our hands.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to facilitate, at the earliest possible date, a discussion with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the opportunities presented in respect of social enterprise.  I was at a presentation this morning at the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education.  Many people do not realise that there are great economic benefits in developing this area further.  The area employs 100,000 people with a turnover of &euro;5 billion.  It is an untapped opportunity at a time when every politician aspires to see job creation maximised.  I refer to a small organisation that operates in County Galway.  Roscommon Home Services operates in Galway, Roscommon and Mayo.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I too welcome the impending release of Gilad Shalit.  In recent years all sides of the House have called for his release because of the great burden it placed on his family and the fact that there is impending peace in the Middle East.  As my colleague, Senator Leyden, suggested, I hope this is a step in the right direction.  It is difficult to understand how <Col N="726"/>the Palestinian people can call for justice for themselves when they would not afford the basic rules of the treatment of prisoners to Gilad Shalit.  He was not allowed to receive letters or parcels from his family and he was not allowed to receive visits from the International Red Cross and the Red Crescent Movement.  It does the Palestinian cause no service when those involved treat a prisoner in such a way.  We welcome his impending release.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday I spoke about the eurozone and Angela Merkel and Monsieur Sarkozy.  There was a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> today on the eurozone.  It was signed by 100 people from the eurozone, including ten former presidents, ten ministers for foreign affairs and five former finance ministers.  It included only one Irish signatory, a man who spent most of his adult life in the United Kingdom, Lord Haskins.  Three countries from the eurozone had no representative signature on the letter, Estonia, Latvia and Malta.  One half of the 100 signatories were not from the 17 countries in the eurozone.  Basically, they suggested that Ireland and other eurozone countries should sign over the running of their finances to the Germans.

        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Brien and several other Senators raised the question of illegal diesel.  The matter was raised by Senators Landy, Mullins and others and it is a serious problem.  If, as Senator Landy has stated, the Customs Service needs more sophisticated equipment to detect and prove the case, it should be provided.  All necessary equipment should be provided for the Customs Service and the Garda to root out the scourge of illegal diesel in our society.  It is an all-Ireland problem, caused by subversives in many cases, and it must be stamped out.  At a time when we need finance, it is costing the Exchequer large amounts of money.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik called for a debate on the Keane report and housing in general and on the &euro;500 million on rental subsidy which is paid annually.  We have requested the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, to come to the House to discuss these items and I hope he will be with us soon.</P>
        <P>Senator Zappone referred to the loop system.  Anything that can assist Members in the performance of their duties should be supported in the House and I thank the Senator for raising this important point.  Several Members have hearing difficulties in the House and the same applies in the other House.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter with me and I am satisfied that the system will be in place soon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn commented on the issue of carbon monoxide detectors.  I will raise the matter with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  He will be here later to speak on local government, a topic on which many other Senators have requested a debate.  The Senator's suggestion that detectors should be put in all new homes should be taken up by the Minister and we will raise the matter with him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Leyden and Daly remarked on the exchange of prisoners between Palestine and Israel.  I have asked the T&aacute;naiste to come to the House.  He has a busy schedule but he has promised that he will come as soon as possible and we can hold a debate with him on this and many other items related to foreign affairs.  I hope the exchange of prisoners will be a new beginning and that it will bring the parties to the negotiating table.  This is what everyone seeks and I hope it will take place soon.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator Gilroy referred to the fair deal scheme and the National Treatment Purchase Fund entering into contracts with certain nursing homes that are costing the State over and above what other nursing home contracts cost.  The Minister for Health will be in the House on 27 October.  As far as I know, I have not yet received written questions from anyone who wishes to table questions to the Minister for that date but I would welcome questions in that regard.  Senator Gilroy&rsquo;s question is a fair one and should be addressed to the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Cullinane commented on speaking time.  I do not wish to get into it too much but Sinn F&eacute;in has three Members and the party is not a group.  Those in the party have been facilitated on many occasions.  They have the power to ask three questions and were they present, each could ask questions on various items.  No precedent was set in the case of the Minister for Finance and the other Minister who was here.  We have given time to the Sinn F&eacute;in group on some occasions.  I am keen to be inclusive and have been.  We gave the Sinn F&eacute;in Members Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; time to speak last week.  I have been more than fair and inclusive and will continue to be so in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Donovan raised the flooding in Skibbereen and Bandon, including the problems with insurance and the possibility of a universal insurance system.  Many families found themselves in devastating circumstances, not only in Skibbereen and Bandon but throughout the country.  I will inquire of the relevant Minister whether it is possible to introduce such an insurance system before reverting to the Senator.</P><Col N="728"/>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Keeffe and MacSharry referred to farm payments.  I understand that 75% of disadvantaged area payments have been made and a commitment has been given to make further payments by the end of the year.  Single farm payments, which will amount to between &euro;1.2 billion and &euro;1.3 billion, will commence in the middle of October, with the objective of having 99% of payments made by the end of the year.  It should be noted that the payments commencing in October are advance payments, which places Ireland well ahead of many of our European counterparts in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Coughlan raised the problems we are experiencing with obesity, an issue which Senator Crown and other Senators also raised in recent weeks.  I would welcome a report from the Senator to the House on this issue.  Perhaps it would also be possible to have some form of presentation or seminar in a venue such as the audio-visual room.  I am sure all Senators would welcome a report on this issue.  I will endeavour to have the two relevant Ministers come to the House for a debate if such a report is furnished to us.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke raised links between businesses and schools in Cork, which take the form of a mentoring system.  This is a good idea which should be raised with the Minister for Education and Skills when he comes to the House in early November.  I note the comments of Senator Crown on the former judge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Landy made a number of points on illegal diesel and raised the issue of the theft of telephone cables.  While the latter issue is new to me, it certainly should be brought to the attention of the Minister.  If the Senator has any difficulty in doing so, he may contact my office and we will progress the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator MacSharry raised the issue of local government funding.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, will be before the House for the debate on the dormant accounts fund and we will also debate local government funding, structures and so forth on 9 November.  Many Senators have raised such matters in recent weeks.  I understand the Minister has come before the House on several occasions.  I thank him for his co-operation and agreeing to come to the House again on 9 November to discuss these matters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bradford raised the issue of an inquiry into the death of Pat Finucane.  The Taoiseach made a clear statement on this matter in the other House yesterday.  There is all-party agreement that there should be an inquiry into the death of Mr. Finucane.  I understand the T&aacute;naiste will meet the Finucane family for discussions, following which the Government will decide on the next step.  The Government agrees there should be an inquiry into Mr. Finucane&rsquo;s death, as the Taoiseach has made clear.  I hope that arising from the outcome of the meeting with the Finucane family, we will be able to progress the matter with the British Government.  Senator Bradford also raised the issue of a truth and reconciliation commission.  I will ascertain from the Government what the position is in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Daly referred to our relationship with the European Union.  The Government&rsquo;s aim is to regain our economic sovereignty.  Its position is that it will continue to try to achieve this objective in the years ahead and I believe it will succeed in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Wilson referred to Senator Reilly&rsquo;s call yesterday for a debate on decisions regarding the location of headquarters of vocational education committees.  I agreed yesterday that the manner in which VECs were notified of the decisions was unacceptable.  I referred yesterday to the position in Waterford and indicated my unhappiness with the position regarding the VEC headquarters in the region.  Senators will be able to raise the issue with the Minister for Education and Skills when he comes before us in early November to have a debate and take questions and answers.</P><Col N="729"/>
        <P>Senator Mullins referred to the need to advance job creation in the area of social enterprise.  I fully concur with him that this issue should be investigated with a view to creating further jobs in communities nationwide.  We will have the relevant Ministers in the House.</P>

        <P LI="1" Just="Left">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann is keenly aware that Ireland was required, under the 2007 EU Universal Services Directive, to make &lsquo;every effort&rsquo; to ensure that the 116000 Missing Children Hotline, already operational in 16 EU Member States, was reserved and operational by 25th May 2011 and that while ComReg has made the 116000 number available the service is not yet operational.  This House calls on the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Justice and Equality and Defence to inform the House of a definitive plan for putting the Missing Children Hotline into operation with adequate and proper funding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for tabling this motion and welcome the opportunity to discuss with them the issue of the 116000 hotline.  I also acknowledge the keen interest and commitment of many Members of the House on this matter.</P>
        <P>The issue of missing children is understandably an emotive one.  I hope, in my contribution, to begin to unpick what is envisaged in the missing children hotline service, outline the services already in place and provide the House with an understanding of the extent to which missing children is an issue in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will address immediately the main objective of the motion before the House, namely, to seek a definitive plan for putting the 116000 missing children hotline into operation.  I am pleased to accept the motion.  My new Department has a large number of priorities, the first of which is to address the significant challenges facing the State&rsquo;s child protection and welfare services.  My new Department has a large number of priorities at the moment, the first of which is to address the significant challenges facing our State&rsquo;s child protection and welfare services.  Senators will be well aware of these challenges which we must address at a time of significant financial constraint.  Nonetheless, in the context of other challenges, the priority I have attached to the establishment of the 116000 hotline is only right.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The decision of the Taoiseach to establish for the first time a senior Ministry and full Department of Children and Youth Affairs was designed to bring added value to the Government&rsquo;s approach to children&rsquo;s issues.  The fresh impetus brought by a new Department to take on the <Col N="730"/>co-ordination of this development is resulting in long-awaited progress.  Since its establishment in June my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Justice and Equality, has embarked on a preliminary scoping of the many issues involved in establishing this hotline.  This week I brought a memo to the Cabinet on the next steps to be taken in establishing the hotline.  Today I can advise the House that a new project team is being established, with representation from both Departments and from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ComReg.  This team will examine how best to set up the hotline in the context of the demand for the service, and by establishing the extent to which existing Government funded services, including the Garda and victim support services, can be mobilised to meet Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to the hotline.  I share the concern of the House that this should happen as soon as possible and I therefore hope, subject to identifying the appropriate partnerships and funding, that both my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality can support the establishment of the 116000 hotline during 2012.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to note that the incidence of children who go missing in Ireland is, fortunately, low and numbers have fallen significantly in recent years.  Up-to-date statistics provided for me by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicate there are five open cases of children who went missing in Ireland in 2010.  The reduction in the number of the children going missing is itself a tremendous achievement, and full credit and recognition should go to all who worked to effect such an impressive improvement in these figures.  However, five children missing are still five too many.  One child missing is one child too many.  For a parent, the very idea of a child going missing is frightening.  If the panic a parent feels when a young child is momentarily out of sight is magnified to that felt when a child is deemed officially lost, the situation is almost too terrifying to contemplate or understand.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the first instance and ideally, every effort must be made to ensure a child does not go missing.  The skills and mechanisms a child needs to stay safe are first taught in the home.  Common simple messages abound and are reiterated to young children all the time: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to strangers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stay there and don&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go where I can&rsquo;t see you.&rdquo;  We have all been through this.  When children enter primary school, they encounter the Stay Safe programme which I have always supported, as have many Members of this House.  This programme teaches children preventative measures, while preserving their sense of the world around them as a basically safe and secure place.  This approach allows children to exercise control and be assertive and enables them to seek help for any problem they may encounter.</P>
        <P>In spite of all this, unfortunately, children occasionally go missing, whether this happens through running away,economic migration, or abduction.  This leads us to the need for clarity around definitions for children who are missing.  It is common across EU member states to accept that a key factor in any definition relating to a missing person is that the person&rsquo;s whereabouts are unknown.  There are many variations and additions on this theme but most definitions are focused on providing law enforcement with an effective threshold for intervention rather than being child centred, with a focus on the needs of the child.  The two can go hand in hand.  This issue of definition is one that requires more investigation in the Irish context as we, too, have tended to look at the establishment of the 116000 hotline in a way that is not necessarily child focused.  It may be of assistance to the House to outline the categories of children who may come within the definition of missing children.  It will help give a sense of which children we are talking about, and the extent to which the necessary services are already in place, to deal with the issues involved.</P>
        <P>I shall go through the different groups of concern.  One category of missing children are those who go missing from HSE care and I shall outline what happens in that situation.  The HSE operates a joint missing in care protocol with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which sets out an agreed <Col N="731"/>procedure between the two agencies and clarifies the roles and requirements of both in regard to all children missing from their care placements, as set out in the Child Care Act 1991.  Many of the cases that are reported refer to a child who is late going back to care, perhaps by some three or four hours.  People have to make a sensible decision based on the previous history and circumstances around the child and consider at which point they should report to the Garda.  Obviously, people err on the side of caution.  A missing child from care is one whose whereabouts are unknown and the circumstances of whose disappearance are such that the Health Service Executive or its agents assess the absence as high risk.  The agreed joint national protocol on children who go missing from care should improve interagency co-operation in regard to these vulnerable children.</P>
        <P>A second category that has received much attention in this country is that of unaccompanied minors who go missing after they enter the State.  It is important to state that this phenomenon is not unique to Ireland.  The issue is a complex one and at times the treatment of this issue has been over-simplified.  There have been positive developments in this area which highlight the positive outcomes of interagency co-operation.  To tackle this serious problem, the HSE developed a strong working relationship with the Garda National Immigration Bureau in regard to missing children.  As many Senators will know, the level of interagency co-operation between the HSE and the GNIB has been consistently high and was rightly intensified in the face of the increase in missing children that presented in late 2008 and early 2009.</P>
        <P>Following a series of intensive meetings which took place last year between HSE management and the GNIB and local garda&iacute; &mdash; to which I referred when responding in this House to the rapporteur&rsquo;s report &mdash; the joint national protocol on children who go missing from care agreed between the Garda and the HSE was adapted in terms of application to unaccompanied minors who go missing.  A series of collaborative measures was put in place which built on previous developments and resulted in improved outcomes in 2009.  There were several surveillance operations with the collaboration of HSE staff and many children who had been reported missing were successfully tracked.  As a result, there has been a decline in the number of unaccompanied minors presenting and remaining missing.  The figure for 2010 was 11, down from 27 in 2009 and from a high of 81 in 2001.  This is the welcome result of intensive interagency efforts throughout that year.  There has clearly been a change in the numbers coming into the country in general which will account in part for those figures.  It should be noted that these children make up the bulk of the children who are classified as still missing and the majority of these were near the age of 18 when they were reported missing.  Many were 17 years of age but this is still a cause of concern.  One asks what has happened to these young people but there may be a range of explanations.  The Garda and the HSE take every incident of missing children extremely seriously and are committed to ensuring that vulnerable children are not exploited or ill-treated.  We know that internationally there are serious concerns about the exploitation of young people, whether they are aged 17 or 15.  It is a serious issue.</P>
        <P>Another area of concern in any discussion about missing children is that of child abduction related to family disputes, a third category of children who may be reported missing.  The Central Authority for Child Abduction was established on foot of the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act 1991.  This Act gave the force of law in Ireland to the Hague and Luxembourg conventions on child abduction.  The purpose of these conventions is to facilitate the return of children who have been taken from one contracting state to another against the wishes of a parent with custody rights.  The Department of Justice and Equality currently acts as the central authority in Ireland on international child abduction.  The Irish central authority processed a total of 233 cases in 2010 &mdash; a large number.  Of these, 140 were new cases, four more than in 2009, while 93 were ongoing cases carried over from 2009.  Of the <Col N="732"/>140 new cases involving 193 children, 64 concerned abductions into the State from other countries while 76 concerned abductions from the State to other countries.</P>
        <P>Of the 93 cases still active from the previous year, 53 were incoming and 40 outgoing.  During 2010, therefore, a total of 117 incoming cases and 116 outgoing cases were being processed by the Irish Central Authority for Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters in liaison with the other national central authorities involved.  Senators will appreciate that there are many families and children involved and that a great deal of inter-country and inter-agency work is required in order to discover precisely what is happening in respect of such children.  Major issues arise in the context of provididng support for the families and children involved.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have no doubt that the availability of an EU-wide 116000 hotline, operational in Ireland, would be of assistance to those affected.  When a child goes missing, support mechanisms are very important.  The Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime was established in 2005.  This is an independent body which operates under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality.  In the past five years the commission has allocated &euro;7.3 million in funding to over 50 non-governmental organisations, NGOs, which support the victims of crime.  Superb work is being done by the organisations to which I refer.  I examined the position on where this money is being allocated and I am aware that superb work is being done throughout the country by the organisations and NGOs which work with the victims of crime.</P>
        <P>One of the agencies for which the commission has provided funding is Missing in Ireland Support Services Limited, a registered charity which provides emotional and other forms of practical support for the families and friends of those who have gone missing in or from Ireland.  This is achieved through the provision of an existing national missing persons helpline, a website with profiles of the missing and a Facebook presence on the Internet.  The existing helpline to which I refer co-operates with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and community-based organisations and works to ensure there is a national, co-ordinated approach to the location of missing persons, to reduce the incidence and impact of missing persons and educate the broader community in respect of missing persons.</P>
        <P>While support and services for the families of missing children are vital, the first action which should be taken when a child goes missing is to alert the local police.  Obviously, in the case of a child who goes missing in Ireland, this is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The investigation of a child&rsquo;s disappearance is the responsibility of the Garda and its structures in this regard include not just local garda&iacute; who will have primary responsibility for the investigation but also the Missing Persons Bureau.  I am sure Senators will agree that it is of paramount importance that any arrangements which are put in place to establish the 116000 hotline in Ireland do not compromise the requirement that the first and most important contact to be made is to notify the Garda of the fact that a child is missing in order that an investigation can commence without delay.</P>
        <P>The 116 numbers are freefone numbers to be used throughout Europe in situations of need or distress.  If a person has a problem when travelling abroad in Europe, he or she need only remember one number instead of several.  In February 2007 the European Commission adopted a decision requiring member states to reserve the 116000 number for missing children hotlines across the Union.  The revision of the telecoms package adopted in November 2009 and, in particular, Article 27a which, I do not doubt, is what the relevant Senators were referring to when they tabled the motion, inserted a new requirement on member states to &ldquo;make every effort to ensure that citizens have access to a service operating a hotline to report cases of missing children.  The hotline shall be available on the number 116000&rdquo;.  At this stage member states are expected to &ldquo;make every effort&rdquo; to act on it.  However, in a communication last <Col N="733"/>November, the Commission stated that &ldquo;if no further progress is made within a reasonable timeframe, the Commission will consider presenting a legislative proposal&rdquo;.  I hope that will not be necessary.</P>
        <P>The allocation of specific numbers in the 116 number range in Ireland is managed by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  I will not trouble the House with the details, but Senators will be familiar with the 116 numbers that have already been allocated.  In essence, the purpose of the 116000 phone number is to provide a contact number for families if children go missing.  ComReg advertised the availability of and invited applications for the 116000 number in Ireland on four separate occasions during the past four years.  It has advised that to date no organisation has applied for the missing children hotline number.  It is clear that significant financial issues for the relevant organisations are involved.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the hotline is a cross-sectoral issue which involves a number of Departments and agencies.  My Department has had a number of preliminary meetings in recent months with representatives from the Departments of Health, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Justice and Equality, the HSE and ComReg.  We have also been in contact with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, representatives from which will also be involved in the discussions on this matter.  In order to progress the matter, it will be necessary to co-ordinate the activities of these Departments and agencies to ensure the 116000 hotline is established in the most effective and efficient manner.  Earlier this year I met representatives from some NGOs which are eager to assist in the establishment of the hotline.  These organisations have already done some work on the process.  Across Europe, NGOs have made a contribution to the running of the hotline and the project team being established will examine if NGOs in Ireland can add value to the scheme.  While the introduction of a missing children&rsquo;s hotline involves, as stated, many Departments, I reiterate that the investigation of incidences of missing child is primarily a matter for the Garda.  I have, therefore, been in contact with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, in the context of discovering whether we can jointly achieve the establishment of this service.</P>
        <P>We are all too well aware of the fact that we live in financially challenging times.  Initial costings have been made, including by interested NGOs, for the provision of a hotline service.  We want to take the most cost-effective approach to establishing the service.  I am acutely aware than many Irish NGOs which run similar hotlines and telephone counselling services are struggling to meet the costs involved.  The Commission noted in its communication of last November that the running and telecoms costs which could arise in setting up and servicing a 116 EU-wide hotline could act as a barrier to implementation.  We must, therefore, give careful consideration to this matter.</P>
        <P>We have carried out an initial scoping exercise of the issues involved and the project team which will include representatives from my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ComReg is being established.  We will examine how best to operationalise the hotline in the context of the demand for the service.  I have outlined the figures involved for the latter and there is no doubt that some discussion is required in respect of them.  It is fortunate that there has been a reduction in the figures in certain areas in recent years.  We need to establish the extent to which services, including Garda and victim support services, which are already in existence and in receipt of Government funding can be mobilised to meet Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the hotline.</P>
        <P>As stated, it is my hope, subject to identifying the appropriate partnership and funding, that both my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality can support the establishment of the 116000 hotline during 2012.  I thank Senator Cummins and his colleagues for tabling <Col N="734"/>the motion and giving me the opportunity to outline the position on these important matters to the House.  I thank Senators for their attention and look forward to their contributions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend a very warm welcome to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on her return to the House in which she previously served.  All Members of the Seanad were involved in the tabling of this joint motion, but I must commend Senator Jillian van Turnhout, in particular, for initiating the process relating to it.  I also commend the Minister who provided one of the most comprehensive responses I have ever heard to any motion tabled in the House.  It is obvious that she took the matter on board and her contribution was so good that I do not have anything to add.  She went to the Cabinet, explained the position to it and obtained its support.</P>
        <P>What is happening here today defines what the Seanad is about.  A Senator initiates a motion, carries out research, brings it to his or her colleagues in search of their support and, if such support is forthcoming, it is put to the line Minister.  The fundamental reason Deputy Fitzgerald was appointed Minister for Children and Youth Affairs was that she would have a dedicated responsibility in respect of the matters under discussion.  She has begun her work with great gusto and energy.  The issue which is the subject of this debate is extremely sensitive.  As the Minister outlined, however, if a child goes missing, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the first port of call in seeking assistance.  The 116000 number would not be required in such circumstances, but if it were in use, it would certainly add to the services already available.  The number would be of particular assistance to new entrants to the country because it would be easier for them to use it to contact the Garda.  It is a pan-European number.  It would be very useful if the European Union provided some support funding for this initiative.  It is fine to publish regulations and requirements for initiatives but rolling this out in 27 countries does not seem to be the most expensive action ever taken.  Anybody who has experienced a child missing for a few minutes on a beach would realise the panic that sets in when this happens.  Most families have experienced moments when children have been out of sight for a few minutes, and it is a terrifying experience.  This number will be very useful to families and young parents in particular.  They will know exactly what number to ring to contact appropriate authorities.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that a project team has been set up to consider this in great detail.  There is no point in having the 116000 number in place if the back-up does not exist to ensure that when a person rings the number, action will be taken.  There is no point having somebody at the end of the line who can give consolation but cannot act.  There is a cost involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also note the Department of Justice and Equality allocates money for support organisations of victims of crime, which is very welcome.  It is frightening to see the number of children involved.  One of the biggest problems now is children being abducted by a parent and being brought to a Middle Eastern state.  That is a serious act and I have noted some tragic cases where children, because of religious or other reasons, are abducted by a father or mother before being brought to a country that does not recognise extradition of individuals.  The Minister might examine the issue because there are some well known cases.  A former MEP and candidate for the presidency, Ms Mary Banotti, is an expert in this regard and we should recognise her contribution.  She has taken a particular interest in the issue and has helped hundreds of families, personally investigating the abduction of children.  She has supported and assisted the return of those children to the family home.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As was mentioned, it is important for people to explore this area and I hope the Minister&rsquo;s speech will get widespread coverage in the media.  It is useful and I know it will be on the departmental website.  The information in it is revealing from a statistical perspective and the Minister has gone into great detail.  I commend the motion to the House and thank the Minister <Col N="735"/>for accepting it in a comprehensive fashion.  Senator van Turnhout should be commended for initiating the motion, and that shows the benefits of our new Seanad with so many Members with expertise.  I am delighted to be associated with and support it.  I thank the Minister for her response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ImeldaHenry"><NameTxt>Senator Imelda Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House; she is a regular visitor and is always most welcome.  We are very lucky to have a full Cabinet Minister with responsibility for children and the various issues associated with the well-being of children and families.  We can finally put issues relating to children&rsquo;s welfare, safety and protection on political and social agendas.  We must ensure immediate and co-ordinated action can be taken whenever a child goes missing.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the 116000 telephone number is to provide a contact number for families of children who go missing, and the hotline will take calls on missing children, liaise with the Garda, provide a point of support and guidance for parents and family members of missing children and support ongoing investigations.  I know the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has recently met non-governmental organisations, NGOs, which are eager to assist in the establishment of the hotline and she is grateful for the work they have already put into this process.  I know that she is anxious to move this matter forward as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The Garda and the HSE take every incident of missing children extremely seriously and are committed to ensuring that any vulnerable children are not exploited or ill-treated as part of their responsibility to provide care for any children in the State who are deemed not to have appropriate or satisfactory care arrangements.  This includes separated children seeking asylum.  It is important to note that the input of the Garda is central to the issue of missing children and it has ultimate responsibility for the investigation of these matters.  The Garda and the HSE have worked closely in this regard in recent years and the HSE, as the major statutory child care authority in Ireland, recognised the value of an EU common hotline for missing children.  Access to a hotline telephone number can be of great assistance to parents when a child goes missing from home or while travelling in another European country.</P>
        <P>It is important to acknowledge the services available via some charitable organisations and others.  The national missing persons hotline, in association with the Garda, works very well, and working with the agencies is important.  The Minister has stated that one child missing is one too many but it is astonishing to hear the figures for child abduction, with 117 incoming and 116 outgoing.  This issue must be very challenging for the relevant authorities.</P>
        <P>Whereas the introduction of a missing children&rsquo;s hotline involves many Departments, the notification of a missing child is particularly a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I understand that the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, are jointly seeking to achieve the establishment of this service.  Different costings for such a service have been calculated, including by NGOs interested in providing the service.  In the current financial climate, it is essential that the most economical approach possible is taken to providing any service.  The Minister hopes a partnership approach will achieve a cost-effective solution to the implementation of this important initiative.  I know we are in unprecedented times economically and budgets are tight but this EU co-ordinated hotline for missing children must be given priority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and her detailed summary of the current position.  My involvement goes back to 2007 to 2009 in the European Parliament, when this issue arose on a number of occasions.  I note that to date 16 countries have signed up to the initiative and have the helpline in operation.  Funding is an issue to the fore in dealing with any new service but it is interesting that in some countries the telecoms operator is providing the fund<Col N="736"/>ing.  I wonder if that avenue could be considered.  In some countries there is a public private partnership and in others it is fully publicly funded.</P>
        <P>It is particularly important to set up the helpline because more people are travelling between countries within the European Union.  It is essential that it be established.  The European Union set up the RAPEX system to identify defects in toys for children in a very short time.  If a defective item is identified in toys in Ireland, the other 26 member states must be notified immediately.  This initiative is just as important if not more so and I urge that everything be done to set it up as early as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for coming before the House and accepting the motion.  I also thank her for the detailed statement.  I wanted to hear that the hotline would go into operation without delay but I accept the Minister&rsquo;s integrity and the proposals laid before us.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">I welcome that and will obviously monitor it.  As the Minister said, this dates back to a decision of the European Commission in February 2007 requiring member states to reserve a six digit number range starting with 116 for the harmonisation of access to services of social value in the European Union.  This decision was based on reason and pragmatism, which I fully commend.</P>
        <P>This line is critical for the parent of a missing child and for a child who is scared and vulnerable having run away from home or for a person who finds himself or herself outside his or her home country and is in dire need of help having been smuggled or trafficked into Ireland.  It is also critical for someone who has been abducted by perhaps one of their own parents to know there is a number he or she can call day or night to find assistance, support and guidance.</P>
        <P>This was the rationale behind the European 116000 missing children hotline.  It was part the EU strategy on the rights of the child, which recognises that every missing child is, as the Minister said, a tragedy and that member states have not only a legal obligation but a moral one to implement whatever measures are necessary to prevent such tragedies.</P>
        <P>The service is currently operating in 16 EU member states.  A parent, guardian, professional, concerned member of the public or child who lives in Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungry, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain and the United Kingdom can call this missing children hotline on a 24-hour basis.</P>
        <P>The value of the missing children hotline, in particular in the context of increasing cases of cross-border child disappearances, is exemplified by a recent cross-border parental abduction case.  In Belgium, a father took his daughters aged seven, ten and 14 and hid them for nine and a half months in very poor and dangerous conditions.  In September 2008, following a request from the Belgian and Portuguese missing children hotlines, the evening news on Portuguese television opened with an appeal for information about these missing children and concluded by showing the 116000 missing children hotline number on screen.  Minutes after the broadcast, the case was resolved.  That is the power of this line.  This shows the real and urgent need to establish a systematic exchange of information, standardised operational procedures and increased cross-border co-operation to resolve cross-border cases of missing children in the EU.</P>
        <P>It is a sad indictment of the priority afforded to the safety and well-being of children in the EU that there are still 11 member states in which the missing children hotline is still not operational.  European Commission Vice President and Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship, Viviane Reding, recently commentated that:</P><Col N="737"/>
        <P LI="1">It is hard to come to terms with the fact that measures that could help are not yet fully operational across the Union.  It would be a double tragedy to imagine a missing child trying to call the 116000 hotline only to hear an answering machine playing a prerecorded message announcing that the service will be operational in 2012.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Unfortunately, this has been the case in Ireland.</P>
        <P>When preparing for today&rsquo;s debate, I decided to dial 116000 and I got the following message:</P>
        <P LI="1">We are sorry but we cannot connect your call because the number you have dialled is not in service.  Please check the number you have dialled and try again.</P>
        <P FLI="0">What about those children from the 16 member states who are aware of this line?  We have a border with the United Kingdom but what happens if children from the United Kingdom are here and they telephone that number and get that message?</P>
        <P>It was against that backdrop and following the interventions of a number of Senators, notably, Senators Daly and Quinn, that I worked over the summer to co-ordinate and seek the approval of my fellow Senators for their support for this motion.  As Senator Leyden said, the Seanad is about us working together and not just raising issues but seeing how we can make a difference and put things in place.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the situation of runaways and children in the care of the State.  This line has been proved in other EU member states to be a safe contact point for these missing children to be able to telephone.  They do not wish to telephone the Garda or the HSE.  By using this line, perhaps we could save resources for the Garda and the HSE and know a child is safe and try to reconcile the difficulties.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that five missing children was too many but I was disappointed when she updated us on the situation in regard to unaccompanied minors.  She informed us that 11 of those children from 2010 are still missing.  For me a child is a child and his or her status is of secondary importance.  For me, there are 16 children from 2010 still missing and cases are still open.  That is the accurate figure.</P>
        <P>The Minister outlined the importance of the statutory agencies working together.  They are doing some invaluable work but the line for me is about children and parents having easy access to those services and to give them a voice.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned that ComReg has advertised the line four times but there have been no applications.  I should note that a non-governmental organisation has submitted two funding proposals over the past few years to Government seeking funding in order to be able to apply for the line.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that the Cabinet gave her memorandum time, that it will be put into operation and that the Departments of Justice and Equality and Children and Youth Affairs, the Garda and ComReg will work together on a project team.  I urge her to follow the lead of 13 of the 16 member states in which the service is operational by assigning the number to a member of Missing Children Europe because it has built up the links and the contact points.</P>
        <P>I noted my colleague, Senator Henry, spoke about cost-effectiveness but we also need to ensure there are minimum quality standards and a practical guide for hotline providers to ensure the hotlines operating throughout Europe are run professionally, efficiently and effectively and meet the European standards for best practice for service requirements.</P>
        <P>The Seanad will not go away.  People may talk about its abolition but we will monitor this to ensure it is implemented in full.  We will work with the Minister to do what we can.  We want <Col N="738"/>to see that Ireland moves from being good on paper when it comes to the rights of the child to being good in operation and implementation and that we uphold those rights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank her for accepting the motion tabled by the Seanad.  Obviously, there are a number of very significant caveats to the Minister&rsquo;s acceptance of the motion, to which I will return.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of Senators mentioned that this 116000 number initiative arose out of a 2007 EU initiative; therefore,  it behoves us to mention that is almost five years ago.  It is a national disgrace that Ireland has been so slow to act in this matter, in particular given that in 2007, funding was not the critical issue it is today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This measure has been implemented in 16 European countries.  Ireland is not alone in being slow to act.  In other countries, disputes in government, telephone companies, NGOs, operators of the service and, in particular, funding have been considerations.  However, it is important to note that on a number of occasions, the European Commission has offered its services to countries which have not put in place the 116000 missing children helpline and has offered to share the experience of other countries which have been successful in putting the number together.  It is important for us to acknowledge that in not actioning this missing child helpline number, we have failed not only our own people but in our obligations to others as well.</P>
        <P>By its very nature, the problem of child abduction and child trafficking is one that spreads across borders.  Ireland is not immune to this purely because it is an island.  We have a Border with Northern Ireland.  In my children&rsquo;s school in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area, there were two attempted abductions.  There are many reasons children go missing and there is no doubt that, irrespective of the numbers, which may be in dispute, it is a very significant matter.</P>
        <P>I refer to some of the Minister&rsquo;s statistics.  She mentioned the progress made in regard to unaccompanied minors in Ireland.  I note that more than 513 unaccompanied children who came to Ireland seeking asylum without a parent or guardian, have gone missing from the care of the State since 2000.  I accept what the Minister said in that these numbers have dropped significantly but the fact remains that 440 of those 513 children who disappeared from the care of the State between 2000 and 2010 have never been found.</P>
        <P>The unfortunate truth is that child trafficking is the third largest international crime and child trafficking for sexual exploitation accounts for 79% of all trafficking.  While we have made progress, we should not pat ourselves on the back with too much fervour.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment but I am concerned about the caveats that surround it.  She intends to establish a new project team but I would like a definite commitment on when this will be done.  She further noted that the 116 number would be set up &ldquo;subject to identifying the appropriate partnerships and funding&rdquo;.  One of the reasons the number is not yet up and running has been precisely the failure to identify appropriate partnerships.  There has been too much emphasis on identifying a suitable NGO to operate the service.  As someone who comes from the NGO sector I believe there is too much expectation on the part of the State generally that NGOs will fulfil these functions, particularly when resources are an issue.  In regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na number, which she mentioned on a number of occasions, why was the Garda not tasked with also setting up the 116 missing child helpline?</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the number is up and running, it will need to relate directly with the other 116 numbers, and particularly the Childline number.  If it is to be successful all arms of the State will need to communicate with each other.  The role of educators is particularly important in this regard.  It is critical that educators and children are made aware of the purpose of these numbers.</P><Col N="739"/>
        <P Just="Left">From a practical perspective, we need not only to investigate the finances of setting up the childline and missing child numbers but to ensure every school diary lists the numbers in order that all children have ready access to them.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s bone fides in giving us her commitment but, being a lawyer, I recognise caveats when I hear them.  Rather than phrases like &ldquo;subject to&rdquo;, &ldquo;under condition of&rdquo; and &ldquo;maybe 2012&rdquo;, this House would like to get a firm commitment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba bhre&aacute; liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire.  T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an m&eacute;id r&aacute;ite agus at&aacute; r&aacute;ite aici.  Chomh fada agus a th&eacute;ann s&iacute;, t&aacute; f&aacute;ilte le cur roimh an m&eacute;id sin.  Is maith an rud &eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist ag an Rialtas an l&iacute;ne chabhrach seo a chur ar bun.  T&aacute; g&eacute;argh&aacute; leis.  Chuala m&eacute; cad a d&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir van Turnhout &mdash; bh&iacute; an ceart ar fad aici faoi na h&aacute;bhair a chl&uacute;daigh s&iacute;.  I welcome the commitment given by the Minister in so far as it goes and I pay tribute to the people who maintained pressure on the Government to treat this issue with urgency.  I first heard about the issue from Mr. Tom Brown, who I note is in the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery for this debate.  It is important that we continue to listen to those who are most concerned about these issues.  Sometimes the political establishment can be slow to do what is needed unless the pressure to act is maintained.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister outlined, with certain caveats, what she intends to do.  It is welcome that she has brought a memorandum to the Cabinet and that a project team is to be established.  To sum up what she has said, she intends to do what she can to put the number in place in 2012.  However, a number of questions arise from her comments.  She referred to the need for the service to be financially sustainable.  I find that language rather unusual because I regard sustainability as meaning something must pay for itself.  That is what sustainability means when we speak about energy, for example.  We must acknowledge that the service will give rise to a cost irrespective of whether the State provides it directly or in partnership with an NGO.  While she is correct to draw our attention to the need to operate the service in the most cost effective manner, she also needs to describe the issues arising in a more focused way.  She did not go into detail on the costs that may be incurred.  If she is going to make a comprehensive statement on an issue such as this, she will have to try to set out what she thinks it will cost.  That is a basic requirement in addressing the issue at this early stage.  Perhaps she has figures in mind but is not prepared to share them because it is early days but it would be useful for us to hear her estimate.</P>
        <P>I did not clearly understand her comments on the position of NGOs.  She noted that no organisation applied for the missing child hotline number when ComReg invited applications but she also admitted that she has met NGOs which were eager to assist in the establishment of the hotline.  Perhaps she can join the dots by explaining how both these statements can be true.  What was preventing NGOs from applying for the mandate or licence to provide this service?</P>
        <P>Senator Hayden was correct to refer to what can be done in schools.  It is a question of helping people who are in a bad place in their own minds.  Children who go missing after entering the State and children who are abducted in the context of family disputes were mentioned.  It is important that a straightforward message is provided to those who are in vulnerable situations.  This is precisely why it is important that the same number applies across the EU.</P>
        <P>Everybody is familiar with the 999 number.  How would that interact with the hotline?  Would emergency service providers be in a position to connect callers with the hotline?</P>
        <P>As we have the Minister in the House, it is appropriate to ask for her response to a somewhat extraneous matter.  The Ombudsman for Children wants the legislation to be amended to provide for an independent complaints mechanism for two categories of children, namely, children who are in prison and separated children seeking asylum.  Yesterday she told the <Col N="740"/>Oireachtas Committee on Investigations, Oversight and Petitions that she was happy with her interaction with public bodies in cases involving these categories of children.  They had responded positively to her interventions and certain changes had ensued.  Nonetheless she is anxious that an independent complaints mechanism be established.  Perhaps the Minister will outline her views of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s aspiration in that regard.</P>
        <P>Gu&iacute;m gach rath ar an Aire agus &iacute; ag tabhairt faoi na hoibrithe t&aacute;bhachtacha seo.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam nach fada a n-imeoidh sula mbeidh an l&iacute;ne chabhrach in &uacute;s&aacute;id sa t&iacute;r seo.

	<P>I will refrain from repetition because much of what I intended to say has been said by others.  I thank the Minister for her contribution.  I thank Senator van Turnhout and the various groups, including my group, for supporting this motion.  This matter has been debated for so long that it is time for action to be taken on it.  That is what we are about here.  Nothing is more important for anybody than a child.  When a child goes missing, that is the most serious thing.  Obviously, it is a legal issue as well as an organisational one.</P>
        <P>EU legislation makes it mandatory for this hotline to be available in every member state.  It is not its availability that is the problem &mdash; it has been available in Ireland &mdash; but the take-up of its availability.  That is why the Minister has stepped in to say she has established a new project team comprising representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, various Departments and ComReg.  I hope the team will draw up some proposals and recommendations.  The Minister said this will happen in 2012.  Like Senator van Turnhout, I will keep an eye on this matter to ensure the 2012 deadline is met.  Regardless of what we do, there will be a cost.  If it were merely a question of putting in place a hotline and publicising a telephone number, that would have already been done by many of the organisations that deal with children.  There are additional costs, however.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  I recommend that we consider which aspects of this service could be provided by each of the organisations that are working with children at the moment.  At the end of the day, it will fall to the Garda to go looking for the missing children.  We do not want to establish various new quangos.  The aim of this Government is to reduce the number of quangos.  We have to support the organisations that are working in this area.  We support the Missing in Ireland Support Service, or MISS as it is known.  If MISS and other organisations were given additional support, they could have the capacity to take on certain aspects of the service.  All of the organisations dealing with children should be brought around the table and asked what they have to offer.  The service could then be co-ordinated centrally.</P>
        <P>In some European countries, this service is provided by community organisations that are co-ordinated by local or county authorities.  That might be the best way to proceed.  I would be the first person to say that an onus cannot be put on a local authority without back-up funding being provided.  The Minister should keep that in mind when she is considering the matter.  I compliment the 16 European countries that have put this service in place.  I hope the Minister will be back here in the not too distant future to give us details of the actual proposals and recommendations she is bringing on stream to put it in place here.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="741"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The fact that a senior Cabinet Minister has responsibility for children, for the first time, makes a statement that the protection of children is one of the Government&rsquo;s key priorities.  The Chair may recall that last July, I raised the question of the 116000 number on the Adjournment.  I got a very positive response from the Minister on that occasion.  Much of what was said on that occasion was incorporated in the speech the Minister made today.  I am delighted that a working group is to be established.  It is a tangible thing that can be done very quickly.  I hope this service will be rolled out in the early part of 2012, as opposed to the latter part of 2012.  Sixteen countries have started a service and there is no reason we cannot be the 17th country to do so.  The 116000 number is available.  As Senator Keane said, it has been reserved throughout the EU.  It is part of EU legislation.  It would link well with the 999 service and services like that provided by Childline.</P>
        <P>I suggest that the proper place for this service to be located is not with a non-governmental organisation.  I think it should be based within the structures of the State, for example, within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Perhaps it could be operated directly by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Too many things have been farmed out to non-governmental organisations.  We need to pull it back and run it within the State, where those responsible for it will be ultimately accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas as opposed to a non-governmental organisation.  I say that with all the best will in the world.  I wish the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, well in her endeavours and I look forward to receiving a progress report on the launch of this service in the early part of 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I commend Senator van Turnhout for tabling this motion in the first instance and seeking the support of all parties for it.  My party is very pleased to support and co-sponsor it.  A number of Senators have spoken about the need for the Government to vindicate the rights of children.  It is interesting that since I was elected to this House, we have had a number of discussions on children&rsquo;s issues.  The Minister was present for the recent discussion on the Cloyne report.  We have discussed children&rsquo;s rights on several occasions, most recently when Dr. Maurice Manning came to the House to speak about human and civil rights.</P>
        <P>Other Senators mentioned that the Minister is a former Member of this House and has been involved in politics for a long time.  Many fine speeches, motions and contributions have been made by people from all political parties.  When the time comes to deliver on children&rsquo;s rights in a range of areas, however, the system seems to suffer from inertia.  In such circumstances, it is easy to see why people get frustrated with the political system and with politics.  For some reason, the system has failed to prioritise the rights of children.  I do not believe these rights should be bartered for.  I do not believe we are being unreasonable in the requests we are making.</P>
        <P>It would be easy for the Government to ensure this hotline is established.  I accept that the Minister has given a commitment to examine the matter in 2012.  It was interesting to hear her say that no organisation has tendered for, or expressed an interest in, the provision of this service at this number.  I understand that the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has publicly expressed its interest in doing so, through the media and through official channels.  The problem is that it needs the resources and funds to provide the service.  It is not the case that these organisations are not willing or capable of providing a hotline service.  There are people and organisations that are ready to do so, but they need the funding.</P><Col N="742"/>
        <P>I welcome the commitment given by the Minister to establish a new project team and examine the funding of this project.  A previous speaker spoke about the funding issue.  Perhaps the Minister can respond on that issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister needs to examine the question of vetting and cross-Border issues.  When we debated the Cloyne report, it was mentioned that sex offenders have crossed the Border on occasions, unfortunately.  There is a need for an all-Ireland approach to ensure there is no hiding place for sex offenders in any part of Ireland.  The Border should not be seen as presenting an opportunity to those who seek to exploit children.</P>
        <P>As many of the points I wanted to make have been made, I will not repeat them.  It is important that the Minister does not merely acknowledge the sentiments of Senators.  This should not simply be another motion that is passed.  We should not be still talking about the same issues six months, 12 months or two years from now.</P>
        <P>This motion relates to the hotline, which we hope will be operational in 2012.  It should have been operational a long time ago.  The Minister cannot be held responsible for that.  She can make sure the line becomes operational on her watch.  I believe she will do so.  I hope she goes further and examines all of the many other issues, such as those relating to migrant children, people in direct provision centres and children from different backgrounds who go missing.</P>
        <P>The most important thing we can do is not agreeing a motion or speaking fine words, but vindicating of the rights and needs of children.  This is one of them.  I acknowledge the commitment the Minister has given today and the contributions of previous Senators, including Senator van Turnhout, who tabled this motion in the first instance.</P>

	<P>I extend a warm welcome to the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald.  I had the pleasure of working with her in another capacity in this House.  She has hit the ground running.  She has an active interest in child care.  As chairman of my local county child care committee, I am aware of the priorities the Minister has set since she took up her brief and the manner in which she has been carrying them out.  I wish her continued success in that regard.  I have had an interest in the issue of missing persons, children in particular, since I began my broadcasting career.  Given my close links with the Irish Diaspora during the years, I have had occasion to broadcast requests from families of missing persons and, in some instances, I am glad to say connections have been made.  That is the context in which I make my remarks.</P>
        <P>I have tried to parse the Minister&rsquo;s contribution in which she talks about setting up a team to examine how best to operationalise the hotline and refers regularly and correctly to the Garda in this regard.  I draw the attention of the House to the Report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate: Missing Persons Review and Recommendations of 2009, with which I am sure the Minister is familiar.  In 2009 there were 1,672 reports of missing persons and the number still missing in March that year was 123.  Obviously, in this instance we are talking about setting up a hotline to address the issue of missing children.  However, it is important to indicate &mdash; the Minister has touched on this question in the context of the individuals she will draw into the project team &mdash; that the report of the inspectorate reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">Unlike the scenes depicted in the media, locating a missing person is much more complicated than assembling a police squad, a team of volunteers, and a few well-trained search and rescue dogs.  In fact, the missing persons issue is extraordinarily complicated.  An investigation may span an urban or suburban neighbourhood, miles of rural countryside, or stretch across several nations and every possible type of transport.  It may involve multiple categories and subcategories of missing persons &ndash; from children to vulnerable adults, from those who <Col N="743"/>wish to remain missing [of course, this does not apply in the case of children] to those whose lives are endangered until they are found ... Throughout the course of this review, the Garda Inspectorate was struck by the complexity of the missing persons issue and the significant resources that are required to address cases effectively and compassionately.  The Inspectorate reached one stark conclusion early in its review &ndash; the police cannot address this complex challenge alone.  Coordination and communication are essential.  Strong partnerships are required, not only within the State but in the international arena as well.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister is attempting to draw all of these disparate forces together and I wish her well in that regard.  This highlights again the complexity of the issues involved.  It is important and positive that in setting up the project the Minister, from what I have read, is committed to being all-inclusive.</P>
        <P>A number of NGOs are doing excellent work.  One resource I use in my capacity as a broadcaster to the Irish Diaspora is <i>www.europeanirish.com</i>, the website of an NGO run by a gentleman in Cork which incorporates a number of missing persons agencies which use the website as a link for those who wish to contact them.  I am aware of at least three agencies operating in this way.  I have no doubt that the Minister, given her reference to NGOs, and her Department are aware of these agencies which are doing a very positive job with very limited resources, for which I commend them.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator Jillian van Turnhout for bringing forward the motion.  The Minister has made it clear that in spite of or despite our efforts, ultimately, money will raise its somewhat ugly head in this regard.  While it seems it will be an expensive operation, I hope the Minister, in her usual direct way, will ensure whatever money is available is given to this exceptionally important initiative.</P>

	<P>My colleague, Senator Paschal Mooney, and I know the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, better than most others in the House.  As she knows, I believe in her and know that she will prioritise the issue of the establishment of a hotline for missing children.  Former Senator Maria Corrigan and the then Senator Frances Fitzgerald spoke passionately about this issue last year.  It had been drawn to their attention following the death of the young boy, Daniel McAnaspie, who went missing early last year.  I attended his funeral and witnessed the pain and saw the tortured look on the faces of the members of his family.  As a 17 year old, if he had had access to a hotline at the time he went missing, he might have been saved.  His death brought the issue onto the radar strongly and there were calls for the establishment of a hotline at the time.  The ISPCC stated the Government needed to establish the European telephone hotline number for missing children as a matter of urgency in order that no matter where a child was in Europe, including for those children who came here from other European countries and covered by the ERASMUS programme, he or she would be able to access the service.  This would provide security for parents where a child was abducted.</P>
        <P>The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children does amazing work and embarrassed the previous Government because of the lack of attention to and support for the organisation.  I suggest the society be given the money to operate the hotline as it deserves funding <Col N="744"/>and would not be able to do this through the Childline service.  The volume of voluntary work carried out by the organisation is extraordinary.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that the Minister, then a Senator, and former Senator Maria Corrigan pleaded last year for the establishment of the hotline.  It is shameful that it has not yet been establishment, given the scandalous way children have been treated in our society, about which we continue to hear on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>I thank the usher, Mr. Tim Hayes, for valiantly using his initiative and skills to obtain a copy of the Minister&rsquo;s speech for us.  She stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The skills and mechanisms a child needs to stay safe are first taught in the home.  Common simple messages abound and are reiterated to young children all the time: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to strangers;&rdquo; &ldquo;Stay there and don&rsquo;t move&rdquo;...</P>
        <P FLI="0">Many children are tortured by people who know them outside the family &mdash; it is not just strangers who do so.  In the majority of cases children are abused by people known to them and who are looking after them.  I know the Minister will prioritise this issue, as she is a go-getter and now has her chance to be a super Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I know she will be.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate which has been extremely helpful.  The first thing I willdo is ensure the members of the project group receive a copy of the debate becauseevery aspect of the setting up of the hotline has been raised in the contributions made.  All of the key questions have been asked and the key points made about how we need to progress the issue.</P>
        <P>I wish to make several points.  I am establishing the project group and have asked for nominations from the relevant Departments and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I expect that we will have a meeting of the group in the next couple of weeks.  Therefore, there has been no delay in setting it up.</P>
        <P>Many of the questions raised need to be addressed by the project group.  I was asked what was meant by &ldquo;sustainable funding&rdquo;, which applies to everything set up in this day and age.  What I mean by it is an appreciation of what the costs will be in the longer term.  We want to ensure that if we start something, we will be able to continue.</P>
        
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I cannot give a figure to the House for the cost involved because the funding estimates vary widely and I want to ascertain first the projected level of usage.  For example, Senator van Turnhout makes a compelling case as it happened in Belgium.  Obviously this depends on the number being known and on people being aware of its existence and being in a position to use it.  I wish to ascertain the extent to which it has been used in other countries.  The project team will assess this and will examine the costings in other countries.  The Government certainly will link with NGOs to see if they are in a position to participate and I note the ISPCC has expressed some interest.  However, I make the point that all organisations currently offering telephone counselling and services are under severe pressure in respect of costings.  Some of the costings for services that are available have been very high.  Many 116 numbers are in operation here.  We do not wish to deflect from calls to the Garda where children are missing.  This is extremely important and quite a number of Senators made that point.  Interestingly, several Senators asked why one should not use the Garda numbers.  Although other Senators entered some caveats in this regard, it is an issue that must be explored.  It may be possible to establish a project to get this number in position and to review <Col N="745"/>it thereafter to ascertain how effective it has been, what usage there has been and the costings.  I am committed to doing this and there is ongoing work to be done.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to introduce this Bill to the House.  It proposes to amend existing dormant accounts legislation in order to dissolve the Dormant Accounts Board and transfer the statutory functions of the board to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>
        <P>The report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes, better known as the McCarthy report, recommended the discontinuation of the Dormant Accounts Board, which has statutory functions relating to disbursements from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  The report stated that this would result in an annual saving to the Exchequer of &euro;1.7 million.  It should be noted that the vast majority of the administrative budget for dormant accounts is paid annually to Pobal, which administer the dormant accounts measures of this Department and certain other Departments.  Expenditure under the fund is spread across ten Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>The rationale behind the group&rsquo;s recommendation was as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">Given that the level of funds transferred into the fund has declined in recent years, the Group concludes that the <i>Dormant Accounts Board</i> should be discontinued.  Remaining projects funded by the Board should be processed to their conclusion.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As the levels of new measures or programmes for disbursement from the fund are likely to remain very low for so long as the current budgetary constraints prevail, the justification for having a body <i>in situ</i> is limited, particularly one that has little involvement in the approval process.</P><Col N="746"/>
        <P Just="Left">Currently, legislation provides for a scheme to transfer dormant accounts in banks, building societies and An Post, as well as unclaimed life assurance policies, to the care of the State, while guaranteeing a right of reclaim to those funds.  The main purpose of the legislation is to reunite account holders or policyholders with their funds in credit institutions and insurance undertakings and in this regard, such institutions and undertakings are required to take steps to identify and contact the owners of dormant accounts and unclaimed life assurance policies.  The legislation further provides for a scheme of disbursement, for charitable purposes, or purposes of societal and community benefit, of funds that are not likely to be reclaimed.  The fund consists of a reserve account from which reclaims and various expenses are paid and an investment and disbursement account from which investments and disbursements are made.</P>
        <P>Under this Bill, the objectives underpinning disbursements from the Dormant Accounts Fund will remain unchanged, that is, disbursement will assist persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged, educationally disadvantaged or who have a disability.  Future disbursements must have regard to those three areas, the priorities and policies of Government, the availability of moneys, the cost-effectiveness of the expenditure and the outcome of any previous reviews of disbursements plans.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Transparency in decision-making on disbursements from the fund is critically important.  The fairness of any grant scheme and decisions made for funding under it are likely to be subject to scrutiny.  Given the special nature of dormant accounts funds, which are private citizens&rsquo; money and not Exchequer funding, there will be a reasonable public expectation that the disbursement process should be clearly fair and equitable.  This is the reason the Government will make considerable efforts in the legislation to ensure this is the case, particularly by providing for Oireachtas or public scrutiny of the process, as well as ongoing reviews, which will be available to the public.</P>
        <P>Everyone in the House welcomes the use of such unclaimed moneys for the betterment of the less well-off in our society.  Such good work for the public good must continue, which is exactly the intention of the Bill.  More could be done.  However, if one is serious about tackling severe disadvantage, the State must use all resources available to it for this purpose in a particularly focused and sustained way.  It is doubtful whether current arrangements can secure optimal impact in this regard.  A more sensible approach, which underpins the Bill, is to draw on the expertise, knowledge and resources of existing public bodies.  One must be careful about using taxpayers&rsquo; money correctly and there is no point in setting up another body to work through these issues if knowledge and expertise already resides within existing public bodies.  The objective is to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy and to enable informed, objective decision-making consistent with public policy priorities and available resources.</P>
        <P>In practice, this means that each year, following broad approval of programmes and types of projects for funding, applications will be publicly invited for eligible programmes or projects.  Following evaluation of such applications by or on behalf of public bodies, I will, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, approve a range of specific measures and projects.  A statement containing details of the approvals will be laid before the Oireachtas and a list setting out the approved measures and projects and specifying the amounts to be disbursed, will be published within one month.  These arrangements demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to streamlined, transparent and effective administrative arrangements and they are grounded in reality.  These rigorous and extensive measures confirm the Government&rsquo;s absolute commitment to ensure that decisions on the fund are informed by Government policy and the public interest, as well as being accessible to public application and fully subject to public scrutiny.</P><Col N="747"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill maintains the requirement for separate recording of dormant accounts spending through the Votes of Departments.  This means, for example, that where Dormant Accounts Fund expenditure for a project for a community group is approved, the relevant funding will be channelled through the Department dealing with that sectoral group.  In this way, dormant accounts spending can be tracked across Departments with enhanced transparency and accountability.  Under Government accounting procedures, disbursements on dormant accounts measures are paid in the first instance up-front from the Department&rsquo;s Vote in the same way as with any other spending programme.  The difference with dormant accounts expenditure compared with other funding programmes is that once expenditure takes place, either on administration of the measure or by the project itself, it is reimbursed to the Exchequer from the Dormant Accounts Fund in accordance with the Dormant Accounts Acts, in the form of appropriations-in-aid payable through the relevant Department&rsquo;s Vote.  In this way, the costs associated with dormant accounts measures are Exchequer-neutral, although it should be noted that Departments cannot spend appropriations-in-aid directly themselves once they are reimbursed from the fund.  They are instead refunded to the central Exchequer.  Moneys disbursed from the fund increase Government debt levels as the money continues to belong to the account holder, who can reclaim it at any time, and not at any stage to the State.  Consequently, every euro spent from the fund is regarded in accounting terms as a potential Government liability.  Therefore, the Dormant Accounts Fund cannot be regarded as free money, as it were.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to convey to the Dormant Accounts Board the Government&rsquo;s appreciation for the work it has undertaken to date.  Following its establishment in January 2006, the board developed disbursement plans that established the framework within which disbursements from the fund would be approved.  Money from the fund was spent and continues to be spent on a wide range of projects and activities across diverse geographical areas, but with one essential common thread, namely, the alleviation of disadvantage.  In accordance with the plans, priority funding is earmarked for RAPID areas, substance misuse, persons with a disability and educational disadvantage.  The Government is fully committed to continuing to use the fund for these types of projects and work.</P>
        <P>The more detailed technical provisions of the legislation are set out in the explanatory and financial memorandum accompanying the text of the Bill.  While I have spoken about some of the key areas, I propose to outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Sections 1 and 2 are standard provisions relating to definitions and so on.  Section 2 specifically provides for the appointed day to be determined by order, which is the day the Act comes into force, the Dormant Accounts Board is dissolved and the functions of the board are transferred to the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 3 replaces Part 6 of the principal Act, as inserted by section 8 of the Act of 2005, and sets out the new disbursement arrangements.  Sections 40A to 44A are subsets of section 3 of the Bill.  Section 40A updates definitions to take account of changes provided for in the Bill.  Section 41 sets out the purposes under which disbursements can be made.  Section 42 provides for the making of a disbursements scheme no later than 12 months after the appointed day and will set out the types of programmes or projects for which moneys may be disbursed.  The disbursements scheme or any subsequent amendment to it must be prepared by the Minister having consulted the Minister for Health, the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Social Protection.  The Minister may also consult other Ministers or persons.  A scheme or an amendment to a scheme must be approved by the Government and must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and the Oireachtas will be allowed 21 days to challenge it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 43 provides for the preparation of an action plan each year where the Minister has made a scheme.  The process of making the action plan is very similar to that of the disbursements scheme in terms of consultation with other Ministers and so on.  Once the plan is adopted, a copy is laid before each House of the Oireachtas, where it may be challenged within a 21-<Col N="748"/>day period.  The action plan must also be published.  Provision is also made for adopting or not adopting an action plan and for not proceeding to invite applications under an action plan if appropriate in particular circumstances.  Any decision not to proceed must be approved by the Government.</P>
        <P>Sections 43A and 44 provide that a Minister, within whose remit lies responsibility for a programme or type of project specified in an action plan, is required to publish or cause to be published an invitation to apply for disbursements, which shall include the assessment criteria, the application procedure, the deadline and any other information a Minister wishes to include.  It also provides for applications to be assessed by or on behalf of a Minister.  As is currently the case, following assessments, recommendations must be made as to which measures or projects should receive disbursements.  These recommendations are submitted in the first instance to the relevant Minister.  They are then submitted to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for approval, subject to the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government&rsquo;s recommendations are submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for approval.  The list of approved measures and projects is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Section 44A provides that disbursements must be paid from the Oireachtas and reimbursed to relevant Ministers on the direction of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform by the NTMA and must be regarded as appropriations-in-aid.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 4 is a technical amendment, updating cross-references to the NTMA and the board.  It also provides that the Minister must, before 30 June each year, prepare an annual report on disbursements during the preceding year, to include any findings, conclusions or recommendations concerning such operation.  The annual report is submitted to the Government and then laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Section 5 provides for the dissolution of the Dormant Accounts Board, with any references to it in any enactment or legal document to be construed as a reference to the Minister.  The chairperson of the former board will remain accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of disbursements by that board during his tenure.  This is a quite standard provision for former chairpersons of State bodies.</P>
        <P>Sections 6 to 8, inclusive, make standard provision for transfer of assets, liabilities, taking over contracts, etc.  Section 9 provides that the board must prepare final accounts, covering the period from the last annual accounts up to the day immediately before the appointed day.  These accounts are to be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit, and the audited accounts must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 10 provides for the final report of the board, including particulars of those to whom disbursements were made and the amount of each disbursement since the last annual report of the board.  This report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 11 provides for the Minister to take ownership of the records of the board.  Section 12 provides that the plan for 2009 to 2011, as prepared by the board and approved by the Government, continues in effect until the Minister&rsquo;s first disbursements scheme is made, and must be treated the same as if it was a disbursements scheme made by the Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 13 updates the principal Act to take account of the new term, &ldquo;disbursement scheme&rdquo;, and other technical amendments.  Section 14 provides for repeal of sections 30 to 40, inclusive, of the principal Act relating to Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board provisions.  Section 15 deals with the Short Title, collective citation and commencement.</P><Col N="749"/>
        <P>The Government has provided for a range of rigorous measures in the Bill to secure transparency and accessibility by ensuring decisions on the fund are informed by the public interest, accessible to public application and fully subject to public scrutiny.  The Bill will assist the State in using the resources available to it in a more focused and effective way for the purpose of tackling severe disadvantage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The purpose of the Bill is to abolish the Dormant Accounts Board and to vest the powers in the Minister.  I have no great difficulty with that; I can trust this Minister and, I hope, his successors in time to look after it.  The Minister has paid tribute to the Dormant Accounts Board which has done excellent work in coming up with the money that was lying dormant in accounts.  After a set number of years it was taken into this kitty, so to speak, and several valuable projects, including a number I can think of in the Cork South-West constituency, benefited.  Over the years it has funded youth caf&eacute;s and other such matters.  This continues the policy of the previous Government which believed that the Dormant Accounts Board had more or less outlived its purpose and that a new approach was needed.  In this regard the Minister has the support of this side of the House for the Bill, which I wish a speedy passage.</P>
        <P>I believe the funding from dormant accounts has now peaked.  It is like oil resources.  There was a substantial amount in the kitty seven or eight years ago and now obviously there is less of it there.  It is appropriate that the board should be wound down.  While I do not say this disparagingly of the board, it gets rid of another quango, so to speak.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I may be incorrect I believe this all came about in an ironic way following a major investigation led by the former Deputy, the late Jim Mitchell, into the accounts in foreign banks.  People were putting money offshore and a lot of money came in from that.  As Revenue and banks trawled through accounts, they discovered a lot of money where there was no traceability of the account holders and consequently it came up with the Dormant Accounts Fund, which has done considerable good work using unclaimed money.</P>
        <P>I recently looked through an old bank account to ascertain if there was any small amount left there.  I discovered that in an account of my late mother who died in 1983 there was still some &pound;70 or &pound;80 left.  The name Mary O&rsquo;Donovan is quite common in west Cork and I suppose it was a small amount of money.  I advised the bank she was long gone and there was no point in taking out a grant of probate or administration for the amount in question.  It just goes to show there are still small pots of money throughout the country in various banks.  If the dormant accounts idea was to be put into practice, perhaps the Minister might say that in these difficult financial times &mdash; I am putting on my legal hat here, although I have not practised for 14 years &mdash; the State and the Exchequer are entitled to get their hands on money or property when there is an end to the line of succession.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill is welcome for reasons already outlined.  The Minister is going in the right direction and it will be neater for him to take charge of it.  With the public expectation being that this money will be properly disbursed, I have no doubt that he will ensure that such an expectation is met.  I have no doubt that such money will be used for very valuable purposes to deal with people who are socially disadvantaged, educationally disadvantaged or who may have disabilities.  That is a good idea, so I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House.  It has the full support of this side of the House.</P>

I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this very important Bill.  The Minister has outlined the disbanding of the <Col N="750"/>Dormant Accounts Board and the transfer of its legislative functions to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Dormant Accounts Acts provide for an annual transfer by credit institutions and insurance undertakings of moneys in accounts determined to be dormant into the Dormant Accounts Fund.  From its establishment in 2003 to the end of February 2011, transfers to the Dormant Accounts Fund have totalled approximately &euro;589 million, which includes interest earned of approximately &euro;35 million.  Prior to the establishment of that fund, that interest earned was the property of the various financial institutions; therefore, it is a plus that the Dormant Accounts Fund was initiated in the first instance.  Funds reclaimed in that period by account holders amounted to approximately &euro;208 million.</P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005, decisions on disbursements from dormant accounts are now the responsibility of the Government.   The Dormant Accounts Board was established in 2006.  Its role is to provide independent advice in respect of Government decisions on dormant accounts funding.   The function was transferred to the Government in 2005, while the board has since only acted in an advisory capacity.  We always hear that Ministers have enough advisers at this stage.  There are ten Departments involved in the disbursement of those funds, so there is advice coming to Ministers from every quarter and every agency on the disbursement of this fund.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 2001 legislation provides for the administration of unclaimed accounts in the various institutions 15 years after they were established, and the funds are then disbursed to the various projects.  These projects are in economically and socially challenged areas, or for people with disabilities or who are educationally disadvantaged.  To date, more than &euro;140 million of the Dormant Accounts Fund has been committed to projects around the country.  The funding has been available over the years, and the Bill does not propose to change any of the underlying principles of the Dormant Accounts Fund.  Those principles, which are admirable, will remain unchanged.  They will assist the people who they were intended to assist in the first instance; those people who are economically, socially, or educationally disadvantaged, or those who have a disability.  Future disbursements will have regard to those areas, and the priorities and policies of the Government will be maintained in that light.</P>
        <P>The Bill strengthens the Government and Oireachtas oversight of the area, while at the same time simplifying administrative arrangements and the associated process in respect of grants awarded from the Dormant Accounts Board.  The Minister pointed out that the amount coming into the fund has decreased since its establishment.  In 2003, it was around &euro;200 million, whereas it is now under &euro;50 million.  Education of the people in respect of claiming funds and ensuring that there are no dormant accounts would also have been responsible for this decline.  In its 2010 report, the board recommended new sources of funding.  Perhaps the Minister should look at different agencies for such funding.  I believe a reply was given at the time that it was not the time to put more money into the fund and that it would be appropriate to wait for better times.  That was the statement made in early 2010, but we know that these are not better times now.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In July 2009, the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes recommended the discontinuation of the Dormant Accounts Board, forecasting an annual saving to the exchequer of approximately &euro;1.7 million.  That money could be put to good use by Departments.  Therefore, it would be a logical step to disband this board in an orderly fashion, and the Bill provides for this.  A previous speaker spoke about disbanding a quango.  The Minister thanked the board members for the work they have done, and they have outlined the various steps and methodology for the disbursement of this fund, and this will continue.</P><Col N="751"/>
        <P>One area of existing legislation that concerns me is that the Government is liable to disburse funds to the original dormant account holders after the stipulated 15 years in which there has been no transaction on the account.  If a large number of dormant account holders were to reclaim their money simultaneously and these claims amounted to more than 15% of the total Dormant Accounts Fund, as provided for in the legislation, the State coffers could be seriously drained and this must be addressed.  The legislation states that the money may be reclaimed by the account holder at any time.  The previous speaker alluded to a scenario where the account holder is dead, but this is not stipulated in the Bill and we do know that account holders and beneficiaries of accounts might be in dispute.  Therefore, it should be put in the Bill that the beneficiary of the account is the person that reclaims the money.</P>
        <P>According to section 22 of the 2001 Act, the Minister is empowered to appoint inspectors to ensure compliance by the financial institutions with the Act.  In its 2010 annual report, the Dormant Accounts Board expressed concern that up to that year, no inspectors had been appointed.  We have plenty of inspectors, but they are obviously not inspecting this fund, which further exemplifies the blas&eacute; approach to financial regulation that was taken in recent years.  I hope the Minister ensures that these inspections take place, because it is up to the inspector to ensure that the banks inform the people who have the accounts that they are approaching the 15 year threshold for the creation of a dormant account.  There does not have to be an inspection of every institution, but it should be done on a spot check basis.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, the Dormant Accounts Board does not have any executive functions but serves to provide independent advice to the Government and to act as a critical appraiser relating to Government decisions on the fund.  According to the regulatory impact analysis of this Bill, the functions of the board are largely historical and its role has been substantially reduced since the enactment of the 2005 Bill.  That is very welcome.</P>
        <P>Will the role of Pobal continue in the administration of the fund?  Perhaps it could be subsumed into the Department if it cost more to administer it that way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the Upper House.  He is a frequent visitor here, which is a credit to him, and he always provides information which is relevant to the day-to-day workings of the country.  Whoever decided to proceed with this dormant accounts legislation was wise because a lot of old money was lying in banks which got their hands on the interest.  When the Government introduced this legislation, it was a good day&rsquo;s work.  As the years went on, people became more conscious that money was lying dormant.  As Senator O&rsquo;Donovan said, &euro;70 or &euro;80 here and there can add up to a lot of money.  We should publicise the fact that there are still dormant accounts in existence, so that the money can be used for social purposes in disadvantaged areas.</P>
        <P>It is fairly straightforward to work out the question of unclaimed life assurance.  Do pension funds which fall into the same type of category come under the dormant accounts legislation?  For example, self-employed people may have contributed to personal private pension funds with the money being controlled by life insurance companies.  The legislation, however, only covers unclaimed life policies.  There may be another source of income from such pension funds.  From my own experience, I know that many small business people would have taken out private pension policies.  They may then have given up that business and discontinued the policy.  There may be &euro;2,000 or &euro;20,000 involved or, unfortunately, they may have died.  The life insurance element of single people with no family connections may have been tackled but the pension fund could be another source of income for the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am delighted the Bill tidies up the efficiency of the system.  One cannot emphasise enough the importance of that aspect.  The disbursements will help people who are economically, socially and educationally disadvantaged, including those who have disabilities.  Most of us were <Col N="752"/>at the carers' group briefing this morning, which included an outline of the difficulties encountered by a female carer and her 19 year old son.  We must target this type of funding effectively.  We spend a lot of money on mental health, depression and suicide awareness.  Groups like Aware and smaller groups should be targeted for funding.  In recent years, many bigger charities have been sweeping up much of the money.  Those involved in smaller groups, such as Aware, are not noisy individuals.  They are quiet but they have difficulty in funding their groups.  We should target small groups which are falling through the cracks, so to speak, as they do not have the same public profile as larger charities.  Groups like Aware and others should be considered for such funding.  I also support any move that will save costs and in that respect the Bill is welcome.  Perhaps the Minister can provide some detail on pension funds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will be brief.  I endorse what the Minister said at one point in his speech.  Everyone in the House welcomes the use of these unclaimed moneys for the betterment of the less well-off in our society.  Such work for the public good must continue and that is the Bill&rsquo;s intention, which I commend.  It is important not to have a slush fund of some kind with high administration overheads and the money going to quangos or bureaucracies.  We sometimes hear those complaints about lottery funding.  If this is targeted and means-tested for genuinely deserving low-income people, it will merit our support.  I commend the Minister for introducing the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House as well as welcoming this new legislative proposal.  I wish to touch briefly on some aspects of dormant accounts, including how the banks deal with them.  Some years ago, a client of mine received a letter from the Revenue Commissioners concerning such an account.  She found that she had an account of &pound;50,000 which had been opened in 1976.  She never had the kind of money that was in that account and when we tracked it down we found that her brother had come home from England and had opened the account in her name.  He had gone back to England and died about six months after opening the account.  In the intervening 20 years there was no correspondence with her by the bank.  In dealing with estates, when members of the legal profession write to banks seeking information on accounts, they may find that all the searches are done on a &ldquo;Michael Murphy&rdquo; of one address.  If there is any variation in a name, the banks do not provide any assistance.  We are concerned about that issue.</P>
        <P>Some years ago, a financial institution tried to introduce a fee for any searches that were requested, but such fees should be discouraged or not allowed.  When people are genuinely trying to find accounts, in particular when they do not have an immediate family and not all the information is available to those administering the estate, banks should provide as much assistance as possible.  Unfortunately, however, full assistance is not being provided by financial institutions and, as a result, accounts are never traced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been more movement of people within the country in the past 20 years.  At one time a person might have bought a house and lived in the same place for a lifetime.  In the past 20 years, however, that pattern has changed substantially.  As recently as yesterday, I received a letter from the Department of Social Protection in respect of the previous resident of my house who left more than 14 years ago.  The Department was trying to track information on an employee of the previous resident.  I am surprised the information had not been updated.  Likewise, information is not updated with banks either.  Banks should be aware of this matter and need to be more helpful in giving out information, particularly in dealing with the administration of an estate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My colleague, Senator C&aacute;it Keane, mentioned the failure to appoint inspectors.  As we are relying on the 2010 report, I am not sure if there was any update.  As the previous Act provided <Col N="753"/>for the appointment of inspectors, it should be followed through in the new legislation.  The same applies to life assurance policies in order that people who took the time to invest in those funds are entitled to get the moneys back.  The need for inspectors in that area is essential.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the legislation.  The fund has been used very well and many projects have benefited greatly from it.  The money has been put to good use.  Nonetheless, we need to ensure that such money goes back to its rightful owners who took the time to invest and set it aside for future use.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House and I support the thrust of the legislation, albeit with a few caveats.  The Government essentially intends to save costs and deal with administration issues.  This is being seen as a quango in some respects, but I support the need to deal with those issues.  Increased transparency is required in disbursing any dormant account funds.  Many community projects benefit from dormant accounts funding.  I have worked in the community development sector as a volunteer.  I was a member of a management committee of a community development project in Waterford.  I am aware of many of the sacrifices made over many years by volunteers throughout the country in the community development sector and agencies.  The Minister will be aware that many community development projects have been placed under the control of Partnership.  The boards of management are now gone and this is perceived by many as a hollowing out of genuine community development.  There is very genuine concern about funding for community development.  Most of the projects concerned operate on a shoestring budget.  All those I know in Waterford operate on a shoestring budget in very difficult circumstances.  They are trying to do work for the most disadvantaged communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have lived in three local authority housing estates, of which I am very proud.  All had community development projects.  The reason they had them was the need for projects to help the communities concerned to deal with the social and economic issues at the heart of many of their problems.  The projects benefit from funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  While the Minister seeks to save money and cut costs, of which we are all in favour, it is important that he does not cut funding for community development projects.  Doing so does not make sense and complicates matters for all those people trying to provide community development services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will money disbursed through the Dormant Accounts Fund be ring-fenced?  If the board is to be subsumed into the Minister&rsquo;s Department, will the funding become part of his budget?  What accountability and transparency mechanisms will be in place?  Will the Minister publish details annually on what money is being spent on and where it is being spent?</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a need for value-for-money-based administration of the fund in order that we will spend less on consultancy and other services.  We see this right across the public sector.  This is an area on which I commend the Minister for at least trying to achieve savings but it should be noted there are many areas right across the public service where, as we know, austerity measures are being implemented and where there have been cutbacks.  I mentioned cuts affecting the community and voluntary sector but there are also cuts affecting health and education, yet there is a great deal of waste in the system.</P>
        <P>The Minister is saving a very small amount of money.  Will he use the money saved to reinvest in communities?  Will the money just be part of general departmental savings?  This is a reasonable question for people to ask.  If we are to save money, we need to know what will become of the savings.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators referred to cuts of &pound;4 billion in the North by the Tory Government.  Senator Harte referred this morning to these cuts.  The Assembly in the North does not have <Col N="754"/>fiscal powers, nor does it have the opportunity to set or raise taxes, as the Minister knows.  I hope the Minister&rsquo;s party and the Labour Party will work with those of us in Sinn F&eacute;in who are trying to obtain fiscal powers to allow Assembly Members in the North to make the kinds of decisions we would like Fine Gael and the Labour Party to make.  In the North, there was an allocation of &pound;80 million for community development purposes, despite the fact that there have been cuts in the order of &pound;4 billion.  It was still possible to find the money to invest in community services.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="755"/>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Hogan, back to the House.  I apologise for not being present to hear his opening remarks; I had to attend a function.  He is one of the few Ministers who attends this House regularly to address concerns relating to his Department.  I commend him again on doing so.</P>
        <P>My party welcomes and supports this legislation.  As has been outlined by a number of colleagues, the dormant accounts funding is ring-fenced for three specific areas, namely, economic and social disadvantage, educational disadvantage and for persons with a disability.  Benefits pertain to respite care; the enhancement of play and recreational facilities for children and young people to make them accessible to people with disabilities; youth and community facilities in disadvantaged areas; facilities for the homeless; action to combat isolation; day care centres; programmes that help educate people about substance misuse; suicide prevention; enhanced facilities for those living in RAPID and CL&Aacute;R areas and local drugs task force areas; empowerment and promotion of equality for those with a disability; increased transport access and integrated mobility; and independent living and appropriate additional or enhanced services for those under this heading.  In the area of arts, sport and science, there have been pre-school educational initiatives, literacy and numeracy initiatives, and intercultural and language programmes.  This is just a brief outline of some of the excellent benefits of dormant accounts funding.</P>
        <P>What role will Pobal have in the new arrangements the Minister is putting in place?  Senator Keane has already asked that question.  How much money is in the dormant accounts fund at present?  I understand that, to qualify for inclusion in the fund, an account must be dormant for 15 years, and that, in April of each year, the relevant bank must notify the Department of that account.  What independent verification is there of information given to the Minister by the banks?  What plans has the Minister to spend the money in the fund?  Over what period will it be spent?</P>
        <P>I understand the application process is ongoing and that there is no particular deadline.  I very much welcome that because good projects come to light at various times of the year.  To impose a deadline on them would be unfair.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to economic, social and educational disadvantage, I would like to see bigger grants available for capital projects throughout the country.  Various grants have been given to organisations throughout the country and they have been put to good use.  However, bearing in mind that money is scarce, if we are to consider capital projects that will provide facilities for the socially disadvantaged, in particular youth organisations, then 50% of the funding should come from the dormant account funds and the other 50% should come from private investment.  There is an appetite among communities for such a grant and perhaps a ceiling of &euro;250,000 or &euro;350,000 could be put on the allocation from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  I am keen to see the Minister&rsquo;s plans in this regard and to ascertain the total amount of money in the fund.  Given the history of our banks, what independent verification is available or will be available from the Department to ensure the banks are telling the Minister the truth?  Again, I welcome the Minister and we are pleased to support the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.  I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this important legislation and thank him for his commitment to the House. He will be with us again early in November to discuss several items which Members have raised during recent weeks.  The Dormant Accounts Board has carried out great work over the years but there is a time limit to everything and it is being wound up by the Minister now.  Nevertheless, the Minister is putting in place a transparent process, as he outlined in his speech, with regard to how the fund will be administered in future.  The action plan will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and can be challenged within a 21 day period.  Also, it must be published and <Col N="756"/>provision is being made for adoption or non-adoption of the plan.  Applications will be invited under the action plan as well.  There is the utmost transparency in the process.</P>
        <P>There is a need for every Minister and Department to make cuts.  The country is in a bad state.  There is much talk of getting back our economic sovereignty and the Government is going about it.  This is about cuts in the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  I commend the Minister.  We have been discussing quangos.  I understand 43% of the quangos under the Minister&rsquo;s aegis have been abolished or amalgamated.  This example should be followed by other Ministers in Government.  There have been calls for ring-fencing of money that will be saved.  The savings will go towards helping us to get back our economic sovereignty and to enable us to run our own affairs in future.  I commend the Minister on the legislation before us and I wish him well.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I suspect it will not always be the case. I thank all Senators for their contributions to the debate.  It was interesting to hear the different perspectives which focused on the dormant accounts aspect of the Bill generally, as one might expect.</P>
        <P>I refer to some of the contributions made.  Senators Keane and Burke mentioned the banks and whether they would be inspected.  This issue was taken up by Senator Wilson as well.  How do we ensure they are compliant with the legislation?  Under the Dormant Accounts Act 2001, which has been amended several times with regard to unclaimed life assurance policies, the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank may authorise inspectors for the purpose of ensuring compliance.  I understand the Central Bank, acting on behalf of the Minister for Finance, has engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers to carry out inspections on dormant accounts over a two year period.  They have completed the first two inspections.  There is engagement by the Minister for Finance to ensure compliance with the legislation and this is welcome.</P>
        <P>Senator Harte made a valid point about pension funds.  As a former insurance broker like Senator Harte, I understand that there would be some lying around in terms of pension funds from various individuals who may not have claimants.  The position regarding dormant accounts funding is that, in practical terms, increasing the amount available in the fund does not necessarily allow for the introduction of new dormant account measures or programmes.  Although supplying the provisions of the dormant accounts legislation to pension fund accounts would increase the amount available in the fund, Departments and agencies must still source the moneys for dormant accounts programmes and measures from their Exchequer allocation in the same way as any other funding programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is interesting to note how Departments treat these funds for accounting purposes.  Since the funds are claimable by the individual or their estate on an ongoing basis until such time as the account is declared a dormant account, it remains a liability on the State in accountancy terms.  When the money expended on dormant accounts measures and programmes are reimbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund, the refund is to the Exchequer rather than the spending Department.  I will seek to establish the position regarding pension funds and the level of interest in that matter in advance of Committee Stage and I will come back to it.  I understand the point the Senator is making.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Cullinane raised the matter of ring-fencing the money.  The Senator will appreciate that given the focus as set down in the legislation a significant proportion of the funding dis<Col N="757"/>bursed to date from the fund is already channelled through community and voluntary groups under the existing arrangements.  This is in addition to the other substantial supports provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for that sector annually through other schemes and programmes.  The intention has always been to ensure a broad and balanced range of potential beneficiaries from dormant accounts disbursements and this should continue in future rather than focusing on a particular sector.  Given the reduced level of funding available for disbursement from the fund, ring-fencing is not feasible.</P>
        <P>The issue of the current surplus in the account was raised.  Since the establishment of the fund in April 2003 to the end of August 2011, the transfers to the fund have totalled &euro;626.59 million, including interest earned of some &euro;35.53 million.  Funds reclaimed in this period by account holders amounted to approximately &euro;218.7 million and the net value of uncommitted funds is &euro;81.991 million.</P>
        <P>Other speakers referred to some key general provisions of the Bill and I welcome the contributions of Senators Barrett and Cummins in this regard.  When dormant accounts legislation was introduced first the priority was to ensure that large financial institutions would not benefit from the money, which had happened previously, but that the money would go back to account holders or people who were deprived or disadvantaged.  This will continue to be a priority under the new arrangements.</P>
        <P>As recommended in the McCarthy report, the Bill proposes to dissolve the Dormant Accounts Board but it would transfer the statutory functions of the Dormant Accounts Board to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The existing arrangements will continue.  This will strengthen Government and Oireachtas oversight of the area while simplifying the arrangement and the associated processes in respect of grants awards from the dormant accounts fund.  Decisions on the spending of the dormant accounts fund will be streamlined and less intrusive of Government business and this will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency and the manner in which we make disbursements.  The objectives of the scheme will remain the same and the Bill reaffirms that dormant accounts funding will continue to be spent to assist persons in the categories outlined.</P>
        <P>Disbursements will continue to be made through Votes of relevant Departments and will be Exchequer-neutral although it cannot be regarded as free money.  The Bill provides that the cost of engaging service providers such as Pobal to administer the application process will be met from the fund while the normal administration costs incurred by the relevant Departments will be met from within existing budgets.  I have no plans other than to continue with Pobal as the source of administration of these funds and funds from various other Departments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Modest annual savings, currently of approximately &euro;120,000, will accrue from the dissolution of the board but the administration costs associated with processing applications will be significantly greater, as I stated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Pending disbursement, moneys in the Dormant Accounts Fund are managed by the National Treasury Management Agency.  The NTMA had &euro;132 million under management at the end of 2010 and some &euro;39 million was transferred to the fund in 2010, while &euro;20 million of previously dormant funds were reclaimed.  Disbursements from the fund amounted to &euro;20 million in 2010.  I have already indicated the total amount disbursed since its establishment in April 2003 up to the end of August 2011.</P>
        <P>The board&rsquo;s function is largely historical in 2011 and this is why we are bringing forward the legislation.  There is a requirement to draw up a three year plan upon which detailed disbursement measures and programmes are based and to prepare an annual report that must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and one has 21 days to challenge it there.  The annual report and the review relate to earlier rounds of funding when more funding was available.</P><Col N="758"/>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In summary, the legislation provides for the transfer to my Department of the function of the Dormant Accounts Board, which will continue to be accountable until the point of its dissolution.  There is no change to the themes under which the disbursements can be made, namely, economic and social disadvantage, educational disadvantage and disability.  Disbursements will have regard to these three themes and take account of the policies and priorities of the Government, availability of moneys, cost effectiveness of the expenditure and outcome of any previous reviews.  Action plans must be prepared in consultation with the relevant Ministers and laid before the Oireachtas for a period of 21 days.  This addresses a point made by Senator Cullinane.  It should also be noted that the relevant joint committee of the Oireachtas already has separate powers to require me to appear before it in relation to any matter under my remit, including dormant accounts.  The expenditure will also be subject to normal scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General and Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Senators for their contributions and support for the legislation, the purpose of which is to do nothing more or less than tidy up matters to take account of the level of funding available in the Dormant Accounts Fund relative to the significant amount of money that has been in the fund heretofore.  The transparent and open arrangements outlined in the legislation will reassure Senators that the mechanism for the disbursement of funds from this source of moneys will be accountable and transparent.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> recognises that the trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation is a modern form of slavery and a form of human rights abuse;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that the Irish sex industry, which is worth &euro;250 million a year (CAB, January 2011), is very damaging for the girls and women involved in prostitution;</P>
       <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that internet audits consistently show that more than 1,000 women are made available for paid sex on a daily basis all over Ireland and up to 97% of them are migrant women (Kelleher 2009);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that there is clear evidence of children who have been trafficked in Ireland specifically for the purpose of prostitution (Kelleher 2009; AHTU annual report 2010);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes evidence from Sweden and Norway which shows that criminal sanctions for the purchase of sex are a proven deterrent to prostitution and consequently to trafficking (McLeod <i>et al</i>. 2008, Claude 2010);</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> further notes that International Conventions repeatedly call for efficient measures to deter demand for prostitution, which is recognised as an efficient approach to reduce sex trafficking (Article 6, Council of Europe&rsquo;s Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings 2005; Article 9(5), UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children 2000), and</P><Col N="759"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> proposes that the Government develops effective and appropriate responses to deal with prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation and calls on the Government to introduce legislation criminalising the purchase of sex in Ireland in order to curb prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Independent Senators move to criminalise the purchase of sex in Ireland in order to curb prostitution and trafficking.  The seven of us, four women and three men, are standing shoulder to shoulder to propose that the Government develops effective and appropriate responses, inclusive of introducing legislation, to deal with prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation.  We do so with an acute awareness of the globalised nature of an industry, of which Ireland is a part, that exploits women and girls and some men and boys, and a conviction that the purchase of sex, mainly by men, should not be tolerated by an Irish society that is modern, fair, committed to gender equality and shows repugnance towards trafficking and organised crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We recognise that trafficking for sexual exploitation is a modern form of slavery and a form of human rights abuse.  International and Irish research documents time and again acknowledge characteristics of slavery as they apply to sex trafficking and prostitution.  Trafficking utilises a plethora of control strategies to ensure compliance by victims.  These include deception in their recruitment &mdash; victims are often promised an education or good jobs &mdash; rape during their transport, issuing false papers which are then taken from them, placing them in clandestine captivity where they are under continuous surveillance, and a constant threat of physical violence to ensure they do not abscond, or that their travel debts will be paid.</P>
        <P>I wish the House to consider two cases of human beings living in Ireland, as documented by Irish researchers.  The first is that of Suzan from Sierra Leone, who at the age of 17 was raped by soldiers.  At 19 she was offered work in Europe in the hotel sector by a family friend who arranged a false passport and other documents for her.  The friend accompanied Suzan to Ireland and when she arrived in this country, she was taken to a house, raped by his friends and forced into prostitution.  The second case if that of Kiky from Nigeria who arrived in Ireland as a 16 year old girl.  I pause to note that research indicates that 11% of women trafficked into Ireland were children at the time they were so trafficked.  Kiky&rsquo;s story started when she was offered a job as a domestic worker in London by a family friend whom her parents trusted.  He and another woman travelled with Kiky who was told to call the woman &ldquo;Madam&rdquo;.  She was brought to a house where there were eight other girls and was forced to have sex with men without using condoms if that was what they asked for.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Prostitution in Ireland is a sophisticated and lucrative industry with more than 1,000 women made available for paid sex every day throughout the country.  While it is difficult to estimate the numbers involved, as the Government amendment to our motion notes, the figure we note in our motion &mdash; a minimum of 1,000 &mdash; can withstand rigorous methodological standards.  It is based on an Internet audit of women and those advertised as escorts, interviews with specialist front-line services and with those involved in prostitution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Women and girls are moved from town to town and city to city in a carefully managed logistical operation.  The Criminal Assets Bureau has valued the Irish sex industry at &euro;250 million a year.  Our current laws on prostitution are ambiguous and insufficient.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing plan for 2011 set out its commitment to proactively target groups and individuals involved in organised crime, including prostitution.  There is also a commitment in the programme for Government to strengthen the powers of the CAB in regard to the forfeiture of the proceeds of crime.  Legislation criminalising the purchase of sex would provide our law enforcement agencies with the tools to stem a large source of income for organised crime.  The <Col N="760"/>previous successes of the CAB in seizing assets of the drug trade could be replicated with regard to prostitution and trafficking.</P>
        <P>The Immigrant Council of Ireland, in its 2009 report, Globalisation, Sex Trafficking and Prostitution, states that trafficking for sexual exploitation and prostitution are inextricably linked.  All of the 91 women and 11 children who accessed front-line services in the period 2007-2008 were trafficked into Ireland for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  The supply and demand relationship between trafficking and prostitution has been confirmed by Swedish police sources who have stated that the Swedish ban on the purchase of sexual services acts as a barrier to human trafficking and procurers considering establishing themselves in Sweden.  The Nordic Gender Institute has identified a halving of the number of sex buyers in ten years since the purchase of sex has been criminalised in Sweden and has indicated a reduction in organised crime in general.  Surveys of men conducted by various researchers have also established that the greatest deterrent to the buyer of sex is a criminal sanction and/or the risk of exposure.  I was present when Swedish and Norwegian police officers came to Ireland recently to provide a briefing on this matter.  At that briefing, Detective Superintendent Jonas Trolle, the operational head of crime and narcotics surveillance with Stockholm police department, stated that it is now impossible to run a brothel in Sweden.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With this country&rsquo;s human rights record under the spotlight at the UN in Geneva last week, we must, as law-makers, be cognisant of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under international conventions on this issue.  The Council of Europe&rsquo;s Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings and the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children recognise that measures to deter demand for prostitution represent an efficient approach to reducing sex trafficking.  These international human rights standards provide the backdrop to our call for Ireland to introduce measures to deter demand for prostitution as a means of curbing human trafficking.  It is correct that in 2008 &mdash; the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion refers to this &mdash; it became illegal to buy sex from someone who had been trafficked as a result of the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Human Trafficking Act).  To date, however, no one has been identified as a victim of trafficking under this law because no convictions for trafficking offences have been secured under its provisions.  Furthermore, the Act does not provide for strict liability.  This means that the purchaser of sex can use the defence that he did not know that the person from whom he was purchasing sex had been trafficked.</P>
        <P>We have received representations from organisations such as Sex Workers Alliance Ireland and individuals who express concerns regarding the safety and welfare of and access to health care for people in prostitution that a change in the law might bring.  I share such concerns and feel that it is important to ensure that, with the introduction of this type of legislation, appropriate supports will made available for people and that additional measures will be developed to facilitate their exit from prostitution.  It is important too that women and men who come forward seeking assistance are not criminalised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The motion calls on the Government to introduce legislation.  The Independent Senators are dismayed by the tone and apparent direction of the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  The Government indicates that there should be a considered public debate on this issue prior to the Government taking a decision.  On an initial reading, this appears to be either a statement which, at best, delays indefinitely a decision regarding the introduction of legislation or, at worst attempts to claim that the <i>status quo</i> is working.  This is coupled with some of the other notations in the amendment but I will await what the Minister of State has to say in respect of these.  We want to publicly highlight the fact that there has already been significant public debate on this issue.  That debate has intensified since the Immigrant Council of Ireland and <Col N="761"/>its partners published the Irish research on this matter two years ago and since the establishment of a coalition of reputable organisations which is advocating for the type of change we suggest.  I welcome the representatives from these organisations who are present in the Visitors Gallery.  The debate on this matter has been inclusive, with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, his Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na all contributing.  We understand from debates in the D&aacute;il that the Attorney General has issued a legal opinion on criminalising the purchase of sex and that this is being considered by the Minister for Justice and Equality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I should have welcomed the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch to the House at the outset and apologise for not doing so.  I ask her to provide a timeframe for the public debate to which the Government&rsquo;s amendment refers.  The debate is already under way.  I also ask the Minister of State to indicate when the Government expects to make a decision on this matter, outline the further specific actions the Government will take to facilitate the public debate and provide an update on the Attorney General&rsquo;s opinion.  Either she or the Minister for Justice and Equality should come before the House at a later date to deliver a judgment on this matter.  Ultimately, this matter, which is informed by research, international standards and public debate, is one of legal and ethical judgment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the motion put forward by Senator Zappone and welcome the Minister of State to the House for this important debate on it.  I note with concern the amendment tabled by Senator Cummins on behalf of the Government.  This amendment is an extraordinary example of the use of Orwellian language and deflectionary tactics to avoid a positive outcome to this debate.  I call on the Government, which includes Fine Gael and the Labour Party, to introduce legislation that will criminalise the purchase of sex in Ireland in order to curb prostitution and human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am a middle class Irishman who is almost middle aged.  It is worth noting that those in the category of males in which I find myself are probably among the most frequent users of prostitutes, escort agencies and brothels in Ireland.  The profile of men here who reported that they purchase sex &mdash; one in 15 &mdash; bears out international research that the majority of males &mdash; 61% &mdash; who buy sex are either married or in a relationship.  It was not until I read about the Turn Off the Red Light campaign recently that I awoke from my own ignorance with regard to prostitution.  Prostitution is not one of those things a liberal country should tolerate.  We cannot turn a blind eye to it.  As a father of teenage daughters, I realise that I have a responsibility to highlight this issue and to raise collective awareness of it among Members of this House in order end prostitution and combat sex trafficking in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sex trafficking is widespread here.  As Ms Sarah Benson from Ruhama stated yesterday, at an excellent briefing attended by several Members, the fact that one can procure a prostitute anywhere in Ireland and have access to her services within 30 minutes provides potent evidence with regard to the pervasiveness of this problem.  As well as that which occurs in established markets in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, Ruhama has come into contact with organised prostitution in places such as Edgeworthstown, Ballina and Tubbercurry.  Women and girls as young as 14 are available to men such as me at the drop of a hand or the click of a computermouse.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Random searches of the Internet sites on which sex is sold indicate that on any given day of the week in Ireland, 1,000 women are available to the purchasers of sex.  Up to 97% of these are migrant women.  Is it because they are not Irish or we do not know them that we are slow to react to this problem?  Is it because we know that the users or buyers of sex are people such as you and me, namely, parents, professionals, uncles and brothers?  According to one study, men who buy sex from women tend to be highly educated, have incomes in the middle range <Col N="762"/>and are employed in professional occupations.  Earlier this year, the Criminal Assets Bureau indicated that the sex industry is worth approximately &euro;250 million per year.  The average price for sex in Ireland is in the region of &euro;150 for half an hour.</P>
        <P>The demand from men who purchase sex fuels the trade in trafficking women and girls and sustains the prostitution industry here.  Any thought to the effect that women involved in prostitution in Ireland have made a free choice and are engaging in commercial transactions from which they benefit should be dispelled on foot of the information provided via the Turn Off the Red Light campaign.  The physical and emotional pain these women experience, their concerns about their health and their future and their unhappiness are clearly documented.</P>
        <P>What is the law doing?  Some activities associated with prostitution are illegal in Ireland.  I refer here to kerb crawling, soliciting, loitering in public places and living off immoral means.  However, the buying and selling of sex is protected under the existing law and is viewed as a contract between consenting adults.  What does prostitution have do with consent?  Prostitution is a one-way street of abuse and rape.  We must get rid of the romanticised view of the character played by Julia Roberts in the film &ldquo;Pretty Woman&rdquo; as being involved in some idyllic, age-old profession.  Women who work in the Irish sex industry are modern day slaves and we in Seanad &Eacute;ireann should do something about it.  What money is buying is the right to override consent and obtain sexual gratification without the need to see another person as real.  According to a briefing paper prepared by the Immigrant Council of Ireland, an analysis of over 1,000 reviews posted by men on <i>punter.net</i> gives a clear indication of buyers&rsquo; attitudes.  There is talk of good value for money, about whether a person was worth the price and a discussion of a woman&rsquo;s physical attributes as if one was discussing the IKEA catalogue.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s amendment is a watered-down proposal which sanitises the argument and is a passive act.  Why does the Minister not bear witness?  I ask Senators to support the motion as we need a definite time and a clear indication from the Minister that his Department is moving forward.  I understand from some of the comments made in the media that any action will be slightly lacklustre; that there is talk about dialogue with the Attorney General and more referrals, about which I am worried.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s amendment seeks a &ldquo;considered public debate&rdquo;, but that is and has been happening since the start of the Turn off the Red Light campaign launched earlier this year.  It includes over 20 Irish civil society organisations, including trade unions and non-governmental organisations, coming together under this banner.  It is a considered and serious debate.  It is an insult to imply, therefore, as the amendment does, that another considered public debate is needed, as that debate is already happening.</P>
        <P>In 2008 it was made illegal, by means of the Criminal Justice (Human Trafficking) Act, to buy sex from someone who had been trafficked.  Section 5 of the Act outlines the penalties for those who buy sex from a trafficked person, but this law is weak.  A trafficked person is defined as a person in respect of whom a trafficking crime has been committed.  There is concern that this may be interpreted as requiring the conviction of a person for a trafficking offence before somebody can be prosecuted for buying sex from the trafficked person.  The Act does not provide for strict liability which means the purchaser of sex can use a defence that he or she did not know the person from whom he or she was purchasing sex had been trafficked.  In contrast, the equivalent law in the United Kingdom, a policing and crime Act, imposes strict liability and the purchaser of sex from a trafficked person cannot use the defence that he or she did not know that the person from whom the sex was bought had been trafficked.  This law was enacted in April last year.</P><Col N="763"/>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s amendment states we should recognise that legislation alone is not effective in preventing prostitution.  I disagree and for that reason will call a vote at the end of the debate if we do not receive clarification and a timeframe for the introduction of legislation in one of the Houses.  We have proof that legislation works and can protect the vulnerable, while reducing the incidence of human trafficking.  The Government can act in a very simple way by targeting the purchasers of sex, or the punters.  Tackling the demand for paid sex will combat the exploitation of women and children in the Irish sex industry.  Having listened to considered public debate, the most effective way to do this would be to penalise the purchase of sex along the lines suggested by Senator Katherine Zappone and what has happened in Sweden.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;human rights abuse;&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> deplores the sexual exploitation of any person, whether by financial means or otherwise, as an infringement of that person&rsquo;s human dignity;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> abhors especially the trafficking of children for the purposes of prostitution;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> while recognising the difficulties inherent in reliably estimating the extent of sexual exploitation and trafficking, notes the various estimates that have been made in that regard;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes the extensive package of legislative, administrative and other measures undertaken over the past three years to prevent trafficking in human beings, protect the victims and prosecute the offenders;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 makes it an offence for a person to solicit or importune in a street or public place another person or persons for the purposes of prostitution and that under that provision those who seek sexual services for payment from another person commit a criminal offence;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> recognises the provision in the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 that makes it an offence to solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, for the purposes of prostitution;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that Ireland&rsquo;s legislation on human trafficking for sexual exploitation complies with EU, Council of Europe and other international instruments and that the penalties in this jurisdiction for human trafficking, including trafficking of men, women and children for the purposes of sexual exploitation, are severe;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes the legislative provisions regarding prostitution introduced in Sweden and Norway and considers that the operation of these provisions, and other measures taken in other jurisdictions, should inform policy in this area;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> in supporting all reasonable and effective measures to curb prostitution, recognises that criminalising the purchase of sex of itself within our legal framework raises complex issues which would have to be addressed, including the possible prosecution of individuals in circumstances in which a gift is given to a person with whom they had a sexual encounter;</P><Col N="764"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> recognises that legislation alone is not effective in preventing prostitution;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> agrees that prior to Government making a definitive decision on whether legislation should be enacted reflecting legislation in Sweden and Norway there should be a considered public debate; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> proposes that the Government, in co-operation with the non-governmental organisations which carry out such valuable work in this area, continues to develop effective responses to deal with prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I listened with interest to the previous two speakers who outlined in graphic and great detail the reason prostitution and the sex industry must be tackled in a firm fashion by the new Government.  I listened to two very powerful presentations, but the problem of prostitution is hundreds of years old and the Government is only six months in office.  It would need a little time to reflect before taking the decisions which we hope it will eventually take.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My friends on the Independent benches are concerned that the amendment is, in some way, a cop-out.  We have seen many political cop-outs during the years, but the wording of the amendment and I hope the words we will hear from the Minister of State will allow all of us to recognise progress can be made and that a timeframe can be put in place to deal with the problem once and for all.  Graphic figures were provided by the previous two speakers for an industry &mdash; if it can termed as such &mdash; worth over &euro;250 million to the people making a perverse financial gain.  There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of young women who are the victims of the appalling trafficking process and this problem must be addressed in a firm and final fashion.  In that regard, I welcome the motion.</P>
        <P>Before proceeding to the next step, it is important to have very strong public consultation and debate, although I appreciate such a debate has commenced.  I also appreciate that we, as Senators, have received many representations and informed comment on the matter.  There is a strong view as to how we should proceed.  No matter what the politics are or how simple it would seem to be to draw a line in the sand, either politically or morally, we must take on board all arguments.</P>
        <P>I read with interest the case being made regarding the progress made following the imposition of a ban in Sweden and it seems very convincing.  We have all received representations from people who argue that what has happened in Sweden is not as perfect or successful as was hoped for or that lessons can still be learned.  Before the Minister reaches a conclusion and devises a roadmap to legislation that I hope will lead to action being taken along the lines proposed by those behind the motion, we should have a higher level of debate and consultation.</P>
        <P>A political message must be sent from this House that we are appalled at the number of victims of prostitution and the sex industry in this country.  We are horrified by the trafficking of victims, generally young girls, and simply cannot allow it to continue.  Decisive political and legislative action must be taken, but when we change laws in this country, we must do so only after giving worthy and serious consideration to the effect.  We must also put in place the resources required to allow us to enact such laws fully.  The Government is very much in its infancy and this is only one of many serious political, social and economic problems to be dealt with.  I hope it will get it right rather than have it rushed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appreciate the sentiments expressed in the motion and sympathise with the idea presented.  I hope the Government in the reasonably near future will be able to act along the lines suggested.  I would like to hear from the Minister of State and hope she will outline a timeframe <Col N="765"/>which the Minister and his colleagues see as appropriate.  There is a grave social problem to which we cannot turn a blind eye, as we cannot ignore it and must do everything possible to solve it.  Those behind the motion have outlined how it can be tackled and solved and I am sympathetic to what is being proposed.  In moving the Government amendment, I suggest arguing a little time is needed for further reflection and consideration is not an excuse; rather, it is a reasonable intermediate response.  This will give us space to find the solution we all desire.  I, therefore, ask colleagues to reflect on the amendment and not to see it as an attempt to kick to touch but instead as the first step by the Government in opening a genuine debate which will result in the finding of a solution, not in three to five years time but in the near future.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank Senators Zappone and Mac  Conghail for their opening remarks on this motion and the Independent group for tabling it.  I also acknowledge the work Ruhama, the Immigrant Council of Ireland and the Turn off the Red Light campaign have done on this issue over a long time, but in particular in recent months, and in building a coalition across all sectors of Irish society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A debate took place at the Irish Medical Organisation&rsquo;s annual conference and doctors said action should be taken.  A debate has taken place in ICTU, Barnardos and 40 organisations which have come together in a coalition and decided this is the right approach to take.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports efforts to eradicate human trafficking and prostitution.  In government we passed the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act, which is acknowledged in the Government&rsquo;s amendment, that criminalised the trafficking in human beings for the purpose of exploitation.  We also set up anti-trafficking units in the Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE and the Legal Aid Board.  By bringing in anti-trafficking legislation and procedures, we acted to address the supply aspect of the equation, as recognised in international conventions against trafficking.  However, as Senators Zappone and Mac Conghail highlighted, trafficking is fuelled by the demands of the sex industry.  If the sex industry did not have an insatiable appetite for children, teenagers and girls to be trafficked into this country, they would not be here.  They are here because there is an appetite and a demand for them.  Traffickers go to great lengths to break the law and get women into this country because of the demand.  The Government amendment congratulates the work done on the supply side but to only look at that side is to completely miss the point.  We must look at demand.</P>
        <P>Senator Zappone highlighted the personal circumstances of women who have been trafficked into this country for sexual exploitation.  Figures I have seen from Ruhama on the number of women involved in prostitution are deeply upsetting.  Ruhama estimates that 1,000 women are selling sexual services in Ireland at any given time and said it has dealt with 140 women from 31 different countries, primarily from Nigeria but also from Romania, Albania and Ghana.</P>
        <P>Many Members attended the excellent presentation by the Turn off the Red Light group and the Not Natasha exhibition.  It brought home to us the personal stories.  What the man does not see when he makes his nice, comfortable choice to fork out &euro;50 for a woman&rsquo;s body, which is the only thing that is truly her own, is the woman who may have got into the industry at 13 years of age, who may have been abused at home as a girl, who may have children in her home country from whom she is separated and who may be afraid to get out of the industry because of what will happen to her children at home and of the gang which took her from her village and knows where her family live, which is the ultimate way to keep her under itscontrol.</P><Col N="766"/>
        <P>People like to glamorise the sex industry and put forward the view that the woman is an equal partner in some kind of legitimate transaction but they need to think about the Not Natasha exhibition and about other girls and their stories.  As Ruhama pointed out, the women involved in prostitution are some of the most vulnerable women in our society.  Typically, they face huge economic difficulties, including crippling debts.  They often have drug problems, many have been victims of abuse in childhood and most got involved in prostitution in their teens.  Prostitution for them is not some kind of balanced choice; it is nothing more than a survival strategy.</P>
        <P>As Senator Mac Conghail pointed out, by contrast, the men who buy sex have power, money and, at the end of the day, they go back to their nice lives and nice jobs unscarred while the woman is left with the impact of what has happened to her.</P>
        <P>Our laws on prostitution are totally inadequate.  Instead of recognising the woman as a victim, we stigmatise and criminalise her.  I know men are involved in prostitution as well but it is predominantly women.  We stigmatise and criminalise those who are involved and in doing so, we make it harder for them to exit the industry and for them to report abuse, seek help and access health and social services because they feel they have done something wrong.  Our laws state that they have done something wrong because the law on soliciting applies equally to the man and the woman.</P>
        <P Just="Left">No approach will be perfect and Members referred to alternative views put forward by other countries.  The reality is that the Swedish model has had a significant effect.  They have managed to reduce the number of women and men involved in prostitution.  The best part of the Swedish model is that it recognises that the woman is a victim and the man is involved in a relationship of abuse with the woman and it sends the right message.  Beyond the harsh criminal penalties set out, it educates society that it is not okay to buy somebody&rsquo;s dignity or body.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the motion tabled by the Independent group.  We agree, in large part, to the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  At best we hope it is genuine in saying that it is looking at this as a serious issue and that it wants further debate.  However, I do not accept there has not been public debate because, as I said, a range of organisations have been working on this issue quite publicly.  We are concerned that there is no timescale in the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  We hope the Minister of State will set out a clear mechanism for having a time-specific public consultation process which will mean a decision in the next few months and that this issue will not be kicked forward.  If it comes to a vote, we will support the Independent group&rsquo;s motion.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have been listening to the arguments of the Turn off the Red Light campaign, Stop Trafficking, in which I was involved in Cork, Ruhama and all the other NGOs involved in the campaigns down through the years and I sometimes think it is quite difficult to have a debate on the law in a dispassionate way in that one is dealing with a subject which is emotional, rightly so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fully accept it is quite difficult to have a dispassionate debate on the exploitation of children, whether male or female, and on women or men involved in prostitution, whether trying to earn a living, as a result of being trafficked or being used by other people.  I also accept that there has been debate among various groups.  The NGOs in this area have informed us extraordinarily well.  The Government&rsquo;s amendment refers to bringing this to a broader audience rather than a broader debate, with which no one would disagree.  That needs to happen.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Independent Senators on tabling this motion.  It is an excellent subject for Private Members&rsquo; time.  I hope this debate, however it may pan out, will be the start of the political-public discourse that needs to happen in this area.  It is very important that we start <Col N="767"/>from here with the knowledge we have received from the debate up to this point.  Those of us who have been involved with and informed by other groups have a degree of knowledge which can be brought to a wider audience.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senators who tabled the motion on an issue which causes incalculable harm and acute distress to untold numbers of women and children.  The amendment to the motion calls for a public debate on the issue of criminalising the purchase of sex.  By tabling the motion, Senators have facilitated that debate and I will take careful note of what they have to say.  There are more Members in the Chamber tonight than on any previous occasion I have been here.  I am sure Members agree this issue should not be allowed to become a political football.  We all share the desire to deal as effectively as we can with the immeasurable harm caused by prostitution and trafficking.  This debate presents a useful opportunity to consider what measures might be effective because, even if there is not full agreement on the precise measures to be taken, we can at least advance an informed public debate on the issues involved.</P>
        <P>Mental and physical harm and violence can be intrinsic to prostitution and women caught up in it experience objectification and dehumanisation.  Many of the women involved in prostitution have limited life choices, whether because of poverty or the circumstances of their lives.  They are often vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation by others.  It is hardly credible to believe they are providing sexual services for a commercial return as a result of a free choice and the physical and emotional consequences they suffer make this clear.  For the wider society, prostitution presents a serious social problem and, with increasing globalisation, an increasingly complex one.  It is not always the case anymore that one can reach the women while they are on street.  While I am concentrating on the plight of women caught up in prostitution, I am conscious that other forms of prostitution are equally objectionable and can exploit young men, in particular.  The Minister shares the view expressed in the first part of the motion that trafficking for sexual exploitation is a modern form of slavery and a form of sexual abuse.  The amendment builds on this by deploring any form of sexual exploitation which might be financial but could also manifest itself in other ways such as emotionally and which represents an attack on the core of a person&rsquo;s dignity.  The amendment abhors, in particular, the trafficking of children.</P>
        <P>This debate is taking place in the context of legislative changes in Sweden and subsequently in Norway and Iceland.  In Sweden since 1999 a person who obtains or attempts a casual sexual relation in any place in return for payment commits the offence of purchase of sexual service.  The legislation applies equally to men and women.  In addition to money, payment can be made by means of, for example, alcohol or drugs.  A person, other than the person who avails himself or herself of the sexual service, who provides or promises the consideration also commits an offence.  I understand the penalties are a fine or imprisonment for a maximum of 12 months.  The offences appear to be absolute liability offences, as there is no specific legal defence available to defendants.  The legislation is focused on addressing demand for sexual services.  The rationale behind criminalising the buyer rather than the seller is the prostitute is the weaker party and, therefore, being exploited.  The main purpose of the legislation is to criminalise the purchase of sex and protect those who are or risk of becoming involved in prostitution.  A second purpose which is regarded as equally important is to create an environment which promotes gender equality and human rights.  I understand why that rationale is worth pursuing.</P>
        <P>In July last year the Swedish Government presented findings from Sweden&rsquo;s first formal evaluation of its ban on the purchase of sexual services.  The evaluation readily admitted that analysing the effects of the ban on the purchase of sexual services proved to be a difficult task because prostitution and human trafficking by their nature are clandestine activities and use of the Internet as a new arena for prostitution makes it difficult to assess its prevalence.  Consequently, knowledge of the scale of prostitution and human trafficking for sexual purposes is limited.  This is particularly the case outside Sweden&rsquo;s main cities.  Despite these reservations, <Col N="768"/>the inquiry team felt that it was possible to draw conclusions based on the material to which it had access.  The evaluation concluded that the incidence of street prostitution had been halved since the ban, representing a real reduction in the incidence of prostitution overall.  The ban is also believed to act as a barrier to human traffickers and procurers who might otherwise consider establishing operations in Sweden.  Given the clandestine nature of prostitution and human trafficking, it was always going to be difficult to source reliable data to assess the effectiveness of the ban.  However, even making allowances for this serious constraint and assuming there was sufficient material available to permit conclusions to be drawn, a number of critics have argued that the findings are tenuous, inherently biased and speculative.  I mention these criticisms not to question the value of the experience in Sweden but to recognise the complexity of the issues involved.</P>
        <P>Dignity is an EU funded research project examining services provided for victims of human trafficking with a view to replicating best practice models in partner countries, one of which is Ireland.  In September 2010 Dignity arranged a trip to Sweden by a group which included representatives of what was then the Department of Justice and Law Reform and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss with officials and experts the Swedish legislation and its operation.  A report was prepared by the Department for the then Minister following the trip and after consideration it was submitted to the Office of the Attorney General.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, has carefully examined the report, as well as the advice subsequently received from the Attorney General.  He recognises there is public interest in the Swedish experience following the legislation introduced there.  To inform public debate, he intends to make arrangements for putting the report in the public domain on Monday.</P>
        <P>The current law relating to prostitution in Ireland contains offences which are aimed at the purchaser of sexual services, as well as the provider of such services.  In this area, criminal law has traditionally had two objectives.  The first objective is protecting society from the more intrusive aspects of such activity from a public order perspective.  For that reason, under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 which codified the law relating to prostitution, it is an offence to solicit in a street or public place for the purposes of prostitution.  The offence can be committed by the client, the prostitute or a third party such as a pimp.  The second objective is to protect prostitutes from exploitation.  Accordingly, under the 1993 legislation, it is an offence to organise prostitution, coerce or compel a person to be a prostitute, knowingly live off the earnings of a prostitute or keep or manage a brothel.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the law in this area is protection.  It is, however, not an offence in itself to sell sex, nor is it, in general, an offence to purchase sex.  Consequently, the general position is that neither party to the transaction is criminalised.  Much of the motion refers to criminalisation of the purchase of sex in the context of trafficking.  Trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is a monstrous wrong and we must do everything we can to combat it.  Thankfully, Ireland has strong legislation in place to combat the trafficking of human beings for sexual exploitation.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 gives effect to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations to criminalise human trafficking as set out in the various international instruments governing human trafficking.  The Act provides for penalties of up to life imprisonment for anyone found guilty of trafficking persons, including for the purpose of sexual exploi<Col N="769"/>tation.  Specifically in relation to the sexual exploitation of trafficked persons, under the Act, it is an offence punishable by a fine or a term of up to five years imprisonment, or both, to solicit a trafficked person in any place, whether public or private, for the purpose of prostitution.  A number of provisions in the Act also offer protection under the criminal law to trafficked persons.</P>
        <P>It has been already pointed out that four dedicated units have been established in State organisations to address this issue.  A dedicated anti-trafficking unit in the Department of Justice and Equality is working with other statutory, non-governmental and international organisations to co-ordinate and implement Government policy and to put in place arrangements to give effect to Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations regarding this issue.  A dedicated unit in the national immigration bureau of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a lead role in the policing aspects of this issue.  A dedicated unit in the HSE is developing and implementing an individual case plan for each potential victim.  A dedicated unit in the Legal Aid Board provides legal advice to victims.  Dedicated officials in the new communities and asylum seekers unit in the Department of Social Protection help people who are not in the asylum system but have been granted temporary residence to access a wide range of State services, such as accommodation and other State benefits.  Furthermore, dedicated personnel in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions deal with the prosecution of these cases.</P>
        <P>Other measures that are in place include a national action plan to prevent and combat trafficking in human beings.  The action plan, which was published in June 2009, covers the period up to 2012.  The multidisciplinary partnership approach that is being pursued was exemplified by the establishment of a round-table forum of non-governmental, governmental and international organisations.  Many of the measures being taken to address human trafficking have received favourable commendation nationally and internationally.  Having said that, I do not claim that everything is perfect &mdash; we all know it is not &mdash; or that there is no room for more to be done.  There is an absolute need for State agencies and non-governmental organisations, particularly those that support victims, to continue to work together to deal with this issue.  The collective co-operation of all of these people will enable preventative measures to be put in place, victims to be protected and perpetrators to be apprehended and brought to justice.  The Minister has assured me of his commitment to ensuring those goals continue to be met.</P>
        <P>The law relating to prostitution is being enforced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Some 67 cases of brothel keeping were detected in 2010.  In the same year, three cases of the organisation of prostitution and 135 cases of other offences relating to prostitution, including soliciting, were detected.  In the first half of this year, some 24 cases of brothel keeping, ten cases of the organisation of prostitution and 110 cases of other prostitution offences, including soliciting, were detected.  An example of Garda activity is Operation Kerb in the Bridewell Garda district of the Dublin metropolitan region.  This operation focuses on prosecuting people who solicit for the purpose of obtaining sexual services and seeks to divert women who engage in street-based prostitution.  As part of the operation, the Garda established contact with a number of stakeholders, including the Probation Service and some non-governmental organisations.  Ruhama&rsquo;s outreach van was deployed for additional contact with those involved in prostitution.  As a result of the operation, over 60 males have been charged with soliciting offences.  There also has been a series of Garda operations to target trafficking.</P>
        <P>The motion before the House calls on the Government to introduce legislation criminalising the purchase of sex.  While it is inevitable that there will be conflicting views about such a proposal, we all recognise that any proposal to criminalise the purchase of sex within our legal framework raises complex issues.  Senator Zappone inquired about the legalities of such issues.  A provision in the substantially different constitutional and legal framework of one jurisdiction cannot be simply transposed into another jurisdiction&rsquo;s constitutional and legal framework.  In <Col N="770"/>mentioning some of these issues, I am not dismissing the Swedish model out of hand but trying to ensure the debate on it and other international approaches is as informed as possible.  That is what we need.  If the Swedish approach were adopted in this jurisdiction, one party only to a two-party transaction between consenting adults would be guilty of an offence.  The buyer only would be culpable and subject to penalty, with all that entails. The buyer would have no defence in law and the seller would not commit any offence in respect of the receipt of a consideration for sexual services.</P>
        <P>Senators with a legal background will be aware that strict liability cannot apply because the Supreme Court has ruled that a defence must be possible.  That is the difficulty.  These are issues we are talking about and the Attorney General is looking at.  One of the difficulties we have relates to strict liability.  In its ruling on the CC case, the Supreme Court said there has to be a defence.  It is not that the proposal is being dismissed &mdash; it is that this serious difficulty needs to be considered.  As I said, if we were to introduce this law, the buyer would have no defence in law and the seller would not commit any offence in respect of the receipt of a consideration for sexual services.  This is despite the fact that the seller may have been the party who initiated the transaction and been a willing party to the act.  Criminalising one party only in this manner, if it was not clearly justifiable on objective grounds, could be open to constitutional challenge in this jurisdiction.  By the same token, there obviously would be concerns about criminalising the sale of sex by exploited people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I said, the Swedish offence appears to be one of strict liability.  Senators may recall that there are difficulties in this jurisdiction in establishing offences of strict and absolute liability, arising from the Supreme Court decision in the CC case.  This resulted in the offence of carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 15, under section 1(1) of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 1935, being struck down.  The defendant could not plead any defence and the girl could not be prosecuted.  The court found that the form of absolute liability in the provision was inconsistent with the Constitution.  Senators can read the remaining two pages of my speech if they wish.  There are other issues at stake, but the question of strict liability is the one with which we will have the greatest difficulty.  We will have to find a way around it and be very careful in doing so.  We have to examine this problem.  It will be part and parcel of whatever we eventually come up with.  I know this is very important to Senators &mdash; it is very important to me as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Dignity report will be published at the start of next week.  That, with this evening&rsquo;s debate, should kick-start a broader debate.  It is not that there has not been a debate &mdash; there has been a clear and informed debate.  We need a broader debate about where we go.  I spoke to the Minister for Justice and Equality before I came to the Chamber.  Ultimately, that is where the matter will lie.  He told me he is prepared to ask for submissions from the public as part of the consultation process.  Not only will people be able to make written submissions, but they will also be able to discuss the matter at the public meetings around the country that I am sure various non-governmental organisations will arrange.  All of the submissions will be considered by the Government, having been first presented to the Attorney General.  The advice of the Attorney General will be brought to the Government.  He is talking about doing that within six months.  He feels that will give us sufficient leeway.  We need to be realistic about the need to free up the bills office to deal with the amount of legislation that is coming through relating to our finances and the economy.  We have to be realistic about that.  All of that legislation is coming down the track at us.  This debate needs to take place as part of the process of better informing the public.  We need to deal with certain issues and arrive at a formula that allows us to deal with the question of strict liability.  It is clear that it will be an issue.  I welcome <Col N="771"/>this evening&rsquo;s incredible debate.  I appreciate very much what the Independent Senators have done.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Having listened to the Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation of the Government&rsquo;s position, I know her heart is in the right place.  However, it seems very much to be a case of &ldquo;Lord, make me chaste, but not yet&rdquo;.  The Government is exuding a lot of support for the good intentions behind the proposal, but it is advancing some pretty thin arguments as to why it should not take the step reasonable people think it should take.</P>
        
        <P>I draw attention to two points.  First, the motion contains a bizarre warning &mdash; I am not sure from what kind of civil servant mentality it springs &mdash; against &ldquo;the possible prosecution of individuals in circumstances in which a gift is given to a person with whom they had a sexual encounter&rdquo;.  That is a perverse, twisted argument to make and it could equally be applied to drug taking.  One could say we will not prosecute anybody for taking payment for giving someone drugs because they might have taken them together and one might have given the other a gift at the end.  That argument insults our intelligence and calls the Government&rsquo;s bona fides into question.</P>
        
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The second point is that although I do not blame the Minister of State for it, I consider as bogus the reference to strict liability being an issue.  I look forward to hearing Senator Ivana Bacik&rsquo;s contribution on this point.  If one examines the jurisprudence, the decisions of the courts and the various arguments made, I do not believe the courts have in any sense found there is a problem with strict liability offences <i>per se</i> in circumstances where what we are dealing with is an offence in the context of activity which is against public policy.  The only difficulty I see is that the President might be tempted to refer the legislation to the Supreme Court for a ruling on its constitutionality under Article 26.  The Minister of State should not worry about this prematurely, as it would be possible to get around it and legislate for strict liability offences in the way proposed.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider the difference between the 200 and 20,000.  Which would she prefer &mdash; the situation in Stockholm where only 200 women are currently involved in prostitution because it is a crime to purchase sex, or the situation in Barcelona where 20,000 are involved?  A Swedish police officer, Detective Superintendent Jonas Trolle, participated in the recent round table seminar organised by Ruhama and the Immigrant Council of Ireland in order to brief various stakeholders such as the Garda, the HSE, the PSNI and so on.  He made the point that prostitution was always connected with organised crime.</P>
        <P>There are two reasons we should criminalise the purchase of sex.  One is that by so doing we would help to make this country a cold house for traffickers, those who traffic others for the purposes of sexual or other forms of exploitation.  There are those who argue that what one is trying to do in criminalising the purchase of sex is to target prostitution in order to deal with the narrower problem of trafficking.  Reference was rightly made by Senator Fiach Mac Conghail to the British legislation.  Some progress has been made in the United Kingdom because the British have provided for the concept of strict liability, whereby it is not a defence for a person to say he or she did not know the person from whom they purchased sex was an exploited person or subject to exploitation.  That is going much further than we dared to go a few years ago in the human trafficking legislation in Ireland, legislation to which I tabled an amendment.  It was pointed out at yesterday&rsquo;s briefing which I found helpful that a problem with the British <Col N="772"/>law was that because one was required to prove a person had been trafficked, this made the burden of proof more difficult and that it was relatively onerous to secure prosecutions in circumstances where it was a summary offence.  That is why the two issues are <i>fite fuaite</i>, interconnected.  By targeting prostitution <i>per se</i> &mdash; the purchase of sex from others &mdash; one targets an activity from which traffickers and other criminals profit.</P>
        <P>The second reason is that we would be targeting a social evil.  The truth is that the sex industry lies to people as well as about people.  It lies when it states people are absolutely free to do what they want with the bodies of others, provided certain technicalities are complied with to do with age and consent.  We had discussions in this country recently about the importance of maintaining respect for the age of consent.  Consent is a very difficult issue to assess, but there are categories in society which we know must be protected by insisting that in certain circumstances one simply cannot consent to something.  The sex industry lies, therefore, when it pretends there is meaningful consent where a person from a background of poverty and perhaps abuse has been coerced or lured by the promise of a better life and is then gradually or perhaps quickly disabused of the notion she had about having a better and dignified life in a new and strange country by being deprived of access to family, friends, a common language or networks of support and protection.  The sex industry lies when it states some good can be achieved for persons with a disability or who are socially inhibited by permitting them to purchase sex from others involved in prostitution.  It lies when it denies that much deeper care is called for in all of these situations.</P>
        <P>It comes down in the end to what we consider what the law should be about.  Is it to be about the bare minimum of rules to allow members of society to enjoy maximum freedom and enjoyment of their lives and opportunities, or is it about something more proactive and protective, something which intervenes to secure social good for people, including their protection at the deepest level?  There is a real danger we could minimise the concept of harm compared to issues we can easily identify such as rape or murder when we can see that a person has been harmed.  I am often reminded of the phrase <i>Slayer of the Soul</i>, the title of a book by Stephen Rossetti to describe the impact of child abuse.  Prostitution is also a murky area of life that involves people&rsquo;s souls being destroyed.  It was the columnist Breda O&rsquo;Brien who asked in <i>The Irish Times</i> a few years ago what young girl grew up with an aspiration to some day to become involved in prostitution.  What personal stories lie behind the technical consent given by a person involved in prostitution?  What sickness is there in our society that, at a minimum, we do not see that we should discourage and criminalise behaviour which involves the instrumentalisation, the use and abuse, of another person in this most intimate and significant area of their lives, namely, their sexuality?</P>
        <P>We have to get away from the laddish individualism that pretends that what we are dealing with are two consenting adults who decide to engage in a contract with each other.  One can contract obligations in the sale of goods in certain circumstances, but one should never be allowed to try to induce another to contract in such a way as not to show fundamental respect for their basic human dignity.  That is what is involved when we propose we should criminalise the purchase of sex from persons involved in prostitution.  One is saying pimps and the users of persons involved in prostitution should be allowed to induce persons from an extremely victimised background to contract to avoid their entitlement to respect for their human dignity.  It is an absolutely intolerable proposition.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and thank and commend Senator Katherine Zappone and the other Independent Senators for bringing forward the motion.  This is a very important debate that has been ongoing for some time, as acknowledged by the Minister of State and others.  I also thank and commend the many NGOs which have been working on this issue for many years, notably Ruhama which has been working on the front line with women engaged in prostitution.</P>
        <P>I commend the Turn Off the Red Light campaign which was commenced to bring to an end prostitution and sex trafficking in Ireland.  Many of us, including the Minister of State, were present at the launch of the campaign in Buswells some time ago.  The Labour Party is one of the 40 organisations which signed up to it.  I am proud to represent the Labour Party, which fully supports the aim of ensuring the putting in place of legislation to criminalise the purchase of sex.  All Members agree with the aim of the Independent Senators, which is to put forward a legislative model in Ireland that is robust, will work within our constitutional system and will ensure the same outcome that has been achieved in Sweden.  Like other Members, I have read the ten-year evaluation of the Swedish legislation.  I had been interested to ascertain how that model has worked and there were some highly positive and exciting findings, notably that street prostitution has halved in Sweden since the introduction of that legislation.  Moreover, as others have mentioned, Norway has followed suit.  However, as Senator Power acknowledged, it is vital to build a coalition on this issue and the success of the Turn off the Red Light campaign to date is that it has built a broad-based coalition of different groups comprising civil society groups, political parties, trade unions and so on.  One must move forward with this united front to legislate in a way that will stand up within our system.</P>
        <P>That said, it is understandable that many would have found the Government&rsquo;s counter-motion and its wording somewhat disappointing in that it appears to suggest there is no sense of urgency in moving forward to the legislative model.  I assure the Independent Senators in particular, as well as colleagues on the other side of the House, this is not the Government&rsquo;s intention and certainly as far as the Labour Party is concerned, as the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has stated, it will be pressing in government to ensure the introduction of this legislation.  However, as the Minister of State also observed, one cannot simply transpose the exact same model from a very different legal system.  Particular issues arise in this jurisdiction and one must ensure the legislation one introduces is robust.  I speak as someone who has defended successfully some women accused of offences under the 1993 Act under which, as the figures demonstrate, it is extremely difficult to prosecute.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has clarified the wording of the motion and has assured Members there is a sense of urgency at Government level and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has already taken some concrete steps to further matters.  On Monday, he will publish the Dignity Project report arising out of his examination of the Swedish law and I understand that within six months, either the Minister himself or the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will return to this House to report on progress that has been made.  The Minister of State has referred to submissions being invited, which would be useful.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which Senator Bradford, other Senators and I are members, would be a useful forum in which to take submissions on potential models for the legislation and on how the legislation might be framed.  The joint committee is doing this at present in respect of the vetting bureau Bill and will do so with regard to the withholding of information Bill.  It is carrying out similar exercises on legislation that have complex drafting <Col N="774"/>aspects and would be a useful forum.  I am reassured by the Minister of State&rsquo;s statement to the effect there will be urgency in this regard and the Government will move forward in line with Labour Party policy and the intentions of the Turn off the Red Light campaign.</P>
        <P>I will comment briefly on the history of legislation in this regard in Ireland.  It has tended, the 1993 Act follows this model, to criminalise only the public display of the sale of sex and not the sale or purchase of sex itself directly and the Minister of State has referred to this.  Our legislation prohibits loitering or soliciting for the purpose of prostitution, which of course means that those who seek to purchase sex, the clients, are criminalised and in some cases usually are prosecuted with more frequency than the women themselves.  However, this is of course only where loitering or soliciting is done in public and there are quite difficult evidential barriers to get over when prosecuting.  The origins of the Act date back to 19th-century law in which criminalisation of prostitution again was based on public order legislation.  I refer to the Vagrancy Act 1824, which penalised the common prostitutes and to the horrendous Contagious Diseases Acts 1864 to 1869, which provided for compulsory incarceration for prostitutes.</P>
        <P>The 1993 Act, which was introduced to try to reform the law, certainly was a great improvement on what had gone before when some horrifically repressive legislation had been in place.  It did at least create gender-neutral offences for the first time and no longer simply criminalised the women.  Moreover, as the Minister of State noted, it also introduced offences in respect of brothel-keeping, as well as offences that were much more protective of those who were engaged in prostitution.  Unfortunately, however, it retained those traditional elements of loitering and soliciting and clearly the main thrust of the legislation was to try to control the display of prostitution in public.  This concern perhaps was based on a political concern to protect neighbourhoods and so-called respectable society from this public display.  The trafficking legislation, which was passed much more recently, shows the change in thinking and is much more concerned about protecting the victim.  However, some evidential difficulties have also been identified with this legislation.  This is also perhaps a consequence of the Supreme Court judgment in the CC case, with which some of us disagreed fundamentally, which overturned the strict liability offence of unlawful carnal knowledge and provided that a defence must be present where someone states he or she made a mistake as to the age of the underage child.  This may be an issue that must be grappled with in framing a Swedish-style law prohibiting solely the purchase of sex or in other words, the Swedish model of criminalising the buyers that tackles demand rather than supply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Government counter-motion, the Independent Senators and everyone else acknowledge, it is of course not simply about legislation and other ways must also be considered to tackle demand in particular, and to seek to end exploitation.  I note the Turn off the Red Light campaign and others have been looking at ways of closing down telephone lines or websites because the manifest advertising of telephone lines or websites is perhaps the most obvious proof of prostitution.  The Swedish evaluation demonstrates the potential that lies in the model being used there to criminalise the clients and to focus on demand.  It also demonstrates a way forward away from the old model, on which Ireland has been far too reliant in the past, of criminalising only public display in criminalising loitering and soliciting in a public order sense.  All Members are united in their desire to see a fundamental shift in the law away from the emphasis on public order and towards protection of the victim and a recognition of those engaged in prostitution as victims themselves, be they victims of trafficking or of exploitation even if they have not been trafficked.  This is the great merit of the Swedish legislation and is what we must replicate in Ireland.  However, the Government side can assure Members on <Col N="775"/>both sides of the House that all are united in that aim.  It is in this spirit that I second the amendment and I am greatly reassured by that to which the Minister of State has committed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I support the motion tabled by what one might call the Independent Senators on the Government side.  I fully respect and pay tribute to the work done by the Turn off the Red Light campaign.  Moreover, when the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 passed through this House, I expressed to the then Minister my reservations that while the legislation was welcome, it did not go far enough.  I was briefed by Ruhama at least twice before and during the passage of that Act through the House and it was with a heavy heart that, under the Whip, I walked through the Government lobby to bring into law the Act in its existing form.  It is now time to revisit this issue.  I do not wish to make a political play out of this and I respect the bona fides of the Minister of State.  However, a significant case has been put forward by Senator Zappone and others, as well as by Senator Power, on where this issue is going.  It is a kind of myth that this issue is new and a rethink is required.  While I accept a co-ordinated approach must be taken to the subject, the entire area of prostitution, the plight of prostitutes and of sex for sale is at least 5,000 or 6,000 years old and has been well debated before this.</P>
        <P>As for the trafficking of human beings and their unfortunate situations, I am given to understand by some NGO groups that in Ireland, a substantial number of the women who are involved regrettably have been brought from outside of Ireland from eastern Europe, Africa or wherever.  In the case of some, I am unsure whether they are here of their own free will, etc.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 prohibited the purchase of sex from a trafficked person and it is time to examine the whole area of strict liability, which the then Minister trotted out at the time, and the advice of the Attorney General.  While I do not blame the Minister of State, the legislation should be framed such that there should be a <i>prima facie</i> case against someone caught purchasing sex, mainly men.  It would then be up to that person in a court of law to rebut that <i>prima facie</i> case being put by the prosecution &mdash; it might not need to be absolute.  In that regard the man in question, who might be married or single, would need to explain in court to his wife, partner, daughter, mother or sister what had gone on.  That in itself would certainly bring a fresh dimension to the whole area.  I would say to the Turn off the Red Light campaign, Ruhama and others that they have achieved a considerable amount in even educating people such as us in the past decade.  Whether it is today&rsquo;s motion or otherwise, this is another tightening of the belt, so to speak, on this appalling situation.  If they do not turn off the red light, they will certainly dim it severely and they must be encouraged to work in that direction, although we may never have a utopian situation.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik mentioned that the CC case was not entirely to her liking as a barrister.  There is a strong view within the Bar Council and senior lawyers that the CC case if revisited in the High Court or the Supreme Court, if it is a constitutional case, might come to a different view.  Perhaps a test case is needed as I believe the view expounded by the court in the CC case could and should be revisited.  Law is not as permanent as a block of concrete; it evolves and changes, and precedent can evolve again.  The Minister of State should not get totally bogged down.  I know she must respect the Attorney General&rsquo;s views and advice, which imposes constraints.  We can go a long way down the road in legislation to try to accept what has been set down in the Independent Senators&rsquo; views.  We should not be afraid of another challenge in the courts.  If legislation is introduced and challenged, it might come as no great surprise to certain people that, if challenged in a test case in two, three or five years, it might be revoked.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the justice spokesman on this side, I support the motion and if there is to be a division I will certainly vote with the Independent group.  I thank my colleague Senator Power for leading off from this side of the House.  I am here to support this appropriate and important motion.  I <Col N="776"/>laud the Independent group for tabling it.  I do not want to be political and understand the Minister of State is anxious to revisit the issue.  However, time is of the essence and we have wasted too much time in the past decade on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  To some extent I concur with much of what has been said here today.  This is a grave social problem based on the abuse of human beings and in this case the abuse of women and girls.  I compliment the courage of the Independent Senators in tabling this timely motion.  It is time for us to view this as a very serious crime against women, not just making women victims, but making them completely inferior.  Women enter prostitution on the false promise of a good job or a new life.  They are sometimes sold by a partner or are kidnapped.  They can find themselves in poverty and homeless and many have drug and alcohol addictions.  I compliment the work of Ruhama.  As the previous speaker said, it has educated us over time as have the coalition of organisations represented by Turn off the Red Light.</P>
        <P>Prostitution is an industry and has become more high tech, which makes it more invisible and harder to trap.  It is a global issue with people trafficked into this country from 31 foreign countries.  There is also a European dimension which has not been addressed in the Minister of State&rsquo; earlier contribution.  If she responds later, I ask her to address how it is being tackled on a Europe-wide basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fully support the legislation to penalise the purchase of sex.  No woman standing here today could but support the evidence to show that the Swedish model is working.  I ask the Minister of State to request the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to as quickly as possible come up with a model of legislation that will not fall under constitutional challenge.  I am pleased the Minister of State has put a six-month timeframe on that.  If she responds at the end of the debate I ask her to state whether we will have a framework in six months.  What will we have in six months?  Before the Swedish legislation was introduced, one in eight men bought sex and that is now down to one in 40.  There is clear evidence that it is deterring men from purchasing sex and in doing so reducing the attraction of sex trafficking.  There was significant public support in Sweden with approximately 80% in favour of the Act.  It is bringing about gender equality, which is difficult to do.</P>
        <P>We need a wider public debate on the issue of the early sexualisation of girls.  In a way that is a precursor to seeing women as prostitutes.  As a mother of a young girl, I am very concerned about this.  The ISPCC study published yesterday indicated that one in six second level students has physically met a stranger whom he or she first met online.  Often when meeting it became clear that the person who did the enticing had lied about his or her age and identity, which links into very risky behaviour and the area of paedophilia.  Parents are often unaware of what children are viewing not just when computers are based in bedrooms, which is often the case, but even when they are in living rooms.  The study indicated that a person under 18 spends on average one to three hours daily on the Internet.  Education is needed on privacy settings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Guardian</i> newspaper reported that the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, is holding a summit on the dangers of the Internet.  This has come as a result of the riots in the UK and his need to keep women voters happy.  We must have a rigorous clamp-down on the sexualisation of children, particularly young girls.  This involves advertising and the national broadcaster can play a role in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I completely support the thrust of everything that has been said here today.  I support the amendment on the basis that we have a six month timeframe.  I presume that we will have something back in this House by March 2012.  I echo what Senator Bacik said in wanting to see legislation drafted with sufficiently good legal advice in order that it is not open to consti<Col N="777"/>tutional challenge.  I look forward to tracking the progress of such legislation because we must put the dignity of the human being &mdash; the dignity of the woman &mdash; first.  Such women are victims and are clearly being made to seem inferior by this age-old profession.  I hate that term being used as a means to justify it.  It is time it stopped and let us in this House act in unison to ensure that happens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State back to the House and commend the independent group for tabling this very important motion.  I support its broad thrust and the sentiments expressed by the Senators who proposed and seconded it in a very forthright and passionate way.  Human trafficking, primarily of women, but unfortunately, sometimes children and even a small minority of men, is cruel, inhumane, indecent, immoral and a form of modern-day slavery, as the motion states.  It is important that all politicians do what they can to tackle this issue in a comprehensive way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I listened to what the Minister of State had to say and the Government representatives had to say.  I also listened to what Senator Mac Conghail said when he asked whether the amendment tabled was an attempt by the Government to deflect or to stymie the thrust of the motion &mdash; he used the word &ldquo;insult&rdquo; as well &mdash; or whether it was an admission by the Government that the <i>status quo</i> was working.  He was very passionate on the issue and I support everything he said, but I must be fair and honest as well.  I do not believe the Government amendment was an insult to the people who tabled the motion.  I do not believe it is a statement from the Government that the <i>status quo</i> is working.  Listening to what the Minister said and what the Government representatives have said, I think they are very genuine in their concern about this issue.  No one in this House could stand over the trafficking of women or stand over the exploitation of women and children, and sometimes men as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, I am torn because I believe it is important we do not rush into introducing legislation.  I accept the points made that this issue has been in the public domain for a long time and has been discussed politically for many years, and I would have been part of many discussions about it.  In fairness to the Government, it is a complex issue to legislate for.  The Government should be given some time and space to come forward with legislation that is comprehensive, that will work and that will not have unforeseen consequences.  Some people here may not agree with that, but I am of the view that because of the importance of this issue and because our objectives are the same &mdash; to end the exploitation and the trafficking of women &mdash; we have to be absolutely clear that whatever legislation is in place works and makes it impossible for people to traffic women.  I want this to end.  I want to make it absolutely impossible for anyone to be able to traffic women and use them in the most degrading way, as Senators pointed out.  I find it abhorrent that this happens in any society.  It is one of the most indecent things that can be perpetrated against any individual.  However,  we also must get it right.  For that reason, I am minded to support the Government&rsquo;s amendment, not because I believe that the thrust of the motion tabled by the Independent Senators is wrong or damaging in any way but because I believe we need to give the Minister of State time.</P>
        <P>The way out of this &mdash; it is something that was sought by the Independent group &mdash; is an explicit commitment from the Minister of State that she will come back and give a clear explanation on what the Government will do.  If that was forthcoming from the Minister of State, perhaps the Independent Senators would also support the Government amendment.  Senator van Turnhout said in her contribution that we are not going away.  We are not going away.</P>

We can make sure the promise made today and the commitments we have received from the representatives of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, who spoke very passionately and who share our concerns, are upheld in six months.  If the Government does not come back with legislation in six months, there is a responsibility on us all to come back here and put pressure on the Government, and I would then accept the thrust of today&rsquo;s motion.  However, at this stage I cannot do so and for the reasons outlined, I will support the Government amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  The impetus for this motion has been the tremendous work of the Turn Off the Red Light campaign to end prostitution and combat sex trafficking in Ireland.  I commend the campaign for highlighting the intrinsic link between the demand for prostitution and the trafficking of women and girls to meet this demand.  The majority of members of Turn Off the Red Light are civil society groups and NGOs that have direct experience of the devastating effects of prostitution on women, children and men throughout Ireland.  These devastating effects are physical, such as sexually transmitted infections, injuries sustained as a result of beatings and rapes, gynaecological problems owing to multiple terminations of pregnancy and many other health conditions relating to prostitution.  There are also mental and emotional injuries deeply embedded in the psyche of sex workers and victims of trafficking which are likely to be carried throughout their lives.</P>
        <P>Senators Zappone and Mac Conghail have excellently outlined the views of our group, which I fully support.  Therefore, in my intervention I will focus on the situation for children.  As devastating as these effects are on adults, the impact is almost unimaginable for children and child victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation.  I have researched with interest some of the arguments against criminalising the purchase of sex in Ireland and I find myself wholly unconvinced by them.  One argument contends that criminalising the purchase of sex in an effort to curb prostitution violates a sex worker&rsquo;s right to exercise self-determination over her own body.  I must respectfully disagree.  It is my belief that when the complex layers of how and why women and men find themselves selling their bodies for sexual gratification of others are peeled away, their paths into prostitution did not start with the simple exercise of their right to self-determination of their bodies.  For those who argue that prostitution is an issue of consent, I would ask these people to be mindful that the age identified internationally for entry into prostitution is 14, an age at which consent cannot be given.</P>
        <P>I would also like to highlight the situation for young homeless people.  Focus Ireland estimates that there are as many as 1,500 young people under the age of 18 who are homeless each year in Ireland, 18% of whom are unaccompanied and one quarter of whom are under 12.  There is inadequate resourcing in this area and there are an insufficient number of places for children in safe, sheltered accommodation.  Some are said to be forced into prostitution.  An increase in substance abuse among homeless youths, especially males, has also seen an increased recourse to prostitution and there is evidence to suggest that boys as young as 13 are involved in prostitution in Dublin city.</P>
        <P>Separated children or unaccompanied minors are under 18 years of age, outside their country of origin and separated from both of their parents or their previous legal customary primary care giver.  Separated children are an extremely vulnerable group owing to their status, the fact they may have experienced war and violence, and the danger that they have been trafficked into Ireland for sexual exploitation.  There have been improvements in the situation for separated children in Ireland under the Ryan report implementation plan, and measures have been taken, such as DNA identification, to tackle false family reunifications.</P><Col N="779"/>
        <P>However, the instances of children going missing from care are of deep concern.  This morning in this very Chamber, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs told us that there are 16 cases of children missing in Ireland still outstanding in 2010 alone, and 11 of those are unaccompanied minors.  There is strong anecdotal evidence that a number of these children could have been trafficked into prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation.  In September 2011, the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance submitted to the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s anti-human trafficking unit collated case studies of suspected and confirmed child victims of trafficking in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P Just="Left">I will now briefly outline these cases which paint a picture of dreadful exploitation.  They include the following: a 15 year old Somali rescued from a brothel in 2006 having been trafficked into Ireland; a 16 year old Nigerian girl who arrived to Ireland as a separated child in 2009 and was enticed out of HSE residential care by a man who later got her involved in prostitution; and a 16 year old girl from Burundi, held captive in a house in County Louth and abused.  She was taken from her village in Africa at the age of 12 and introduced into sex slavery in different countries before being trafficked to Ireland for more sexual exploitation.</P>
        <P>I have also heard dreadful accounts by an NGO, which were subsequently documented, of eastern European girls as young as 14 being trafficked to Ireland, brutally and systematically raped over a number of days to &ldquo;break them in&rdquo; and then shipped off to various brothels around Ireland.  This intolerable situation is my motivation for fully supporting the motion proposed by the Independent Group.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Senator Zappone has already mentioned, the sex industry in Ireland is extremely lucrative.  Children continue to be victims of prostitution and trafficking because it is good business for organised criminals and traffickers.  After much research into this issue I firmly believe that legislation is needed.  I understand that the Minister says we need a wider public debate.  I would like to say I am reassured by what I have heard both from the Minister and the Government side, but I am not.  We have heard a lot of nice words and good sentiments but I would like to have seen much more detail in what is being put before us.  I note the six month timeframe that is given to us and our group must still decide whether we will move this motion to a vote.  We will certainly not be going away from this issue, however, because every day that passes there is a possibility of women and children being forced further into sexual exploitation in Ireland.  We have to take action.  We may have to allow the Minister of State some time, but it is a very short time because this is about human beings and people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister of State.  I am confident that whatever happens, at the end of the day she will take the right decision.  I assure my colleagues that I firmly support the campaign to end sex trafficking in Ireland.  I thank the Independent Senators for bringing this issue to the House again.  We discussed it previously in the last Seanad and had a good debate on it.  I sincerely believe, however, that the matter has to go beyond the Houses of the Oireachtas and become a national debate.</P>
        <P>I support the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion because the motion is too hasty.  Within my own party I have seen decisions being made too hastily to criminalise purchasers of sex.  We must study the Swedish model in more detail.  If women are disappearing off the streets, it means the problem is going underground.  Realistically, this has been going on since the beginning of time.  We have to face reality.  I am not condoning it but since the beginning of time sex has been purchased.  There is a case for saying that women are perhaps being protected from rape because in some countries prostitution is legalised.  Senator O&rsquo;Donnell should not be looking at me in amazement like that.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="780"/>

	<P>I am totally amazed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am giving my honest opinion.  It is too hasty to say over one day&rsquo;s debate that we should criminalise the purchase of sex.  That legislation would be totally wrong.  We need a national debate with the people in Ireland, not just in here.  We cannot be overwhelmed by the success of the Swedish model because there are many reports stating that the evidence of that model is not quite correct.</P>
        <P>I commend the Immigrant Council of Ireland for lobbying to improve the level of protection and services available to victims of trafficking.  I am totally opposed to all forms of trafficking, including labour and sexual trafficking.  Many Senators may be aware that al-Jazeera is currently running a weekly programme called &ldquo;Slavery: a 21st-century evil&rdquo;.  It claims that there are more slaves in the world today than there were at the height of the transatlantic slave trade from Africa to the colonies in North and South America.  The slave trade is now bigger than ever before.  The most widely accepted international figure for the number of slaves is 27 million men, women and children.  International experts, such as the academic campaigner Kevin Bales, have revealed evidence that it is cheaper to own a slave today than it was during the 19th century.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In order to have a national debate, we must listen to the other side of the argument.  I am sure that all Senators have received e-mails from the Turn off the Blue Light campaign, which is a small, sex worker-led association.  That organisation is campaigning for the health, safety, civil and labour rights of sex workers.  They have expressed a desire to stop trafficking, abuse and exploitation within the sex industry.  However, they strongly believe that criminalising the purchase of sex is not the answer and, in fact, would only serve to drive the sex industry further underground and make it more dangerous for everyone.  The Turn off the Blue Light campaign asks that before the Government even considers bringing in new prostitution laws, it should consult that organisation&rsquo;s views.</P>
        <P>I commend the Independent Senators for bringing this issue back onto the agenda, but as a true democrat I believe there should be no hasty legislation.  I know I am right.  That is why I support the Government&rsquo;s amendment recognising that legislation alone is not effective in preventing prostitution.  It also agrees that prior to the Government making a definitive decision on whether legislation should be enacted reflecting legislation in Sweden and Norway, there should be a considered public debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Mac Conghail stated there has been a debate but that is not correct.  This matter has not entered the broader Irish public domain.  I have not heard it there.</P>

It is important to support our Independent colleagues and there should be a timeframe.  I know that the Independent Senators, as well as Ruhama and other groups, have the best of intentions but we must look at the other side of the issue.  Why are men out there daily, from every strata of society, seeking quick sexual satisfaction?  I would like to know why that is.  Apparently, many of them are very happily married; therefore, there is something deeper wrong if they are living double lives.</P>

	<P>I acknowledge how well this issue has been highlighted and the telephone calls to Senators&rsquo; offices to remind them.  I congratulate all concerned on their excellent work.</P>
        <P>This motion sets out the context of human trafficking for sexual purposes, implying it is one of the most violent and horrific crimes against humanity.  The trafficking of women and young girls for the purpose of sexual exploitation is a form of 21st-century slavery and a total violation of their human rights.  Trafficking of women and children for sexual purposes is a multi-million euro industry.  Research from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime unmasks the extent of the problem of sex trafficking.  Sexual exploitation usually forcing a person into prostitution is the most widespread form of human trafficking, constituting 79% of all recorded human trafficking cases.  Up to one out of every seven sex workers in Europe is thought to be enslaved into prostitution through trafficking, and one in five victims is a child.  This is an horrific statistic.  Two thirds of victims are women.</P>
        <P>Behind each of the statistics lies a real human being whose life has been blighted by violence, imprisonment and degradation, and whose family has suffered loss and bereavement as it can only imagine the fate of its loved one.  Several of my colleagues have given excellent examples in this regard.</P>
        <P>Women trafficked into Ireland are brought in by criminal gangs on the promise of a better life.  On finding themselves in a world of prostitution and abuse, they are unable to approach the authorities as they fear they could be subject to deportation.  The recent exhibition Not Natasha, hosted by the Immigrant Council of Ireland, with its harrowing images of women trafficked into the sex industry, offered a poignant illustration of the human tragedy of the women concerned.  The trafficking of women and young girls for the purpose of sexual exploitation across the globe knows no geographical borders.  Organisations such as Ruhama and the Immigrant Council of Ireland have demonstrated that Ireland is now a major destination for sex traffickers and they report that there are more than 1,000 women and girls for sale for sex in Ireland every day, 97% of whom are migrant women.</P>
        <P>We need an enlightened and resolute response from the Minister of State to demonstrate that our society cannot and will not tolerate such cruel and violent acts against vulnerable women and children.  Ireland has been slow to introduce legislation to criminalise human trafficking but, thanks to concerted campaigns by organisations such as Ruhama, the Immigrant <Col N="782"/>Council of Ireland and women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s rights organisations in recent years, the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act was passed in 2008 and Ireland was eventually able to ratify the Council of Europe&rsquo;s protocol on human trafficking.  However, it is now clear that we cannot tackle the issue of human trafficking without dealing with the wider issue of prostitution.  The trafficking of women and children for sexual purposes is lucrative because there is a buoyant market.  We need a complete review of legislation in this area.  While legislation prohibits purchasing sex on the kerbside, it is not illegal to purchase sex in private.  The vast majority of women who find themselves working in the so-called sex industry are not willing participants; rather, they are victims who, for various reasons, including a history of abuse through drug addiction, homelessness or debt, find themselves surrendering their human dignity and forced to undertake demeaning and degrading acts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Garda&iacute; in areas frequented by street prostitutes say they are struck by the increase in the number on the streets at certain times of the year.  This  is absolutely harrowing.  September, which coincides with children going back to school, Christmas and the First Holy Communion season are cases in point.  There is no glamour in this career for the women involved.  Some 80% of women in prostitution have reported physical abuse and more than 60% have been raped or sexually assaulted.  Moreover, there is significant evidence that the sex industry is associated with criminality, money-laundering and trafficking.</P>
        <P>There are those who say the sale of sex between two consenting adults is perfectly legitimate and that it may be better to legalise prostitution.  However, when such people are asked whether they would be proud to say their mother or sister was a prostitute, or whether they would encourage their daughters to take up prostitution as a career, they soon change their minds.  Ruhama states the vast majority of women it comes across want to get out of prostitution, and independent research validates this assertion.</P>
        <P>The sex industry is thriving because there is demand and those who create the market are not subjected to the rigour of the law.  While activities such as kerb-crawling, brothel-keeping and living off immoral earnings are illegal in Ireland, the buying and selling of sex is not.  It is clear the legislation needs a radical overhaul to deal with the 21st-century realities of the sex industry, which operates on the Internet, with so-called brothels being more transient.</P>
        <P>There is really a need for legislative reform in respect of prostitution and sex trafficking.  I fully support the call to introduce legislation to criminalise the purchase of sex and curb prostitution and trafficking.  I will do my best to introduce it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  As a rookie Senator, it is lovely to see her here.  I have admired her work in the past and wish her all the best in her role.</P>
        <P>It is very possible to have a debate on prostitution and trafficking that is without sentiment, passion and emotion because that is precisely what happens the people affected; they begin to lack emotion, sentiment and passion because of what has happened to them.</P>
        
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>If Senator Bradford wants something rushed and not right, I suggest he read the amendment.  It is probably one of the best examples of something that is rushed and not right.  It is befuddled and does not state a case of which it is supposed to be certain.  It shows very great uncertainty, which I find extraordinary given that we are talking about something as humane as this motion.  Our motion states &ldquo;the trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation is a modern form of slavery and a form of human rights abuse&rdquo;.  The amendment suggests we should include financial exploitation as a human rights abuse.  This is an outrageous parallel because, while we know that all abuse is wrong, we know in particular that our response to the physical, mental and emotional abuse of women through prostitution <Col N="783"/>and trafficking is at the core of who we are.  If we were to parallel financial abuse therewith, we might as well say all of us have been desecrated, abused and violated by the banks.  There is a very grave difference between those who are trafficked for sex and those affected by the power and greed of banks.  There is no intelligible comparison.  The comparison being made just adds to the uncertainty and befuddlement.</P>
        <P>The amendment states that the Seanad &ldquo;abhors especially the trafficking of children for the purposes of prostitution&rdquo;.  We do not abhor anything &ldquo;especially&rdquo;.  This is a very bad use of an adverb.  We do not abhor it at all; to abhor is to make a kind of weak assertion, rather like Senator Bradford&rsquo;s assertion that we are appalled and, therefore, in some way dilute the abuse.  We do not dilute the abuse by language since we know the practice is appalling.  We know, recognise and consider trafficking as criminal; that is all we need to say.</P>
        <P>The amendment is incorrect in regard to the vacillation in estimating the extent of sexual exploitation and trafficking.  There is an enormous amount of reliable, startling, up-to-date research, including qualitative, quantitative and on-the-ground research, in this area.  Are we afraid to reference it, rely on it and use it?  Some of the researchers, including on-the-ground researchers, and writers and purveyors of research are present.</P>
        <P>The amendment states &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s legislation on human trafficking for sexual exploitation complies with EU, Council of Europe and other international instruments&rdquo;.  That does not mean it is working.  Why does that mean it is working?  The amendment also suggests our legislation on trafficking is &ldquo;severe&rdquo;.  In what way is it severe?  Senator Zappone pointed this out.  Where is the proof of the severity?</P>
        <P>The amendment states curbing prostitution and criminalising the purchase of sex within our legal framework raises complex issues.  All behaviour is complex.  That it is complex does not mean we should not criminalise aspects thereof, especially those that close us down as human beings and do not allow women to stand up as dignified human beings.</P>
        <P>Just because it is complex does not mean we should not criminalise aspects of it, especially those aspects which close us down as human beings and do not allow women to stand up as dignified human beings.  Complexity must never be an insurance policy against the legalisation of criminality.</P>
        <P>It is something of a clever and complex move into how we view pornography now because soft pornography has moved into our lives.  It is a part of our language, dress, behaviour, advertising and marketing.  It is a part of the way we are, a part of comedy and a part of the way we express ourselves.  It is everywhere.  It is interesting that the rise of soft pornography has taken place in parallel with the rise of prostitution and trafficking and as pornography becomes more acceptable, so do they.</P>
        <P>It is also interesting that pornography has become ageless.  There is no difference anymore and children are now mini-adults; they do not even wear different clothes.  We find that we are suppressing them if we do not allow them into an adult world.  It is as though shame has disappeared.  This is what concerns me about the amendment because shame was not at the core of it and it does not sit anywhere in the amendment.  Shame on us all that we even have need for an amendment.  I will leave the House with that thought.</P>

        <P>As a member of Fine Gael, I am supportive of further legislation in this area and it is necessary legislation.  Even since the Irish Management Institute, IMI, conference in Killarney this year I have studied the issue steadily.  We are keen to ensure that whatever legislation is enacted is proper.  One thing we have not seen but which I am keen to see is the dignity report and the Minister has stated that she will bring it forward.  It is an EU-funded report.  The Minister has stated that she will publish it within the coming week or two.  I am keen to see it come forward.</P>
        <P>Everyone here has said how great the Swedish law is.  It was enacted in 1999.  I was at the brilliant presentation in the audiovisual, room yesterday on the matter and I thank the House for it.  No person has been prosecuted under that law in Sweden as of yet.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Sweden has a low rate of prostitution.  I agree with banning it and ensuring the selling of sex or the purchase of sex is made illegal in this country.  Selling sex is legal in Sweden and it has a low rate of prostitution.  We must ensure what we do in this country.  We have a constitution in this country.  The Minister of State pointed out that our legislation is different from the legislation under the Constitution.  The CC <i>v</i>. Ireland case brought it to light here and that is an important point for consideration.  I have no wish to rush this.</P>
        <P>There is a point to Senator O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s remarks.  The amendment may have been rushed but there is a difference between rushing an amendment and rushing legislation that we cannot change later.  I am keen to ensure legislation is in place and I will follow up on it.  I will not take my eye off the ball and Fine Gael will not take its eye off the ball.  It is in government with the Labour Party.  Speaking as a member of Fine Gael I assure the House that we will keep our eye on the ball in this regard because it is as serious a matter to me as a member of Fine Gael as it is to any Member that has spoken today.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My point was that Independent Senators are of a mixed view with regard to arguments forwarded in respect of the amendment.  I will come back to that issue.  I acknowledge the extraordinary passion, compassion, logic, analysis and information <Col N="785"/>taken by my colleagues on all sides of the debate.  I hope this provides some evidence, especially to those with us this evening, that the Seanad wishes to engage with civil society in critical debates, that we hear what it is saying and that we are struggling with these issues.  I am proud of all contributions in this regard.</P>
        <P>I have not heard any strong arguments against the introduction of some form of legislation that would criminalise the purchaser of sex.  I am struggling with the Minister&rsquo;s call that we require a period of six months to make a decision about it.  Having said that I thank the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, who, I realise, has been involved in these consultations with the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch.  I thank my colleagues as well but especially those who have informed us so well and who have conducted this coalition and campaign which has brought us to the point of trying to decide what we should do.</P>
        <P>I propose that the Independent Senators are of a mixed view.  Most of us believe enough time has passed in terms of the debate conducted.  Some of us believe there should be a wider debate to give the Government six months and are not afraid of it.  Some of us believe it would be worthy for the wider public to be with us in this call.  Some of us acknowledge the complexity of a decision to introduce legislation.  Having said that, most of us do not think this way.  We are a group of Independent Senators.  In this case with a mixed decision it has been decided that we will push the amendment to a vote.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise this matter because I am very concerned about a particular case in County Clare where the Equal Status Act and Equality Tribunal are being abused by an individual.  To date, an individual in the county, Ms Heather Rosen, who is an advocate on behalf of the Traveller community, has made 1,300 complaints against Clare County Council to the Equality Tribunal under the Equal Status Act.  Thus far, between 70 and 80 cases &mdash; I am not sure of the precise figure &mdash; have been adjudicated on by the tribunal and all have been dismissed.  Since 2003, as a result of the complaints made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not name individuals in the House as they are not in a position to defend themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>The matters I raise are on the public record.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator may not name individuals in the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, I will refrain from doing so.  The cases in question are, however, in the public domain as they were brought before the Equality Tribunal and have been covered in the media.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Anyone may make a complaint to the Equality Tribunal.  While the tribunal does important work, the problem I have is with the complete absence of procedures.  An individual can write a complaint on the back of an envelope and submit it to the tribunal which is then obliged to carry out an investigation.  Moreover, the institution against which a complaint has been made is obliged to mount a defence.  If all 1,300 complaints to which I refer are investigated and ultimately dismissed, taxpayers will be exposed to costs running into millions of euro.  Clare County Council has already borne significant costs as a result of having to defend the cases in question.  Frequent adjournments of cases on various grounds further increase costs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Equal Status Act is extremely important legislation in an extremely important area.  However, elements of the Act, particularly as regards the reporting of cases to the Equality Tribunal, can be abused if people so wish.  I call for the introduction of an amendment to the Act to ensure the Equality Tribunal is not abused.    That is not its purpose; this should not happen and it must stop.  There is a provision in the Act, whereby the Minister can introduce regulations relating to how the Equality Tribunal carries out its business and adjudicates on cases, but to date no such regulations have been introduced.  The legislation remains important but some tweaking is needed.  If we are to have an effective tribunal which is run efficiently and can do what it is supposed to do, an amendment is required to the Equal Status Act.  I call on the Minister of State to follow up the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  Before dealing with the substantive point raised by him, I will outline some of the background to the Equality Tribunal and the legislation under which it operates. <Col N="787"/> I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, who is unable to be present.  I will pass on to him the points made by the Senator.</P>
        <P>The Equal Status Acts prohibit discrimination in the provision of goods and services, the disposal of property and access to education on any of nine grounds.  The Acts outlaw discrimination in all services generally available to the public, whether provided by the State or the private sector.  These include facilities for refreshment, entertainment, banking, insurance, granting credit facilities, transport and travel services.  Discrimination in the disposal of premises, the provision of accommodation, admission or access to education courses or establishments is also prohibited, subject to some exemptions.  Under the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2008, the Equality Tribunal deals with complaints of discrimination based on nine grounds, namely, gender; civil status; family status, including pregnancy; age; disability; race, including nationality; colour or ethnic-national origin; religion or belief; sexual orientation; or membership of the Traveller community.</P>
        <P>The Equality Tribunal is an impartial, independent body, set up to investigate and decide or mediate cases brought under the equality legislation.  Its decisions and mediated agreements are legally binding and it has extensive powers.  The tribunal is a quasi-judicial body, in that it does not have to decide cases on court procedures and can follow relatively accessible and informal procedures.  It is, however, bound by the principles of natural justice, which means that it must act impartially in considering complaints before it and must ensure fairness for both parties in its procedures.  The service is free and parties are not required to have legal or other representation.</P>
        <P>Complaints in respect of registered clubs and premises may only be referred to the District Court and may no longer be referred to the Equality Tribunal.  Any person who believes he or she has experienced discrimination by a service provider which is contrary to the Equal Status Acts may seek redress by making a complaint to the tribunal.  Before referring a complaint to the tribunal, a complainant must first notify the service provider and has the right to ask for information in that notification.  The notification must be in writing and sent within two months of the incident complained of, or, in the case of repeated incidents, the most recent one, stating the nature of the allegation and the intention to seek redress under the Equal Status Acts, if the complainant is not satisfied with the service provider&rsquo;s response.  The service provider is not obliged to reply, but the Acts state the tribunal may draw such inferences as seem appropriate if the service provider does not reply or provides a false, misleading or unhelpful reply.</P>
        <P>Any person who believes he or she has experienced discrimination which is contrary to the Equal Status Acts may, after notifying the service provider, seek redress by referring a complaint to the Equality Tribunal.  The Acts provide that a claim may not be referred to the tribunal after six months from the date when the discrimination or victimisation occurred, or, in the case of a repeated act, last occurred, unless the complainant applies for an extension of time.  If the delay was caused by the respondent misrepresenting the facts to the complainant, the time limit runs from the date when the complainant discovered the misrepresentation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I turn to the substantive point raised by the Senator.  The position is that section 22 of the Acts allows the tribunal to dismiss a complaint without a hearing at any stage if, in the opinion of the director or an equality officer, it has been made in bad faith or is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or relates to a trivial matter.  This provision is robust enough to ensure any attempts to abuse the legislation can be stopped as soon as such abuse becomes apparent.  I cannot comment, nor can the Minister for Justice and Equality, on individual cases.  I can, however, inform the Senator that the Minister has been informed by the director of the Equality Tribunal that the tribunal exercises this power, as required.  Moreover, if a complainant does not pursue a complaint lodged, the director may dismiss the complaint after one year for non-pursuit.  Once a complaint goes to hearing, an equality officer will dismiss a complaint if the complainant fails to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case.  It is important to note that the failure <Col N="788"/>to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case does not mean that the complaint was made in bad faith, was frivolous, vexatious or misconceived.</P>
        <P>The director of the Equality Tribunal has further informed the Minister that the number of cases lodged under the Equal Status Acts has fallen significantly in recent years.  The backlog of outstanding cases has been reduced.  All cases which were lodged in 2010 and which have not been settled at mediation or withdrawn have now been assigned to equality officers for investigation and decision.  The number of claims made under the Acts is not a particular burden on the tribunal.</P>
        <P>If the Senator raises individual cases, I will be happy to ask the Minister and the Department of Justice and Equality to pass on the points raised to the Equality Tribunal.  What the Minister and I cannot do, given the statutory independence of the director and the quasi-judicial role of the tribunal, is comment on individual cases or involve ourselves in any way in making inquiries about the process or the basis of individual cases.  I again thank the Senator for raising the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive response.  The best way of describing the case I have raised is to say it is a corporate effort by an individual to abuse the ethos of the Equality Tribunal.  How can one individual make 1,300 separate complaints?  If the Equality Authority was operating in the real world, it would have dealt with this matter.  It is completely unacceptable that what is, by and large, a very good organisation which does exceptionally good work has been entirely blocked.  Its reputation in my county is at a very low ebb because the public is very angry about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality is that there has been what I would describe as a systematic attempt to undermine the Equality Tribunal.  In a case in which multiple complaints are reported to the Equality Tribunal by one individual, surely to God the Minister for Justice and Equality can do something to bring the matter to an end.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The short answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;, the Minister cannot do so.  In the first instance, the Equality Tribunal is a very important  part of the architecture of our democracy. <Col N="789"/> We cannot say we will limit the number of complaints a person wishes to make.  It is clearly not a burden on the tribunal which has dealt with every case that has come before it.  There is a queue and it is dealing with these cases, too.  However, if one were to go down the road of trying to limit the number of complaints an individual could make, no matter what the Senator&rsquo;s opinion of the case is, that would be a retrograde step.  As stated, the tribunal is sufficiently robust to deal with issues of this nature.  If the Senator is conscious of continual complaints being made in this instance, then I am sure the tribunal is also aware of them.  The tribunal has dealt with the matter in the way it has chosen.  We must allow bodies such as the tribunal to deal with complaints as they see fit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter relates to the reform of legislation relating to inquests involving Northern Ireland residents who die in the Republic of Ireland, particularly in the light of the request of the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Northern Irish Human Rights Commission on 5 May for an inquest, under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, into the murder of Mr. Denis Donaldson in County Donegal in 2006.  I am asking that the Minister for Justice and Equality take the necessary steps to facilitate this request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for and appreciate her brevity.  I also thank her for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.</P>
        <P>The murder of the person to whom the Senator refers is the subject of an active and ongoing criminal investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In that context, the House will appreciate that we must be judicious in our comments with regard to the case.  I am sure the Senator is well aware of that.  There is never any justification for the violent taking of human life.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will vigorously pursue all leads in its investigations into brutal crimes of this nature.  That is the position regardless of the circumstances in which a crime was committed.  In accordance with the legislation relating to a death which may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner, there is a duty on the coroner for the relevant district to hold an inquest into the death.  Accordingly, the death of the person in question is the subject of a coroner&rsquo;s inquest.  I am aware that the inquest has been adjourned on several occasions for reasons with which I will deal later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The legislation governing matters relating to coroners is the Coroners Act 1962 and subsequent amendments thereto.  This legislation, which is under review in the context of legislative proposals in this area, provides that a coroner is a statutory officer exercising quasi-judicial functions in respect of which he or she  is independent.  The House should be conscious, therefore, that neither the Minister for Justice and Equality nor his Department has any role in individual cases which may be the subject of an inquest.  Under the legislation to which I refer, where a coroner believes that a death was violent, unnatural or happened suddenly and from unknown causes, he or she will hold an inquest to establish the facts of how the person died.  The function of a coroner&rsquo;s inquest is not to decide if someone is legally responsible for a person&rsquo;s death.  Rather, it is solely intended to establish the identity of the deceased and when, where and how the death occurred.  The Coroners Act 1962 makes explicit provision that prohibits a coroner&rsquo;s inquest from considering questions of civil or criminal liability or from censuring or exonerating any person.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that in circumstances where a coroner&rsquo;s inquest is required, the conduct of such an inquest for residents of Northern Ireland who die in the State is no different from that relating to inquests for residents of the State who die here.  I reiterate that the Minister has no <Col N="790"/>role in respect of the conduct of inquests. That is entirely a matter for the coroner in accordance with the legislation related to coroners.</P>
        <P>With regard to the comment made in a joint statement issued on 5 May this year by the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law means that the coroner must have regard to the convention, including Article 2.  I have no doubt that the inquest in respect of the death of the person in question in this instance meets the highest international standards and that it fully complies with Article 2.  The commissions also expressed concern that the Coroner&rsquo;s inquest in this case has not yet been concluded.  I am sure the House is already aware that it is the usual practice in cases where an investigation is ongoing that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would request the adjournment of an inquest to avoid the possibility arising that the proceedings of the inquest might prejudice a criminal investigation.  This is specifically provided for in section 25 of the Coroners Act 1962.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The commissions further indicated that the family of the person in question is concerned about the lack of information available to it from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In that context, the Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that it is the family&rsquo;s wish that the force should liaise with its solicitor and this is being done.  However, the Garda authorities remain ready to facilitate requests from the family to brief it on progress with the murder investigation.  As stated, the Garda investigation into the murder of the person to whom the Senator refers remains open and active.  Information provided by the Garda authorities indicates that a number of lines of inquiry continue to be pursued by the investigation team.  Bringing those involved in this killing to justice must remain the priority.  I hope what I have said will be of some assistance to the Senator.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State.  Mr. Donaldson was an Irish citizen but there are different standards for Irish citizens in the two jurisdictions on this island.  An inquest into anyone killed in the North &mdash; in circumstances where state agencies may have direct or indirect knowledge or involvement &mdash; must be compliant with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  This is not merely the whim of the British Government or that of the Assembly of the Six Counties, it is a requirement of the European Court of Human Rights.  The inquest system in the Twenty-Six Counties is not compliant with Article 2.  Under the system in the Six Counties, state agencies are compelled to bring forward information and senior serving and former members of the police and other state agencies are obliged to co-operate with inquests.  The cross-jurisdictional issues to which I refer arise in the case of Denis Donaldson.  Many other Irish citizens have been affected by these issues and there is a need for cross-Border co-operation in order that they might be resolved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am aware that the Senator is passionate about these issues and respect her for that.  I am assured that we comply with Article 2.  However, I take on board what the Senator said and will make further inquiries on her behalf.  The investigation is active and ongoing and &mdash; even from common-sense point of view, if not legally &mdash; it could prove prejudicial if the groups of people to whom Article 2 refers were to go before a coroner&rsquo;s court in open session and provide the type of information that would be requested.</P>
