	<P>I have received notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">Go dtabharfaidh an tAire Sl&aacute;inte soil&eacute;iri&uacute; maidir leis na h&aacute;iseanna agus an taca&iacute;ocht a chuir Feidhmeannacht na Seirbh&iacute;se Sl&aacute;inte agus a gcuid conraitheoir&iacute; seirbh&iacute;se ar f&aacute;il chun cuidi&uacute; le daoine le m&iacute;chumas, a ch&oacute;naionn i dtithe c&oacute;naitheach n&oacute; gr&uacute;pa, chun cabhr&uacute; leo v&oacute;t&aacute;il i dtoghch&aacute;n na hUachtar&aacute;nachta agus sna Reifrinn le d&eacute;ana&iacute; agus an f&eacute;idir leis tabhairt le fios c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad duine acu sin a tugadh amach chun v&oacute;t&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion to amend the terms of reference contained in the resolution passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 23 March 2005 and by Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 24 March 2005 pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2004, to be taken without debate; No. 2, statements, questions and answers on overseas trade, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and conclude not later than 1.45 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes, to be followed by questions to the Minister from the floor, with Sinn F&eacute;in Senators to be given the opportunity to ask the first question, followed by rotation back and forth across the House, as with the Order of Business &mdash; to enable Members to have an opportunity to put questions to the Minister, we ask that questions be confined to one minute in each case; and No. 3, statements, questions and answers on developments in social protection, to be taken at 2 p.m. and conclude not later than 4 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes, to be followed by questions from the floor, which are not to exceed one minute in each case, with Sinn F&eacute;in Senators to be given the opportunity to ask the first question, followed by rotation back and forth across the House, as with the Order of Business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday, the House discussed third level fees and the abolition of financial support for postgraduates.  The Minister for Education and Skills lied to the electorate.  He promised to reverse the &euro;500 increase in the student service charge.  He signed a pledge to that effect.  The lack of Labour Party flags was notable at yesterday&rsquo;s student protest. <Col N="498"/> Last year, there always seemed to be quite a large number of such flags at these protests.  The red flag was flying high then, but yesterday there was no protest by labour youth.  I did not spot any of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Labour Party leader in the Seanad is not here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity the Minister for Education and Skills decided, three days before polling, to sign a pledge that he would not introduce third-level fees and would reverse the increase in service charges.  This morning, he tried to tell people that he did not lie to the electorate, but he clearly did.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business this morning, that the Minister for Education and Skills should attend the House to explain why he lied to the electorate and if he will reintroduce third-level fees.  There is no doubt that he will do so.  Will he make good on his commitment to reverse the &euro;500 student service charge increase?  He will not do so, but I would like to hear it from him.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, at least 20,000 students took time out to put their message to the new Government.  It was a cynical electoral ploy, particularly by the Labour Party in this regard.  I did not see any labour movement from Trinity College, although perhaps Senator Bacik is meeting them this morning to discuss how she will extricate herself from the difficulties she finds herself in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to get the Minister for Education and Skills to attend the House to discuss third level fees and the fact that the Labour Party has broken another campaign promise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The comprehensive spending review is to be published today.  It will be announced by the Government at a press conference, rather than in the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  The Government did the same thing last week with the review of the capital programme.  I ask the Leader to provide sufficient time early next week &mdash; I suggest Tuesday &mdash; to debate the elements within the comprehensive spending review.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s draft policing plan for 2012, I raised a matter on the Adjournment yesterday about the closure of Garda stations in my area of Dublin.  However, such closures will affect many constituencies, both rural and urban, across the country.  The Government is trying to slip this policy in under the radar.  The answer I got from the Minister, Deputy Shatter, who was not here, although that does not necessarily surprise me, was that the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s draft policing plan for 2012 will be produced shortly.  I asked if &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; meant next week, the week after or in January, but got no reply.  I therefore ask the Leader to provide time next week to discuss the Government&rsquo;s plans to restrict or close Garda stations all over the country.  Perhaps the Leader can find out from the Minister for Justice and Equality when the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s draft policing plan for 2012 will be published.  I had no joy in getting any information from his office yesterday.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt Senator O&rsquo;Brien.  I strongly reject the accusations being levelled at the Minister, Deputy Quinn.</P>
        <P>I commend the Ceann Comhairle and the Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas for the hard work they have put in to ensure that the public will, in real time, get to see the affairs of the D&aacute;il, Seanad and Oireachtas committees.  This is vital progress.  I call again on RTE to take up its responsibilities as a broadcaster under its public service remit.  UPC is now broadcasting the business of the Houses on channel 801, as arranged by the Ceann Comhairle.  To date, RTE is refusing to broadcast such matters into people&rsquo;s homes across Ireland.  As the public service broadcaster, it is incumbent on RTE to broadcast the affairs of this House.  RTE receives a considerable subsidy from the State through the licence fee.</P>
        <P>I also commend a Private Members&rsquo; Bill introduced in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Mattie McGrath dealing with the theft of precious metals.  All parties should embrace this measure which seeks to tackle a serious problem that is putting businesses and jobs at risk.  Last week, we saw a despicable act in Castletown, County Laois, where a memorial to deceased children was stolen.  We have got to the stage where these people would take the whites out of one&rsquo;s eyes.  It is incumbent upon us to introduce legislation to severely penalise those who steal monuments and precious metals.  Such legislation should also place an onus on dealers who buy such objects.  There would be no such market if dealers did not purchase these objects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader arrange, at the earliest opportunity, for the Minister for Health to return to the House for the sole purpose of discussing his policy on care for the elderly.  Two community <Col N="500"/>hospitals have closed in County Laois this week, in Abbeyleix and Shane.  This is causing consternation and great distress in the community.  The HSE is hiding behind HIQA and using it as an opportunity to close down what we used to call county homes across the entire country.  There will not be a public bed left if the HSE has its way.  It is winding down and closing hospitals by stealth.  I do not believe it is the Government&rsquo;s policy, so I would like the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Health to attend the House at the earliest opportunity.  We should have a balance of care provision between private nursing homes and community facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from yesterday&rsquo;s student protest, I would welcome a debate on education.  I am concerned by the growth of overheads and bureaucracy in universities, which has already been noted by an bord snip nua as well as by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is important in these times to spend resources in the classroom and on lecturing, which is the so-called front line.  Three areas in particular are badly needed, which would not be expensive to develop: the problems of mathematics, foreign languages and the shortage of people with economic expertise.  They are so badly needed, as has been shown in recent years.  These problems could be tackled within budgetary constraints.  When the Minister brings forward his sustainability proposals, I hope he will take into account the substantial diversion of resources out of the lecture-hall and into the bureaucrat&rsquo;s office that has taken place in recent years.  I gather that report is to be completed shortly.  I would like to debate it here because we could do a lot more, even under budgetary constraints, than has happened in recent times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I also seek an urgent debate on education.  It was great to see 15,000 or 16,000 students outside Leinster House yesterday.  During the Celtic tiger period it was distressing that students were not active in voicing their political views.  To a large extent they became focused on monetary issues.  However, the fact that 15,000 students were at the Merrion Street gate of Leinster House yesterday spoke volumes.  I remember attending student protests in the early 1990s when 20,000 or 25,000 students would march to Leinster House, and they got results.  I would like to see an all-encompassing debate on education in which we would look at how we could build relationships with the private sector to see if there were persons who wanted to fund education, such as the likes of Dr. Tony O&rsquo;Reilly did in UCD in the early 1990s.  I would also like to see a step-by-step examination of the bountiful salaries being earned within the education system by the presidents of the various colleges, senior academics, senior lecturers and senior administrators.  If we started by cutting their salaries significantly, we could be in a position where we would not have to look at the imposition of extra costs on students and homeowners.  In the past decade the Monopoly-type sums earned by professors, senior lecturers, the presidents of colleges, etc. have been a source of outrage.   There is no point in starting at the bottom.  We need to start at the top and cut the wages of those mentioned significantly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point has been well made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I have one other issue to raise.  I support Senator Whelan&rsquo;s call for a debate on older people.  We have seen during the years how successful the Council for the Status of Women and the Council for the Status of People with Disabilities have been; what we need is a council for the status of older people, as the population will age significantly in the coming years.  That is a good development because it shows people are living longer and are healthier, and, because of advances in medication, something that needs to be embraced.  However, we need to provide services within communities and their homes to ensure they will <Col N="501"/>have the quality of life they deserve.  The Government should, therefore, examine the possibility of setting up a council for the status of older people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator O&rsquo;Brien and endorse everthing he said in calling on the Minister for Education and Skills to come before the House &mdash; I agree with Senator Conway in this regard &mdash; for a comprehensive debate on education.  It is not only about the students who were protesting last year.  As somebody once said, students have been revolting for years, but that is their right.  However, it is somewhat ironic.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">With all due respect to Senator Whelan, I could not help but to reflect when he was making what was a defence of the Government, as I would if I were on his side of the House.  If he was still the editor of a provincial newspaper, no doubt his editorial this week would be screaming at the Government about the nefarious activities in which it was involved.  I could even write the headline, &ldquo;Broken Pledges&rdquo;.  That is exactly what this is about.  It is not so much about what the outgoing Fianna F&aacute;il Administration proposed.  I will put up my hands and state that it was proposing a number of the changes the Government is implementing, but the difference is that the then spokesperson on education publicly pledged that he would not implement them when in government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has not done so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the core of the argument.  I have the greatest of respect for the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and believe he is trying to do his very best for education, but there is a need for a comprehensive debate on the issues involved.</P>
        <P>Senator Conway is correct.  The wages of academics in the past ten or 15 years must be addressed.  They must lead by example.  What Senator Barrett referred to should also form part of that debate.  The universities are slipping down the European and world leagues, while the American CEO of one of the new industries establishing in Ireland stated last week that he was astonished by the level of educational attainment of those coming before him for interview.  We have a proud tradition of producing graduates from third level colleges, but there are many issues to be considered, other than the imposition of fees.  Irrespective of whatever debate takes place here on the future role of education within a limited budget, the people are watching.  Those who will be most affected by an increase in registration fees are the ordinary five-eighth and, to paraphrase the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the people can take no more.  I, therefore, advise the Government to tread carefully where it imposes various increases in taxation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Whelan&rsquo;s proposals, and also those of SenatorConway on older people.  Establishing a council for the status of older people would be a good move.  As he stated, people are living longer and are healthier, but we need to facilitate them in the provision of services.</P>
        <P>I would like the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il to come into the House to explain something to me.  Senator Barrett alluded to courses in mathematics.  Perhaps the Fianna F&aacute;il Party should take a course in mathematics and then explain to us how we got to the position where the next generation, not this one, will be compromised.  This generation of students will be looked after.  However, the generation coming after it and the ones after that concern me more.  I have a daughter who is seven years old.  She will not be going to university for ten years and I want her to be able to go.  If she can afford the fees or if I can afford them, so be it.  However, I want her generation to have the same chances as past generations since fees were abolished.  There are many families who can afford the fees and many working-class taxpayers consider <Col N="502"/>they are paying their taxes to pay for rich kids who can afford an education.  The debate in England has moved in that direction.  Any interviews one sees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am delighted that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has reached the stage where it thinks everything has happened since February.  Recently I read a book in which Mr. Bryan Gould, the Labour Party stalwart, stated the Tory Party was a party which thought it had the right to govern.  This has been shown to be an illusion; I can say the same about Fianna F&aacute;il.  It was all an illusion which has been exposed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank sincerely all of the Senators who responded to the letter sent on behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators a number of weeks ago on speaking time.  We received a positive response from Senators of all political parties.  In regard to what the Leader of the House had to say today on the statements which would be taken on two important topics, with respect, he missed the point.  Whether Sinn F&eacute;in Members are allowed to ask the first or last question is not the issue.  The issue we raised concerned speaking time.  What we were asking for, because the Leader is allowing spokespersons of the various groups eight minutes, was that a Sinn F&eacute;in representative be given five minutes.  That would be fair and reasonable.  I, therefore, propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that a Sinn F&eacute;in representative be given five minutes in both discussions and hope we will receive the support from Members of all sides of the House promised to us when we wrote to them in good faith recently.</P>
        <P>In the past few days I have referred on a number of occasions in this House to the need for a proper discussion on the budget.  The Government has leaked much of what will be included in it in terms of cuts in capital spending and to the social welfare budget.  Announcements are to be made today on public sector reform.  There is a debate on every television programme and, I am sure, in the canteen in every workplace throughout the country on what should and should not be included in the budget.</P>
        <P>We in this House are not being given an opportunity to properly tease out alternative proposals being made by all the various groupings and individuals.  That is wrong.  Why is it okay to have a debate in the media?  In this House we are elected to scrutinise policy and engage with the Minister on the budget but we are not given a proper opportunity to do so.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Leader yesterday indicated that he would try to facilitate a speaking slot for this issue.  I call for a half day of discussions in this regard.  The Order of Business and what has been on the agenda in this House over the past number of weeks has been pathetic.  We need proper debate in the House if we are to take it seriously, which elected Senators do.  I urge the Leader to ensure that we have proper opportunities for a full discussion on what will be in the budget.  In the past all politicians were accused of being asleep at the wheel but if we are not being given an opportunity to have discussions and debate, it is not our fault that we are not able to provide scrutiny.  Proper space is not being made available for us to have such discussions.  I will be formally moving the amendment to the Order of Business that we be given five minutes for both statements which are being taken today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise the issue of robberies, particularly those which affect older people.  Senator Conway asked for another organisation for older people and I put on record that there are many such bodies working for older people.  These include Age Action Ireland, Older and Bolder, the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament and the national council for older people.  These bodies are doing a very fine job, and although we are not in the business of setting up many organisations, we should recognise those who are working for older people.</P>
        <P>I have risen to speak about robberies, particularly people targeted for gold.  I had a call from a very upset woman the day before yesterday who had been robbed.  Although she had other valuable items, the only belongings targeted were gold.  I watched a television programme which linked cash for gold shops to easy disposal of stolen gold.  That programme did an undercover survey, as gold is the only commodity holding value now, that took in four cash for gold shops.  The people in the shops were giving a quarter of the market price for gold, with <Col N="504"/>the most being paid at a level of half the market price.  The robbers are being robbed as well.  Only one of the shops asked for identification and there is no regulation, although there should be.  A lack of regulation indicates to robbers that they can rob people of gold and it can be easily disposed of.</P>
        <P>When former Deputy Dermot Ahern was Minister responsible for justice, he commissioned a report from the Garda on the matter, which has only been passed to the Minister for Justice and Equality recently.  Will the Minister come to the House to make a statement on the matter?  Will he indicate after reading the Garda report whether it is necessary to introduce legislation to regulate those shops?  They are an easy market for people who get gold through illegal means.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Whelan mentioned a precious metals and scrap Bill and I would link those issues.  The theft of art on motorways is also connected.  I would like a debate on the matter and we should do something about the cash for gold shops.  That would be one way of stemming the robberies which affect older people in particular.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>We welcome the Government support for Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s Bill on scrap metals and I hope the Government parties will also support our leader, Deputy Martin, who has a Bill relating to corporate donations.  That issue was mentioned in Fine Gael and Labour Party policy pledges and we expect the parties to live up not only to their promises but the recommendations of the Moriarty tribunal.  Unfortunately, they have been completely ignored by Fine Gael.</P>
        <P>I will speak on something far more important and which goes to what we are as a Parliament and Seanad.  There is talk of abolishing the Seanad and it should be abolished immediately if we are to proceed with the Leader&rsquo;s proposal today to deal with No. 1 on the Order Paper without debate.  The motion relates to the Smithwick tribunal and its extension.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has had a debate but Seanad &Eacute;ireann, with the Leader under the instruction of the Minister for Justice and Equality, has been refused a debate.</P>
        <P>We had a significant debate on the matter in June and the Minister, Deputy Shatter, was shown to have withheld vital documentation from the Houses.  Judge Smithwick told the Minister that his imposition of a deadline, which we alleged at the time was done for political purposes, was a major threat to the continuation of the tribunal.  We should not forget that this tribunal is like the A5 road in that it comes from an international agreement at St. Andrew&rsquo;s.  It involves British-Irish agreements and North-South relations.</P>
        <P>If Fine Gael and Labour Party Senators are happy for this motion to go before the House without debate, I urge them to put down a Bill with a constitutional amendment to abolish the Seanad.  There is no point having a Seanad if matters of international importance are not discussed.  This matter was debated in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad has an equal function, as both Houses must approve the motion.  If we cannot have such a debate, what is the point of having this House?  Government backbenchers who will oppose my amendment are allowing this Chamber to become a rubber stamp, and if they are happy with that, we should just abolish the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that one hour of debate be provided for No. 1 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper.  I urge Government Senators to support this.  The D&aacute;il had its opportunity and the Seanad is entitled to the same treatment.  We have the same role as the D&aacute;il in passing this motion.</P>
     
	<Col N="505"/><P>Both Houses must pass this motion and the D&aacute;il is not superior.  I urge colleagues to second and support the amendment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Last night Sir Richard Branson called on the British Government to introduce legislation for organ donation with an opt-out clause.  A Bill was introduced in this House three years ago which had a very good debate on Second Stage.  Then I was asked whether I would adjourn it with two or three minutes to go so that consultation could take <Col N="506"/>place in regard to the opt-out.  It was not just an opt-out; it was an opt-out with co-ordinators in each hospital to encourage organ donation.  Nothing has happened and the Bill fell with the change of Government.  I wish to know whether we should consider introducing the same or a similar Bill again.  Perhaps the Leader would find out the view of the Government on the matter.  I mention it because a large number of people are waiting for organ donations.  Let us consider the success when somebody donates an organ, in particular when an accident occurs and a family says it is happy to have the family member&rsquo;s organs donated.  I have read of people who have said that they feel so good because, for example, the death of their son has at least given somebody the right to see, or to have a kidney or liver transplant.  We can do that with an opt-out clause that is well advertised.  If anyone does not want his or her body to be used to help someone else then he or she can opt out.</P>
        <P>I recall a lovely quote: &ldquo;Do not send your organs to heaven; we need them here on earth.&rdquo;  We do need them here on earth but for those who are concerned about an opt-out clause which says that if one does not opt out then one can assume that one&rsquo;s body parts will be used, I assure them they will not be used without the consent of the family.  That can all be covered.  It is time we considered the matter again.  The British are now following what we attempted to do.  We should lead the way once again.  It is worthwhile confirming with the Minister for Health whether he would support the reintroduction of a similar Bill to that which was introduced three years ago.</P>

	<P>Most days our thoughts and vocabulary are primarily dominated by economics, financial matters, family income, personal debt and Europe.  I was shocked and saddened to learn that this country is No. 1 in Europe for the use of heroin and we are third highest for deaths from illegal substances.  It is a shocking indictment to hold those positions in Europe.  There is a human side to what is going on in the world.  I believe the matter needs to be addressed.  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to come to the House for a serious, lengthy, genuine debate not just on the problems but on solutions to the trauma that is affecting so many households and families, namely, the scourge of illegal drugs.  It is a family health issue.  It does not need to get mixed up between the areas of justice and health; it should be specifically dealt with as a family health issue.  I seek that the Minister for Health would come to the House for a debate on the issue.</P>

I am aware other Members have raised the matter on the Order of Business.

	<P>Speaking as an employer I find the proposal difficult to comprehend given that we hear repeatedly from Ministers that job creation and the protection of existing jobs is their top priority.  If the proposal is implemented it will stall job creation and in the long term may lead to businesses having to cease trading.  I ask Members to imagine for a moment that they are employing 100 people who are all working very hard in a factory.  Most of my staff have been with me in excess of ten years.  I treat them fairly and well.  They love working with me but it is hard work.  I suggest to the Minister that she might push the measure through but exclude Mondays.  To be honest, it is like giving one a choice of taking a Monday or Tuesday off to go to the doctor and say one is not feeling the best and know one is going to get paid for it.  I do not think the Government has thought this one through.</P>

	<P>I employ 100 people, most of whom have been with me in excess of ten years.  They love where they work and I treat them fairly but I am not certain that this proposal will allow me to operate my business in the future.  I call for a debate on the proposal as a matter of urgency and a wider discussion on the Government&rsquo;s lack of focus on small, independent employers dotted around the country who provide tremendous benefits to their communities.  While attention must be paid to foreign direct investment it is not the only show in town.  We all know that an indigenous Irish company employing one person is equivalent to a foreign direct investment company employing five people.  I will raise the issue with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, if she is in the House this afternoon but I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Thomas Byrne.  I also support the call by Senator David Cullinane for adequate speaking time for Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is a perfectly reasonable request and it can only be good for the deliberations in this House to have all views properly ventilated.</P>
        <P>I also support the comments of Senator John Whelan on the broadcasting of what is happening in this House, particularly where RTE is concerned as it is the public service broadcaster <Col N="508"/>in this country.  An important element of the operation of democracy is that the general public would be aware of and engaged in the political process.  This country is particularly fortunate in that there is a great interest in politics.  That is largely due to those who are involved as volunteers on the ground.  They show an interest and are prepared to give their time.  We must also give credit to the media which tends to highlight certain aspects of the political process.  There is a deficit in that regard, namely, the adequate coverage of this House.  There is an imbalance because that is not happening.  Therefore, we are not serving the public well.  It would be in the interests of RTE to come on board at this particular time.  It does exceptionally well out of politics with its programmes.  There is no reason it could not be generous in its response.</P>
        <P>On the scrappage issue which has also been raised; I have a particular interest in Tipperary in that regard.  We are all worried about the many monuments we have in this country that could be used for scrappage.  They are of historical and sentimental value.  Some monuments are valuable.  People are now talking about mounting security on monuments lest they be stolen as others have.  One of the glaring cases relates to Holy Cross Abbey where an ancient relic was stolen.  I believe it was stolen for the casing which would be particularly valuable because of its gold content.  The thieves broke into the abbey, desecrated it and stole the casing and the relic contained within it.  As the Archbishop of Cashel has said that Holy Cross Abbey will never be the same again without the relic because of its historical and traditional value.  Regardless of whether one has a religion or not, if people have a particular reverence, as they would have had for that relic in Holy Cross Abbey, can one imagine how people feel to have it desecrated in that manner?  I appeal to anyone who is listening and has the relic to bring it back.</P>
        <P>I agree that legislation is required.  I commend Deputy Mattie McGrath on taking this step.  If we allow this to go on it will be a very serious development.  If the thieves believe they can get steal our heritage throughout the country with impunity, they will continue doing so.  I hope all of us can unite on this issue.  There is much goodwill among all politicians on fundamental issues of this kind.  This is one for which I ask support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>When a Senator who employs 100 people and provides financial assistance to 100 families every week of the year speaks on job creation and matters pertaining to it, we should listen seriously to her ideas, suggestions and concerns.  I support what was said by Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien.  She is following the lead given two days ago by Senator Fidelma Healy Eames.  I look forward to the Minister for Social Protection being in the House this afternoon and, I hope, putting to bed this mad idea of further penalising hard-pressed employers.  We cannot have employees or jobs without employers.  Our whole being must be focused on job creation and the support of employers.  I look forward to hearing the Minister relieving our worries and concerns on that matter this afternoon.</P>
        <P>My friends across the way appear very concerned at what they see as U-turns in education.  Many of them will have served in this House or the D&aacute;il with the former Leader of this House, Mrs. Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.  During her time as her party&rsquo;s education spokesperson Mrs. O&rsquo;Rourke was very strident in her support of student unions and took part in, and almost led, marches to Croke Park.  When she became Minister with responsibility for education she appeared to engage in a different set of proposals from those she had advocated months previously.  She simply explained this to the D&aacute;il by saying she was now on a different side of the House.  This may be of some assistance to the Opposition Senators in explaining away their concerns.</P>

	<P>I support what was said by a number of colleagues about the need for a broadly based debate on older people.  I have raised this matter on several occasions in the past seven or eight years and have suggested the holding of a referendum to enshrine the rights of older people in the Constitution.  We will be having such a referendum in relation to children.  We should also consider a constitutional amendment to protect the rights of older people.</P>
        <P>Senator Byrne raised the proposal to take No. 1 on the Order Paper without debate.  I am concerned when any motion goes through without the debate.  When I was in Opposition I always felt motions should not be passed without debate and I must be consistent on this occasion.  I am not sure why it is necessary to deal with this item in this way.  I would be happier if we had some degree of debate on it.  I know the Leader is constrained by ministerial timetables and responsibilities.  However, could we proceed with other business and give the Leader an opportunity to arrange time for even a minimal debate on this matter later in the afternoon?</P>

	<P>It is important for the Seanad that we ventilate our views on such matters.  It is not practicable to have a full debate on this matter, as Senator Byrne proposes.  I suggest we move on to Nos. 2 and 3 and that the Leader and the Whips explore the possibility of debating No. 1 later in the day.  Rather than have a silly vote, the result of which we know in advance, could we not try to find time and space for a debate later this afternoon?  There may be a valid reason this cannot be so.  The Seanad should not be a rubber stamp.  We should be a House of debate and consideration and not a rubber stamp.  Sometimes this must happen, but I suggest some flexibility with regard to No. 1.</P>

        <P>I am seconding Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s amendment regarding the speaking time for Sinn F&eacute;in Senators.  This is not an unreasonable request.  If it is not acceded to, we will be obliged to call a vote on the amendment.  The vote will probably take longer than the time we would be given to speak.  I would prefer that we would be given the time to speak rather than wait around for a vote.  Members of both Government parties have privately indicated to us that they are in support of the motion.  I hope they will vote as they have spoken to us.</P>
        <P>We are not trying to be unreasonable.  We are trying to have a vigorous debate, to question the policies of the Government in a constructive manner and to provide a diversity of viewpoints.  I implore the Leader to reconsider the allocation of speaking time for today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom &aacute;bhar eile a &aacute;rd&uacute; chomh maith.  There is a story in a Galway newspaper this morning about people who were victims of flooding in County Galway and who are finding it very difficult to get quotations from insurance companies.  This is a very serious matter.  They cannot move their houses.  The flooding is not in their control and much of it is caused by a lack of infrastructural work by the State.  This is a serious matter and I call on the relevant Minister to come to the House to discuss this matter, to say what he can do to rectify the <Col N="510"/>situation in order that victims of flooding are not discriminated against by insurance companies and to clarify the role of the Financial Services Ombudsman of Ireland in this matter.</P>
        <P>I also second the proposal by Senator John Whelan on health care.  Senators Paul Bradford and Martin Conway also spoke about the role of old people in our society.  We need to have this very important debate.  The privatisation of health care for the elderly is almost Government policy.  This follows the example of previous Ministers with responsibility for health care.  I have heard the Minister for Health described as Mary Harney with a beard.  Progressive Democrat policy is being followed through and health care for the elderly is being privatised.  This is completely wrong.</P>

        <P>We should commend the Taoiseach on his actions yesterday.  Of course we must defend and save the euro in every way we can.  The matter is urgent, as the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il said this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  We must do this with the tools we have at present rather than trying to bring about further treaty change.  That might be allowed for further down the road.  Defence of the euro is urgent and important and we must deal with it now.  Let us get on with it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think anyone in the House, particularly from the three main parties, is in a position to point the finger at anyone else with regard to creating economic difficulties.  We should also remind ourselves that data based on 2009 figures show we had the fifth highest <i>per capita</i> GDP of the European countries in the OECD.  This achievement was brought about by Fianna F&aacute;il, although I am not happy with many of its mistakes due to the procyclical policies it followed in the past ten years.  However, it came about following a serious <Col N="511"/>mess being made of the economy in the 1980s, between 1982 and 1987, and we all know who was in power then.  </P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of the recent court case in Belfast relating to the bankruptcy of Se&aacute;n Quinn.  I was very sorry to see that happen because he is a man for whom I have great admiration.  He built up an extraordinary multi-billion euro company from a start of just 23 acres of bad land in Fermanagh.  His story was a phenomenal success story and it is very sad to see the situation that has arisen for him personally and for employees in his company.</P>
        <P>In that regard, I want to raise two issues that arise.  The first is our bankruptcy laws.  The fact that Se&aacute;n Quinn went to Belfast to seek bankruptcy raises many of the arguments we on this side of the House made when bankruptcy changes were debated here recently.  It is a terrible reflection on the Department of Justice and Equality that more than three years into this crisis, it is still only considering what it may do about bringing forward realistic bankruptcy legislation.  I ask for a debate on this in the House.  The time it takes the Department to come to conclusions and for legislation to pass through the House leaves it far too late to try and change the situation.</P>
        <P>It is also imperative that bankruptcy lasts no more than one to three years.  The costs of the bankruptcy and the Revenue costs should also be eliminated in cases of bankruptcy.  Currently, we have a ridiculous situation where those costs last for 12 years.  We have good entrepreneurs in this country, but if we cannot get them back to work, to investing and to creating jobs, we will be looking at high unemployment for the next decade and possibly longer.  In that regard, I ask that this debate be extended beyond these two areas to competitiveness.  It is extraordinary that the troika had to insist to Ministers recently that they should do something about the exorbitant legal and medical costs in this country.  People are being ripped off.  Senator Conway probably best described it when he used the term &ldquo;monopoly money&rdquo;.  The fact that we allow people in privileged positions to continue to rip people off is a shame on the Houses, the Administration and our public service.</P>
        <P>I find it extraordinary to read comments in the newspapers from people, particularly those who work in RT&Eacute;, about salaries and pensions of Members of these Houses.  Like many people here, I work for far less than I got, only a proportion of what I got, when I was working in the public service.  I make no apology for what I get now.  If we do not fund and resource politicians properly, this gives rise to corruption and leads to a failure to attract talent into the political scene, where it is needed.  I propose we invite the Minister with responsibility for public services to the House to discuss the reason we are putting a cap on the salaries of CEOs in semi-State companies.  These are important organisations that are at the root of how we will extricate ourselves from the current economic crisis.  I am talking about Bord G&aacute;is, whose very good CEO is now leaving, the ESB and the people who run the banks.  We must depend on these people and if we do not have quality management, we will lose out.  At the same time, RTE is paying monopoly money to contract broadcasters.  I want the Minister to come in to debate the cap of &euro;200,000.  There is no reason anybody in RTE should get in excess of what the Taoiseach is paid.  It is time we spoke up and enforced a cap and stopped listening to the r&aacute;im&eacute;is broadcasters go on with while hiding behind their exorbitant salaries.</P>

	<P>Last night a gentlemen who came to see me here in the House asked me if I realised we were in war time and asked what happens during war time.  When put starkly like that, one rethinks everything.  At this juncture, we must guard our fundamentals where possible.  For that reason, I believe strongly that employers, the source of our jobs, must not be made to pay further for absenteeism.  I know we will have a debate this afternoon with the Minister for Social Protection and I am delighted with the level of interest this issue has raised.  Perhaps it is the employee who should bear the burden of sick leave. <Col N="512"/> We need to widen the debate.  It should not be the employer or the State who should bear the burden.</P>
        <P>Education is another fundamental it is important to protect.  It is the driver of our economy and the key to personal growth.  I am aware that many Members have sought a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills and I support that call.  The proposal to cap student numbers is very worrying, particularly when the only choice our young people have is education or emigration.  Education is a right, but it must be a right that is accessible and affordable.  We must ensure we guard standards and provide a quality education.  I am delighted with what the Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, said in the newspapers today, namely, that good teaching is about doing research, teaching and some community work.  That is the type of lecturer we need and should support.  I have concerns about the waste&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator seek a debate on education?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do, but I would like to make this point because I have waited a long time for the opportunity to do so.  There is significant waste at the top and I wonder whether we can continue to afford to have university residences for our university presidents.  We are in war time and must look at everything.  All bets are off and we must consider whom we should serve.  We need to serve citizens and students and we need to serve our employers in order that they continue to provide employment.  We are at a new juncture.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to press on with the abolition of severance pay for senior civil servants.  Today we saw that the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, who is about to retire, has volunteered to renounce her severance pay of &euro;126,000.  I compliment her on that.  The figures are sickening.  This is huge money and we cannot afford to pay such sums at this time.  We cannot leave the issue to a voluntary code, so the Minister should press on with the abolition of such payments.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Quinn with regard to seeking an opt-in clause for organ donation so that organs would be available unless people choose to opt out.  That would help many people make their decision.  I have not signed to say that on my death my organs can be donated.  However, I would not have any difficulty with an automatic opt-in clause.</P>

	<P>This morning I did an interview with a transition year student from Blackrock College on the reform of the Seanad and I commended Senator Cummins on introducing reform whereby Ministers take questions here and on how that has opened up debate.  We are only beginning with this and it is not fully established, but I complimented the Senator in my interview on Blackrock College radio.  I would like the Leader to take on board the request of the Sinn F&eacute;in Members to be given an equal amount of time for questions.  We can continue to improve and I see nothing wrong with giving them parity because their contributions are informed and interesting.  I encourage the Leader to support their request.</P>
        <P>I call for an urgent debate on education in Ireland.  The <i>Financial Times</i> is the most influential newspaper in the world and on 7 November, it printed an article by Dr. Thomas Begley, who spent seven years as dean of the business school in UCD.  In his article he complimented the lecturers, academics and students, and highlighted the fact that the IDA brands Ireland as an island of innovation.  It is a pity that Senator Healy Eames, an authority on education, is not present, but Senator Barrett is.  Mr. Begley stated that there is a growing gap between rhetoric and reality in Irish education, that the standard has decreased in the primary and secondary schools and that standards are slipping in Ireland by comparison with other OECD countries.</P><Col N="513"/>
        <P>Two years ago, Mr. Craig Barrett, the previous chairman of Intel, drew our attention to our poor performance in mathematics.  We need an urgent discussion on the education system.  How in God&rsquo;s name can we continue to attract multinationals to the State if the students emerging from our universities have obtained qualifications by rote and by having good memories and if they are not taught to analyse?  We all know that, in many cases, those who have the best memories get the highest points in the leaving certificate examinations.  We will not be able to compete with the multinationals if our third level graduates cannot analyse, critique and argue.  This morning, I urged three transition year students not to learn material off by heart and instead learn to analyse, critique and deliver.  I asked them to be action people and deliver the goods.</P>
        <P>There is such competition internationally to attract multinationals that we must adopt the correct approach.  Our secondary and third level education systems are being starved of resources.  The people do not understand.  We agree unanimously that education is the key to human development and job prospects.</P>

        <P>I would welcome a debate on older people.  It is far too long coming.  We now have a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs but there would be no harm in having one for older people, whose concerns are equally important.  Older people have brought us to where we are; that is the way life works, yet we choose to treat older people in the most appalling manner.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh commented on RTE.  I cannot put my point any better than he did, so I will not say anything more on the issue.  Suffice it to say politicians must stop running themselves down.  What are we at?  This is a profession and we need to be professional about how we conduct our business.  RTE and other media might try to bash us but we should not buy into that.  I would welcome a debate on this point.</P>

	<P>The main proposal exercising people&rsquo;s minds at present is probably that of the Minister for Social Protection on sick pay.  We all know sick pay comprises a difficulty but the manner in which it is being handled is not in the interest of increasing employment and protecting small businesses.  There is certainly a problem with sick pay throughout the public service that needs to be addressed, but the Minister will have to find other ways of addressing it rather than through putting the burden back on small employers.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Brien referred to the funding of education.  I mentioned yesterday that the Higher Education Authority, HEA, had submitted a report to the Minister of Education and Skills on Monday last.  The Minister needs time to examine it.  When the HEA publishes its report, we can debate it.  The question of education has practically dominated the Order of Business today.  I will certainly allow a debate on it, in addition to a focused debate on various aspects thereof.  It is needed.  In fairness to the Minister, he has been in the House on several occasions and is willing to come to debate the issues Members have raised.  He will continue to come to the House.</P>
        <P>On pledges, I will not refer to those made prior to the election.  However, the pledge that Fianna F&aacute;il signed with the troika will certainly cost the people much more than other pledges made.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The questions of whether and which Garda stations will be closed will be taken in the context of the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s draft policing plan.  As with every organisation, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have to manage with reduced resources.  The Commissioner has rightly been examining all aspects of the Garda policing model, including the deployment of personnel and the utilisation of modern technologies in the operation of Garda stations, in terms of opening hours and possible closures.  The purpose of the review is to ensure Garda resources are managed and deployed in the most appropriate manner to meet existing and emerging policing requirements and maintain Garda front-line services in a manner consistent with Government policy.  Clearly, an examination of opening hours and, in some cases, the viability of stations will form part of the report.  In that regard, the Commissioner will have to consider whether better policing services could be delivered to certain communities by having Garda members on patrol rather than in a station.  This can be discussed at a later stage.</P>
        <P>Every Member would like to join Senator Whelan in congratulating the Ceann Comhairle on his initiative on the televising of debates in both Houses.  I thank UPC for doing that.</P>
        <P>Senators Phelan, Keane and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the issue of scrap metal and a Bill that may be introduced in the other House.  The cash for gold issue is a cause for concern throughout the country and even monuments and graveside memorabilia are being stolen for their scrap value.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett and others spoke about the importance of mathematics, languages and economic subjects.  We can raise that issue with the Minister for Education and Skills.  Senator Mooney spoke about school fees, which also can be raised with the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Cullinane and &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of speaking time.  I have repeatedly pointed out that Sinn F&eacute;in does not have sufficient numbers to make up a group.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Member in the previous Seanad sat with other Senators in order to form a group.  I have facilitated Sinn F&eacute;in Senators with far more speaking time than I am required to provide and have given them Private Members&rsquo; time.  I have given the three Sinn F&eacute;in Senators more than a fair opportunity to make their point.  They have three minutes for questions and the three of them can speak on the Order of Business.  They have ample opportunity to contribute and we have facilitated them in practically everything they have requested.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Byrne, Bradford and Noone referred to the Smithwick tribunal.  The chairman of the tribunal wrote to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il on 15 October to indicate that he was not in a position to meet the 30 November deadline.  The Government has approved the Minister for <Col N="516"/>Justice and Equality&rsquo;s proposal to put a motion to the Oireachtas requiring the tribunal to provide a further interim report by 9 March 2012 and to complete its work by 31 May 2012, in line with the chairman&rsquo;s request.  The Government is conscious of the sensitivity that attaches to the tribunal.  The Minister will not be available for most of the day but we have made inquiries and he will return to Dublin at 4.30 p.m., at which point I will facilitate a 15 minute debate on the tribunal.  I am glad to facilitate the House in this regard.  The motion merely deals with an extension of time but if Members require a debate, I will facilitate them.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn raised the issue of organ donations, in respect of which he introduced a Bill several years ago.  I will revert to the Senator within a day or so on the question of whether the Government intends to introduce its own legislation or if he needs to reintroduce his Bill.  It is an important subject.</P>
        <P>On the issue of sick pay, the Minister for Social Protection will be in the House from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.  I understand the cost to the Exchequer of sick pay has increased from &euro;100 million to &euro;900 million in the past decade.  This is unsustainable.  As regards putting the cost onto employers, reference was made yesterday to the Government&rsquo;s role in developing an environment for creating jobs.  The measure appears to be contrary to the measures several Senators and other commentators have outlined in regard to creating such an environment.  However, this is a matter that can be teased out with the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh spoke about bankruptcy legislation and the legal profession.  The Government is committed to introducing bankruptcy legislation at an early stage and the Legal Services Regulation Bill will be debated in the House shortly.  I note the Senator&rsquo;s comments about a cap of &euro;200,000 on salaries for RTE presenters.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to update the Seanad on the trade promotion work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As the time available is short, if there are questions that are not reached, I can come back to them at a later stage if Senators require answers.</P>
        <P>The promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s economic and trading interests overseas has always been a key focus of my Department, in co-operation with other relevant Departments and State agencies.  Embassies can, by virtue of their status in international relations, gain access to the highest levels of government, the media and business in host countries, thus providing a platform to promote Ireland and Irish companies.  Ireland&rsquo;s relatively modest network of embassies and consulates continues to work to restore Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation, which has been affected by the economic and financial crisis, and to support the export-led growth which is crucial to our recovery.</P>
        <P>Following a Government decision, certain trade promotion functions were transferred from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 1 June 2011.  This transfer has given my Department an enhanced role in trade promotion, which should in turn provide a renewed emphasis for this work and help facilitate a stronger relationship with all Departments and State agencies responsible for supporting the growth of Irish exports.</P>
        <P>Export-led growth is fundamental to our plans for economic recovery and the decision by Government to give my Department this enhanced role in trade promotion recognises the importance of the contribution of the Department and its embassy network in delivering the Government&rsquo;s trade strategy.  Local market teams chaired by our ambassadors and including representatives of the relevant State agencies are working hard in all of our priority markets overseas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is responsible for managing the new Export Trade Council.  In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, the first meeting of the Export Trade Council chaired by the T&aacute;naiste took place on Thursday, 29 September 2011.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, and I, together with representatives of other relevant Departments and the CEOs of the appropriate agencies, all participated in the meeting.  In addition, IBEC and the Irish Exporters Association also participated, as did representatives of private sector companies with a track record in exporting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Export Trade Council subsumes the previous Foreign Trade Council and will strengthen co-operation and co-ordination across all key Departments and State agencies involved in promotion and development of trade and exports, as well as overseeing the progressive implementation of the recommendations set out in the Government&rsquo;s trade strategy and action plan, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy, which was published in October 2010.  As Senators will be aware, the strategy seeks to build on our strengths in existing markets and develop exports and tourism in emerging economies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Management of the Export Trade Council will give my Department a key role in implementing aspects of the strategy and will mean a closer relationship with Enterprise Ireland, particularly with regard to trade missions led by the T&aacute;naiste or me.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation retains lead responsibility for trade policy, which includes rep<Col N="519"/>resenting Ireland&rsquo;s trade interests in the context of the EU common commercial policy and at the World Trade Organization.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At its inaugural meeting on 29 September 2011, the council reviewed our recent performance in trade, tourism and investment.  Based on the most recent Central Statistics Office and agency figures, all of the trends were positive.  The council considered a progress report on implementation of the action plan for the trade, tourism and investment strategy to maximise the opportunities, as well as to deal with the challenges and constraints faced by Irish companies trying to grow their businesses abroad.  The council also considered progress reports from the local trade, tourism and investment teams, comprising representatives of the locally based State agencies and chaired by the ambassador or head of mission, to which I have referred.  These teams are established in all 27 priority markets identified in the trade strategy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of key issues were identified at the meeting, which the T&aacute;naiste, as chair of the council will pursue through the framework of the council.  One of the items discussed at the first meeting of the council was progress to date in realigning our visa regime with our economic priorities, which is one of the commitments in the action plan for Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy.  In response, the Department of Justice and Equality set up an interdepartmental mechanism to look at ways of realigning our visa regime to support the Government&rsquo;s integrated strategy for the promotion of overseas trade, tourism and investment.  The visa waiver programme announced at the end of June is the first tangible outcome of the new mechanism set up under the strategy and represents the kind of joined-up action required of the Government if we are to meet the challenge of export-led recovery.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the programme, tourists or business people who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa will be able to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.  They will be allowed to stay in Ireland for up to three months or until their UK visa runs out, whichever is the shorter.  Nationals of 16 countries in all are included in the programme, including India, Kazakhstan, Peoples Republic of China, Uzbekistan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Belarus, Montenegro, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Turkey and Ukraine.  This is an excellent example of a joined-up Government response to what is widely accepted as a genuine constraint to the growth of Irish tourism in new and emerging markets such as China, India and the Gulf.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Justice and Equality will shortly bring to the Cabinet further developments to the visa regime for entrepreneurs and investors who wish to do business in Ireland.  Whereas it is expected that the Council will convene up to three times annually, the terms of reference of the council allow for the establishment of working groups to examine specific topics between its plenary meetings if necessary.  It is intended to hold the second meeting of the council early in 2012.  I emphasise that the Government is committed to doing all in its power to support an export-led recovery by ensuring the most effective and efficient use of all of the available resources, including our embassy network, in order that our trade, tourism and investment sectors are able to maximise opportunities in our existing and key high growth potential markets.  The Government believes the Export Trade Council will play an important role in achieving this objective.</P>
        <P>I know that the Members of this House who contributed to last year&rsquo;s report on Ireland&rsquo;s foreign trade, published by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, were very much in favour&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>Notice taken that 12 Members were not present; House counted and 12 Members being present,</i></P><Col N="520"/>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Members of this House who contributed to the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs last year were very much in favour of a greater role for our embassy network in trade promotion as well as the setting up of a mechanism such as the Export Trade Council with the participation of the private sector.</P>
        <P>My Department now also has an enhanced role in supporting and leading Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s programme of trade missions to develop and expand Ireland&rsquo;s exports to existing and new markets abroad.  The destination of these trade missions is selected on the basis of specific priority international markets being targeted by Enterprise Ireland client companies, where the involvement of a Minister leading the trade mission will add substantially to the efforts of Irish companies to establish and develop long-term business and exports in those markets.</P>
        <P>Currently, Enterprise Ireland is in the process of finalising proposals for trade missions in the first half of 2012.  These proposals will then be discussed between the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and decisions taken on the Ministers to lead each approved mission.</P>
        <P>In addition to Minister-led trade missions, Enterprise Ireland will undertake a complete schedule of other sector-specific events and market visits for which ministerial involvement is not considered necessary.  Trade missions provide an opportunity for Enterprise Ireland client companies to develop links in a market, to win export sales, to engage in international partnerships and joint ventures and establish an in-market presence.  A focus on exporting underpins all missions, ranging from export opportunities identified in the mission market, market opportunities for specific firms or sectors and future growth opportunities.  In future, the potential of trade missions will be maximised by integrating trade, tourism and investment promotion activities, in line with the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to export-led growth and the development of new markets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I assure the House that along with the T&aacute;naiste, I have been very active in promoting trading opportunities through specific missions proposed by Enterprise Ireland and in the course of other working visits abroad since the transfer of certain trade promotion functions to the Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  On 13 October, I attended an Enterprise Ireland construction sector networking event and dinner in the Irish Embassy in London, which was attended by more than 52 companies.  The event demonstrated the importance of Ireland as a source of high quality engineering and construction solutions and allowed leading construction figures from Enterprise Ireland client companies to engage with similar figures from the UK.  The event provided an opportunity to raise the profile of Enterprise Ireland client companies that already provide market-leading construction solutions with key potential partners, while introducing senior level executives from UK organisations to Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>On 13 and 14 October the T&aacute;naiste had a range of meetings in Japan and Korea focused on economic and trade issues.  He attended the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Ireland Business Forum, APIBF, in Seoul.  From 15 to 20 October I led a very successful Enterprise Ireland multi-sectoral trade mission to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and to Qatar, on which 45 companies travelled.  The main objectives of the visits were to help raise the profile of Ireland with established key contacts and to highlight the developing political, economic and commercial links between Ireland and Saudi Arabia and between Ireland and Qatar.  The visits also provided a forum for companies active in the Saudi Arabia and Qatar markets to develop their relationships with customers and partners, while facilitating new business contacts for Irish suppliers in key strategic sectors such as construction, ICT and health care and to promote the emerging sectors of aviation, e-learning, food engineering and oil and gas where Irish companies have a strong reputation.</P><Col N="521"/>
        <P>Over the course of the trade mission a number of Irish companies announced significant new contracts and business alliances across a range of business sectors.  I am confident that the mission provided important support to the ongoing efforts of Irish companies as they continue to win new business and increase their export footprint in these rapidly growing markets and right across the Gulf region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week I led a trade mission to South Africa. The mission included 27 Irish companies and visited Johannesburg and Cape Town and explored opportunities across a wide business spectrum.  While the focus of the trade mission was on the telecommunications, financial services and e-learning sectors, participants from a wide range of industrial and consumer product sectors were also represented, including education, wastewater management, traffic management systems, plastics, publishing and pharmaceutical products.</P>
        <P>The visit was an opportunity to raise Ireland&rsquo;s profile as a key trading partner and investment destination for South Africa, to emphasise the message that Ireland is open for business and to reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to working with South Africa at Government and business levels, through the activities of the embassy, and the State agencies.  During the mission I availed of the opportunity to raise the awareness of Ireland as a source of world class products, services and technologies, to support efforts of the participating companies and enhance their relationship with local partners and customers.  In the course of the trade mission Irish companies announced a number of significant contracts and strategic alliances with a value of more than &euro;15 million across a range of business sectors.</P>
        <P>We see South Africa as a strategically important hub for the region, and the ideal entry point for business across southern Africa.  In this regard I was pleased to announce the opening of a new Enterprise Ireland office in Johannesburg.  I also attended the launch of chapters of the new Ireland-South Africa Business Network in Johannesburg and Cape Town.  It is hoped those networks will be expanded into other areas of southern Africa.  The networks are supported by the embassy in South Africa.</P>
        <P>Trade missions are an important part of our overall strategy of trade diversification.  While the UK, USA and our eurozone partners continue to be key markets for Ireland given our strong knowledge and understanding of these markets, embedded relationships that include historical and cultural links, the nature of our foreign direct investment, FDI, base, and geographic proximity in the case of the UK, the Government is fully committed to developing and expanding engagement with key high potential markets, such as the so-called BRIC countries &mdash; Brazil, Russia, India and China &mdash; I add South Africa to the list, where we are already increasing our trade footprint.  In the four years between 2006 and 2010 our merchandise exports to this group of markets have increased by 69% and our services exports by an even more impressive 130%.  The T&aacute;naiste and I will continue to focus on emerging markets in the period ahead.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In that regard I mention another area for which my Department is now responsible, namely, for the organisation and management of our joint economic commissions, JECs.  Currently, Ireland has JECs with a small number of countries &mdash; Russia, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia and China &mdash; which provide a basis for ongoing, detailed and focused interactions with those countries.  Our existing JEC with Libya, which met last year, may also be reactivated in due course.  JECs are formal bilateral intergovernmental bodies dealing with trade development in all its aspects, be it mercantile or services.  They provide a forum for discussing issues that relate to bilateral trade development and serve to further the development of economic, business, scientific and technological co-operation.  All of our JEC partners are key emerging markets for Ireland where government to government contact is important for bilateral trade and economic relations.  As Irish companies turn to emerging markets as well as our more <Col N="522"/>established markets for new opportunities, our JECs have an important contribution to make in supporting Irish companies which are either trying to enter or grow their business in these markets.  Again, the strategy includes a commitment to maximise the opportunities presented by the existing JECs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">JECs are not appropriate to all markets but where they exist they offer significant opportunities to raise new issues for discussion; raise again issues which are already under discussion between the two countries and seek a response within the context of the JEC; increase awareness of Ireland and the high quality products and services it has to offer; present Ireland in a positive light and highlight our key strengths.  In that context last week during his visit to Russia, the T&aacute;naiste led the Irish delegation, comprising senior representatives of a number of Departments and State agencies, at the eighth meeting of our joint economic commission with Russia, during which the opportunity was availed of to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s expertise in areas such as transport, in particular direct air services between Ireland and Russia; leasing of Irish registered aircraft to Russian airlines and aerospace facilities which Irish companies can offer Russian companies; energy and energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy; co-operation in the areas of innovation, telecommunications and information technologies, high-technology and nanotechnology and e-governance; third level education and English language training and agrifood and related industries.</P>
        <P>The meeting agreed to establish working groups in each of the sectors to provide a follow-up mechanism which will involve a new level of engagement between relevant Departments and State agencies with their Russian counterparts.  It was clear from last week&rsquo;s meeting that there is good potential to increase exports from Ireland to Russia in these sectors, namely, education, agriculture, transport, energy, and information technology.  By taking advantage of existing opportunities and playing to our strengths we can deliver the export-led growth needed to bring about recovery in Ireland&rsquo;s economy.</P>
        <P>I wish to brief the House on another key area of my Department&rsquo;s work, which was already touched on in terms of the reference to last week&rsquo;s visit to South Africa.  We have recognised, as has Irish business, that significant market potential is developing on the African continent, albeit in the longer term.  In September this year, the T&aacute;naiste and I launched the new Africa strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which acknowledges the many positive changes in Africa in the past decade.  It seeks to update our relationship with African countries to move beyond aid to include stronger political ties and the development of mutually beneficial trade.  The Government acknowledges that, although it remains essential, the needs of Africa cannot be met by aid alone and that business and the private sector must also play a role.</P>
        <P>The Africa strategy was launched at the first ever Africa-Ireland Economic Forum which was attended by 20 African countries and 140 Irish businesses.  This event was arranged in partnership with the UCD Michael Smurfit Business Graduate School.  There was strong recognition by all present of the importance of the relationships established across Africa through our engagement in development co-operation; of the need to maintain that development co-operation, focused on reducing poverty and building inclusive economic growth; and of the need now to build on those relationships and adopt a proactive and coherent approach to Ireland&rsquo;s overall relations with the African continent, including trade relationships.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have participated in several events related to increasing trade with Africa.  These include the launch of the study by Value Added Africa on trade with six of our long-term development partners.  I also opened the Ghana Ireland Investors Forum in Dublin in October and the IIEA development studies series earlier this month when a vice president of the African Development Bank spoke of the issue of increased trade and investment in Africa.</P><Col N="523"/>
        <P>Africa is now in a position where it can start to drive its own development.  Huge levels of investment in Africa chase scarce natural resources as well as recognising that Africa, with its growing middle class approaching 300 million people, is also a market for many businesses.</P>
        <P>Within Africa, the major challenge will be how to maximise the potential for economic growth which this foreign direct investment will bring.  The challenge will continue to be how to bring about a better life for citizens, including the eradication of poverty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following last week&rsquo;s trade mission to South Africa I took the opportunity to meet our ambassadors in the region to discuss opportunities to improve trade.  Enterprise Ireland participated in these consultations.  Follow-up trade initiatives will involve activities in Ireland and at embassy level.  In Ireland, my Department will build on the relationship with the UCD Michael Smurfit Business School and identify opportunities for working breakfast meetings between the Irish business sector and key speakers on trade and investment in Africa.  This will include a central role for the resident African ambassadors in Dublin.  Activities at embassy level will be agreed by the ambassador and detailed in the annual embassy business plan.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to brief the House on last month&rsquo;s highly successful Global Irish Economic Forum which was managed by my Department, and which clearly demonstrated that the diaspora is also a substantial asset in our efforts to increase our exports and to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s standing abroad.  Some 270 key decision makers with Irish connections gathered in Dublin Castle.  The forum, as the Taoiseach noted in his letter of invitation, provided an opportunity &ldquo;for the members of the Government to meet directly with many of the most influential members of our diaspora and to discuss our priorities for economic renewal, job creation and the restoration of Ireland&rsquo;s reputation abroad.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The response to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s invitation was overwhelmingly positive.  These 270 members of the global Irish network travelled from around the world at their own expense to contribute to the discussion of these key priorities and how best to achieve them.  The participation of such world-renowned figures as President Clinton and Bono and the constructive and encouraging messages which they communicated were well publicised at home and internationally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try not to be too much longer.  I was talking about the Global Irish Economic Forum.</P>
        <P>Overall, the forum was a very considerable success in terms of the high level of engagement and its substantive outcomes, and it clearly demonstrated the huge level of support and goodwill that Ireland can call upon from among the very highest levels of the international business and cultural communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We intend to publish a full report on the forum shortly, but among those key themes to emerge were ideas such as a world actors forum to be held in Ireland; Mr. Gabriel Byrne was at the forum; a more business-friendly visa system, which I have addressed; a new network of networks; extending the cultural ambassador model to areas such as sport; specific proposals relating to foreign direct investment, the green economy and innovation; and offers ofsupport from the Global Irish Network members for mentoring and other assistance to Irish exporters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to the formal outcomes, a range of initiatives were also announced during the forum.  The announcement by former US President, Mr. Bill Clinton, of his intention to convene a tightly focused meeting in the US with very senior US business executives is very welcome.  Likewise, in response to an invitation from the T&aacute;naiste, a significant number of participants also signed up to be Advocates for Ireland and to undertake tasks such as assisting Irish com<Col N="524"/>panies abroad and investing in post-forum projects.  That means financially investing in post-forum projects.  All participants, and the Government, were in agreement that the event itself was extremely successful and well run, but that its ultimate success will be judged on the implementation of its outcomes.</P>
        <P>The Government is deeply conscious of the need to have a robust and inclusive follow-up process, which fully involves the diaspora in the active implementation of initiatives.  To this end, the new advisory and implementation group will be co-chaired by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and will include representatives from the Global Irish Network from each of the main geographic areas.</P>
        <P>I thank all of the participants in today&rsquo;s debate.  Because there will not be much time for questions, I reiterate that I will be happy to respond to questions which are not reached on the floor of the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State.  It is clear from her speech the tremendous work she is doing.  I know she is an ideological politician with tremendous integrity and for that reason I have total faith in her.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will focus on the economic situation in Ireland, Europe and the world.  Last Thursday, Mr. Olli Rehn, the EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, presented his report on the current EU economic outlook and said Europe is headed for hard times and recession.  He said forecasts for next year have weakened considerably since the spring and economic growth in the eurozone is expected to be an anaemic average of 0.5%, down from 1.8% which was the expectation earlier this year.  The Commissioner called this a final wake-up call.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, stated in its latest employment outlook that recovery was stalling and that this was not good news for unemployment and employment prospects.  The Secretary General of the OECD said that of all the facets of the crisis, from sovereign debt to banking, high unemployment was the elephant in the room.  I am sure that all here today would agree with that.  Every day we hear about the sovereign debt and the banks, but unemployment does not hit the radar as seriously as it should.  Unemployment is the human face of the crisis and the most visible manifestation of the challenge we face to restore sustained growth.  The outlook puts the spotlight on two particularly worrying aspects of the current situation: the serious threat of unemployment becoming entrenched and the disproportionate impact of the crisis on youth unemployment.  Tackling persistent unemployment, improving job opportunities and ensuring adequate social safety nets should be at the top of the political agenda.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many of us here have had transition year students working with us and learning about what goes on here over the past couple of weeks.  These students are full of enthusiasm and are on the cusp of participating in the economy and our political system, but I am seriously concerned about their job prospects.  It is vital that we ensure that the younger generation will be able to get jobs in Ireland.  As Members are all aware, the rate of emigration has soared by 45% this year, with an astonishing 40,000 people leaving the country.  Simply, there are too few jobs for <Col N="525"/>young people leaving school or graduating from university.  In a recent magazine report, Professor Brendan Walsh, speaking particularly about men without work, said that the rise in the unemployment rate reveals a grim picture of the impact of the recession.  The overall unemployment rate has risen from 4.4% at the beginning of 2007 to 14.6% today.  Male unemployment is now 17.3%, while unemployment among young men aged 20 to 24 is 32.23%.   There is no doubt that unemployment causes serious mental stress for individuals and families.  It behoves all of us in the Oireachtas, and the Minister of State and her colleagues in government in particular, to make serious decisions on this.  I know the Minister of State is valiantly giving a 100% effort in this regard.  We want the government to make the serious decisions.  We are on a serious austerity programme, but we also need a plan for growth.  We are the fair haired boys and girls in Europe because of our austerity programme, but we also need a programme for growth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is not much Ireland as a small economy can do to improve the EU or OECD economic outlook.  It simply means that the Government and firms must act even more smartly to identify and provide the products and services customers want.  We have not made much of an impact even in static markets or in exploiting markets that are still growing, such as those of India and China.  This has been highlighted by the body that nominated me to the Seanad, the Irish Exporters Association.  One of the benefits of being a small economy is that even in the face of a static international economy, it only takes a small extra slice of that market to boost our economy.  We can and must influence start-ups and expansion of Irish SME enterprises in the midst of a recession.</P>
        <P>I speak from first hand experience, as Lir Chocolates was started in the middle of a recession in the 1980s.  Connie Doody and myself and our staff worked passionately to develop the company.  In Ireland in the 1980s the national average unemployment was 17% and in many pockets and areas unemployment reached 40%.  However, we put our hearts and minds together and developed a company.  We started Lir Chocolates in the middle of a recession and there is no reason a similar venture cannot happen again if SMEs get the proper support.  Today, Lir Chocolates employs 250 people in Navan and this can be emulated.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Government on its support to the banks, but making money available for SMEs is still critical.  It is up to family and friends now to help people as the banks are not forthcoming with funds.  The revised code for banks dealing with SMEs published by the Central Bank is an improvement and it will put the screws on the banks and ensure they are more careful about personal guarantees.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator White for sharing her time.  I welcome the Minister of State and welcome her statement to the House.  We must realise that we live in one of the most open economies in the world.  Our exports are in excess of 100% of our GDP, whereas the comparative figure for Europe is 40%.  This shows our dependency on the export market.  Therefore, the recent slowdown trend, particularly in the merchandise manufacturing sector, is very worrying.  If it continued, it could derail our economic prospects which are predicated on export growth.  While we have seen a huge and welcome increase of 15% in exports in the agri-food sector this year, we must be aware that our important pharmaceutical-chemical sector is slowing down and our computer hardware exports are falling.</P>
        <P>All of this highlights the need to concentrate on other markets and the Minister of State has addressed this to some extent.  We should concentrate in particular on the BRIC countries, although she did not mention Brazil or South America in her statement.  She did not mention Mexico or Central America either, yet these are markets we need to consider.  We should also look at Indonesia.  We need to broaden our horizons if we are to tackle the problem.  The IMF has said that growth in emerging economies will be approximately 6%.  Some 80% of our <Col N="526"/>exports go to the US and Europe, but the IMF predicts only a 2% growth in those markets.  It is essential that we look to other markets.</P>
        <P>This brings me to some questions for the Minister of State.  I like the idea of trade councils and of involving our embassies, but why, therefore, are we closing our embassy in Iran?  We exported products worth &euro;82 million to Iran in 2010, so closing the embassy there defies logic.  We have embassies in many places where we have nothing like the magnitude of that trade.  The Minister of State spoke about Qatar and Saudi Arabia.  Three weeks ago, I attended the world economic forum at the Dead Sea, but there was no representation from Ireland at it, which was extraordinary.  However, thousands of delegates from Africa, Europe and the Middle East attended.  There were delegates from many Arab countries there.  While I welcome the concentration on Qatar and Saudi Arabia, there is significant opportunity within the Arab world.  Given our disposition to the Palestinian cause, we might have favoured status there.  I urge the Minister of State to look at that.</P>
        <P>I believe the British visa proposal is a good initiative.  Will the Minister of State confirm there is a reciprocal arrangement in place so that people coming to Ireland who obtain Irish visas will have the same facility in going to Britain?  My final question has to do with the capital programme.  Why is it indicated in the capital programme that the need to address fiscal targets will require some retrenchment of funding for research and development?  Research and development are the cornerstone for growth.  We are cutting funds for Science Foundation Ireland by &euro;5 million, despite the fact that its research is the cornerstone for future growth.  If we have learned anything, we should have learned that we must concentrate our scarce resources on areas that will lead to growth and lead us out of the current crisis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House, congratulate and compliment her on the comprehensive report she has given to the House and wish her success in her challenging Ministry.  Never before have we had needed such a Ministry to be as successful as we need it to be now.  The programme for Government identifies that Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth must be export led and commits to achieving the maximum growth in exports, including the long-term development of new markets.  The Government has clearly signalled its commitment to this objective by having two Ministries with a trade-export remit, the Department of Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, at which the Minister of State has responsibility for trade.  We all welcome and are very encouraged by the latest external trade figures published yesterday by the CSO which show a significant increase in exports in September, despite all the difficulties in the global economy.  There was an 11% increase in the balance of trade surplus in September, month on month, amounting to &euro;4.113 billion, just short of the all-time high of &euro;4.183 billion achieved in June.  There was a 4% increase in exports in the first eight months of the year by comparison with the same period last year.</P>
        <P>I welcome the commitment given by the Government to implement progressively the recommendations included in the strategy and action plan for Irish trade, tourism and investment to 2015, entitled, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy, developed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation last year.  This is an integrated strategy and global in scope.  It covers both established and new high growth potential markets.  The targets set are ambitious.  By 2015, it is hoped to create 150,000 new jobs in manufacturing, tourism and traded services, with a similar number of indirectly created jobs.  The targets are to increase the value of the exports of indigenous companies by 33%, increase the number of overseas visitors to Ireland by 1 million per annum and secure an additional 780 inward investment projects through IDA Ireland.  The strategy document is impressive in that it includes an in-depth analysis of recent <Col N="527"/>performance across the three sectors and an aggressive action plan to build on existing strengths with a view to driving trade relations with established, new and emerging economies.</P>
        <P>The strategy adopts a two-pronged approach focusing on particular markets and sectors.  It identifies the potential to further grow existing key markets and, most particularly, increase or gain a foothold in high growth and high potential markets such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and key Middle Eastern countries.  It sets a number of specific targets for our performance in key areas, to be achieved by 2015.  These targets, agreed by the relevant State agencies &mdash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland &mdash; are to be implemented through a suite of actions driven by them.</P>
        <P>Trade missions comprise a key element in achieving trade expansion.  I encourage the two relevant Departments to increase the number of trade missions, although many would want to scale back on travel.  However, trade missions are particularly productive, as the Minister indicated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the setting up of a new Export Trade Council to strengthen co-operation and co-ordination across all Departments and State agencies involved in the promotion and development of trade and exports.  This is a most positive development and pulls together all the key players, including Ministers, departmental officials, exporters, companies and business representatives.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery will be driven by an increase in exports and the attraction of additional visitors.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>To help us to achieve our priorities and targets, we must focus on strengthening our international profile and improving our reputation abroad.  There has been much progress made in the past eight or nine months in enhancing our reputation abroad and getting the public finances in order.  We must maximise the benefit of trade missions and continue to leverage the benefit of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations around the world.  We are all aware of the wonderful opportunity it presents to showcase the very best of Ireland.  I advocated that Ministers partake of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day activities around the world to promote and develop our export industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must develop tool kits for Irish businesses trying to enter new markets.  We must develop Ireland as a hub for global enterprise and continue to build a competitive environment for enterprise.  We should maximise the use of the diaspora throughout the world.  The Global Irish Economic Forum was certainly an effort in this regard and I congratulate everyone involved in making it such a success.</P>
        <P>We need to exploit the benefits of the European Single Market as we live in very challenging times.  There is great uncertainty throughout the world, as other Senators said.  We live in a small, open economy.  We perform very well in some sectors, while our exports are buoyant.  We are doing well in tourism, while the agriculture sector has considerable potential.  We need to build on these sectors.  The Government has a plan and a strategy.  I wish the Minister of State and her colleagues every success in leading us back to economic recovery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is very welcome.  She knows this House well.  We spent a number of years here together and it is great to see her in her new job.  She has obviously taken it on with enthusiasm and is full of the necessary confidence.</P><Col N="528"/>
        <P>I spoke this morning to former MEP Eoin Ryan, our representative on the board of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  He told me not enough people knew about that bank, yet Irish taxpayers are contributing to it.  He stated the bank had offices in many places that it would love to be used.  He asked us to ensure Irish exporters used them.  Irish taxpayers are entitled to use the services.  The bank has offices all over the former Soviet Union and recently opened offices in Tunisia and some other north African countries.  It would be a shame not to use these facilities in countries with which we may not have full diplomatic relations.</P>
        <P>I wrote an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last week in which I raised the massive issue of Ireland&rsquo;s chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  When we take over the chairmanship for one year, starting on 1 January, our doing so will present us with a significant opportunity.  The OSCE is what is known as a regional security organisation.  It has 56 members dealing with political, military, economic and environmental issues, as well as the human dimension which covers a range of areas, including human rights and the holding of free elections.  Given that Ireland, as chairman, will be the focus of this massive and influential organisation, we can use the opportunity to find new international partners for Irish businesses.  Given that we will be the focus of a massive and influential organisation, we can use the opportunity to leverage new international partners for Irish businesses.  In particular, Ireland&rsquo;s chairmanship of the OSCE will allow us to reach out to states that are increasing in wealth and importance, such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.  It must be kept in mind that we do not have resident representatives in these countries.  Irish companies currently active or interested in doing business with those countries can expect better name recognition for Ireland during 2012.  We can also look to secure investment from these growing economies.  Kazakhstan, for example, is one of the world&rsquo;s top 20 oil producers.  Tony Blair is now advising the Government of Kazakhstan in regard to increasing its trade links with the UK.  Other OSCE countries with limited supplies of natural resources, such as Georgia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, offer huge potential in terms of investment in their services industries.</P>
        <P>Irish exports are our strong point.  The fact that our exports to Kazakhstan have increased by 25% over the past year indicates the potential for further growth.  Our chairmanship of the OSCE will gives us greater influence in making contacts and securing trade with other member states.  If we are able to achieve progress in resolving the ongoing conflicts in Georgia, Moldova and Azerbaijan by using our experience of the Northern Ireland peace process, we can expect to increase our name recognition and ability to foster trade links.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the naive belief that everybody loves Ireland persists.  Foreign businessmen and diplomats have pointed out to me that such a belief is far from true.  Ireland&rsquo;s reputation has taken a severe blow from the economic, financial and political woes of recent years.  We are doing our best to change this reputation but it has not helped that certain politicians touted Ireland as the model everyone should follow during the boom.  I was one of those who had a great experience in explaining to people about how we moved from the bottom to the top of the pile.  The reasons I outlined included social partnership, which we are shy to mention at present, investments in education and our tax rates.  Ten or 15 years ago I argued in countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Panama that we had done a good job but I realise now that I was not as right as I believed.  Our chairmanship of the OSCE and the EU Presidency in 2013 will help to restore our reputation as a sound and reliable member of the international community and, hopefully, boost trade.  Tourists from countries that were not aware of our existence heretofore are expected to spend millions of euro in Ireland during 2012 as a direct result of our chairmanship of the OSCE.</P><Col N="529"/>
        <P>Can the Minister of State outline what her Department is doing to take advantage of this opportunity?  What business opportunities have been identified and how does she plan to inform Irish businesses about them?  If she has not already done so, I implore her to start identifying the opportunities.  The OSCE has limited name recognition in the western part of Europe but it is widely known in the rapidly growing post-Soviet states.</P>
        <P>I have previously spoken on the issue of training diplomats to increase trade.  My granddaughter, who turns 20 this month, was born and lives in France.  She is spending her second year in university in China because she wants to be a diplomat in the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  This is not something we do in Ireland.  We send our diplomats to China, Japan or Korea for three or four years when they are in their 40s or 50s but they never really learn the languages of these countries fluently.  French diplomats are prepared to steep themselves in the cultures and languages of the countries to which they are deployed.  We should encourage a cadre of young people in their early 20s to join our diplomatic service and live in countries like China, Japan or Korea.  If they can steep themselves in the cultures of these countries, when they are appointed as ambassadors in their 40s and 50s we will be more likely to secure trade and investment.  We are not looking far enough ahead, particularly given the developments occurring in places like central Asia and China.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to discuss these matters.  She will find that we can offer useful information.  I apologise if I have usurped other Senators&rsquo; time.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">All of us are aware of the difficulties that the country faces.  One route to recovery is through exports, the smart economy and tourism.  Export-led growth offers a way forward if we can resolve our domestic problems and put the public finances in order.   Even in these recessionary times, our export trade has grown significantly.  However, we cannot be complacent and in this context I am delighted that the trade council has been established.  Our performance in agri-food and tourism is encouraging.  We have a strong background in education and English is the main trading language used in many of our major trading partners, including India, the UK and various parts of Europe.</P>
        <P>There is probably an Irish bar in every city in the world but I have yet to go into one in which tourism to Ireland was promoted.  There are pictures of the countryside and representations of our culture but I have yet to see a brochure advertising holidays in Ireland.  Irish bars offer a potential network of tourism offices and I am sure they would be happy to distribute marketing material.  No other country in the world has a similar network.  People go into Irish bars because our culture means something to them.  It is a brand that can be more aggressively sold.</P>
        <P>Euro 2012 offers further marketing opportunities in Ukraine and Poland, which have a combined population of more than 80 million.  As one of the smallest countries in the tournament, we will receive considerable attention.  After the 1990 World Cup, Italian tourists came in their droves to Ireland because of the positive messages left by Irish fans.  I have never heard of an Irish fan being arrested or found drunk, although I stand to be corrected.  Perhaps there might be a focus on UEFA Euro 2012 to be held in Ukraine and Poland, two big economies.  Obviously, people in Poland are familiar with Ireland because the two countries are in the European Union but Ukraine has a massive population of 46 million.  As it is almost the size of France, there is potential for us to find a market there.  I hope Tourism Ireland will in marketing this country avail of that opportunity next summer.</P><Col N="530"/>
        <P>I welcome the introduction of the visa waiver scheme.  A huge number of Indian people come to the United Kingdom and Ireland.  English is their first language and India is a good trading nation which has a strong software industry.  Many Indians live in Letterkenny and work in the Pramerica factory.  They are keen to come to Ireland and develop a business here.  My experience with the health care industry in Letterkenny started about 30 years ago.  There are many Irish-born experts in health care who have the expertise and knowledge to develop the health care business in Ireland.  The health care market worldwide is massive and growing all the time.  As people are healthier and living longer, the more health care interventions and components manufactured in Ireland, the more it will help the economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I look forward to us developing the market in the Far East.  Indonesia, for example, has a population of 400 million.  There are markets in the Far East that we have not yet touched and I am delighted that there are trade missions to these countries.  It is money well spent.  The IDA did this to develop the export market and brought people to Ireland when it was, perhaps, not the thing to do.  I am glad, therefore, that trade missions led by the Minister will be sent to these countries.  Senator Quinn referred to the various &ldquo;Stan&rdquo; countries which, again, have a massive population base.  We might think everybody knows about Ireland, but they do not.  However, when they get to know it, we can trade well with them.  This brings me back to the point about Irish bars.  I am sure there is an Irish bar in Kazakhstan.  It is probably called &ldquo;Stan&rsquo;s Bar&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We have the potential to develop our export markets.  This will get us out of our current economic straits, but it will require a great deal of hard work and, perhaps, a lot of luck.  The domestic economy is flat and the European economy is not growing, but we have markets in the BRIC countries and the Far East to develop.  I wish the Minister luck.</P>

        <P>I am very impressed by the strategy.  In particular, identifying Africa as an area of growth in the longer term is far-seeing.  I agree with the concept of using South Africa as the hub of that growth.  I suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The reasonable way to approach Africa is by taking the bilateral approach, in the way we have done with foreign aid.  We have built a number of positive relationships with the countries with which we have bilateral aid programmes.  This offers us an opportunity to develop the benefits of critical mass.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are two areas we should consider.  The Minister mentioned, in the context of the Russian visit, the importance of education.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of this, but the United States and the United Kingdom engage in educational franchising, that is, they franchise educational programmes in third countries.  This has proved to be a successful way of <Col N="531"/>bringing income into the third and fourth level systems in the United Kingdom.  Similarly, medical tourism is very popular in the Middle East.  It is an important source of income in a number of Middle Eastern countries.  These are areas Ireland could explore in that regard.  In the context of educational franchising and medical tourism, a cross-departmental approach is critical.  As many of these sectors do not have the capacity to engage in export-orientated activities, it will be essential to adopt that cross-departmental approach.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for giving of her time this morning.  I read an article by Gordon Brown in one of the newspapers recently not only about trade between Ireland and countries outside Europe but also about Europe&rsquo;s role.  The figures he produced showed that less than 7.5% of all exports from Europe went to the countries that accounted for 70% of the global growth rate this year.  Only 2% of exports from Europe go to China, 1% to India and 1% to Brazil, countries with economies that are growing massively.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>From the Irish point of view, there is a need for joined-up thinking at European level, whereby Europe would be more proactive in ensuring we gain a bigger slice of the world market.  Some years ago it accounted for 40% of the world market but now it dominates only 20%.  Has there been any discussion at European level about gaining access to these markets?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>In announcing his decision to shut the Irish Embassy in the Vatican the T&aacute;naiste cited economic reasons because of the economic challenges.  In other words, our embassies and overseas missions must pay their way.  In this context and given that the appointment of ambassadors has always been the preserve of the public service and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is it time to reflect on a suggestion made repeatedly in both Houses in the past ten or 20 years?  I refer to the suggestion that some of those holding ambassadorial roles need not necessarily come from the Civil Service stream.  Instead, they could be former business people or politicians who could make excellent trade ambassadors.  Ireland is unique in having ambassadorial appointments entirely as the preserve of what I call a certain elitist class.  Should consideration be given to appointing people from outside the Civil Service, with experience in business, commerce and politics, to serve in some of the key overseas posts?</P>

	<P>I will be brief.  I have listened to the debate in the Chamber for most of the morning and small and medium enterprises have not received recognition for the part they must and will play, if given the opportunity.  Many small industries began in back kitchens, garages or homes and have developed.  I am aware of one which has developed into an enterprise employing 12 or 14 people which now produces for a worldwide market.  While there are entrepreneurs in all communities, it should be part of Government policy that provision be made by local authorities, county enterprise boards or some agency for the making available of developed sites for small industries on an industrial estate.  We cannot depend on multinationals forever and the future lies in having small industries.  It should be Government policy to provide such sites.  I am aware of one such site in County Meath that has 120 people working on it.  Imagine having a similar estate in each county.  Ten times 26 is 260 and with ten people working on each, one would have a couple of hundred thousand people.  This space should be provided, as it is needed.</P>

	<P>I again thank those Senators who were constructive in the debate.  The vast majority of contributions were highly constructive and I will incorporate them in ongoing discussions, as they were made in a positive manner.  I will draw a few conclusions.  In this context, I note that in the very first contribution Senator White raised the issue of job creation.  Essentially, our recovery will be export-led&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senator White raised the issue of job creation.  To create jobs, we must continue to grow our exports.  That is my main message and focus.  </P>
        <P>I will include all the positive suggestions that have come from this House.  I refer, for example, to using strategic opportunities such as those presented by our chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE; our participation in the soccer finals next year in Ukraine and Poland and the Olympic Games next year.  In the context of the Olympic Games, Senator Walsh asked whether the visa arrangement was reciprocal.  Unfortunately, it is not at present, but the discussions are ongoing.  However, that proposal originated in Ireland in order that we could use the opportunity provided by the Olympic Games to attract tourists from other countries.  The point on Irish bars is another interesting one.  We will incorporate all these ideas because we want to use whatever suggestions are coming from across the floor.</P>
        <P>In response to the single question from Sinn F&eacute;in, Canada is a priority market.  There were so many other questions that I will not be able to cover them.</P>
        <P>Even though I may not have referred to each country on an individual basis, we have a strong focus on the BRIC countries and the various opportunities they offer.  The co-ordinated Africa strategy referred to by Senator Hayden was only published in September and we will be building on that development.  I am glad Senator Quinn raised the issue of contact with our representative on the board of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Mr. Eoin Ryan, because he also contacted me in this regard.  I am glad this point was raised publicly because there is little awareness of the existence of the bank.  There are other international banks with which we are also linked.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I will outline the changes I have made since I was appointed Minister in March and give a flavour of the challenges facing us and how I propose to tackle them.  I have looked with fresh eyes at the existing social protection system, schemes and policies.  I am targeting aspects of the system for change and development while, at the same time, following through on commitments for my Department in the programme for Government.  The job we all have is to rebuild our welfare state in a way that is appropriate to the 21st century and this is a huge challenge.</P>
        <P>I refer to expenditure on social welfare.  The social protection budget increased dramatically during the Celtic tiger years.  In 2001, spending on social protection stood at &euro;7.84 billion and the 2010 outturn stands at &euro;21.35 billion.  This is an increase of 272%, which is way in excess of the increase in inflation of approximately 30% during the same period.  Spending on schemes, services and administration in 2011 is estimated at &euro;20.62 billion.  Support for children and families accounts for 11.8% of expenditure or almost &euro;3 billion, of which &euro;2.07 billion will go on child benefit.  A wide range of supports for people of working age accounts for more than 54.7% of overall expenditure or almost &euro;11.3 billion.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit account for in excess of &euro;3.6 billion while more than &euro;1.1 billion will be spent on the one-parent family payment.  Carers will receive &euro;762 million in total.  Pensions and other supports for retired and older people account for 29.6% of overall expenditure or &euro;6.1 billion.</P>
        <P>Now that the recession has bitten hard and deep we have a scale of expenditure that is completely out of step with our ability to fund it.  We do not have the means or revenue as a country to support our level of spending.  This year, spending will be approximated &euro;18 billion more than overall Government income.  The Government will get &euro;42 billion from tax and PRSI, over &euro;20 billion of which will be spent by the Department of Social Protection.  The Department accounts for 39% of all current expenditure and therefore a sustainable fiscal position cannot be achieved without some reduction in welfare expenditure.</P>
        <P>A core commitment in the programme for Government is the restoration of fiscal stability.  Restoring fiscal stability is essential to saying &ldquo;Goodbye&rdquo; to the IMF and the troika.  Even those who favour default would have to cope with exactly the same issue, except in that event, the deficit would have to be cleared in a year rather than over the period in the negotiated programme.  My Department has recently completed a comprehensive review of expenditure which will inform the budgetary process and will help to identify how we find a balance between reducing expenditure and supporting those most in need through the supports and services offered by my Department.  I am conscious of how many people rely on support from the Department of Social Protection.  Offering them the continuation of that support is vital but we must equally help people get to back to work and achieve economic independence.  We talk about national sovereignty but personal financial independence is also an issue, particularly for people of working age.  If they from time to time lose their job or become ill, they should get support from the social insurance system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People have spoken recently about illness benefit and statutory sick pay.  The number of people claiming illness benefit and other disability payments has increased greatly in the past <Col N="536"/>ten years from about 170,000 to 247,000.  The cost to the Exchequer of paying illness benefit, not disability and not invalidity benefit, has risen from &euro;330 million to &euro;900 million during that period.  At any given time there are 80,000 people on illness benefit.  That amounts to 20 million working days lost for which the Department of Social Protection is paying.  In European terms, the 20 million working days, compared with the number of people at work in the economy, is very high when compared with our competitors.  We have people in work who become seriously ill and for whom the supports are provided.  The cost to the State of all schemes that cover illness and disability will amount to over &euro;2.7 billion this year.  Illness benefit is &euro;900 million and other payments related to illness and disability bring the total to &euro;2.7 billion.</P>
        <P>Introducing statutory sick pay would only mean that employers would have to pay for sick pay for their employees for a period of up to four weeks.  After that, the State would continue to pay and would fund invalidity and disability payments.  This reform would still leave Irish employers in a very favourable position compared with their counterparts in competitor countries, such as Britain and the Netherlands, where employers pay for sick leave for more extended periods.  The social protection budget could be cut by more than &euro;150 million if this reform was introduced.</P>
        <P>Most other European countries, including all of our major competitors, oblige employers to pay for some sick pay costs.  In the Netherlands the employer pays for up to two years.  In Britain, one of our most important markets and competitors, the employer pays for up to 28 weeks.  In Belgium the employer pays for up to four weeks while in Germany the employer pays for up to six weeks.  This has been researched in depth because it is an important issue in most developed economies with good social protection systems.  OECD research has indicated a strong link between the period of sick absences and employer contributions to sick pay costs, both in the public and private sector.  The social insurance fund should pay for long-term illness benefit while the short-term benefit should be payable by employers.  If managers had to manage sick pay as a budget item, absenteeism could be reduced in the public and private sectors.  All the OECD evidence points to this being so.</P>
        <P>It is notable that absentee rates in the Netherlands dropped from 10% to 4% after statutory sick pay was introduced.  This is the difficulty we face when debating these reforms.  We can hardly expect the troika to accept a situation where the country they are bailing out is in danger of becoming this decade&rsquo;s &ldquo;sick man of Europe&rdquo;.  Fifteen years ago in the Netherlands, 1 million people were being paid sick pay and that figure was reduced by 50% over a period of years.</P>
        <P>The OECD notes that Ireland does not oblige employers to pay a contribution and recommended in a report published in 2008 that Ireland should consider introducing such a scheme.  Even though Ireland does not oblige employers to pay a contribution to sick pay costs we still have one of the lowest average rates of employer PRSI as measured by the OECD.  Our rate of PRSI for employers is low at 9.7% compared with 18.2% in Finland, 16.2% in Germany, 23% in Belgium, and 12.9% in Poland.  Even Latvia, which people talk about as a very low tax country has high employer and employee PRSI rates to provide for its social security system.</P>
        <P>Our low employer PRSI rate means that the social insurance fund is running a deficit which amounted to &euro;2.5 billion in 2010.  This deficit cannot go unaddressed.  In this debate, the choice is to increase PRSI rates, reduce benefits or change the payment model in a manner which asks employers to share some cost but also gives them control over the management of the cost.  I know Senators share my concern about high absenteeism rates and their impact on productivity.  One of the key aspects of the proposed reform is that it will give employers in the private and public sectors an incentive to manage absenteeism.  In addition, it will reduce administrative costs in the Department of Social Protection.  Approximately 300 of my staff deal mainly with processing sick pay claims.  These employees would be much better employed <Col N="537"/>in trying to combat fraud within the social welfare system by carrying out inspections and checking that those claiming social welfare and employers are properly accounted for within the Department&rsquo;s system.</P>
        <P>I stress that these reforms apply as much to the public sector as they do to the private sector.  Senators probably do not realise that my Department pays for the sick days of persons employed in the public sector.  For example, it pays for the sick days of employees of the HSE.  The statutory sick pay proposal emphatically does not provide for a transfer of the cost from the public to the private sector.  Given that the private sector ultimately funds the public sector, either through taxation or other charges such as PRSI, this criticism does not stack up.  We are trying to change the culture of absenteeism and there is broad agreement that this is a matter we should address.  In the long term tackling this culture will be beneficial to both people&rsquo;s health and the economic well-being of the companies for which they work.  Those who have been involved in managing or employing people will recognise this fact.  If some individuals are seen by their co-workers to be taking more sick days that would otherwise be considered the norm, this can give rise to difficulties.  If the Government is paying, the private sector is also paying &mdash; it is just that the payment is routed through Government channels.</P>
        <P>Usually, the cry from the private sector is to define collective services narrowly and minimise State involvement.  The logic behind this is to allow private businesses and individuals to manage their own affairs to the greatest extent possible.  There is normally praise for reforms which minimise bureaucratic overheads in order that the overall cost will be reduced.  Obviously, an issue arises with the capability of small enterprises to fund sick day payments, particularly in the context of exceptional cases involving prolonged absences in respect of serious illnesses.  There is some merit in the State providing an insurance mechanism for collective cover.  The key question is when this cover should kick in.  Under the proposals under consideration, it would come into play at four weeks.  This would be at the lower level in our peer countries and, therefore, provide an earlier and more comprehensive form of collective cover compared, for example, with the United Kingdom in which state cover kicks in at 28 weeks.</P>
        <P>In view of its low corporation tax and PRSI rates, Ireland remains a very friendly place in which to do business.  There is a need to consider the examples of the Netherlands and the Nordic countries.  These states have good welfare systems which provide people and employers with support when they need it.  In some ways, during the Celtic tiger era it was possible for Ministers for Finance to introduce many increases to cash payments.  There is a need, therefore, to consider how we might spend the more limited funds at our disposal now as wisely as possible in order that they might benefit people in the most effective way.  We must also introduce reforms which will bring the provision in this country &mdash; as is the case with the proposal to which I refer &mdash; into line with the lowest level in our competitor countries.</P>
        <P>In addition to focusing on expenditure, it is essential to reform and transform the system of social protection.  In the past increased expenditure on social protection was focused on increases in rates and expanding the number and size of schemes.  The system has become increasingly complex.  Consequently, it is difficult to understand for those who need to engage with it and inflexible for those who administer it.  I would like us to put in place a system that is easier to understand, more flexible to administer and amenable to change, both as the economy changes and contingencies arise.  While the system provides a basic level of income support, it does not sufficiently enable or encourage people of working age to get back to work, or, in the absence of jobs, return to education or training.</P>
        <P>The system is fostering a culture of welfare dependence rather than one of economic independence, self-direction and self-determination.  The replacement rate or the proportion of their former wages that unemployed persons receive in benefits has increased in the case of <Col N="538"/>some recipients to levels which may discourage them from seeking work.  In providing and retaining an all-encompassing safety net we have taken away choices and opportunities.  As with so many matters relating to my portfolio, we need to strike the correct balance between social protection and encouraging initiative, employment and economic independence.  Necessity is the mother of invention and we want to empower people to explore solutions in meeting their own needs.  This will not happen in adopting an open-ended approach to providing payments.  As the recent NESC reported points out, the social welfare system has been passive in providing much but demanding very little in return.  We must turn this around in order that entitlement to support will be based on a commitment to prepare for future opportunities in a timely manner and to grasp those possibilities when they arise.</P>
        <P>The Government has taken the first important steps on this path, including, for example, the introduction of the JobBridge scheme.  I am pleased to report that over 2,500 people are now involved.  Employers and host organisations have offered a further 2,500 plus individuals opportunities to participate in the scheme which is a work in progress and we are only in week 21.  However, the feedback is extremely positive and the scheme has given opportunities to people who could not get jobs because they were not in a position to gain experience.  However, JobBridge is not perfect and I have taken into account all the comments Members of both Houses have made on it.  The scheme is under constant review in order that we might identify ways to improve it.  We have taken a great deal of feedback from host employers and organisations and those participating in the scheme.</P>
        <P>JobBridge represents a small but valuable addition in providing opportunities for particular types of people.  I refer to individuals who recently emerged from different levels of education or training or those who previously worked in the construction industry and now want to try to change careers.  I was happy to be involved recently with a Skillnets programme for engineers.  As a result of the downturn in the construction industry, the opportunities for engineers have dried up.  However, the Skillnets programme to which I refer allowed a number of them to retrain and they have now embarked on new career paths with companies which produce medical devices.  I am sure Members can think of other examples where we will be able to help people who have very good work experience and education but for whom the construction industry is not there any more in the way it was during the Celtic tiger era.</P>
        <P>My Department is carrying out a major transformation and changing the way it does business.  A number of services are being integrated into the Department.  Responsibility for the office of social inclusion transferred back to the Department in May 2011.  The community welfare service transferred from the HSE to the Department on 1 October 2011, which involved 1,000 staff.</P>
        <P>The F&Aacute;S employment and community services will formally join the Department on 1 January, and very detailed preparations are under way to ensure this deadline is met and that the transfer of services and staff is as seamless and smooth as possible.  Senior managers in the employment and community services side of F&Aacute;S have already begun to transfer to the Department and almost 700 staff have been identified as transferring in total.  The remainder of the staff will stay with the new organisation, SOLAS, which will take over the education and training functions of the old F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Once the F&Aacute;S employment and community services people join the community welfare officers at the Department, we will try to build a single point service or one-stop-shop where people who have become unemployed can come to claim a benefit or support from the Department and be encouraged to enter a process where they receive advice, options and opportunities, particularly with regard to education and training to get back into the job market.  We all know the job market is very difficult at present but none the less there is a churn of jobs <Col N="539"/>and it is very important that those on the register have as much opportunity as possible to take up this employment.  Following the integration of the F&Aacute;S and community welfare officers, we hope the national employment and entitlements service will commence in April.  It is important we get this to work.</P>
        <P>I am also very conscious that the Department must develop a service for employers.  One constantly reads of situations in the newspapers whereby an employer has vacancies but finds it difficult to fill them.  We must improve contact between the Department and employers.  I am pleased to say I recently held the first stakeholder meeting between the various employers organisations and the Department to discuss how we can work together.</P>
        <P>I am also examining a situation which many Senators have mentioned on occasion, which is the classic situation of people who obtain work for several days or weeks and are concerned about taking it up because they must sign off and feel they may return to the bottom of the queue.  I believe it will be possible to work out a new system of suspending payments so if one obtains work for four weeks, one can e-mail or text the Department to suspend the claim and when one returns, one will not have to start all over again at the back of the queue for applications.  This is something departmental staff have identified.  I have visited quite a number of social welfare offices to speak to staff and meet people at the counters to find out what would help those on social welfare to get the jobs that are available and assist them and employers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of other developments in the Department are ongoing.  A group is examining child and family supports which hopes to commence an examination of the position of self-employed people when it comes to social protection.  As Members probably know, self-employed people are entitled to pay a contribution of only 4% which entitles them to the old age and widow-widower pensions.  Self-employed people are quite interested in becoming contributors and having their entitlement to other benefits examined.  We will have to examine this carefully and consider the cost involved.  Self-employed people would have to pay a greatly increased contribution.  I know many self-employed people who may have been employed previously would like to move to this system.  I have asked the working group on the integration of tax and social welfare to commence examining it shortly as a matter of priority.</P>
        <P>I have also spoken about measures to tackle, reduce and eliminate social welfare fraud.  The majority of people who claim social welfare are honest and claim no more or no less than their entitlements.  Some people are abusing the system, however, and in terms of the social contract and the social support and understanding of social welfare, it is very important that those paying PRSI, PAYE and tax have confidence that the money they contribute to the social insurance system is spent in a way that is directed at and supports the people who need it.</P>
        <P>The fraud initiative I announced in September seeks to target specifically at-risk areas and together with the Garda, Customs and Excise, the Revenue Commissioners and the taxi regulator, we have run joint initiatives called &ldquo;feet on the street&rdquo; to check people in the taxi industry are registered properly for tax and social insurance.  We have also initiated an ambitious programme of visiting employers to see that all the employees are fully registered for tax and PRSI, and this has been welcomed by many legitimate employers who are in competition with people who are partially or wholly in the black economy.  We have received a very positive response from employers throughout the country to this.</P>
        <P>Social welfare inspectors visit people in their own homes to check that people are properly in receipt of the benefits or allowances they receive.  It is a very big reform agenda.  I stress <Col N="540"/>again that the Department is spending more than &euro;20 billion of citizen&rsquo;s contributions in tax and PRSI and it is important we get value for that.  We have an ambitious target of building a welfare state of which we can be proud, that is friendly to business, that is absolutely supportive of both employees and employers, that gives value for money and, in particular, is supportive of older people when they retire.  In regard to people of working age, say, those between the ages of 18 to 20 up to the time they retire, it is important we have a range of measures in place in order that, if they become unemployed or unable to participate, they are encouraged to develop their economic capacity, be economically independent and take up options in education, training and work experience.  This means we will be conscious that social welfare is a hand-up, not just a handout, and that, ultimately, as the economy recovers, and it will recover, they can then get a job and become financially independent for themselves and for their families.</P>
        <P>This is the goal to which most people aspire.  When children are in school, this is what they expect &mdash; that they are going to be somebody, whether working in a shop, as a fireman or a policeman, as a scientist or otherwise.  If primary schoolchildren are asked what they want to be when they grow up, most of all they want to work and be financially independent for themselves and for their families.  That should be the aim of a modern welfare state &mdash; to be supportive, enabling and empowering of people to be full participants in our society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for her comprehensive review of the current state of her Department and of her various initiatives.  I also thank her for the clarity she has brought to a number of initiatives, especially the one that is now proving the most controversial in regard to employers&rsquo; obligations to provide sickness cover.</P>
        <P>To put all of this in context, this side of the House has been regularly accused of all sorts of nefarious activities.  One area where I feel this criticism is somewhat misplaced is that Fianna F&aacute;il tripled expenditure on social welfare from 2000 to 2010, when resources were available.  We continue, as a party, to emphasise the need for a safety net for the most vulnerable in society and those affected by the economic crisis across Europe.</P>
        <P>It is worth making the point that the troika, in the commitments the Government has entered into, has made it clear repeatedly that it is a matter for the Government itself to take individual initiatives so long as they comply with the overall budgetary requirements.  This is why it is important to put on the record that the continuing criticism of Fianna F&aacute;il in this area is becoming a little tired, because it is now becoming apparent that the Government will have to finally take ownership of the budget and the Exchequer, and, as a result, it is now finding the reality of Government is beginning to set in after a very long honeymoon period.</P>
        <P>I take some umbrage at a quote outlined by my colleague, Deputy Barry Cowen, in the other House during a debate on a motion earlier this month, a quote the Minister had made at the MacGill summer school in Donegal that Fianna F&aacute;il was cynical in increasing benefits and rates for electoral gain.  That is quite extraordinary when one considers the joint manifestos of both Fine Gael and Labour, which were not at all shy in putting forward their own proposals to improve social welfare rates.</P>
        <P>Having said that, there are a number of issues I wish to deal with in the time available to me.  In light of the comments that have been made, it is a pity the Minister cut the fuel allowance, the electricity allowance and the gas allowance for the elderly.  One can only imagine the deprivation that will impact on the most vulnerable in society coming into the winter and early spring.</P><Col N="541"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister stated that the replacement rate or the proportion of their former wages that unemployed people receive in benefits has increased in the case of some recipients to levels where it may discourage them from seeking work.  I would be grateful if the Minister could outline what she plans to do in this regard.  The figures pop up every so often in the tabloid press, although I believe most of the press in Ireland is now becoming tabloid.  How can the Minister implement measures that will encourage people to seek work when there are very generous benefits?</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was definitely an environment over that ten-year period in which all political parties, both in government and outside, took the view that while we had the resources, we should look after the vulnerable.  The former Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v conceded much the same and even this Government will agree it, too, has a commitment to ensuring the vulnerable are protected.  As a result and despite or in spite of what I said earlier about Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s record in this regard, I would put my hands up and state in a personal capacity that I consider we spent too much and raised the level of expectation too high.  One statistic relating to this is that from 2003 to 2009, the social welfare increases were of the order of 300% at a time when inflation was only 19%.  If there is any lesson to be learned in the hope that we do get out of this, it is that future Governments will not be tempted, because they may have the resources, of going down the road of perhaps over-egging the pudding in that regard.</P>
        <P>As the Minister knows, there is another school of thought that would argue it was right and proper that the more vulnerable in our society would have been looked after and that when we had the resources, we would have paid it.  In addition, there is no doubt that the level of poverty overall reduced during that period, as even Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy would concede.  I would be anxious that the Minister would elaborate on how she is going to square this circle.  While the Minister might correct me if I am wrong, I understand a married couple with two children, because of the available benefits and depending on their own individual circumstances, would be entitled to something of the order of &euro;38,000 per year in State benefits, which comes very close to the average industrial wage.  If any of us were in that situation and perhaps did not have the inclination to seek work, human nature being what it is, would we bother?</P>
        <P>I am particularly pleased that the F&Aacute;S employment and community services will formally join the Department on 1 January and that detailed preparations are under way to ensure the deadline is met.  This brings me back to a debate we had earlier today with the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, who outlined a number of initiatives in the area of trade.  One of the points that struck me was in terms of the joined-up thinking between Departments in the context of trying to provide more job opportunities.  Will the Minister have a role in the following specific area?  She referred to attending a dinner in the Irish Embassy in London in early October when representatives of 52 Irish construction companies were present.  As she knows, because of the momentum created by the Olympic Games coming to London, a significant number of Irish construction companies are providing a significant amount of employment.  Sadly, in one sense, but perhaps positively in another, an increasing number of those who worked in the construction industry here, now that it has collapsed, have managed to find work in London.</P>
        <P>Before people go down the road of saying I am encouraging emigration, I would subscribe to a view that is becoming increasingly more apparent.  There was a very fine article in <i>The Irish Times</i> about this a couple of months ago where the writer took Mr. Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n to task for making a comment at the global economic forum in Farmleigh that emigration was &ldquo;a tragedy&rdquo;.  Involuntary emigration is a tragedy; there is no question about that.  I was an emigrant; I had to leave.  However, voluntary emigration is different.  My own daughter, who is 23 years of age, left with a masters degree.  She would not have been able to get work here but she and a number of friends said they wanted to travel for at least one to two years to gain <Col N="542"/>experience, and they want to come back.  They are not, in my sense, of the traditional emigrant pattern.</P>
        <P>It is sad I do not have the time to develop other issues but this is one on which I wanted to focus.  I suggest there are young people in this country who perhaps, for whatever reason, do not have the capacity to look for work or who may not know where to go.  Will the Minister consider having a discussion with her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the context of the Minister and the Department of Social Protection taking over F&Aacute;S and the employment and community services, given she has referred to the fact it will be setting up a service for people to establish benefits, look for a job and seek advice on their training options?  Perhaps the Minister might consider integrating with British companies?  One can get to London faster than one can get to Leitrim.  If people on the Minister&rsquo;s radar are looking for job opportunities, perhaps her Department might join with our embassies, since work is available.</P>
        <P>There is also work in Ireland for high-end graduates and those with specific skills.  This is evident from websites such as <i>irishjobs.ie</i> and so on.  We are importing people.  While there was an outflow of 42,000 people last year, 25,000 people came to Ireland.  The Minister will empathise with the points I have raised, as she is focused on trying to get more people into work.</P>
        <P>I regret that I do not have more time and I am grateful to the Leas-Chathaoirleach for indulging me, but I will take just 20 seconds further.  According to Spotlight: Tackling Social Welfare Fraud, research &ldquo;suggests that the benefits system needs to change to accommodate more flexible employment patterns and ease the transition for people in temporary jobs to come on and off benefits&rdquo;.  The Minister seems to have expressed this sentiment.  What are her opinions in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  She raised many important issues, some of which I will address while addressing other more general points.</P>
        <P>The Department has two important roles.  First, poverty is an increasing factor in society and the State must try to ensure every person has adequate income and resources to live with dignity.  Second, the Department must ensure a balance between social protection and the incentive to seek and gain employment.  The Government must rebuild a broken system.  It is a big job.  Ireland is perceived as a welfare state, but the rankings of the EU 27 place us considerably below the EU average.  The figures do not support the perception.</P>
        <P>I wish to address the statutory sick pay proposal the Minister mentioned.  She has opened a good debate, but she is not going about it the right way.  It is valid that she is trying to tackle absenteeism, but forcing the employer to pay for the first four weeks of an employee&rsquo;s sick leave will kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  The employer is the source and creator of jobs.  Employers are the multipliers and should not be crucified.  Throughout the country, small and medium sized businesses are struggling.</P>
        <P>In recent days, an employer of seven employees told me that they gave &euro;7,000 per month to the Exchequer between VAT, PAYE and PRSI.  When the employer called the seven employees in, they were told that they would be let go and that the employer would become a sole trader if the Minister&rsquo;s proposal went ahead.  The Exchequer would lose money.</P>
        <P>Other employers have approached me.  One told me that he would be in a position to create 50 jobs in January, but that he would now add them on a subcontract basis.  The Government will need to pursue these subcontractors for PAYE and PRSI.  It is right to tackle absenteeism, but the Minister is going about it in the wrong way.  I have a number of proposals.  The Minister will drive business underground, which means more people will be pursued for fraud.  The <Col N="543"/>Department is doing wonderful work in that respect already, but let us not bite the hand that feeds us.</P>
        <P>Absenteeism costs business &euro;1.5 billion per year.  This is a significant problem.  Average sick leave in the private sector is six days per year.  Average sick leave in the public sector is 11 days per year.  The Minister outlined how her Department pays for the HSE&rsquo;s sick leave.  This is outrageous.  Who should pay for sick leave?  Let us face up to it.  Surely the employee has a responsibility.  The Minister referred to the Dutch model, but we should consider the Swedish model in which the employee, both public and private, pays for the first day of sick leave.  Could the Minister draft figures on this proposal?  What would it save the State?  What if the employee paid for the first three days, after which sick leave would be certified and the State or employer would have some duty?</P>
        <P>Let us be careful.  Our greatest problem is unemployment.  Let us not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  It is important that the Minister examine the Swedish model.  When employees were made to pay for the first day of sick leave in the public service, Sweden&rsquo;s absenteeism rate reduced by 40% in one year.  In the private sector, absenteeism almost disappeared when an employer gave one week&rsquo;s bonus at Christmas for not being absent.  Many good measures can be found, but the Minister&rsquo;s is not the right one.  I say this respectfully.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some employers go bust, become unemployed and have no social welfare.  What supports can the Department provide for them?  They have paid their employer&rsquo;s PRSI.  I employed six people for several years.  It was unbelievably difficult.  I needed to generate business and go out on the front line to deliver the business, but I was the one doing many books at the end of the week because I could not afford to hire someone to do them for me.  For these reasons, I see no merit in the sick pay proposal.</P>
        <P>An employer who pays S class social insurance might find himself or herself injured or ill through no fault of his or her own, for example, as a result of a car accident.  That person would receive no payment until he or she became eligible for the old age pension.  Will the Minister explore the UK model, a matter to which I referred in an Adjournment debate?  That model allows the self-employed to become employees in certain situations to pay PRSI contributions.  This offers them protection when they are injured or ill.</P>
        <P>I refer to employment traps that may deter an individual from seeking or acquiring employment.  I am pleased that the Minister mentioned one of these, that is, seasonal employment.  When individuals finish their employment, they are sometimes left without social welfare for a number of weeks.  As the Minister is working on this matter, I will say no more.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Rent supplement is a large trap.  A person who receives this benefit has his or her rent paid by the State until such time as he or she gets a job.  The rent is then paid out of his or her income, however small it may be.  This makes no financial sense for many.  However, if the supplement moved to a differential rent system, this situation would be alleviated.  After six months of accepting the benefit, only a proportion of a person&rsquo;s total income would be taken.  This is what local councils do.  It would end the dependency on rent supplement, as the person would only lose in proportion to his or her income.  The Minister might consider this proposal.</P>
        <P>Long-term unemployment is a major issue.  Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy and Social Justice Ireland have developed a worthy proposal.  People want to work.  During the Celtic tiger era, the unemployment rate was 4%, of which 1.3% constituted the long-term unemployed.  Fr. Healy&rsquo;s proposal is with the Minister.  It would create 100,000 jobs at a cost of &euro;150 million to the State.  The Minister should consider his proposal.  Jobs would be created in the public, community and voluntary sectors with no displacement, people would be paid at the going rate and they would work a maximum of 19.5 hours per week and on a voluntary basis only.  There is a great deal <Col N="544"/>of evidence in Galway that people want this.  Solicitors, accountants and other professionals have told me that they will work for their social welfare payments if the State provides appropriate opportunities through JobBridge and so on.  Not everyone on those programmes will cut grass or paint walls.  For example, community welfare officers are burst, so to speak, and need help.</P>

	<P>The programme for Government indicated that &euro;800 million would be made up through pensions.  The pension levy is expected to earn the State &euro;1.8 billion over four years.  If we reduce tax relief on pensions, we will kill off the attractiveness of investing in a pension that is good for the State and individuals.  Life expectancy is now longer and if we decrease the tax relief on pensions from 41% to 20%, we will almost make them disappear.  I have evidence that pension advisers are now finding it difficult to convince people to buy pensions.  We would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House so swiftly to discuss the issue of sick leave.  Senator Quinn is here today and as head of the Superquinn chain he was one of my great mentors as he had one of the great cultures of employment here.  I am one of the few employers in this Chamber.  I am dismayed at this proposal and the haste with which it seems it will be put through.  Will the Minister in her response tell me how many employers were directly consulted by her Department before making this public earlier this week in <i>The Irish Times</i>?  My fear is that civil servants, the vast majority of whom have never employed anyone, have dreamed this up and are treating it like a simple accounting exercise.  At a time when we are meant to protect jobs and try to create employment by attracting companies, we will put another black mark against our attractiveness and the cost of doing business in Ireland.  If the Minister carries through with the proposal as it is, jobs will be shed and businesses will be forced to close in the long term.</P>
        <P>I will provide a quote from an Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association of Ireland press release from earlier today.  It states &ldquo;If the proposals on sick pay and redundancy rebates are introduced, it will cause untold damage to the smaller companies and will result in company closures and significant job losses.&rdquo;  There is an indication that the Minister would be better off giving business owners an opportunity to trade out of the current environment and focusing her attention on the significant level of absenteeism within the public sector and the inefficiencies within her Department.</P>
        <P>Of the 230,000 small businesses employing more than 900,000 individuals, less than 30% could currently afford a sick pay scheme.  Of that 30%, a significant number could only afford to maintain a partial scheme.  It becomes obvious, therefore, that introducing mandatory sick pay on top of other costs being foisted on companies through State-controlled increases in transport, energy and local charges will be the straw that will break the camel&rsquo;s back in many instances, leading to company closures and job losses.</P><Col N="545"/>
        <P Just="Left">My company in Newbridge has employed 100 people for 19 years.  I had to make people redundant in 2008 but I thank God we have survived.  Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Superquinn was my first customer in 1995 and he is a mentor.  I have been very fortunate and I feel I have fostered a really lovely culture.  We are very business-like, fair and friendly, and we look after our employees.  Nevertheless, we are only human beings and I fear that if the Minister&rsquo;s proposal comes through, I would have some dormant couch potatoes among my employees.  I wonder what will happen after a match on a Sunday.  I could be one of those dormant couch potatoes as I am quite lazy and I would love a Monday or Tuesday off and to get paid for it.  Senator Healy Eames mentioned it and the Minister might consider that the employee could pay for one or three days of the sick leave.  That would restrain an employee from taking a Monday off.  I joked that Mondays should not be included.  I referred to some of the rather difficult employment laws and small businesses do not have the CIA, the FBI or Arthur Cox working with them.  If there is a dormant employee who is not terribly ill, it can be very difficult to get such people back to work.  I will not go into such details.</P>
        <P>I will pick up on one point as the Minister stated that we are out of line internationally on sick pay.  I am not great with Europe but I am very up to date with the UK because I have a company there.  The cost base is significantly lower in the UK than here and although the employer does not make the initial sick payment, we are able to offset the cost against the PAYE tax bill later.  This has less of an immediate cash flow implication as the payment would be &pound;81.66 sterling for 28 weeks per week compared to &euro;188 per week for two years here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank her for giving her time in such a busy period leading to the budget.  We know it is a tough and these are unprecedented times given our financial position.  Unpalatable decisions must be made and we may find it hard to stand by such decisions, although we will do it in the interest of the country.  However, there are a few issues I would like to discuss with the Minister to elicit the thoughts and reasoning behind them.  That may help us to understand why the Minister feels such decisions must be made.</P>
        <P>I add my voice to the concerns of people about employers having to pay the first four weeks of illness benefit to employees.  As the Minister will appreciate, it is a very hard time for employers as well as employees, with many only hanging in there by the skin of their teeth.  My fear is that this could cause widespread unemployment, as many employers will not be in a position to carry this extra burden.  I am interested to know how the Minister believes this could be implemented and the logistics?  Have there been negotiations with the social partners and where would an employer stand with employees who did not have the proper contributions to qualify for illness benefit within the Department of Social Protection?Would they still be obliged to pay this category of people and would it be seen as inequality in the workplace if they do not pay them?</P>
        <P>Will there be a clause whereby employers can claim inability to pay?  What happens the employee if the employers simply say he cannot afford to pay the illness benefit?  What happens if an employee takes sick leave on several occasion during the year and will the employer be expected to pay the first four weeks on a number of occasions?  I fail to see how implementation of this proposal could reduce absenteeism.  If employees know that employers must pay for four weeks of sick leave, will they jet off on holidays while sending on sick certs?  Will people go back to their own countries knowing employers must pay for four weeks?  We recently reduced the VAT rate to help tourism and employers but this would have the opposite effect.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts on the matter.</P>
        <P>Currently, most employers are having significant difficulty with their rates and are seeking a reduction so how can we now be justified in putting this extra taxation to them, as that is how <Col N="546"/>it will be seen?  How can it be justified to put this extra burden on employers?  I do not see how this will make a difference in the public system, and the Exchequer will still have to pay illness benefit.  The private sector will be affected.</P>
        <P>Currently, there is such a significant backlog in applications for social welfare that it is causing distress and hardship among the public.  One lady applied for an invalidity pension last March and to date her application has not been dealt with, the Department officials indicating that they want to deal with people whose disability benefit is running out or who have no other income.  She is constantly put to the back of the pile.  This has a knock-on effect as she cannot apply for the household benefit package because she is waiting for a decision on the invalidity pension.  Speaking of backlogs, there is a huge backlog in the appeals office as well.  It is taking almost ten months for an appeal to be heard and this is causing a great deal of hardship.  People are hurting.  Perhaps the Minister will outline what proposals the Department has to deal with the backlogs.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment not to cut the basic rates of social welfare in the forthcoming budget.  People living on social welfare are among the poorest in society.  It is a fact that the cost of maintaining a standard of living is higher in rural areas than in urban areas.  If one has a child in third level education, for example, the cost to a person living in Kerry as opposed to a person living in Cork or Dublin is not comparable.  A student from Kerry attending UCC or UCD will have to pay the cost of accommodation in addition to travel, which is crippling for parents and students alike.  These costs are generally not applicable to students living in urban areas if they avail of the benefit of living at home.</P>
        <P>Even the cost of the weekly shopping is higher in rural areas, as people do not have access to the larger shops or superstores.  The small shops cannot compete with them so their prices are high.  Many families have hidden costs, such as travel, which are higher in rural areas.  For most people living in the country it necessitates the purchase of a car, which brings tax and insurance costs.  People living on social welfare in rural areas have far more expenses than people living in urban areas.  Most of them are barely making ends meet and it is imperative that they are left with as much disposable income as possible.  It is important that those who can pay are made to pay, although I am aware that everybody must pay something.  However, I trust that in the area of social welfare this can be done through reform and not through cutting the basic rates.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the steps the Minister has taken to tackle social welfare fraud.  Programmes such as &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; show the extent of the fraud.  I have a small suggestion that the Minister might consider.  When somebody dies, their personal public service, PPS, number should appear on their death certificate.  This would ensure there was no opportunity for others to use that PPS number for any other reasons.</P>
        <P>Another issue that must be addressed is the domiciliary care allowance.  This allowance should be extended to children up to the age of 18 years, as it causes untold hardship for both the parents and the child when they must apply for disability allowance at the age of 16 years.  In most cases applicants are being refused disability allowance and inevitably their applications end up in the appeals office.  If the domiciliary care allowance was paid up to the age of 18 years, the child would then be an adult and would probably have finished their schooling.  Perhaps the Minister will consider that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I was delighted to hear the Minister say she is examining how to help the self-employed.  Self-employed people are hard workers who provide an income for themselves, their families and their employees.  They are staying off the live register.  However, they pay a reduced amount of PRSI which means they are not entitled to illness benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit if they get sick or have no work.  I suggest that they be given the option of paying the full amount of PRSI and if they decide to pay the reduced amount they must accept that they will not have entitlement to benefit when they get sick.  However, if they choose to pay the full amount, they will have that entitlement.  Why not give them that option?  There are approximately 270,000 self-employed people in Ireland at present.  The increased amount of PRSI could generate a large amount of income for the Exchequer as well.  If self-employed people were given that choice, I am sure most of them would take it up.  It is like an insurance policy.</P>
        <P>Rent supplement is now under the auspices of the Department of Social Protection.  My colleague will speak in more detail on that shortly, but I wish to make a brief point.  It has come to my attention that the rent allowance is being paid directly to the tenant and in some cases it is not making its way to the landlord.  The tenants then find themselves in arrears and facing eviction.  It would make more sense if the rent allowance was paid directly to the landlord, with the tenant making up the balance of what they owe.  Perhaps the Minister will think about this and consider changing it.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister give us an update on the progress being made with the social services card?  When is it likely to be in use?  Will it contain a photograph or, as was suggested by a Senator on one occasion, a fingerprint?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I am full of admiration for her grasp of her brief.  Much of what she said was spoken off the cuff, rather than read from a script.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I now better understand her proposal about sick pay.  That does not mean I support it because I was even more impressed by Senator Healy Eames&rsquo;s contribution.  I understand that the Minister&rsquo;s objective is to reduce absenteeism.  However, her figures will not be correct from the State&rsquo;s point of view if the payment is transferred to the employer.  Where the employer is the State, there is a far higher number of sick leave days.  That includes the Departments of Health, Justice and Equality and Education and Skills.  The State pays for it.  In those Departments there is an average of 11 days sick leave per year compared to less than half that amount in the private sector.  That will not change under what the Minister proposes; it will remain the same.</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister&rsquo;s objective is to deal with absenteeism, but we need a more imaginative solution.  I was impressed by the suggestion made by Senator Healy Eames.  It would be quite dramatic but if we told every employee that the first three days of sick leave must be paid for by themselves, there would be a huge drop, particularly in the number of Monday absences where people decide not to bother going to work after a hard night or weekend.  That affects large and small employers.</P>
        <P>I am really concerned about the use of such a blunt instrument, as described by the Minister, particularly for a smaller business.  Take the example of somebody employing five or six people in a restaurant.  There is one chef and if he or she is out sick, there is nobody to replace them.  The business probably closes until he or she returns.  There is also the example of somebody who has five or six employees, one of whom is a lorry driver.  There is no way they can transfer one of the others to drive that lorry.  The proposal, while I understand its objective, must be more imaginative if it is going to succeed.</P><Col N="548"/>
        <P>I prefer the question of how we can help people to come off benefits.  I have looked at other countries and in Britain, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition Government introduced a work programme based on welfare reform similar to that introduced by President Clinton in the USA which is a payment for results contract with the private sector.  More than 500 businesses and voluntary organisations in Britain have signed up to get people who have claimed unemployment benefit for up to a year back to work.  The Government pays those contractors only when the worker has held down the job for a certain period.  Chris Grayling is the Minister of State in the Department for Work and Pensions and he says it will transform the lives of millions of people and that it represents good value for the taxpayer as it bases payments to contractors on results, awarding much of the money to providers only when they find the jobseeker sustainable employment.  Is the Government considering such a programme?  It would be worthwhile considering it.</P>
        <P>Businesses also complain that they do not have the right sort of people and that education provided by the State does not match business needs.  In India, many leading firms have established in-house universities to teach the rudiments of their business and the Government there has asked industry to design one of the world&rsquo;s most ambitious attempts to close the skills gap.  It has provided seed capital for an industry-led programme to train an incredible 150 million workers by 2022.  We could do that here by attaching such a programme to the national skills development programme.  We are a much smaller country but we should look at such models where the Government listens to the job creators.  Jobs will be created by individual entrepreneurial businesses.  They will not be created by the State.  Jobs created by the State do not last in the long term and increase costs for those for those who could create jobs elsewhere.  Start Up Britain, launched earlier this year, is trying to do the same as Start Up America.  Edward Davey, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in the British Government, is preparing a comprehensive package of help for entrepreneurs that he calls &ldquo;employment in a box&rdquo; which he says will make it easy to take on the first employee in a new company.  If we are not careful, we will not be able to encourage people to take on their first employee.  Taking that first person is vital.  If that works, the company can progress from there.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note the situation in other countries.  Switzerland offers a good example for the child benefit system.  Child benefit depends on the region where a person lives but it is usually around &euro;150 per child per month, roughly the same as in Ireland.  In Switzerland, however, in most regions child benefit is stopped for the third child and subsequent children.  The United States has a similar system.  In Ireland a parent with eight children will take home &euro;1,322 per month, while in Switzerland a parent with eight children only gets &euro;300 per month.  It is not as if Switzerland cannot afford to pay similar child benefit to Ireland but the country has made the decision not to incentivise large families.  I have five children so I am speaking against myself but given our financial situation, we must look at these areas.</P>
        <P>I had a discussion with a secondary school teacher in a deprived area of Dublin who said many of his students are planning to have babies because of the benefits, housing and improved social status.  It is easy to be facetious about this but these teenage girls are making a rational and economically sound decision and cannot be blamed for doing that.  I am asking if benefits match.</P>
        <P>Vouchers for food have negative connotations but we should consider every way to get the economy back on track.  IBEC has proposed children&rsquo;s allowance be paid with an electronic card that can only be spent on goods here.  It has been suggested that much of the money paid is not even spent in Ireland.  I could be accused of coming from a tradition of encouraging people to spend their money in supermarkets but that is exactly where these cards should be <Col N="549"/>used.  Some of the money received in children&rsquo;s allowance payments is not necessarily being spent on children, the original idea for the payment.  A certain number of well-off families use the money for holidays when at the very least the money should be spent in this country.  IBEC&rsquo;s proposal has the dual benefit of solving what we want to do with children&rsquo;s allowance while giving a boost to the retail trade in Ireland.  Perhaps vouchers could be linked to social welfare payments in the context of the reports that the Government is going to cut social welfare again at some point.  Could food vouchers have a role in encouraging people to eat healthy food?  Moody&rsquo;s Analytics in America has assessed different forms of stimulus and found that food stamps were the most effective, increasing economic activity by $1.73 for every $1 spent, with unemployment insurance coming in second at $1.62, whereas most tax cuts yielded far less than $1.</P>
        <P>Those are just some suggestions.  I am impressed by the Minister&rsquo;s grasp of her portfolio and the way in which she put across her ideas, but we must think seriously about some of these areas, particularly sick pay.  We need something that is not such a blunt instrument.</P>

        <P>Ba mhaith liom ceisteanna a chur ar an Aire i gcomhth&eacute;acs JobBridge.  The Minister discussed the JobBridge scheme but there is a glaring anomaly in that scheme in that it is only applicable to those on jobseeker&rsquo;s payments and not to those on other social welfare payments such as single parent&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance.  It is grossly unfair that the attitude seems to be those people are not interested in getting back to work and are not being given a fair crack of the whip to be able to take part in the scheme.  I have had cases like that in Galway where people have come to me and I have brought those cases to the attention of the Minister.  This anomaly should be examined.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that rent allowance should not be cut given the over-supply of housing at the State&rsquo;s disposal through NAMA?  Does the Minister believe social welfare cuts are counter-productive and that instead of cutting social welfare rates, investment in jobs is necessary?  The Minister is aware that Sinn F&eacute;in has launched its pre-budget submission.  It is a constructive document that has engendered a lot of debate and there are other areas in the social protection and general budget headings that we ask the Minister to take on board.  If we had more speaking time we could go into detail on those.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand where the Minister is coming from because &euro;775 million is the cost to small businesses for absenteeism.  The small firms average is seven days, with a national average of nine days.  As Senator Quinn pointed out, however, in the public service it is 11 days.  If a person who is earning &euro;30,000 takes eleven days off because he is ill, it costs &euro;442 million, a huge cost to the State.</P>
        <P>It has been found that stress is the greatest contributor to absenteeism, replacing back pain as the top cause.  A survey carried out by the International Labour Organisation in 2002 showed 80 million lost working days in a year, with 14% of NHS inpatient costs and 25% of the cost of medication resulting from stress related illnesses in workers.  If a survey was done in this country on illness caused by stress and what businesses do to provide stress alleviation and education, plus family responsibilities such as home care and child care, what would the results be?  What would we save by looking at such areas?</P>

     <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  My questions are in respect of the rent supplement budget.  I welcome the transfer of the rent supplement budget, announced by the former Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Willie Penrose, and ask the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to expedite that as quickly as possible.  There is no doubt in his evidence from the rental accommodation scheme that when people have the opportunity to work and pay differential rents they go back to work.  My information is that will not happen until 2013. In light of that, I put the following to the Minister.  I ask her not to interfere with the rent supplement limits paid to single people.  The evidence of Threshold is that there is no property available at that cap and if a straightforward cut is given at that level there will be displacement, homelessness and people topping up rents out of scarce resources.  I want the Minister to ensure that rent is paid directly to landlords, although I know that is not popular with her Department officials.  However, our information is that 34% of landlords receiving rent supplement are not registered with the PRTB, therefore there is evidence of non-compliance with tax payments.  I ask the Minister not to increase the personal contribution.  Front line organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Threshold say that will result in poverty.  Will the Minister please put some money in the budget for a new computer system for the Department of Social Protection?  It is a well-known fact that their hopelessly out-dated computer system is the principal thing standing between the Department and some meaningful performance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  We are all aware that significant benefits are going into many houses, particularly houses with large families, yet children in many of those homes are among the most deprived.  Will the Department consider targeting some resources to help those families?  Perhaps some of the suggestions made by Senator Feargal Quinn are worthy of consideration.  It is appalling to realise that &euro;700 or &euro;800 per week goes into some houses yet the children are not cared for properly.  In regard to the sick pay scheme I appeal to the Minister not to proceed along the lines she has suggested as it would be the death knell for small businesses in particular.  While there is a major problem with absenteeism I suggest that a person on illness benefit does not receive any payment for the first three days from the Department of Social Protection.  If the Minister were to consider three waiting days across the entire public and Civil Service, without any payment from the Department of Social Protection, what would be the saving to the State?  A significant amount of money is involved.  Some of the people in those positions are in secure employment and have been assured under the Croke Park agreement that they will not suffer any reduction in salaries.  There is an opportunity to tweak the sick pay issue that might give the desired result.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am interested in everything the Minister has to say.  As I am not as well briefed as other speakers, I do not propose to repeat anything.  I am involved in the legal industry and have been involved in the fashion industry and in two family businesses and I see the issue from all angles.</P>
        <P>The legal industry, in particular, is struggling. It is hard to have any pity for the legal industry but as Senator Fidelma Healy Eames said, what applies in general should apply to the legal industry too.  There is plenty of scope for employing solicitors on social welfare.  I merely make the point.  I strongly support what other speakers have said with a view to making life easier.  Without employers, there are no employees to worry about being on sick pay or any other problems.  First and foremost, we need to protect the employers so that we have employees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and agree with most of what she had to say.  However, given the number of calls I have received in recent days from people with small businesses there is major concern about the sick pay issue.  I suggest that the Minister look at <Col N="551"/>the issue again.  It will be a case of sick pay or jobs.  According to the people who run small businesses employing from five to 15 or 20 people they are very worried and experience a major problem with PAYE, VAT and pay for their employees.  It is important not to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  I recognise that the Minister has a difficult role and that she has to achieve certain savings within her Department but perhaps she would go down the road of the first three days of illness, without payment from the Department of Social Protection, whereby employees would be responsible for themselves. I ask her not to go down the road of the sick pay scheme.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise two issues in the context of the Government&rsquo;s commitments, one of which relates to the sovereign bonds.  There was a suggestion earlier in the year that pension funds would be actively discouraged from investing in Germany and France and that they should be repatriated to Ireland to help the Irish economy.  Are there any developments on what is referred to as partial capacity?  The Minister referred to it here in the context of creating an integrated service providing a one-stop shop for people.  This would mean that instead of having a whole plethora of benefits going to an individual there would be a one-size fits all benefit.  Perhaps the Minister could bring some clarity that issue.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators who made such thoughtful contributions on social protection.  In his initial contribution Senator Mooney asked how to make work worthwhile and several other Senators referred to that also.  He referred to a statistic of &euro;38,000 per year of State benefits for a married couple with two children.  The first thing to bear in mind is that these examples which crop up from time to time in the media are generally correct but they reflect a very small proportion of the people who are on job seekers&rsquo; allowance.  Normally what we are talking about is a couple with three or more children on rent supplement.  Such a family could be in receipt of &euro;38,000 or, perhaps, a little more if they lived in a more expensive area of Dublin where the rent supplement was higher.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators raised the issue of rent supplement.  Rent supplement is one of the key barriers against people taking up employment.  I have spoken in the House previously of my preference for the local authorities &mdash; a matter to which Senator Aideen Hayden referred &mdash; to take over rent supplement as quickly as possible.</P><P Just="Left">I stress that the Department of Social Protection has no expertise in housing.  Housing is the function of local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  There is fairly widespread agreement among all the political parties and Independents that we would have a better system if it was dealt with by the local authorities.  That is the objective.</P>
     
	<Col N="552"/><P>One issue was raised by Senator Fidelma Healy Eames and Senator Marie Moloney.  There are a couple of different issues.  One issue is that the rent should be paid to the landlord directly.  From a social welfare point of view that is difficult to do because the relationship of social welfare is to the individual who has a social welfare entitlement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The suggestion of a new computer system is very welcome given that we are dealing with around 50 to 60 systems with different levels of entitlements and one cannot look through them.    We cannot make exact comparisons between people.  In some situations some people have a greater advantage from the system than others.  All I can say is that if someone is living on a sole income of &euro;188 a week as a single person, that is not a huge allowance in terms of the cost of living here.  However, we also have examples of families who can accumulate multiple payments and as Senator Quinn pointed out, these families may also be in receipt of substantial child benefit payments.</P>
        <P>It is critical that we address the issue of rent supplement.  We also need to know whether other Departments or agencies pay income supports to families.  We do not necessarily get information from the HSE as to whether it makes payments to families.  I suspect that some of the large amounts one sees reported in the newspapers from time to time are based on cases where, for instance, people within one family may be both claimants and carers.  There might also be some children being fostered in the family and payments being made by the HSE.  We do not always get that information.  We do not have a system like the Austrian one, which is a single account, which can keep us informed of all the different payments payable by different elements of the state.  In Ireland, payments would most likely come from the Department of Social Protection and some arm of the HSE.  We do not have a system that can keep us informed of payments from different Departments currently and would only be able to get that information by carrying out an investigation.  While our data protection laws do not necessarily allow Departments to share that information, it might be appropriate to provide for making it possible to share the information.</P>
        <P>The transfer of responsibility for rent allowance payments to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is very important.  The big problem county managers have experienced is that when social welfare recipients go on the rental allowance scheme, the rate of default is quite high.  Where people move from rent supplement to the local authority rental accommodation scheme, RAS, there is no problem if they get a traditional local authority house because they are on a direct differential rent.  However, the difficulty for the local authorities is that in some cases people on a social welfare income do not get a traditional local authority house and they are falling behind in their rent payments.  In some cases, people enter the household budgeting system operated by An Post and then back out of it.  They commit to it when they get their tenancy, but back out of it.</P>
        <P>We may need to look at legislation which will make a legally enforceable commitment to the household budgeting scheme when somebody takes up accommodation.  The local authorities want the Department to deduct rent directly, but our famous computer system would not be able to do that because there are 88 different local authority differential rent schemes.  There are also at least 88 different computer systems.  It is not feasible to try to get the Department of Social Protection to undertake pretty much all of the public administration in this regard.  The Department already handles a vast number of schemes which is part of the difficulty because the pressure on all the schemes is extensive.  For that reason, the transfer of responsibility for rent allowance payment to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the right move, but we should provide greater legal status and <Col N="553"/>enforceability to An Post&rsquo;s household budgeting system.  This would be very helpful.  Members are aware of how appalling it is for families who get into and build up thousands in arrears and that this brings an enormous complications to families and they become even poorer.  It is also a big problem for local authorities.</P>
        <P>Senators referred to large families on social welfare.  During the Celtic tiger era here payments rose rapidly, but one difference between Ireland and other countries is that most countries with good systems have a mix of income supports and cash payments and services.  For instance, I am looking into the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and considering whether some of it could be paid directly to the schools for a national schoolbook lending system.</P><P Just="Left">This would, perhaps, be some version of the suggestion made by Senator Quinn to allocate the money to schools.  This would then be spent locally and would give local businesses the opportunity to bid for schemes like the book rental scheme or the provision of school uniforms.  There is merit in looking at the proposals that have come forward to ensure the money is spent on the children and in Ireland.  That is a reasonable objective.  Social welfare moneys amount to approximately 16% of the economic spend in the country.  This is significant and important.  In the west of Ireland in particular, the social welfare spend is probably an even higher proportion of the local economy.  Therefore, it is important that we ensure that as much as possible of the social welfare spend is spent on the people who need the money, spent on children and spent within the economy.</P>
      
	<P>On the issue of people in the United Kingdom keeping close to information on jobs in Ireland, as people who have used JobBridge know, it operates via a website.  It has taken some time to get JobBridge up and going and for employers to appreciate that it works through a website and for people looking for internships to appreciate that.  However, JobBridge is now working reasonably well.  With regard to Irish people in London, it should be possible to develop something similar that will allow them to tap in to information about jobs at home.  We need employers to put up information on vacancies and to be able to identify people who are not working who would be interested in and suitable for those vacancies.  There are great possibilities in terms of using modern technology.  I have met some of the people involved in some schemes in England and attended events around St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and met a number of people offering this kind of scheme there.  I also met the UK Ministers involved in these schemes.  There is much food for thought in this, but we will not be able to do this until we get our national employment services unit up and going and until the Department integrates our traditional social welfare department, community welfare officers and the F&Aacute;S labour services people.  If we achieve that integration &mdash; we have an ambitious programme for next year and people in the Department are working flat out &mdash;  there will be many possibilities.</P>
        <P>Many people referred to illness benefit.  I stress again that some 20 million days are lost to illness each year.  This involves handling 300,000 claims a year and takes up the time of approximately 300 civil servants, some of whom might be better employed working on how to prevent fraud, abuse and error in the system.  We need to discuss the resource issue.  People were concerned about small employers, but I did not hear concerns expressed about large employers who traditionally manage sick pay schemes and sick leave arrangements, whether in the public or private sector.  If we are to introduce this, it will require legislation.  There will be a detailed discussion.  I will be anxious to ensure that the views of small employers in particular are taken into account.  Small employers tend to manage illness and issues around it very well.  As Senator Quinn indicated, issues arise in regard to illness management in parts of the public sector.  What is the point of the Department of Social Protection being responsible for sick pay in the <Col N="554"/>HSE or in other public institutions?  We have no control over it.  We just pay it.  If we can get the management of an enterprise to be responsible for engaging with employees to ensure that illness and absenteeism is kept to a minimum there will be a tremendous gain in terms of productivity for the country in the public and private sectors.  We need to have a conversation on the matter.</P>
       <P>People, understandably, would like to see improvements, for instance, in how appeals are dealt with.  Senator Moloney made an excellent proposal on the domiciliary care allowance; that it should move from 16 years to 18 years of age.  Some years ago the then Minister, Ms Mary Hanafin, attempted to do that.  At the time I was the Labour Party spokesperson on finance and I strongly supported the move because I know there are many people, in the organisations supporting parents with these issues and among parents, who want change.  It would also assist people in being supported and staying on in school and maximising their education.  There is a great deal of merit in the proposal.  It is certainly something I will examine in the context of the budget and the changes.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames referred to Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy and his proposals on generating additional employment places.  There is also merit in that proposal.  I strongly suggest to her that she might also speak to her colleague, the Minister for Finance.  I am anxious to see those opportunities but they have a cost.  All politicians, regardless of party, recognise the value to a local community of community employment schemes and other ways of activating people to contribute at local level.  Years ago when there was much unemployment here we had social employment schemes.  There is a great deal of merit in such an approach particularly in terms of local authorities and local work.  In conjunction with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the former Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, I have had many conversations about that, but we need the go-ahead from the Minister for Finance to enable those kind of schemes to restart.</P>
        <P>We are working to achieve a structure whereby we simplify social welfare and end up with much fewer schemes, disregards, allowances and so on.  People of working age who are being supported by the Department broadly fall into three categories of people &mdash; jobseekers, people on lone parent&rsquo;s allowances and those who may be ill or have a disability.  In the current jobs market they have very little opportunity to get any kind of work even though very often that is what they would like.  We must create opportunities in terms of the changes in the system.  In an environment where the jobs market is extraordinarily tight we must create other opportunities for people.  The jobs initiative that was launched in May has been very successful.  To date, the outcomes from the internship scheme are extremely positive.  I accept what Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said about perhaps opening the scheme to others.  The reason it is being confined to jobseekers is that it was the conditionality in regard to the initial IMF programme where extra schemes were created that would help to take people off the live register, namely, people on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>One of the things we should consider for people who are parenting on their own is the approach taken in Scandinavia where the status of someone as a lone parent applies until his or her child has settled in school.  After that one is considered a parent.  The state does not differentiate between parents who are married or single.  Parents and children are taken into account.  If a parent is of working age and wants to get a job then all the opportunities are available whereas we tend to put people in a category of &ldquo;lone parent&rdquo; which lasts for a long period.  We need to have a conversation on the issue.</P>
        <P>The development of a lone parent support was in the context of this country 50 years ago.  There was a stigma attached and the support for parents, especially women bringing up children on their own, practically closed down the institutions overnight.  Now we have moved on.  Irish <Col N="555"/>society is different now to how it was in the 1950s and 1960s.  Being a lone parent is often an individual&rsquo;s decision.  Also, marriages break up and relationships form and re-form.  We should consider developing our system in the context of how society has evolved.  One of the things we need to do in that context is to look at Scandinavia where there is more child care and more after-schools services.  I am concerned that the children of people who are parenting on their own would be seen in schools as being exactly the same as the children of parents who parent together, whether they are married or cohabiting.  The focus should be on the parent and the child.  To some extent the way the system has developed does not reflect the way society has evolved in recent decades.  There is a great deal of opportunity.</P>

	<P>That is what the IMF and the OECD are saying to us; that people from the age of 20 to whenever they retire at the age of 65 or 66 are of working age and they may have particular needs because they are parents or young adults but that, essentially, we should provide a full range of opportunities to them in terms of work, training and employment opportunities but, equally, if they have needs because they are parenting that child care and after-school care is available.  In Scandinavia, that is often where they put the money rather than to have large direct payments for families.  It is a shift in the balance of how we provide support from the way it has evolved to date.  That is something we need to consider.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien mentioned redundancy rebates.  I was very struck recently, as I am sure were most people, when TalkTalk closed down over a short period, with great personal distress to the workers involved in Waterford and the south east, and people were offered redundancy.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The officials from the Department went into TalkTalk and set up information sessions to ensure the poor unfortunate workers who were being made redundant at the click of a finger would get social welfare income support.  This resulted in the social insurance system paying 60% of the redundancy cost.  In other words, our system carried the bulk of the cost of transferring jobs in Ireland abroad.  The figure pertaining to Dell was approximately &euro;11 million.  Senators should think about this.  With regard to the 1,000 highly trained aircraft technicians in SR Technics in my constituency, the State picked up a large part of the tab &mdash; 60% &mdash; for their redundancy payments.  This is the first year in which redundancy payments were dealt with in the Department of Social Protection.  Previously, they fell under the employment remit.  Some thinking must be done in this regard.  Are we ultimately to pay a large subsidy for jobs to be transferred out of Ireland?</P>
        <P>If a company has become insolvent or an employer has no funds, of course redundancy support is required through the Department, but we must consider whether the system is being used to make redundancy more attractive than it ought to be.  I refer in particular to the wholesale transfer of jobs out of Ireland in the case of TalkTalk and SR Technics.</P>

	<P>I am giving the Senators the opportunity to think about the circumstances to which I refer, particularly in the case of TalkTalk.  This would have been the first time the matter was dealt with in my Department.  Despite our trying to set up a task force to <Col N="556"/>help the workers to have their entitlements as soon as possible, we were ultimately paying 60% of the redundancy cost.  We need to think about that.</P>
        <P>I have touched on many of the general themes.  Senators Noone and others referred to the legal industry and the professional organisations that would appreciate taking on people.</P>

	<P>We need to have a series of pathways.  While people want to do something useful and gain work experience, there ought to be the balance we talked about during the JobBridge debate.  We must ensure employers do not exploit the system and that people get an opportunity.  Under JobBridge there is, in almost all cases, a good balance.  I have arranged for the evaluation of JobBridge.</P>
        <P>The cost of pensions was raised.  I raised it as soon as I became Minister.  I have asked for a very detailed study to be undertaken in regard to pension costs.  There are grave difficulties, particularly with regard to defined benefit pension schemes.  Senator Mooney asked about annuities.  There are proposals being worked upon actively in relation to a kind of blended annuity with the support of the NTMA.  The current turmoil on the markets is such that every time it seems some stability is established, problems become worse.  That has been extraordinarily difficult for defined benefit schemes.</P>

	<P>At the same time, there is approximately &euro;74 billion in Irish pension funds.  Irish pension funds, by and large, can put a small percentage into hedge funds.

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a profound argument that one should ensure we develop a system in which it is possible to invest in Ireland when certainty and calm have returned.  All other European countries are considering this approach.  In Holland, the amount in pension funds is approximately &euro;800 billion.  Therefore, there must be a way of offering investment opportunities.  It may be partly through simple savings-type products with a low, but guaranteed, rate of interest.  Pension funds are required to carry some such investments.  We could try to design, perhaps with the support of the NTMA, investment capacity for infrastructure which carries a rate of return or rent that gives the investing pension fund the kind of return and security it requires.  The &euro;74 billion is, by and large, invested around the world.  Relatively little is invested in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We are going to set up a commission on the future of pensions because, after the crash, we will have to reconsider how best to protect people investing in pensions.</P>
        <P>The issue of tax relief on pensions is not under my remit but under that of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  He is looking very closely at this.  The IMF documents indicate that savings of up to &euro;940 million could be made.  The pension levy has raised &euro;450 million.  One of the proposals in the programme for Government is to provide tax relief on pension savings on investments which would yield an annual pension of approximately &euro;60,000.  This is a capping proposal rather than one that relates to rates.  The Minister for Finance is examining such issues in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>This motion proposes to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry into allegations of collusion by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other employees of the State in the murder by the Provisional IRA of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Bob Buchanan in March 1989.  The tribunal was established in 2005 and is chaired by Judge Peter Smithwick, former president of the District Court.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann considered and approved a similar motion yesterday and I appreciate the support given to that motion by both Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas established the Smithwick tribunal in light of Judge Peter Cory&rsquo;s report in a genuine desire to get at the truth both in the interest of the families who were bereaved by this atrocity and in the public interest.  Senators will recall that on 1 June this year, I proposed an amendment to the Smithwick tribunal&rsquo;s terms of reference to afford the Seanad the opportunity to consider the state of play with the tribunal&rsquo;s work and to establish a timeframe for its <Col N="558"/>completion.  That proposal was consistent with the chairman&rsquo;s previous indication to me of a timeframe for his work.  I do not believe it would be helpful to the work of the tribunal to rehearse again some of the arguments which arose in this House at that time.  Suffice it to say it is clear the tribunal has been making substantial progress in its public hearings, which commenced after the motions were dealt with in both Houses, and there now is an appropriate mechanism in place for this House to be informed of the tribunal&rsquo;s progress.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I state clearly that if, for any reason, it did not prove possible for the tribunal to meet the timeframe set out then, the chairman could report to the Oireachtas that circumstances had arisen which required the timeframe to be extended in order that the House could consider the matter.  I also gave the Seanad a solemn assurance that the Government&rsquo;s response to such an approach from the chairman would be fully cognisant of and consistent with the need for the tribunal to fulfil its obligations fully and as expeditiously as possible.  I am happy to be able to tell Senators that today&rsquo;s motion follows through on that assurance.</P>
        <P>The chairman, in accordance with the resolutions of the Oireachtas in June, presented his interim report on 29 June 2011, in which he reported that good progress had been made in the tribunal&rsquo;s work.  The tribunal&rsquo;s opening statement, which the chairman submitted with that interim report, sets out fully the background to the tribunal.  Senators will be aware that the tribunal chairman wrote to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il on 5 October 2011 setting out the circumstances which have arisen since June and which lead him to seek a six-month further extension for the tribunal&rsquo;s work.  The chairman states in his letter that the tribunal had heard 105 witnesses to that date and has continued with other aspects of its inquiries.  I welcome the progress which the tribunal is making and I am pleased that this House is being kept informed of it.</P>
        <P>The Government has considered the extension sought by Judge Smithwick and proposes that the Oireachtas should resolve to extend the timeframe for the tribunal to conclude its work and to present its final report to 31 May 2012.  This is fully in line with the tribunal chairman&rsquo;s request.  The motion also requires the chairman to prepare and submit a further interim report by 9 March 2012 on the state of play of its inquiry at that date.  It is my view that it is appropriate that this House should be kept informed of the tribunal&rsquo;s progress and the interim report fulfils that.  Furthermore, I believe it is in the public interest and in the interests of those most directly concerned by the tribunal&rsquo;s work that it should get to the truth and report as soon as possible.  That is the objective of the motion before the House.</P>
        <P>The Government hopes the tribunal can fulfil its mandate within the timeframe set out in the motion.  However, if an unanticipated difficulty emerges subsequently with the target date for conclusion, I have no doubt that the chairman will report this and the Oireachtas will have an opportunity to consider the matter further.  The Government respects and fully defends the independence of the chairman to carry out his inquiries without fear or favour.  I am confident that the tribunal will fully discharge its responsibilities and the motion will assist in that endeavour.  I commend it to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for attending the House to debate this motion which deals with an important issue.  Unfortunately, we are in the realm of &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;  The Minister came into the D&aacute;il and the Seanad last June with all guns blazing and it subsequently emerged that the judge felt those blazing guns posed a threat to his independence.  The Minister referred to the families involved, but he failed to mention the criticism of him from that quarter.  Neither has he discussed how that criticism was dealt with.  For our part, we compliment Judge Smithwick who has been doing a good job.  His private hearings have been shown to be absolutely necessary.  He is hearing from a lot of witnesses and much information is coming to light.  We wish him well and look forward to hearing further from him.  In the <Col N="559"/>meantime, we know that we will hear plenty in the media on the public hearings.  It is up to the judge himself to come to his own conclusions.</P>
        <P>We will support the motion, but we have laid down a significant marker in that the motion, as important as it is, needs to be debated and the reasons for it need to be put before Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I am grateful to my colleagues on the Government side who agree with me.  I will not assign blame to anyone, but this is such an important issue that it cannot be rubber-stamped by the House.  Let us wish the judge well and assure him of our belief in his independence and the quality of the report that will emanate from the tribunal.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for being here.  His presence indicates his respect for the House, for which I am grateful.  </P>
        <P>The motion before us is simple, yet it is important because it concerns part of the work of the Smithwick tribunal.  It is part of a number of measures which I hope when they are all completed, will help to bring about a final resolution of the complex difficulties in Northern Ireland for so long.  We do not have to go into the history of the reasons for establishing the tribunal, but we should record our appreciation of Judge Smithwick and his staff for having made such progress to date.  We have had many debates in this House and elsewhere about the cost and duration of tribunals but progress is being made by this one and in the not too distant future we will have its interim report.</P>
        <P>I have no difficulty with the Minister&rsquo;s request to provide additional time for the tribunal to complete its work.  It is important that we are debating the matter publicly with him present.  Having a transparent process is vital, not just to the tribunal but also to any work we undertake concerning Northern Ireland in trying to bring the conflict to a conclusion.  On other occasions, we have spoken and will do so again about the need for a truth and reconciliation commission.  We can reflect on this issue when we have more time to do so.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Minister for being here and I am happy to support the motion.  I look forward to receiving the interim and final reports of the Smithwick tribunal which I hope will help in the healing process on the island.</P>

        <P>I support what other speakers have said.  As we know, some of the exchanges on this issue in recent months were somewhat fraught.  Today, however, we are noting that a request has been made for an extension of the tribunal&rsquo;s timeframe.  As the Minister said, this is consistent with the assurances given at the time, that such a request would be considered.  It is entirely appropriate and in keeping with our ongoing role in scrutinising issues that the Minister is present for a debate, however short, on the matter.  I thank him and the Government generally for facilitating this.</P>
        <P>Clearly, nobody would oppose the motion, as good work is being done by the tribunal.  It is important that it be completed within a reasonable timeframe.  To this end, the tribunal should be facilitated in every necessary way to do its work properly and well.  We are here to facilitate the request for an extension and look forward to receiving the final report in May 2012.Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as ucht a bheith linn agus leis an Rialtas as ucht an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo a chead&uacute;.</P>

        <P>I am delighted that there is cross-party support for the motion.  We have all noted that the tribunal&rsquo;s work is progressing well and are all glad to note that the Oireachtas will be kept informed by way of the presentation of an interim report in March 2012.

        <P>This is an important question that arose during the election recently.  It was brought to my attention that there were a number of persons with a disability who were being cared for, either in a HSE home or a group home in a residential setting, and I wanted to find out what was the facility put in place for them to cast their vote in the presidential election and the referenda.  Some of these people encountered a difficulty in that there were no staff available to bring them to vote and they had to contact relatives to try to facilitate them.</P>
        <P>It is a serious issue, first, that we recognise the rights of such persons to go out and vote in any election of whatever kind.  It calls into question how these group homes and residential homes are being run.  If, for example, the home has been contracted out to a third party organisation under the auspices of the HSE, how can the Minister, and then the HSE, safeguard the right of those persons to be able to cast their vote and have their democratic say in whatever election is taking place?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I am pleased to take this opportunity to outline the current position on the procedures in place to enable residents in group and residential homes to vote in the recent presidential election and referenda.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that vulnerable persons with disabilities in residential services are safeguarded and protected and that their quality of life is enhanced.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has issued the national standards for residential services for persons with disabilities.  These standards have been developed for the purposes of the registration and inspection of residential services for persons with disabilities.  They will assist service providers to assess the quality of service they provide in advance of inspection.  They will also act as a guide to individuals and families as to what they can reasonably expect of a residential service.</P>
        <P>Standard 12 states, &ldquo;Each individual is facilitated and supported to exercise his/her civil and political rights, in accordance with his/her wishes.&rdquo;  This includes individuals being facilitated, where they so wish, to participate in the political process by voting and by seeking public office.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government includes a specific commitment to put these standards on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by HIQA.  As announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on 16 June last, discussions have now begun between the Department of Health and HIQA to progress this commitment.  Given the complex nature of residential service provision for persons with disabilities, ranging from congregated setting to dispersed housing in the community, careful consideration is being given to designing the most appropriate regulatory model, and this work is ongoing.</P>
        <P>While the HIQA standards have yet to be put on a statutory footing, compliance with the HIQA standards is already included in the service level agreements and arrangements between the HSE and service providers in the disability sector &mdash; that answers directly Senator &Oacute;Clochartaigh&rsquo;s query on the voluntary and non-HSE service providers.</P>
        <P>The HSE is working closely with contracted voluntary service providers to prepare for the implementation of these standards.  As a general rule, clients with a disability who live in residential care are facilitated to vote where they wish to do so.  Polling cards are distributed and discussions on the voting process are facilitated.  The HSE is confident that if a client in one of the services run by contracted service providers requested support to cast his or her vote in the recent presidential election, this would have been facilitated.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is responsible for the various legislative codes dealing with the registration of electors and the conduct of elections and referenda.  That Department has advised that provision is made in electoral law for residents of a hospital or nursing home who have a physical disability to apply to be included in the special voters&rsquo; list and to vote at the hospital or nursing home.  These arrangements were in place for the presidential election and for the 2011 referenda.  The number of special voters on the register of electors at 15 February 2011 was just over 6,000.  There would have been some more added to this through the supplement process before the polls.</P>
        <P>Electoral legislation provides for a variety of special arrangements to assist those with certain disabilities to exercise their right to vote.  These include: voting at an alternative polling station if the local station is inaccessible; postal voting; assistance in voting at the polling station by a companion or the presiding officer; and voting at a hospital, nursing home or similar institution, if the individual resides there and cannot go to a polling station.</P>
        <P>Once included in the special voters&rsquo; list, a person residing in a hospital, nursing home or similar institution who has a physical disability or illness which prevents him or her from going <Col N="562"/>to the polling station, can vote at the hospital or nursing home.  Local arrangements for special voting are made by the returning officer in each constituency involving assistance in voting, as it is required, by the special presiding officer.</P>
        <P>In consultation with the National Disability Authority, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government provided guidance on accessible voting for the recent polls.  This guidance assisted returning officers and their staff in a practical way and aimed to increase their awareness of assisting persons with disabilities on polling day.  The guidance also included an accessible voting checklist which draws on the National Disability Authority&rsquo;s 2002 publication, Building for Everyone, including guidance on accessible voting and access to polling stations.</P>
        <P>The latest data from the national disability databases shows that 9,000 persons with a disability live in full-time residential settings.  These settings vary from large institutions to individual homes in the community and staff support will vary according to the varying needs of the client group.</P>
        <P>The HSE does not routinely collate information on the number of service users who are registered to vote or who have requested assistance to allow them to vote.  Therefore, the specific information sought by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh on the numbers who were brought to vote in the recent presidential election is not available.  However, in view of the foregoing HIQA standards, which at present is non-statutory, it is clear that the potential to enable persons residing in group or residential homes to exercise their franchise needs further attention, and certainly we will be engaging on that.</P>

	<P>Is part of the service level agreement with the third parties that they must indicate to the persons in the residential homes that they have the right?  Is there a process to make arrangements to vote in advance?  Is there a particular procedure in place for that as part of the agreement or how does that work?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have intimate knowledge of the service level agreements with each one other than of the general HIQA standard provided to accommodate and ensure this happens.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh makes a good point.  It is certainly a point which I will check and confirm.  I will contact the Senator in writing.</P>
