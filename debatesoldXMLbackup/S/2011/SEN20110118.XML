	<P>I have notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to consider reducing commercial rates by 50% for a 15-month period to support businesses and jobs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to clarify whether he has had talks with the Road Safety Authority to have traffic islands made visible through the use of cats eyes at their base.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Keaveney as the Minister has no official responsibility in this matter.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Student Support Bill 2008 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed), to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and adjourn at 5.15 p.m., if not previously concluded, on which spokespersons may speak for 15 minutes and all other Senators for ten minutes and Senators may share time; and No. 2, Welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2010 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at 5.15 p.m. and conclude not later than 7.15 p.m., if not previously concluded, on which spokespersons may speak for 12 minutes and all other Senators for eight minutes and Senators may share time, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate for closing comments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We see little attention being given today to the issues facing the country; instead the focus is on the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party.  The point is being missed: the people have not lost confidence in the Government because of errors made in communication, they have lost faith because of errors, misjudgments and bad decisions made by the Government that have left hard working families to pay the price for generations <Col N="126"/>to come.  The Government has forgotten that it was the decisions made by it that led to the IMF bailout.  That is the problem and what concerns the people.  Anything else is a distraction.</P>
        <P>There is no better example I can give to highlight the poor performance of the Government than what we have learned in the last few days about the payment of bank bonuses.  I have raised this issue on a number of occasions, but it is extraordinary to read that further millions have been paid in bank bonuses.  It is even more extraordinary that the Department of Finance did not even know about this.  The Minister must start an investigation to find out what is going on.  It is quite extraordinary.  I ask the Leader to ensure a full report on this issue is made available to this House as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>It is quite extraordinary to read the details of this matter.  Millions of euro are concerned.  Other banks covered by the guarantee scheme paid out a total of almost &euro;46 million in bonuses between 2008 and 2010.  Anglo Irish Bank was responsible for some &euro;20 million in bonus payments in the last months of 2008 and AIB was responsible for &euro;20 million.  This is quite extraordinary at a time when people are telling us on the doorsteps how much money they have lost this week from their social welfare payments and pay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Added to this there is the universal social charge and the hike in VHI premium costs.  No wonder people are angry.  What we need is not a change in Fianna F&aacute;il leader but an election and a new Government as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a parlous situation.  It appears as if the Taoiseach has lost the confidence of a significant number of his own Cabinet members, which must cause difficulty.  The sooner this is resolved, the better, especially in a time when we are getting rather inappropriate lectures from people such as Mr. Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank laying the blame entirely at the foot of the Irish taxpayer.  I have tried to refute this argument in this House and hope it will be refuted magisterially by writers for <i>The Irish Times</i>, in which newspaper Mr. Smaghi&rsquo;s comments were cited.</P>
        <P>The financial circumstances are appalling.  I spoke when the universal social charge was mooted first, and I predicted the way it would go.  Senator Fitzgerald is perfectly right is this regard.  I listened in horror to a man saying on the radio before lunchtime how he would have to remove his family&rsquo;s VHI coverage and to another whose gas and electricity have been cut off.  The latter has a house full of children, one of whom is recovering from swine flu.  The family has no means of cooking.  This is appalling and must be addressed.</P>
        <P>I would like to make a few positive points.  I wish well my colleague, Senator Shane Ross, who has announced his intention to stand as an Independent candidate in the general election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.  The Senator should ask questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>My question, then, is whether the Leader welcomes the candidacy of a Member of this House and whether he joins me in congratulating Senator Ross.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Congratulations to Senator Norris.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to raise a couple of other positive issues.  Last week I went to the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition.  If one ever needs to be lifted out of a feeling of despair, one need only meet the wonderful young people involved.  This year saw the largest ever number of entrants, who entered 1,735 project<Col N="127"/>s.  Three hundred and forty schools, from all 32 counties, were involved.  I spoke to a number of the entrants, one of whom was a fellow who had created an application for a mobile telephone such that it could be turned into a defibrillator so sudden adult death syndrome could be addressed immediately by a very large number of people.  I asked the student whether he was applying for a patent and he said he was.  Another student had just obtained a patent.  Last year&rsquo;s winners, John O&rsquo;Callaghan and Liam McCarthy, from Kinsale community school, have a patent for a project on the development of a convenient, simple test for somatic cell count, which is important to milk production.  Well done to these fantastic, enterprising, creative, imaginative and gifted young people.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader take up an issue that I am sure must be close to his heart, that is, the closure of Fitzgibbon Street police station?  I wrote to the superintendent and asked about this.  The station is supposed to be closed for refurbishment.  I asked two questions, namely, when the refurbishment programme would start and when the station would reopen, and the answer I got stated: &ldquo;I do not have this information because it is not within my knowledge at present as a district officer.&rdquo;  The plan is to refurbish Fitzgibbon Street station but I have been given no information in regard to when this work will commence.  The station, which is in the inner city, is being abandoned and we must do something about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Fitzgerald is absolutely right.  Having spoken to citizens, I note many have gone beyond anger at this stage.  There is a real sense of paralysis, particularly in recent days.  It is extraordinary.  People are filled with awe that they are expected to watch something that seems to pass for politics, namely, the circus that surrounds the leadership of Fianna F&aacute;il which is being indulged across the media as if there was nothing else of importance that we could debate in the serious economic climate.  Some members of Fianna F&aacute;il have gone on radio to tell us that, if the party can crank up the Taoiseach again for a few weeks and if he gives a few prize fighting performances on radio and television, everything will be fine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions to the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The world has moved on from such cynicism.  Senator Fitzgerald is right, we need change and a new Government.  There is no reason the Government should stay in office beyond this week or, at most, ten days, in which the Finance Bill could be disposed of.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week I asked the Leader a question and he stated he would revert to me with an answer.  Perhaps he might do so today.  What are the Government&rsquo;s intentions regarding the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights?  A new wording has been prepared, but there are issues with it.  The committee spent two years debating the question and a year has passed since we produced our report.  There is a danger we could rush into accepting the new wording in the three or four weeks or whatever length of time remains before the general election which some seem to believe will not be held until the middle of April or later.  We should go back to the previous forum, an important one which lasted for more than two years, to re-examine the new wording.  I share some of the concerns expressed about it.  What are the Government&rsquo;s intentions in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme which is efficient and effective?</P>

	<P><Col N="128"/>It has been a flop.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to be invited to come to the House.  Yesterday the offices of the Property Registration Authority were opened on Golf Links Road in Roscommon town opposite the Sacred Heart Hospital.  Some 90 civil servants will be employed there, with the potential to have 250 employees in total.  The offices cost &euro;11.5 million to build.  I visited them this morning and congratulate all concerned.  I congratulate, in particular, the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, as well as myself for bringing the project to Roscommon town, in addition to another project, the General Register Office on Convent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator congratulating himself?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The use of the word &ldquo;congratulations&rdquo; might be a little excessive.  It would be worthwhile to show how Fianna F&aacute;il has encouraged and supported decentralisation, despite the efforts made by the Opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the decentralisation programme not stopped?  The Senator will soon be decentralised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This morning I was told someone hoped Fine Gael would not get into power because it would relocate 30,000 civil servants to Dublin.  This is causing fear among civil servants.</P>

	<P>I will come to them.  The universal social charge is affecting everyone.  In particular, those aged over 70 years are angry.  Everyone&rsquo;s income is lower and emigration is also a factor.  Let us consider the reality.  While Nero fiddles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator want a debate on the matter?  This is not the time for speeches.  Questions to the Leader, please.</P>

	<P>That is what I want to hear from every Member.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;not defended us against the comments of the French President, Mr. Sarkozy, to the effect that Ireland should not benefit from EU aid while retaining a low corporation tax rate?  In Galway it accounts for the creation of 12,000 jobs in multinational companies.  This shows how weak a negotiator the Government is.  Where is its robust, definitive response?  Let France, President Sarkozy and the European Union know this country is not a carcase to be picked at.  We are fully compliant and supported France when it needed EU aid to bail out Renault.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not dealing with France now or talking about what happened in the European Union.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;a key member state of the European Union.  It goes to prove Ireland&rsquo;s clout, post the bailout, is as diminished in the European Union as the public finances.  There is only one way to rebuild our reputation and that is through the holding of a general election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions to the Leader, please.  The Senator has made her point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I say to Members on the Government side: for God&rsquo;s sake, go.  Their time is up.  That is what they should tell the Taoiseach today.</P>

	<P>I do not share the anger expressed, but I certainly share the sense of hopelessness and despair referred to by Senator Healy Eames when I listen to Opposition Members and think they could be in government in two or three months&rsquo; time.  I understand why people have a sense of hopelessness and despair.</P>

	<P>The Senator had better wake up after 13 years in government.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Senator Walsh is not meeting people on the doorstep.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Please, Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is disgraceful that bonuses are being paid in the banks.  On occasion I have been highly critical in the House of excessive public service pay levels.  The taxpayer is now having to support the banks in the interests of the overall economy.  In this regard, it is unconscionable that some of the money is being siphoned off to pay bonuses in a situation where the banks are insolvent.  That would not happen anywhere else in the private sector and it should not be allowed to happen in the case of the banks.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before Christmas we were promised there would be an ongoing debate on the Croke Park agreement.  I ask for a debate on it as a matter of urgency.  I read recently about the negotiations that were taking place on privilege days.  Apparently, an attempt is being made to add the number of privilege days to one&rsquo;s annual leave entitlements.  Compensatory leave is also given in the public service, which is a disgrace.  Those working in the public service and the Houses get up to 11 weeks&rsquo; holidays following the inclusion of compensatory leave&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;this issue will definitely not be addressed by the Labour Party which is in hock to the unions and will not be in a position of independence to make essential changes.  If taxpayers were aware of half of what was happening with their hard-earned money, there would be a revolt.</P>

	<P>I should be very careful in case I say too much about the outcome of the High Court case, as the matter may well be referred to the Supreme Court, but it is appropriate that something should be said about the High Court&rsquo;s decision last week with regard to the Seanad and the payment of expenses.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It has not been finalised.  I do not wish to go down that road.  There may well be an opportuni<Col N="131"/>ty later if Members wish to discuss the matter but not today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will defer to the Cathaoirleach for the moment, but it is important to make certain points.  There is an issue in the public mind about the quality of the Seanad, its ability to investigate its own affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, Senator, we are not pursuing the matter now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

	<P>Questions to the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No matter how bad the national finances are, the fact that the funding for Operation Anvil, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s biggest ongoing operation to tackle organised crime, has been cut by more than 50% should not be let go unchallenged or without criticism.  When I raised the matter a number of weeks ago, I said that no matter how bad things got, it would still be necessary to prioritise in favour of essential services.  At a time when so many people are concerned about organised crime, it is madness to cut the budget for Operation Anvil to that extent.  I have a similar concern about the ability of the Garda to investigate prostitution in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

	<P>Last Friday evening, I joined Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and other Oireachtas colleagues from the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in attending a public information meeting organised by Cavan Chamber of Commerce on the future of Quinn Insurance.  A number of contributions were made by interested parties and the staff, representatives of various interest groups and Oireachtas Members who attended left the meeting with one question unanswered.  Why are the administrators of Quinn Insurance not examining the proposal that Anglo Irish Bank and representatives of the Quinn family have worked on for more than nine months and which would retain the company in Irish ownership and repay &euro;2.8 billion of the money owed to the State by the Quinn family?  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Finance into the House in order that we can ask him whether the proposal is being examined and, if not, who is preventing an examination or what difficulties have arisen in respect of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Has the Leader invited the Minister for Health and Children to discuss with the House the increase in charges announced by VHI?  I tabled two amendments on this issue to the Order of Business last week.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Finance to explain to the House how Bank of Ireland can award bonuses to its staff.  We have appointed public interest directors and bailed out the banks.  As public stakeholders we own the banks, yet the bonus culture con<Col N="132"/>tinues to exist in them.  Does the Leader agree that a cosy cartel continues to run this country?  According to the Minister, he has to conduct an investigation.  The payment of these bonuses is a scandal which needs to be addressed immediately.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Healy Eames in suggesting that, rather than play games in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, the Minister for Foreign Affairs should explain to this House and the nation what he has said to President Sarkozy in response to the latter&rsquo;s remarks on Ireland.  We are a strong and vibrant member of the European Union and President Sarkozy has further sullied the name of our country with his remarks.  How dare he intervene in our affairs?  What has our Government said about it?  Nothing.  Why has the Minister not rebutted these claims?  Why has he not stand up for the ordinary citizen of this country?</P>

        <P>There are times when we need to commend the benefits of the tough decisions made by Government.  The fact that farm incomes grew by 34% in real terms in 2010 is something from which we should all take comfort.  I am quite conscious that we have set strong targets for exports from farming to help us to grow this economy.  With that in mind, I look forward to the debates which will take place on the carbon emissions legislation to see how we can reconcile the necessary growth from the farming community and the very stiff regulations which will be put in place.  I am sure our Green Party colleagues will be able to outline how that will be done in the coming months.</P>

	<P>There have been flip-flops by the Minister for Finance of a much more serious nature in the economic sphere and I will cite three.  The first was the bank bonuses where he maintained that his hands were tied and that he could do nothing about them, yet he subsequently passed legislation to deal with that issue.  The second was that subordinated bondholders could not be touched, yet legislation was ultimately passed by the Minister to deal with that matter.  The most extraordinary one was the EU-IMF bailout in which he treated with contempt, as did the Taoiseach, anyone who suggested the rates of interest were excessive and unsustainable, yet he unashamedly indicated yesterday that he was going to Brussels to renegotiate the rates.</P>

        <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on what is happening in the North and the north west.  Last week the Minister announced he was withdrawing the PSO in respect of the Derry to Dublin link road.  The Labour Party has announced it will withdraw the money for the project.  A Sinn F&eacute;in Minister will not deliver on the rail link between Belfast and Derry.  The PSO has been removed because we have good road and rail links.  This is both very serious and unacceptable for the north west.  For those who are worried about the shape of the next Government, when we see the money going to the North being considered irrelevant and unnecessary, the people of County Donegal will say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Labour Party because of the way they are being abandoned.</P>

	<P>I have an issue to raise on health information.  During the Christmas break I discovered that many could not properly read the instructions on medicines and could not read health information.  What is the HSE&rsquo;s national service plan for 2011 on health information?  There are volunteers who provide courses on literacy and numeracy through the VECs.  We should have a module in civic education in schools on health education to help those parents who may be not good at reading or writing<Col N="136"/>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Very often they throw away instructions on medicines because they have not read them properly.  I would like us to have statements in this Chamber on the HSE&rsquo;s strategy, in conjunction with those of the Departments of Education and Skills and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to help those who may not be good at reading or writing and do not have the confidence to deal with these issues.  We could do it as part of the senior cycle in schools through modules on health education.  There is social and civics education.</P>

	<P>This is an area that is being neglected and it would save taxpayers money because so much money is being wasted on prescriptions, with tablets being thrown out because people have not read or do not understand the instructions.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>One can sympathise with those who resent the kite flying of President Sarkozy and particularly what one could call an intrusion into the internal affairs of this country.  The best comes out in the Irish character when we are provoked in that way.  Often it forces cohesion between the different groupings, both in this House and elsewhere, and we see that happening in this instance.  I would be disappointed if that were not the case.</P>
        <P>One of the best ways of responding to this type of provocation and questioning of our independence and sovereignty is to show respect and admiration for our history and for our patriots, those who gave us the opportunities and the wherewithal which we have today to deliver on our own destiny.  Previously I raised the question of the upcoming celebration and commemoration of 1916 in a short number of years.  I raised it in particular in the context of the buildings in Moore Street.  The will of the people on this issue would be without doubt unanimously that we must protect and develop that area.</P>
        <P>The reason I raise it, and I hope the Leader may get the opportunity of responding on this, is that it has gone unnoticed that Dublin City Council has taken a positive move in this regard.  It has been proactive through a resolution, which I believe was put forward by the Labour Party in recent weeks.  I compliment the party on that because we needed that guidance and leadership from Dublin City Council.  It will count for nought, however, if Parliament does not respond to it at this time.  I am just a little concerned that the wheels are moving too fast.  I ask the Leader to give Members time specifically to discuss that.  If we do that, we will be sending a message to the world that our sovereignty is beyond reach and it is our intention in a few years time to demonstrate to the world the type of nation we are, the independence we have and the leadership we have provided, not just here but to the world in other cases as well.  I ask the Leader for the opportunity to discuss specifically the national monument which is Moore Street in order that we can show support for Dublin City Council in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I also want to comment on our 12.5% corporation tax rate.  It is recognised by most political parties that it is of paramount importance for foreign direct investment and the creation of jobs in this country to retain that 12.5% tax rate.  It is regrettable that President Sarkozy has come out against Ireland on this tax.  We are a sovereign nation and can have whatever tax we wish.  It is the prerogative of President Sarkozy to reduce his own country&rsquo;s corporation tax rate if he believes ours is of such benefit to us.  I look at Taiwan, one of the most expanding nations in the world, which has growth rates of 9% to 10% and which has recently reduced i<Col N="137"/>ts corporation tax rate from 22% to 16%.  We do not intend to take lectures from President Sarkozy or those from any of the other countries on our tax system.  We will deal with it as we see fit and as long as we can repay our debts to the European Union, it cannot have any say in our tax system.</P>
        <P>Some political parties, such as People Before Profit and others, suggest that we should increase our corporation tax rate, and this at a time when we need to create jobs, we need foreign companies to come to this country and we need foreign companies with a presence in this country to stay here.  This suggestion by People Before Profit and the alliance of the left, or whatever they call themselves, that we increase our corporation tax rate by 2% to 3% or even more to solve our economic problems is an absolute disgrace.  It is a mockery where economics is concerned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>

        <P>Will the Leader also indicate when the finance Bill will be published and outline the Seanad schedule to accommodate same?  Will the Leader indicate the position of the legislation dealing with a directly elected lord mayor for Dublin and outline the likely schedule associated with same?</P>

	<P>The comments on corporation tax serve as a reminder that we have been able to apply the 12.5% rate without much question for many years.  It has proven very successful and I agree entirely with Senator Cummins in his comments on the benefits we have experienced.  When people run into debt, they also run into difficulties.  A debtor finds that those to whom money is owed can begin to argue that because they provided help, they can talk about topics such as corporation tax.  It is a reminder that there are costs associated with bailouts.  We must be careful and not assume that these issues do not have a cost.</P>
        <P>My attention has been drawn to a topic of which I was not previously aware.  We are trying to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship in small and medium-sized enterprises.  Last month a ban was imposed on access to debt judgments, and this deprives small businesses of information they used to get.  An Irish organisation called Irish Judgments Limited used to provide the details of debt judgments in the Circuit and District courts, giving the information to <i>Stubbs Gazette</i> and others in order that small businesses could decide whether to give credit to other businesses.  Last month a stop was put to this in Ireland, although the process still occurs in England, Scotland and Wales.</P>
        <P>I do not know the reason for this action but it seems the decision will deprive small businesses and enterprises of a very useful tool they had previously to assess the creditworthiness of other parties.  I suggest that the Leader ask those responsible where the decision came from and whether it is possible to reverse it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, Norris and Alex White discussed the economy and I welcome the announcement on exports last week and the success of Bord Bia in particular.  We should give the Government the credit it deserves for our strong export figures over the past two difficult years.  Senator Norris also expressed serious concern about families in real poverty, especially those with no heat, electricity or gas.  I will see what we can do about that.  We will make inquiries after the Order of Business to ascertain the up to date position.  Irrespective of how little money they have, families should not be left without electricity or gas, both of which are basic essentials on a par with tea, butter, bread and sugar.  Energy is essential for the survival of families and the least the Government can do is ensure it is provided for them.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Norris in congratulating Senator Ross on his endeavours in Dublin South.  He follows other Senators in announcing he will stand for election in Dublin South.  I understand a fourth Senator will make a similar announcement in the near future.</P>

	<P>The Leader would be very welcome to stand in the constituency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend good wishes to all candidates in Dublin South, a constituency anyone would be proud to represent and one which has been fortunate to benefit from massive infrastructural investment.  I look forward to assisting colleagues in the area.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris also congratulated the 1,735 young enterprising boys and girls who entered the Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition.  These young people are the future of the country and I join the Senator in congratulating all those who participated in the event, especially those who won awards.  The exhibition is an outstanding success.  Every January it is uplifting to see what the young brains of the country are achieving at a young age.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senator Norris on the lack of investment in the inner city of <Col N="139"/>Dublin.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, is a champion of the inner city who will be sadly missed now that he has decided he will no longer represent the area.  His decision will leave Senator Norris and the constituency&rsquo;s Deputies with a challenge on their hands.  As the Senator noted, funding for Fitzgibbon Street Garda station is crucial and must continue, if possible.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White referred to the forthcoming referendum on children&rsquo;s rights, an issue about which I asked a question last week.  I will inquire as to the timeframe for the referendum and inform the Senator of the up to date position tomorrow morning.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden celebrated and rejoiced, with the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, in the opening of decentralised offices in Roscommon, his local town.  This development provides a major boost for the town, the west and rural Ireland in general.  I congratulate the Senator and the Minister of State on their achievements in this regard.  I hope, however, that the Senator is wrong regarding the possibility that a new Government will reverse policy and relocate 30,000 public sector workers to Dublin.  I hope a new Government will support rural areas.  The population of the west, from Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s constituency in County Donegal along the coast to County Waterford, is declining.  In the light of considerable reductions in the cost of staff and property and the construction of new dual carriageways and motorways between Dublin and Waterford, Limerick, Cork and Galway, companies have an ideal opportunity to invest on the western seaboard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Healy Eames referred to job creation and recent public comments.  As Senators are aware, more than 600,000 jobs were created under various Governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il and more than 1.5 million people are still at work.  All parties, whether Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Green Party or Sinn F&eacute;in, must prioritise job creation for the 250,000 people who have lost their jobs.  It is clear what will happen at the polls to any political party which fails to do this.  No other party has a more successful record on job creation than Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris, Walsh, Buttimer, Hanafin, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Quinn referred to the payment of bank bonuses.  That incorrect information was provided for the Minister for Finance is unacceptable and the matter must be investigated urgently.  We fully support the Minister in his efforts and I will have no difficulty in setting aside time to discuss the matter.  The example given by us in public life and in the public sector through everyone taking a reduction in wages, as have bank staff, means the bonus structure must be discontinued in these difficult times.</P>
        <P>President Sarkozy has outlined various matters regarding the 12.5% corporation tax rate which is in the hands of the Irish people who have a veto.  The message to the world is: hands off our 12.5% corporation tax rate.  This is an island nation.  As such, everything must be brought in by air or sea and we must have an opportunity to play a leading role in the European Union.  President Sarkozy&rsquo;s comments demonstrate sheer greed.  Why should such a powerful nation like France deny a little island nation like Ireland which has a population of 4.5 million people the opportunity to survive and its people a chance to make a living and rear their families, as they are doing so successfully and well?  I fully support all of the comments made regarding our 12.5% corporation tax rate.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh called for a debate on the Croke Park agreement.  I will schedule the next debate on the agreement for early next week.  I have taken note of his comment that there are those who get 11 weeks holidays.  I presume this figure includes sick days and the 22 or 23 days some sections of the workforce receive.  It is unacceptable and unsustainable that one should have 56 days leave.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen referred to the funding of Operation Anvil and I support his call.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform faces very difficult decisions in how he handles his budget<Col N="140"/>.  I send him our best wishes following his operation last Friday.  Let us hope he makes a full recovery.  He was in pain for some considerable time when he taking Bills in this House and we wish him well.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen referred to future legislation on prostitution.  I am awaiting a response and will revert to the House when I receive it.</P>
        <P>Senator Wilson sought a special debate on the Quinn Group and its difficulties.  A number of interested parties have made proposals and it is unacceptable that they have not all been examined and considered.  I have thought about this since the request was made and will allow time next week for statements.  The Minister or Minister of State at the Department of Finance will be present in the Chamber to hear the serious concerns brought to the attention of the House by Senator Wilson and others.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer asked for the Minister for Health and Children to attend the Chamber to discuss the subject of VHI charges.  I will endeavour to have a date included in the diary, but the difficulty is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I welcome it and congratulate everyone associated with it.  Also, this must be taken into account in regard to climate change proposals, which are before the House for consideration and Second Stage of that Bill will be taken in the House tomorrow.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney asked about the Road Traffic Bill.  That Bill will be before the House at 2.30 p.m. tomorrow and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, will be in the House to take it.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney also called for a debate on the North, in particular on the importance of issues related to the north west.  I fully agree with the Senator, who is a champion in this House in highlighting the difficulties and the very many issues about which she is concerned regarding her native county of Donegal and the plight of those living in the north west.  I will support her in any way that I possibly can in her call for such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Ormonde called for the issue of health literacy to be addressed and for a programme to be put in place and she asked what the HSE strategy in this regard will be.  Perhaps this matter could be raised with the Minister for Health and Children when she will be in the House to deal with the VHI issue and all other issues related to health.  Senator Ormonde&rsquo;s request for such a debate is a serious one that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the matter of the centenary celebrations of the men and women of 1916, quite a number of whom gave their lives for this country.  Those people have given us the Ireland we have of today.  The Senator raised in particular the preservation of the buildings in Moore Street in regard to Dublin City Council and I note all the issues he outlined.  I have no difficulty in allocating time for such a debate and if I cannot find time to arrange for it having regard to all the Bills that are to come before the House, I will arrange for the debate to take place in the next  Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely raised the matter of Seanad reform.  All the submissions on it from the various groupings and parties of the House are with the Minister responsible.  The Minister promised a White Paper on this matter, the publication of which we await.   I announced last week the programme of Bills to be published and that were listed for our consideration, one of which is the Finance Bill which will be taken in February.  Another Bill that has been published is the Dublin Lord Mayor Bill, the progress of which we await.  If time permits, that Bill will also be taken</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand.  I am very happy to welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am sure he will pass on whatever substantial remarks are made during the remaining part of this debate.  This is a significant matter, particularly for students who are under financial pressure.  With the greatest goodwill in the world, the grant system has been fairly chaotic.  The Minister in her speech made it clear that there were anomalies and that individual students suffered hardship as a result.  I have called for this legislation for quite a long time and the latest mention I found of it was on 25 November 2010 on the Order of Business when I appealed to the Government to introduce and pass this legislation as rapidly as possible.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the work of the Library and Research Service which once again has produced excellent material about the Bill in terms of the briefing document.  It is important that we recognise that it does excellent work in framing this legislation but the briefing document we received is substantially out of date, although not necessarily its content because the outlines are perfectly all right, but, when one considers that since 2008 three Ministers have been charged with producing this Bill and a vast number of reports on this area have been produced.  There was the report of the advisory committee on third level student support &mdash; the Butler report in 1993, the Report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education in 2001 &mdash; the McNamara report, and the report on supporting equity in higher education in 2003, and so on.  It is not surprising that in this document there is reference to the hope that it would be introduced in time to benefit the students of the 2009-10 academic year.  This is certainly not something that has been rushed.  It is timely and in the light of the fact that the Government will shortly be out of office &mdash; of that there is no doubt &mdash; this is a positive contribution to that exit and it provides for a streamlined administration, which is very welcome.  It also for the first time provides for a proper statutory basis for these grants and that is very much to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>Turning to the Minister&rsquo;s speech, she indicated the pressing need for an administrative system that suits equally all students.  She gave an example of two students from different parts of the country who sit beside each other in a lecture in college and said that it is important that they get the grant at the same time.  That is absolutely true.  I have voluminous correspondence from various representative bodies for students indicating that last year some of them did not get their first tranche of the payment until April, whereas some of them got it straight away.  On a very basic principle of justice, that is completely wrong.  It is appropriate for it to be addressed.</P>
        <P>The difficulties posed are partly because of the multiplicity of granting organisations, of which I understand there are currently, before the passage of this Bill, 66.  This will be halved to 33 and, clearly, that must represent an efficiency.  The Minister was gracious in her speech and she did not use this to be<Col N="143"/>labour the existing 66 authorities, rather she paid tribute to them and the work they have done.  I welcome the fact that she did so.  However, the situation is changing because ten years ago, as the Minister pointed out, there were 50,000 students in receipt of grants, while this year there will be 70,000 students in receipt of them and on top of that the financial employment situation means that there will be greater pressure upon the system because increasingly more students will decide that it is their interests to go into third level education rather than attempt to find a job straight off.</P>
        <P>As I am in a generally positive frame of mind, I also welcome the preliminary moves that have been made before the introduction of the provisions of the Bill because they include a significant modernisation of the technology involved.  First, there is the introduction of a new and simplified application form with explanatory notes.  I abominate forms.  I hate filling out forms; I often make mistakes in them.  I recently had to fill out the return for the Ethics in Public Office Act and I put a figure of &euro;7,000 in the wrong column, so it appeared I was volunteering to pay the Government that amount rather than looking for it.  I can make a mistake like that and I am a reasonably intelligent person.  The forms should be as simple and clear as possible so students do not make mistakes that create difficulties later on.  An online facility for the 11 grant awarding authorities has been rolled out.  That should be the norm in the entire system because this generation operates that way; it is completely computer literate.  It is easy and can be done quickly and efficiently.  There is also the question of electronic funds transfer that would allow for grants to be paid directly into the student&rsquo;s bank account.</P>
        <P>The three most significant elements of this Bill are the introduction of a single, unified grant scheme to replace four existing schemes; that will get rid of anomalies.  The single national grant awarding body is also established under the Bill.  Finally, the independent appeals body is introduced.  I like the idea of an independent appeals body and I like the flexibility it involves.  I noted when I was reading the Bill that in certain circumstances, if a student misses a deadline for an appeal, he or she can make a case for the deadline to be extended by a calendar month.  That is useful because there could be circumstances in which, for one reason or another, a student does not make the appeal on time.  For the first time we have a proper independent appeals authority and, second, the appeals authority is flexible and student-centred.</P>
        <P>I have had some criticism of the Bill, particularly from the vocational education authorities; they are concerned that there is reduction of their status.  I am sure the Minister of State will address those concerns in his concluding remarks because doubtless the IVEA has made its concerns known to him.  I understand the group&rsquo;s position, however, because any group being rationalised always experiences a certain amount of pain and regret for the past.  While I sympathise on a human level, and while it makes me say it was even more important for the Minister to pay tribute to the work done by the existing bodies in difficult circumstances and without the technology and support that is now being introduced, this Bill goes in the right direction and I commend the Government and the Minister for introducing it.  I hope it passes swiftly, perhaps it could even conclude within the next week, because students need it.</P>
        <P>There has been briefing after briefing in Buswell&rsquo;s Hotel on this urgent issue.  I fully support the students on this for practical reasons of politics and tactics.  I explained to them at the same time that on fees I took a more nuanced position.  I have no doubt fees are coming and in evidence I point to reports like the Hunt report.  I saw this coming three years ago and I have spoken at length about it since then; I do not want to do so again as a codicil to Second Stage of this Bill.  I believe in full and free access to education from primary to third level for all citizens but I am a realist and I understand that we cannot have the Scandinavian model without Scandinavian taxes to support it.  To date the Irish people have not voted for that tax model.  I also believe in a free and universally accessible health system but without the support of a tax system we canno<Col N="144"/>t have it.  In the meantime, scarce resources must be directed towards the most vulnerable in society and towards those who need it most.  I would prefer for it to be universal and free but it never has been and until we revise our tax system, it never will be.</P>
        <P>I understand the grant awarding authority will start operating soon on a transitional basis before kicking in properly by 2013.  The sooner the better, as far as I am concerned.  I am supported in this by every student body.  The student body of Trinity College states that currently students are left waiting for grant payments well into the academic year.  Last year there were students waiting until April to receive the first grant instalment.  This is a massive issue as students are struggling to pay for accommodation and food as they await their grant.  The Bill also allows for the amalgamation of the 66 grant awarders to one centralised body.  If the Bill is not passed and the grants are late again, some students will be unable to pay for rent and food.  These are basic elements.</P>
        <P>I would like to advert to a particular situation and ask the Minister of State if he would be kind enough to bring this question to the attention of the Minister.  As things stand, certain recognised third level institutions are excluded from the provisions of the Bill.  Griffith College is a particular example.  It is a fine institution.  I have spoken at a series of debates there and have had engagement with members of staff, particularly in the legal department, and there are some fine lecturers there along with highly intelligent and gifted students.  They are excluded from this grant.  There is a mechanism in the Bill by which such colleges may be recognised.  Will the Minister of State find out if Griffith College will be recognised?  It is important that it should be.</P>
        <P>It is excluded because it is recognised as a private commercial college, which makes the students ineligible for the grant.  The students come from a variety of backgrounds and a number of them are clearly in need of this sort of support.  It looks like a certain type of discrimination that is not acceptable in a republic in 2011.  Griffith College offers many courses to students through the CAO system so it is already involved in part of the machinery.  In addition, the fact that it is a commercial college produces yet another anomaly.  Students at the Law Society of Ireland in Blackhall Place, where solicitors are trained, and the Honourable Society of Kings Inns, where barristers are trained, are fee-paying, but they are not automatically excluded from applying for a grant which may be received on the basis of an individual student&rsquo;s circumstances.  Most of those entering these august institutions, namely, those going for the bar or to be solicitors, usually come from established and financially comfortable backgrounds.  It would be wrong if we allowed the anomaly to continue.  Whereas well-heeled individuals can obtain access to education and obtain grants, students at institutions such as Griffith College are precluded in this regard.  My point refers to section 8 of the Bill which presents a possibility to provide for redress.  I ask that the problem be addressed for all of the colleagues in the anomalous circumstances I describe, particularly at Griffith College.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the Hunt report, in respect of which my point represents a side issue.  However, I note with some satisfaction that the report provides for the upgraded recognition of certain third level colleges which do not currently have university status.  There are a number in this category, one of which has been very effective, namely, Waterford Institute of Technology which has conducted internationally renowned research into diseases of the eye, including macro degeneration of the retina, for example.  I would very much like to see the college recognised fully as a technical university.  I am sure it is already included in respect of the payment of grants.</P>
        <P>I welcome the significant advance made which every student and student body will welcome.  I urge the House and the Minister of State to afford the Bill as quick a passage as possible in order that it will come into operation with maximum speed such that students and parents u<Col N="145"/>nder great pressure in these very difficult economic times can be facilitated.  We heard on the wireless today about people cancelling their VHI policies and about a family with a child recovering from swine flu that had no cooking capacity because its electricity and gas supply had been cut off.  In such circumstances, when families are suffering, what conditions are the students likely to be in?</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a politician, I always refer to my &ldquo;final word&rdquo; and then have another.  In this instance my final word may be irrelevant.  I remember the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, when he first entered the other House and the very effective speech he made about the conditions in which some of his constituents in Ballymun were living.  I would like him to leave this House with a slightly sideways thought, namely, whether we could ask the Government to reinstate the moratorium on the cutting off of the gas and electricity supply of persons who find it impossible to pay for them.  I understand the moratorium is coming or has come to an end.  I know this is not directly germane to the Bill, but it is directly relevant to the lives of ordinary people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, and compliment him and the Government on grasping the nettle on this very important and urgent change to the system for processing third level grants.  I note the commitment to providing a speedy and effective service that will be seen to be fair.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris spoke eloquently about how many students were disadvantaged by being in college for almost a full term or more before receiving grant assistance.  It is important to remember that many of them come from less well-off and, in many cases, disadvantaged homes.  The students affected are those for whom going to a third level institution presents a huge challenge in the first instance.  It is to their credit that the families concerned are determined that their children will have access to third level education.  However, when the students concerned gain access to third level, they find themselves in the invidious position of being on an unequal footing by comparison with students from better-off homes, for whom third level does not present such a challenge.  We all have anecdotal evidence of students living in very distressed circumstances until they are almost half way through their first term in college.  Their parents are forced to borrow money, sometimes from moneylenders, in order to give them a fair chance.  It is important, therefore, that the Bill is passed speedily and that the new system comes into effect and works well.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There are aspects of the Bill I would like to highlight.  The establishment of the statutory appeals procedure is welcome.  It was always very difficult for a student who had been refused a grant to appeal the decision in the office where he or she had been initially refused, possibly with the same officers dealing with the case.  In the Bill it is proposed that a different officer deal with such cases and that, if appealed again, they should be submitted to an independent agency.  This is a good step forward, as people will have confidence in the system.  No one likes to be refused, but if the refusal of one&rsquo;s application was explained properly and it was shown that there had been an objective re-examination of the case, it might make it easier to accept.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that there will be a run-off period before the existing system is replaced by the new one.  The system will obviously require some tweaking as progress is made.  It is important that the system in place for existing students is allowed to run its course.  I welcome the fact that the Bill envisages the new system applying only to students who begin next term.</P>
        <P>I welcome the re-examination of the residential qualification which has been a huge bugbear for local authorities and vocational education authorities.  I refer to students applying from counties in which they d<Col N="146"/>o not officially reside, etc.  The section dealing with this issue is very important.</P>
        <P>Some aspects of the Bill are a little puzzling and I hope the Minister of State will be able to clarify one or two issues.  I believe that in 2006 the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, seemed to imply that all third level grant applications would be processed by VECs.  It was implied that local authorities, county councils, would be phased out of the system and that the VECs would operate on their own.  Perhaps the Minister of State will correct me on this if I am wrong.  The set of proposals made in the Bill is very different.  We must ask which body will ultimately be selected to become the single granting authority.  There has been considerable expertise in VECs during the years.  That I was a councillor and vice chairman of the VEC in County Kerry for a number of years informs my thinking on the matter.  That expertise must not be lost.  Whatever system is introduced and no matter which body will have overarching authority, I would still like to see a role for VECs.  I do not know how this would work; I am just making the suggestion.  The Minister of State accepts that the existing grant giving authorities have done a good job, although we have all had complaints about the process being drawn out.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to the filling in of application forms.  As a public representative my heart dropped when a parent or student came to ask for assistance in filling in an application form for a third level grant.  It was a full day&rsquo;s work.</P>
      
        <P>One needed to be careful.  Someone could make a living out of it, given that many people, including well educated people, require help with filling out the forms.  I hope the new system will be simplified.  That it is online and students are clued in will make the process easier and faster.  I look forward to this aspect.</P>
        <P>Given that the local authorities and VECs were doing all of this work, it makes sense to remove one of them from the equation.  It is ridiculous that someone attending University College Dublin, UCD, or Trinity needs to go to a county or city council to have his or her application processed whereas someone attending an institute of technology needs to go across the street to a different organisation.  It makes no sense that both bodies do the same type of work.  Any move away from such duplication is a step in the right direction.</P>
        <P>Another aspect gives me some concern.  The Bill envisages the single authority as a statutory public body.  This is important, given the great faith the Irish have in the prudence and probity of our public service and public servants.  This standard must be maintained in whatever system is introduced by the Bill.  However, the envisaged authority would be able to farm out some of the work in certain circumstances.  I have concerns in this regard.  I would be anxious to ensure the same high standards expected of public servants would obtain in any private organisation.  Many applications contain sensitive information about incomes, social welfare payments and matrimonial issues such as separation, divorce and so on.  One needs to have confidence in whatever private organisation takes on the work.</P>
        <P>I assume the T&aacute;naiste envisages a serious cost saving through the centralisation measures, which is welcome in these straitened times.  Sometimes centralisation can be counterproductive.  For example, when the application process for medical cards was centralised, people found the service unsatisfactory for a time.  They have since come to terms with it.  I hope the new measures will be eased in properly.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill broadly but I have certain reservations about the involvement of private companies in family situations.  Whatever authority is preferred, I hope the VECs&rsquo; record of service will be cherished, respected and utilised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.  This legislation is well overdue and must be brought to finality as soon as possible.  It was origin<Col N="147"/>ally introduced in 2008 but has been delayed for a variety of reasons, including a legal challenge.  As such, we accept some of the reasons for the delay.  The Bill aims to streamline the current grants system by centralising the 66 bodies that award third level grants into one main entity.  It is enabling legislation only, however, and we still await detailed proposals on the matter.  Some greater clarity was provided by the T&aacute;naiste when she attended the House last week.</P>
        <P>The current third level grants system is inefficient given how small our country is.  There must be a standard and fair national system.  It must not result, however, in efficient bodies becoming less efficient, which can occur during such a transition.  I raise this point in light of the bad experience of changes in the way Garda vetting is handled.  Vetting used to be carried out locally and quickly through local Garda resources, but when a special unit was set up in Templemore to centralise the process, the time extended beyond belief and is now in the region of 12 to 14 weeks.  This is an example of local, dispersed decision making being centralised into a single area and becoming less efficient.  Given the fear that such could occur in the case of this Bill, great care must be taken to prevent it from happening.</P>
        <P>We need a centralised grant awarding authority in order that students entitled to a grant get it more quickly and efficiently.  Central processing must be properly resourced and exempted from the recruitment embargo if any member of the team leaves for any reason.  It must also be flexible enough that the resources required to deliver the service can increase or decrease in line with demand.  As this is what occurs in efficient private sector areas, we must aspire to this standard.  It is nothing less than what is required by the country we are managing.  Students must be in a position to make informed decisions about their futures.  In the current economic climate, ensuring students get their grants in a timely manner is vital, given that many are unable to find part-time work to supplement their incomes.  This is important for students.</P>
        <P>I welcome the quality control check provided by the Bill.  The Minister can order a review of an awarding authority&rsquo;s performance in terms of issuing grants effectively or implementing other parts of the legislation.  The Minister can also order an awarding authority to lose its power to issue grants for two years as punishment.  I welcome the fact that students must have been resident in Ireland for three of the past five years, a reasonable provision.  I welcome that when means testing candidates, a distinction between independent and dependent students is made in terms of assessing incomes.  The 23 year old cut-off point is rightly being replaced with the distinction between dependent and independent.</P>
        <P>As I understand it and as the T&aacute;naiste stated last week, if a student applies for grant support for a course of study while still living at home, then moves out and even gets married during the time of the course, his or her status as someone living with his or her parents cannot be revoked for the duration of the course and the means of the parents will be considered.  I am unsure whether this anomaly has been addressed, but there must be some flexibility and every case should be taken on its merits.</P>
        <P>I welcome that the Bill standardises the information required on an application form for a grant to all awarding authorities.  I also welcome the introduction of fines and imprisonment as penalties for falsified grant applications.  The potential benefits of the Bill if it is enacted in its current form are a large reduction in the number of authorities issuing grants and a general streamlining of administration.  Within each county division, students will experience less confusion about where to apply and for which grant.  The establishment of an appeals process for applicants refused a grant ensures transparency and accountability for the individual student.</P>
        <P>I will outline some problems with the Bill.  Section 8(1)(<i>b</i>) specifically requires full-time attendance by a student.  I will refer to section 8(3) momentarily.  It is sensible to have some degree of creative flexibility with democratic safeguards that could enable a successor to the T&aacute;naiste to examine the possibility of <Col N="148"/>providing grants in some shape or form for students doing certain part-time courses.  Section 8(3) is welcome in so far as it allows for the possibility of funding for part-time courses in certain circumstances.  However, it only refers to undergraduate courses.  This is unwelcome, as flexibility should be provided.</P>
        <P>The series of reasons for funding part-time courses focus primarily on disadvantage.  While this is to be welcomed, the circumstances should not be limited to disadvantage.  Extending it to include other circumstances might make sense for the Department.  We should consider an amendment in this respect.  For example, we may need an amended provision in terms of labour market flexibility to encourage people to move sideways from a declining economic sector into a growing or developing one.  The cost of up-skilling could be facilitated by the provision of grants on top of redundancy payments and other entitlements.  The appeals procedure must produce a speedy outcome, especially as the beginning of the college year is an especially costly and stressful period for students, as noted by other Senators.  The Bill is a progressive reform of the grants system and is to be welcomed in this regard.  In several respects, however, it does not go far enough to overcome many of the problems from which the system suffers.  Inconsistency in the payment of grants is a significant flaw in the system as it stands.  Some local authorities pay out quickly, while others do not.  It is not essential for there to be an awarding authority in every county, but students who rely on grants to fund their education need a swift and efficient response from the bureaucracy which manages them.  This should be the overwhelming priority for the Student Support Bill.</P>
        <P>The grants system is, first and foremost, a public service, one which needs to be flexible and responsive.  Means testing has been debated in the past and there is great dissatisfaction with it in many parts of the country.  Access to the grants system should be equitable.  There has often been a perception of inequity where one person receives a college grant while a person down the road does not.  This fuels anger and a lack of the essential social cohesion in society.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party believes there should be student representation on the Student Grant Appeals Board, with at least one student representative on each sitting or division of the appeals board to be nominated by the Union of Students in Ireland.  My colleague, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn in the other House, tried to address this issue by way of an amendment.</P>
        <P>Among the countries of northern Europe, Ireland probably has the lowest provision of dedicated accommodation for students attempting to get to college and this is also a major issue for the USI.  Mechanisms could be put in place to enable third level colleges, the Construction Industry Federation and the Departments of Finance and Education and Skills to ease some of the pain of the current downturn in the construction sector through the provision of dedicated student accommodation.  This could be provided on campus land surplus to educational requirements or in conjunction with local authorities in areas unsuitable for family accommodation.</P>
        <P>I have some questions for the Minister of State.  When is it intended to make the changes which are provided for in the legislation?  Has the Minister a particular model in mind?  Will the changes be in place for the next academic year?  This is essential.  Is it the case that one of the bigger awarding bodies has offered to carry out central processing for all of the country?  If so, what is the current state of affairs in that regard?</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the question of progression.  The current guidelines state that grants will not be paid to candidates who hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification, but that candidates who hold a postgraduate qualification and are progressing to a further postgraduate course which represents progression may be deemed eligible for grant aid.  I am dealing with the case of a student who has a postgraduate diploma in arts in learning and teaching.  She arranged her own f<Col N="149"/>unding and is now studying for a postgraduate diploma in education in Trinity College.  This will qualify her to become a second level teacher because her other qualification does not qualify her.  She is progressing from a qualification that does not allow her to become a second level teacher to one that does.  This is a progression by any definition.  She was refused grant aid on the basis that the Department did not regard this as a form of progression but I must question this decision.  She is progressing from a qualification that does not allow her to become a second level teacher to a qualification that does.  I do not see the logic of this decision.  Furthermore, I am informed that the Department applies an exemption where a student is applying for a postgraduate qualification in law.</P>

The Leas-Chathaoirleach&rsquo;s timing is excellent because, in conclusion, I question why a legal qualification should be looked at differently from a qualification in education.  I ask the Minister of State or his officials to revert to me on this serious matter.  The rule on progression is applied to one set of qualifications and not to a qualification which is obviously a progression.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not argue that point.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am in favour of this Bill.  As Senator Ryan has argued, however, the key point will be its implementation.  I ask the Minister of State to say when the Bill will be implemented.  I am a Galway representative and it is a city with a population of 75,000 and a student population of 20,000.  The student population of Galway is very vibrant and every September throws up numerous representations from students with regard to difficulties with grants.  This information is needed by everyone in Galway and by everyone living in a city with a college or university.</P>
        <P>I accept the principle that the plethora of grant agencies have been causing significant confusion.  First-time students find it particularly difficult as they attempt to become familiar with a new curriculum and to adjust to living in a new place.  When problems arise with grants, they often do not know who to talk to.  Any proposals to simplify the grants system are to be welcomed.  The implementation of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions is a key point.</P>
        <P>I refer to a particular issue arising last year with regard to grant aid for mature students and the back to education allowance.  As a result of the economic situation, many people are choosing to go to college or university as a means of helping them to find employment.  This is a better use of time than being on the dole.  The grants system should support people who should not be forced into a situation whereby they have to go on the dole, especially if they have children.  Parents wishing to go back to <Col N="150"/>education to enhance their employment prospects and to add value to their skills and abilities should be supported in every way possible.  This Bill is a step in the right direction.  I am aware that the number of grants for mature students has been cut and this is regrettable.  However, I acknowledge the current difficult financial situation.</P>
        <P>The effect of this Bill on mature students and their social welfare benefits should be examined.  The single grants authority provided for in this Bill should allow for a more efficient administration of grants.  We must invest in education and in students for the sake of the country.  It has been a Green Party principle that education should be protected in this difficult economic time.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Norris in his support for full and free access to education.  I refer to the controversy about registration fees and college fees.  I have said on a number of occasions in Galway that I support the Labour Party point of view that we do not want to reintroduce college fees.  This has been a long-standing Labour Party principle and I commend the party on abolishing college fees in the first place.  This policy is supported by the Green Party.</P>
        <P>The registration fees have increased to such an extent that they are higher than similar registration fees in many other countries.  Getting fees in by the back door is not appropriate either.  Senator Norris also made the valid point that if we are going to be a low tax economy we cannot have high tax solutions.  We cannot copy the Scandinavian model without paying Scandinavian levels of tax.  We cannot afford to pay for a full student system if we do not have sufficient tax revenues.</P>
        <P>We are harmonising grants but a number of people have told me they would like to see a proper system of student loans.  At present, student loans are not easy to obtain and students would not be seen as good credit risks when they come looking for money to help themselves through college.  I accept that the risk perception depends to some extent on the course being pursued.  It is incumbent on the Government of the day to ensure that anybody who wants to go to college will not be barred interminably by financial considerations.  If people, and mature students with families in particular, are prepared to borrow money to attend college it should be possible for them to do so.  People should have some means, whether by begging or borrowing, although not by stealing, to enhance their employment prospects with a college or university education.</P>
        <P>I am not particularly concerned about historical issues relating to the VECs or who administers the funds but there are bound to be teething problems when the new structures are implemented.  We need to manage the transition period carefully.  I recognise this is not a matter covered by the Bill but, as several Senators have noted, implementation is key to this issue.  I welcome the Bill but I would like to know the timetable for implementing it and whether an implementation plan will be put in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an t-Aire St&aacute;it.  I am glad the Student Support Bill 2008 has at last come to fruition.  The Bill is welcome at a time when our most educated and brightest young people are leaving in droves.  It will offer greater cohesiveness through the implementation a single unified grant scheme.  Fianna F&aacute;il could do with a unified scheme to stay afloat but that is a different matter.  I wish the Minister of State well in the deliberations this evening.</P>
        <P>Last October and November, Fine Gael&rsquo;s spokesperson on education, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, highlighted the current fragmented nature of the grant system.  Parliamentary questions he tabled in the D&aacute;il revealed that almost 20% of applications had not been processed at that stage.  In my county of Cork, 55% of Cork County Council applications had not been processed.</P>
        <P>Senators &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in <Col N="151"/>and Ryan made reference to different issues.  Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in spoke about registration fee increases in the budget.  His party is in government and he acquiesced to these increases.</P>

	<P>I am not crying.  Senator Buttimer can cry if he wants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>A great number of students depend on grants to remain in college.  Some are unable to cover their fees due to the delay in payments.  We must implement a fast payment method for these students.  I welcome that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills acknowledged in the D&aacute;il that the current system is fragmented.  However, her admission that it was a priority for her at Cabinet tells its own story given that the legislation is not yet enacted.</P>
        <P>Research by the USI indicates that a unified system of payments would bring savings of approximately &euro;5 million per annum.  Grants are the sole source of income for almost 70,000 students.  There is a shortage of part-time employment.  I am labouring the issue of grants because it is important.  Families are coming under pressure because registration fees have increased, accommodation costs have to be met and food has to be purchased.  My office is on Glasheen Road, which is adjacent to UCC, and I regularly meet students.  They need their grants to be paid quickly.  At a time of economic worries, they are doing the best they can to graduate with good degrees or diplomas.  The process must ease their anxieties rather than add to them.  I am concerned that the new system will not be more efficient.  The cut of 4% to the student grant rate represents yet another blow against Irish students.  It means a significant reduction in the money available to students and their families.  Their parents were hit by other taxation measures in the budget and the cost of going to college has increased.  That creates a disincentive for people to go to college.</P>
        <P>We must never prevent people from returning to education in any shape or form.  I was a director of adult education prior to becoming a Senator.  The importance for mature students of returning to education cannot be overemphasised.  If we lose that model, we will be in a poor position at a time when we look to build the smart economy.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, claimed he did great work to promote research and development.  We must make education accessible to people.</P>
        <P>One third of students depend on the student grant.  What does that say about the Government&rsquo;s economic policies?  If we are cutting money here and streamlining there, the grants process must be a catalyst for education.  We have a well earned reputation for third level education and fourth level research and development.  If we are to trade on our reputation as a well educated and skilled workforce, investment in education must be a priority.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the appeals process provided for in the Bill.  The consideration period of 90 days is too long and should be reduced by half.  The Minister proposes a more efficient system that includes much speedier processing of applications.  I do not see why the appeals process should be any different.  A student who is refused a grant in October should not have to wait until Christmas or longer to find out whether he or she will have the necessary support to remain in college.  I know of a student who had difficulty with a grant and had to opt out of UCC this week.  It took from October to January for a decision.</P>
        <P>We must put in place supports which will allow students to remain in college.  The change in the criteria which will mean that mature students will no longer qualify for the non-adjacent rate of the grant is also troubling.  The increase in the qualifying distance between the student&rsquo;s home and college for the non-adjacent rate has also increased from 24 km<Col N="152"/> to 45 km and the change in criteria will ensure another cut in the grant for many students.</P>
        <P>Another new provision is the residency requirement which means an applicant must be resident in this State for three years of the previous five years.  That will exclude many people who have had to leave our shores to find work elsewhere.  When they want to come home, they will find that they are precluded from getting State assistance to enter education.  That is worth addressing.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd put forward different proposals regarding the one-stop-shop payments and entitlements service, which will act as a single point of contact for citizens making claims and which will cut the cost of administration and reduce the waiting time for grant distribution.</P>
        <P>The Bill is welcome as we need a unified grant scheme and to allow access to education to continue.  I note the IVEA&rsquo;s letter of concern regarding the policy and I understand from where it is coming.  The VECs carried out considerable work and were very proficient in what they undertook.  Through their general secretary, they put forward a very comprehensive briefing document which I am sure the Minister of State will consider and refer to in his concluding remarks.</P>
        <P>It is important to acknowledge that we must speed up the grant payment.  We cannot allow students to live in poverty and allow people to drop out of college because that is what is happening in some cases.  The Minister will note that the student representative bodies have welcomed the single agency to deal with grants and the appeals board.  However, the timeframe for the appeals board must be tightened.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to welcome the Bill and, if we can, amend it in order to improve it.  It is also incumbent on all of us to ensure that those people attend third level colleges to which access is open to all and that investment in education is not diluted further.  If we continue to erode third level education, we are not planning for the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At a time when we are experiencing an economic crisis, we must look forward and sow the seeds of recovery.  The seeds of that recovery can be sown through our graduates who are currently located in the four corners of the world.  There is a duty on us as legislators and on the Minister to try to entice them back.  I am a former teacher and meet pupils who want to come home but there are no opportunities here for them currently and that must change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and compliment the Government, in particular the Minister for Education and Skills, on grasping this nettle.  This Bill has been under consideration for a number of years and it has taken some time to produce but at least we have some finality in terms of a decision as to how best we formalise a new policy and a new structure to deal with higher education grants.</P>
        <P>This Bill is about a unified grant system and it introduces a single national grant awarding body.  The idea is that we try to deal with the time element in terms of the processing of applications, simplifying the application form, issuing the application form to provide enough time to tease it out and make a decision so students have a decision by the middle of August and not September, because many colleges start in early September.  All that should be done in time to allow people to appeal a decision.</P>
        <P>There is much teasing out to be done in terms of implementation.  We must first get the structure right and then ensure we have the personnel to implement it at different stages.  It is a great concept but its implementation has been referred to by other Senators.  It is good that those on courses currently will continue under the old system in the transition period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister will play a role in regard to the institutions in the State to which grants will apply.  They apply to the North of Ireland and perhaps they will apply to some o<Col N="153"/>f the educational institutions in EU member states.  I have no difficulty with that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A plethora of courses is coming on stream in third level colleges.  Some of them are Mickey Mouse courses but others are very good new courses.  They reflect modern thinking and last for a few years but then go out of fashion.  It is important the Minister has a say in terms of the courses people in receipt of grants do.  What qualifications will people receive?  Will they lead to postgraduate courses, if necessary?  Are the qualifications acknowledged internationally or do they apply only in this country?  Given the number of courses coming on stream, it is a very important role when giving grants to students.</P>
        <P>We have heard of colleges mushrooming and of courses folding before completion.  I worry about that.  We should narrow the range of courses somewhat.  We have too many courses for the size of our country and we should streamline them.  People should get a primary degree first and then do modules to complement their primary degree rather than do a course on a very particular subject which really only should be a module and not a degree course.  If we are to give grants, let them be for structured and well teased out courses.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the fact the Minister will have a say in vetting courses, how they are run and the qualifications concerned.  Periodically, someone will drop in without notice and examine the courses for which grants have been given to students to ensure they are as they should be and that taxpayers&rsquo; money is acknowledged.</P>
        <P>I worry about the eligibility criteria for students applying for these grants.  Most of these students will be leaving second level so there will be no difficulty with them.  It would be an idea for career guidance teachers to have to hand this information which has been convoluted during the years.  I often had to ring VECs or the Department to establish who could qualify for grants.  The application form should be simple and the information provided at leaving certificate stage.  I accept that could be done without any bother.</P>
        <P>The residence requirement is a big issue.  If a person living in Sligo got married in Dublin, there was confusion when that person became a mature student.  Should he or she apply from his or her home in Sligo or from his or her present address?  These are issues I have confronted as an educationist and also in my role as a public representative.</P>
        <P>There is a major issue with mature students.  A person may return after spending two or three years in Australia.  He or she may not have applied for a grant since completing the leaving certificate and may decide to go to college.  I understand such persons need to be here for six months before applying for a grant for the following year.  I know of a 23-year old who had never applied for a grant, went to Australia and returned three or four months before the start of the academic year.  When he applied for a grant, he was refused because he should have been back in the country for some length of time beforehand.  Many young people will go away after completing the leaving certificate.  They may not know what they want to do and having spent two or three years away decide they want to come back and go to college.  When they apply for a grant, they discover they cannot qualify for it.  That would be fine if they simply did not qualify for that year, but it transpired that the person to whom I referred could not get a grant for the second or third year.  Am I right in my thinking?  I believe there was such an anomaly and would like to see the matter cleared up once and for all as part of this Bill.  It is not a problem if students need to return six months beforehand or if they are required to submit their forms by October or some other deadline.  These are matters that need to be teased out.  That issue is very important to me because I came across a genuine student who could not qualify for a grant for his second or third year in college and missed out totally.  I have scanned through the Bill and while it may be addressed, I have not spotted it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I could stay here talking about this issue for a long time.  I would like to have the matter clarified further.  If it is three years of the previous five, there is a lot to be teased out.  I am not grasping it as the Minister of State says it and it may need to be teased out further.</P>
        <P>It is great that we are starting this process to modernise the grants scheme.  I worked in one of the VECs for many years, was a member of another VEC for many years and know how the system works.  The VECs are to be complimented on the work they have done but the process became convoluted because of the increase in the number of students.  While I believe in the unified system, if we farm out the system we are introducing, to what people will it be farmed out?  Will they be educationists and understand the process?</P>
        <P>While I welcome the appeals system, I would like it to be spelled out more.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to further discussion on Committee Stage.  It is worthwhile, but considerable further teasing out is required.  Implementation is the most important part and should be done before 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a joy to speak after Senator Ormonde, particularly on a topic such as this on which she is so much in charge.  She knows what she is talking about and speaks with great enthusiasm.  I would happily forgo my time to hear her speak.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>During the good years in the economy I often found myself at retail functions throughout the world and as soon as people heard I was from Ireland, I was asked how we had succeeded in building such a strong economy.  I had a list of five or six items, of which the first was always that we had continued to invest in education, even during the tough times.  Even in these tough times we need to continue to invest in education.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the new system to replace the one that has been in place since the 1960s.  While the streamlining of the system will bring benefit to students, I am worried about the additional staffing and resources which will be required to introduce the unified grants scheme, especially given the pressures on the public finances.  I ask the Minister of State to elaborate on whether there are enough staff available to administer the grants scheme.  If not, surely we are back to square one.</P>
        <P>I welcome the creation of an independent appeals body, but I am somewhat concerned about the length of time to deal with appeals.  Surely a waiting time of 45 days is too long, especially for a student starting university.  Could we reduce the red tape and cut this figure to approximately two weeks?</P>
        <P>I believe section 8 of the Bill does not include private colleges as being eligible to participate in the grants scheme.  Should we not consider the student rather than the college when administering the scheme?  I realise that not all educational institutions can be eligible, but some may see this as a form of discrimination.</P>
        <P>The increase in online education courses will also need to be taken into account, if not in this Bill, in the near future.  The question as to whether grants can be given to those doing an online course needs to be asked as this seems to the way of the future.  It could be said oral, video and interactive delivery represent a natural extension of the tra<Col N="155"/>ditional textbook and it is becoming more prevalent.  Who would have thought some of the best universities in the world such as Georgetown in the United States would now be offering a multitude of online courses?  In addition, there is the renaissance of the Open University in Britain which started to make lectures available to download from iTunes in 2008.  More than 30 million items have been downloaded since.</P>
        <P>Increasing numbers of undergraduates will likely choose to save money by living at home while they study, allowing part-time students to earn some money to ease their financial burden when not studying.  Is there not a benefit in studying and working at the same time, allowing students to apply theoretical knowledge to solve real-life problems?  I believe part-time students are not covered in the Bill.  However, I welcome the provision to allow certain part-time courses to be included in the student grants scheme in the future, of course subject to resources.</P>
        <P>There may also be cost savings in the case of online education.  Hibernia College, the private teacher training college, has been providing online courses for a number of years.  In the past ten years it has trained approximately 4,000 primary teachers through its online postgraduate programme who have not cost the State one cent.  This compares with an annual &euro;40 million price tag for the running of St. Patrick&rsquo;s College and Mary Immaculate College.  Surely we should be looking to provide more support for such private colleges.  The University of Phoenix, the largest private education provider in the United States, increased enrolments from 384,000 to 455,000 in just one year.  This has been done without any increase in the number of buildings.  It is able to use electronic means of communicating and lecturing, a subject on which we should have a debate.  Last year I was asked to address via television link at NUI Galway a group of commerce students in six countries, including Russia, United States and France.  They were able to ask me questions and I was able to answer them.  Technology can be used in so many ways nowadays.</P>
        <P>Perhaps employers should get more of a say on what they might consider as desirable attributes instead of completely relying on the academic scene.  This is not to say there should not be education for education&rsquo;s sake &mdash; Cardinal Newman had strong views on that.  If higher education was purely driven by businesses, they would fail to understand how philosophy graduates such as President Barack Obama and Mr. George Soros could earn a living.  However, business and education can work in tandem.</P>
        <P>I have also mentioned previously how there is a &euro;4 billion export opportunity for Ireland in terms of attracting foreign students here to study.  Just look at the success of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, which has 3,500 students, 70% of whom are non-Irish.  The students create jobs, for instance, the College of Surgeons in Ireland has approximately 800 staff, and it is estimated each student spends about &euro;8,000 locally per year.  As an English-speaking country, we should be able to ramp up our efforts to attract many more such students here.</P>
        <P>Perhaps less often mentioned is the licensing of our education services abroad or the exporting of them through on-line means.  In Doha, the capital of Qatar, for instance, there are branches of campuses of a number of universities from the United States, including Cornell, Georgetown and Texas A&amp;M.  The Sorbonne in Paris has set up a campus in Abu Dhabi.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, long open to foreign students, has set up branches in Malaysia, Bahrain and Dubai.  There is much potential and there is much more that other Irish institutions such as UCD, Trinity College or renowned second level or third level schools could do.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well with the Bill which reduces bureaucracy and, hopefully, will reduce waiting time for students.  I hope there will be no further delay, especially as students, like so many, are facing financial difficulties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are other steps that can be taken in education.  Returning to second level schools, the three months&rsquo; holiday is unsustainable.  It c<Col N="156"/>ame about when students were needed on farms 50, 60 or 100 years ago.  It will not be easy to address, but it really does not make sense.  In Japan, students in second level education get 16 days holidays a year.  I am sure this will not be popular with teachers, who I am aware vote in the university panel in the Seanad, but there is little doubt that we can learn a great deal.  There is much we can do.  In Germany, for instance, second level schools finish at 1.30 p.m., but I note the effort that goes in afterwards into mathematics and languages, some of the areas where we really are quite poor.  We must find some way of encouraging and developing our students, for instance, making it fun to learn mathematics and languages.  There are new methods of teaching language.</P>
        <P>When I visited a school recently it was interesting to ask the young women there what they intended to do.  The teachers told me 90% of the young women there wanted to be hairdressers or opt for some other such scheme.  They were not looking, as those in other countries do, at being able to develop and lift themselves up into new and better opportunities.  If we are going to invest in the future, we really must encourage young people to invest their time, energies and brains in being able to concentrate particularly on languages, mathematics and science.  If we do that, we will find a way through so that when people in years to come will ask how Ireland succeeded, we will give the same answer as I have been giving for the past 15 years, that there were a number of reasons, the first of which was that we continued to invest in education.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister on this step.  I believe it is the correct direction.  Let us ensure it happens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their valuable contribution to this debate.  My overwhelming sense is one of support for this legislation based on a common goal to reform the student grants system.  While we are thankful for the service that has been provided to students and parents by the existing grant awarding authorities in the past, we are now concerned with and must look forward to the future.</P>
        <P>As demand for student grants continues to grow in the current economic climate, the quality of the service that is needed for the organisation and operation of student grants must improve dramatically to make it accessible, transparent and, most importantly, timely in its response to providing funding to those who otherwise might not be able to avail of further or higher education.  In the next 20 years, the demographics show that we can expect a 50% increase in our first-year student intake at third level and the impact of this on our student grant system demands that we have a structure in place which is capable of absorbing the inevitable pressures this surge in student numbers will bring.</P>
        <P>Simply put, our student grant administration system must change and be fit for purpose if we are not to ignore the plight of students who currently must negotiate a range of different student grant schemes and in many cases wait an unacceptable length of time to have their applications assessed and paid.  In this regard, both the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Education and Skills fully accept that the delays in processing the student grants mentioned in the debate is not acceptable and this legislation is being enacted to tackle this issue head-on.</P>
        <P>Concerns were raised here last week at the length of time that it has taken to bring this legislation to fruition.  It is realised that progress on the Bill can appear to have been slow but this was unavoidable for a number of reasons, including the need for additional research on the legal implications for the provisions allowing the Minister to make decisions regarding the approval of institutions and courses for the purposes of the student grant schemes and a Government decision to establish a single grant awarding authority in line with the transforming public services agenda.  Senator Ryan<Col N="157"/> recognised the reasons for this delay.  Each of these developments required significant legal input and subsequent amendments to the Bill.  Because of the importance of this legislation, the emphasis at all times has been on getting it right.</P>
        <P>The legislation provides us with the opportunity to overhaul fundamentally the student grants system by enhancing its capacity and responsiveness to the demands being made on it, not only from a changed economic environment but also in the face of dramatically increasing student numbers and the need for it to play its role satisfactorily, both in promoting participation in higher and further education and in providing quality third level education.</P>
        <P>It is the intention, with the Senators&rsquo; help, that this legislation will be enacted in the current Oireachtas session.</P>
        <P>By selecting a single grant awarding authority and providing it with the power, where appropriate, to outsource some of its functions, we will ensure a fully equipped and robust body based on a strong legislative footing.  By consolidating the four existing grant schemes into one, we will eliminate confusion for students when it comes to applying for a grant.  By clearly and unambiguously setting out the details and regulations on a wide range of issues, including the application for and awarding of grants, the responsibilities of students and their parents and spouses, the conditions for grant eligibility and the residency and nationality requirements, we will ensure consistency of approach in dealing with grant applications.  By the use of service level agreements with the single awarding authority, we will ensure a continuum of high quality customer service to students and their parents and the application of the terms of the schemes equitably and efficiently throughout the system.  By establishing an independent appeals board, we will ensure that objectivity applies in the determination of a grant application appeal.  By strengthening the processes on fraudulent claims, which will be policed by the single grant awarding authority, we protect the taxpayer and safeguard funds so they can be targeted at those most in need.  By requiring the preparation and implementation of access plans and equality policies in approved institutions, we underpin Government policies to increase access to further and higher education.  By including an enabling provision to include part-time courses in the student grant schemes when resources permit, we recognise the changes in the methods of delivery of higher education over the years.  I look forward to the real improvement in service that these developments will facilitate, most of all the improvement in the quality of the student experience when dealing with the grant administration process.</P>
        <P>I welcome the support for the independent appeals process in particular.  This has been a feature as the Bill passed through the various stages of the legislative process.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The timeframe set out in the Bill for appeals is the maximum.  It is envisaged the majority of appeals will be considered in a much shorter timeframe and the service level agreements with the single awarding authority to which I have referred and the procedures to be set down for the independent appeals board will reflect this.  On Report and Final Stages in the D&aacute;il the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills agreed to reduce the timeframe in which the independent appeals board will deal with appeals from 90 days to 60.  This is the maximum timeframe which takes cognisance of the fact that there will be cases in which complex matters may need to be considered and consultation may be required with other parties, including State agencies, to reach a conclusion.  Senators will find that much of the latitude provided is to allow a student more time to appeal, if necessary, rather than facilitating the response of the awarding authority or the independent appeals board.  The independent appeals board will be introduced during the transitional period in line with the provisions contained in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Three other issues arose here last week, the first of which relates to when resources might be available to<Col N="158"/> include part-time courses in the student grant schemes.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to predict when this might happen at this time.  We know the number of full-time students eligible for grants is increasing significantly and this is likely to be the case for the foreseeable future.  We realise the modes of delivery of higher education courses are constantly changing and the student grant schemes must reflect this.  Whereas we are not in a position to include part-time courses, I hope Senators will agree it was important to include an enabling clause in the legislation to facilitate movement on this front when we are in a position to do so.</P>
        <P>The second issue which arose last week had to do with whether the new online application facility would ensure more accurate grant applications would be submitted.  As Senators probably know, incomplete or inaccurate applications are a major contributor to delays in processing grant applications.  I am pleased to inform Senators that the new online facility is intelligent and responsive to the inputted information.  It is not possible to leave blank mandatory fields and students are prompted to provide information specific to their personal circumstances.  In addition, it automatically generates an e-mail to a student outlining the supporting documentation required for the application.  This is student-specific and based on the information provided by the applicant.</P>
        <P>The third issue which arose was the possibility of including funding to meet additional course costs such as equipment in the student grant schemes.  Given the level of demand on the student grant budget, this will not be possible.  Student grants are not intended to meet all of the costs of going to college but are intended to contribute to meeting the costs incurred.  In the current economic climate, if we were to add funding in one area, it would have to be saved in another, meaning another cohort of students might suffer.  On the other hand, costs incurred such as those for compulsory field trips are covered under the grant schemes.  In the interests of fairness, the allocations made are deemed to be the fairest.</P>
        <P>The possible involvement of students on the independent appeals board has been raised at various times throughout the legislative process.  There is nothing in the legislation to preclude this, but the appeals board is not a representative body and it would not be appropriate for any of its members to participate on an advocacy basis.  Its membership, appointed by the Minister, will be on the basis of expertise in education and other relevant fields such as accountancy.  Senators will appreciate that the board must be entirely objective if it is to have credibility.  I do not wish to imply that students would not be objective, but Members will appreciate that I must ensure from the outset that no question marks will hang over the board&rsquo;s independence.</P>
        <P>I am pleased we have commenced the reform of the administration of the grants system by issuing invitations for expressions of interest in the establishment of the single grant awarding authority and by appointing an evaluation panel.  I am also pleased that work is commencing on the consolidation of the four existing grant schemes by way of regulation.  I hope Senators accept this as a sincere expression of commitment on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills and Department to deliver on this legislation for students and parents in the fastest possible timeframe.  As the T&aacute;naiste stated last week, the intention is to have the unified grants scheme in operation for the forthcoming academic year 2011-12.  This will place the terms and conditions of the grant schemes on a legislative footing, including all of the eligibility conditions relating to nationality, residency, means and previous academic attainment.  It will also include the eligibility requirements for various categories of student such as independent students, to whom Senator Healy Eames alluded last week.  However, any changes to the definition of &ldquo;independent student&rdquo; will require cost implications to be taken into account and whether the cost can be borne in the current climate.  The Senator also referred to continuing eligibility for student grants where a student discontinued <Col N="159"/>one course and started another.  Again, there would be cost implications in this regard which would have to be considered before any changes could be made to the current structure.</P>
        <P>The intention is that the single grant awarding authority will come into operation on a transitional basis for the 2012-13 academic year.  The question was posed last week as to why the authority could not commence operations sooner, but Senators will understand the legislation was originally drafted to allow for the grant administration function to be carried out by 33 vocational education committees.  In line with the transformation of public services agenda, a Government decision was taken to develop a single grant awarding authority and until the legislation was sufficiently advanced, it was not possible to move on setting up the authority.  There is now a process to be followed which involves inviting expressions of interest, evaluating these expressions, fleshing out proposals, where necessary, and verifying that any preferred proposals are fully viable.</P>
        <P>Essentially, by the time the new single authority is selected, there will only be one year to put in place the necessary structures and resources to do this properly.  Given the importance of the grant administration function, it is vital that the single body immediately offer an uninterrupted and effective service to students.  Therefore, the new single authority will commence by accepting new applications in 2012, with current students staying with existing grant awarding bodies.  This will allow a three to four year run-in period for the single authority.  We are aware there were severe problems in other jurisdictions when there was an attempt to do too much too soon.  Taking this on board, it is considered prudent to introduce and bed down the unified grants scheme in order that the single grant awarding authority can hit the road running with the scheme.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames asked what criteria would be used in deciding on the single awarding authority.  Proposals from public bodies interested in operating the single grant awarding authority are expected to address customer service improvements, efficiency, use of technology, organisational capacity, potential for outsourcing and overall cost.  Additionally, some of the principal challenges that must be addressed in proposals include the centralisation of a service currently provided by 66 grant awarding authorities, dealing with high volumes of inexperienced customers, interpreting and explaining grant schemes governed by complex regulations, development of new ICT and business processes, having new staff working with largely new management and cyclical work with relatively brief but high volume processing periods.</P>
        <P>It has been made known to prospective applicants that the anticipated outcomes are timely processing and assessment of grant applications, decisions within a guaranteed timeframe where complete applications are submitted by the closing date, consistency in the application of scheme requirements, more streamlined and transparent processes, increased automation of service delivery from online application through to payments by electronic fund transfer, consistent and timely payments to both students and institutions, the availability of adequate information and support for students, improved management and financial information for the Government, significant gains in efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the grant administration function.  Overall, there should be a greatly enhanced service for students.</P>
        <P>Other issues were raised today by Senators Norris, Buttimer and others, including the concerns of VECs.  The Department of Education and Skills is in ongoing discussions with the Irish Vocational Educational Association on its list of concerns.  The matter will be discussed at a meeting with association representatives next week when its concerns will be addressed further.</P>
        <P>Senators asked about the position of private and for-profit colleges, Griffith College was mentioned in particular.  The institutions recognised under the Bill are generally publicly funded third level colleges offering full-time courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level.</P>
        <P>The Department provides significant funding to the institutions in question.  These fu<Col N="160"/>nds are used to provide a broad range of courses which are required by society and not only to meet the economic needs of the country.  The institutions in question operate for the greater good of the country and act in the best interests of the development of human capital in the State.</P>
        <P>Private commercial colleges generally operate on a for-profit basis and the State does not have any say in directing their operations.  By their nature, they only provide courses where there is a demand and their only objectives are to remain commercially viable and make as much profit as possible.  If private colleges were to be approved under the student grants scheme, the Department would be liable to cover not only the costs of a maintenance grant and student services charge but also the cost of tuition fees, which constitute a support to the college rather than student.  This would result in the State effectively contributing towards the operating costs of a private, for-profit college.</P>
        <P>Taking together the factors I have outlined, the Government has formed the view that there are compelling reasons for not admitting for-profit colleges to the student grant scheme.  For this reason, it is not proposed to depart from the policy of extending the scope of the student grant scheme to private colleges operated on a for-profit basis.  This position is reflected in section 7, although the section does not preclude such colleges from being approved and makes provision for the Minister to prescribe an educational institution as being an approved institution subject to certain conditions.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris also raised the issue of university status recognition for Waterford Institute of Technology.  The issue of the status of other institutes of technology can be addressed in the context of the Senator&rsquo;s query.  In line with the recommendation of the higher education strategy, there is no requirement for further traditional universities under the Universities Act 1997 and the Government has decided that no applications under section 9 of the Act will be approved.</P>
        <P>An alternative pathway of evolution for institutes of technology is outlined in the report, allowing for potential amalgamation on a regional basis and redesignation as technological universities which would operate under a separate legislative framework.  International expertise has been commissioned in developing detailed performance criteria for redesignation, which will be published at an early stage.  Any future redesignation will follow a two stage process as set out in the report.  This will include an assessment of wider system implications of any application and a second stage review by international experts focused on the amalgamated institutes&rsquo; performance, quality and standards.</P>
        <P>I am greatly encouraged by the enthusiasm of the stakeholders for the proposed programme of change and their co-operation in bringing it forward.  The Department looks forward to continuing to work with them to maximise improvements in customer service and deliver an efficient and cost-effective system of grant administration.  As we move towards the final stages of this legislation, I look forward to the Seanad&rsquo;s support for the Bill.  I thank Senators and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to bring the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2010 before Seanad &Eacute;ireann and look forward to an informed and constructive debate during its passage through this House.</P>
        <P>Greyhound racing is a very important industry which is responsible for sustaining 11,000 full-time and part-time jobs, both directly and indirectly, principally in rural communities.  It provides an estimated &euro;500 million for local economies around the tracks which are spread throughout the country.  The greyhound breeding industry is also successful with a large percentage of greyhounds now running in Britain being Irish bred.  Greyhound racing also attracts a significant number of continental European visitors to Ireland.</P>
        <P>Following enactment of the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, it was agreed to introduce separate legislation to regulate the greyhound industry to provide a regime for greyhound welfare.  The policy objective is to optimise the level of animal welfare in the greyhound industry.  While the objective is similar to that of the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, the approach taken differs owing to the distinct nature of and controls applying to the keeping of greyhounds.</P>
        <P>Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club agreed with the need for legislation to regulate all aspects of welfare throughout the greyhound industry and thus protect this country&rsquo;s reputation in respect of care of greyhounds.  Preparation of the Bill has involved wide-ranging consultation with a variety of interested parties, including Government Departments, Bord na gCon, the Irish Coursing Club, voluntary bodies and animal welfare groups, especially those concerned with the welfare of dogs.  I thank all those who participated in the consultation process and acknowledge their constructive input.  I am satisfied we have struck an adequate balance which accommodates various points of view.</P>
        <P>The Irish Coursing Club identifies and registers greyhounds individually in the stud book so as to ensure the integrity of the racing system.  Furthermore, the industry already has a system of self-regulation in place which can be readily adapted for welfare purposes and which the Bill uses as a starting point.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of the Bill, greyhounds are defined as all greyhounds entered in the Irish greyhound stud book and they will be covered by the welfare provisions of this legislation.  The welfare requirements specified in the Bill on animal keepers to safeguard animals in their care are in addition to the general provisions relating to cruelty in the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965.  While greyhounds that are not registered in the stud book cannot be covered by the scope of the Bill, they will continue to be covered by general animal welfare legislation and the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, where relevant.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding that the provisions the Bill apply to all greyhounds in the stud book, I saw merit in establishing a register of greyhound breeding establishments.  These are premises at which not less than four greyhound bitches are kept, each of which is more than 15 months old and has been or is being used for breedin<Col N="162"/>g.  I make clear, however, that the scope of this Bill extends to all greyhounds in the racing and coursing industry, not only those found on a premises that is registered as a greyhound breeding establishment under the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, on the other hand, provides for a hitherto unregulated industry, namely, puppy farming, with no existing system either in relation to the registration of individual dogs for stud book purposes or the registration of premises on which they are kept.  The welfare provisions of the Act apply to dogs on premises registered under that Act.</P>
        <P>Senators will be aware that there is a variety of opinion on any issue involving animal welfare, in particular the welfare of dogs.  In the case of greyhounds, however, there are fewer problems involved than in the business known as puppy farming.  While puppy farmers and greyhound breeders are both engaged in breeding activity as a commercial activity, greyhound breeders strive to breed high quality greyhounds to win races and, therefore, in greyhound breeding, quality rather than quantity is paramount.  I am confident the provisions for the welfare of greyhounds in this Bill and the extensive powers given to welfare officers will result in a very high standard of welfare for greyhounds.</P>
        <P>I will set out my overall approach to the issue of greyhound welfare and outline the points of similarity and difference with the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010.  Stewards of the Irish Coursing Club visit all greyhound breeding premises to register and identify all new litters to ensure the integrity of racing.  This Bill provides a legislative basis for them to deal with all aspect of welfare on such visits.</P>
        <P>A crucial aspect of this Bill is that a greyhound bitch will not be allowed to breed until she is 15 months of age, compared with a stipulation of six months in the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, and a limit will be placed on the number of litters a bitch can produce.  The Bill also provides for inspection of premises registered under it as greyhound breeding establishments.  Local authorities may appoint welfare officers who are given the same level of powers as stewards of the Irish Coursing Club and I envisage close liaison between personnel from the Irish Coursing Club and the local authorities.  The Bill will form the basis of a co-operative relationship between local authorities, Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
        <P>The legislation requires reports of inspections or details of welfare notices to be notified to the Irish Coursing Club, Bord na gCon and the relevant local authority.  This Bill grants a wide range of powers to welfare officers and allows them to specify various items in welfare notices.  These provisions will not present any difficulty to individuals who take due cognisance of welfare requirements and who have proper premises and operate their business in co-operation with their local veterinary practice.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides a period of up to three months from the commencement of the Act for greyhound breeding establishments to be registered.  It will be lawful for an existing dog breeding establishment to continue to operate for this period.  This will enable a smooth transition to full registration of greyhound breeding establishments.  In line with best practice in any regulatory regime, there is an appropriate scale of regulatory actions that can be taken to ensure compliance.  I have provided for some offences for which fines and custodial sentences are possible upon summary conviction and for other lesser offences, mainly concerning records or registration, for which only fines or in some cases fixed penalty notices apply.</P>
        <P>A provision is necessary to require owners of establishments to co-operate within reason.  There is general need for such a provision and it is especially important in cases where an establishment operates from the private home of the owner.  The Bill provides, in circumstances where consent of the occupier to <Col N="163"/>enter a dwelling is not forthcoming, for the authorised person to apply to the District Court for a warrant to enter.</P>
        <P>I wish to summarise some of the principal provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 contains the usual provisions of a general nature dealing with such matters as Short Title and commencement, definitions, service of notifications, notices and documents, expenses of the Minister and the making of regulations.  The key definition is that of a &ldquo;greyhound breeding establishment&rdquo; which means:</P>
        <P LI="1">a premises used, in whole or in part, for breeding greyhounds at which not less than 4 greyhound bitches are kept, each of which&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) is more than 15 months old, and</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) has been or is being used for breeding purposes,</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left" LI="1">but does not include a premises at which not less than 6 bitches (other than greyhound bitches), each of which is more than 6 months old and is capable of being used for breeding purposes, are also kept[.]</P>
        <P>The age limit of 15 months specified in this Bill for a greyhound bitch to be bred is much higher than the six months stipulated in the Dog Breeding Establishments Act.  These provisions have been the subject of intensive, constructive debate and have the support of the Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
        <P>Part 2, which deals with welfare generally, requires the publication of codes of practice for welfare with the consent of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and provides for the welfare standards for greyhounds in terms of accommodation, food and drink, exercise, health and safety.  It is important to note that this section applies to all greyhounds whether they are on the premises of a registered breeding establishment or not.  That is an important difference between this Bill and the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, which applies to dogs on registered premises only.  This Bill is building on an existing and effective regulatory system and will underpin the welfare of all registered greyhounds.</P>
        <P>In terms of the identification of greyhounds, I have allowed for both the traditional tattooing method and microchipping.  Greyhounds are individually identified by tattooing for registration in the studbook maintained by the Irish Coursing Club as this is vital for the integrity of industry.  As tattooing has a long-standing tradition, it is not necessary to require breeders to change their methodology at this stage.  The important thing is that every greyhound pup is uniquely identified and this is verified by a DNA analysis programme.  In contrast, the Dog Breeding Establishments Act deals with a sector where individual pups in the dog breeding establishments concerned have hitherto not been required to be identified by any method.  In that situation, microchipping was considered to be the appropriate method of identification to be used.</P>
        <P>Part 3 concerns greyhound breeding and the registration of greyhound breeding establishments and prescribes that a greyhound bitch cannot be mated under 15 months of age.  This is considerably higher than the minimum breeding age of six months specified in the Dog Breeding Establishments Act.  This section also restricts to six the number of litters a greyhound bitch can produce, as there are welfare concerns with greyhounds carrying excessive numbers of litters.  A further two litters may be permitted under veterinary certification.</P>
        <P>Section 12 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a register of greyhound breeding establishments.  These are premises with four or more greyhound bitches over 15 months of age that have been or are being used for breeding.  This is lower than the number of breeding bitches specified in the Dog Breeding Establishments Act which stipulates that premises with six or more breeding bitches must be registered.  It will be an offence to operate an unregistered greyhound breeding establishment except during the lead-in period of three months or where an application for registration as a registered breed<Col N="164"/>ing establishment is being considered by the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
        <P>Part 4 concerns enforcement and allows for the appointment of welfare officers and gives these officers powers of inspection and issuing welfare notices.  Welfare officers may be appointed by local authorities, Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club to act as welfare officers under the Bill.  The functions of welfare officers are also set out in the Bill and include the power at reasonable times to enter and inspect premises where the officer has reasonable grounds for believing that greyhounds are kept.  The Bill also provides that the welfare officer may be accompanied by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Welfare notices can be issued where a welfare officer is of the opinion that there is a contravention of the Act, or where a premises or vehicle poses, or is likely to pose, a threat to a greyhound&rsquo;s health or welfare.  These notices must state the grounds on which the officer forms the opinion.  Such notices may require a wide range of actions in the interests of the welfare of greyhounds.  Examples include requiring veterinary advice or treatment, and the provision of food and drink of specified quantities at specified intervals.  The notice can specify the numbers of greyhounds that may be kept in a particular accommodation.  The notice can also require, upon advice of a veterinarian, the cessation of breeding or that a greyhound be disposed of or destroyed in a specified manner.</P>
        <P>Section 23 allows for, following veterinary examination, the immediate veterinary treatment or humane destruction of a greyhound which is in pain, distress or an acute state of neglect.  Obviously it is regrettable but necessary to provide for this but I hope it is a power most welfare officers will never be called upon to implement.  The cost of doing so can be recovered from the owner of the greyhound as a simple contract debt in court.</P>
        <P>There are provisions dealing with penalties and proceedings and cases can be taken under the Act by Bord na gCon, the Irish Coursing Club, the local authority or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Fines shall be paid to the relevant body taking the case.  I look forward to engaging on these provisions in detail on Committee Stage and I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that the Minister must leave the House to deal with important business.  I thank the Minister for introducing this important legislation.  It follows on from the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2010, which was widely debated in this House and on consideration of which considerable time was spent with contributions from Senators on all sides.  At the start of the debate on the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill there was political consensus that something needed to be done in this area and Fine Gael had called for many years for the terrible practices in puppy farming to be addressed.  That Bill addressed that specific area.  That strong legislation put in place provisions to protect the breeding and rearing of puppies in puppy farm establishments and ensure there is no cruelty or poor practices of breeding in such establishments.</P>
        <P>During the debate on that Bill, I as spokesperson on this area identified, as did Fine Gael, that the greyhound industry was being included in that legislation, even though it was already covered under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958.  It was pointed out to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, that it would be more appropriate for greyhound breeding establishments to be legislated for and covered under the 1958 Act.  Without being too political, I advise that it was pointed out clearly that this Act was the legislation under which greyhound breeding should be regulated and properly managed.  Unfortunately, the Minister did not listen at that time despite protestations from the greyhound industry, including Bord na gCon, the Irish Coursing Club and the greyhound breeding industry, which are all proactive in this area of animal welfare and which think very highly of the greyhounds and the racing animals they breed and train.  It would have saved the Government considerable hardship and problems if the Minister had listened to the Fine Gael argument made in the Seanad at that time.  It is only when that Bill went to the D&aacute;il that the thrust of the Fine Gael amendm<Col N="165"/>ents were taken on board and proper consultation took place with the stakeholders in the greyhound industry.  I welcome that and I am glad it happened, but I am strongly of the view that it would have happened much sooner if the Minister and his officials had listened to those Senators who strongly and reasonably argued that this is what should have happened.</P>
        <P>That is the context and background to this legislation.  Fine Gael broadly welcomes the legislation, as presented, because the Government, the Minister and the officials engaged properly with the stakeholders, which is all we sought at that time.  The thrust of many of our amendments went some way towards addressing the concerns within the industry.</P>
        <P>I need not go into how much the greyhound industry is worth to Ireland.  It is an indigenous industry that is recognised worldwide for the champion breeding of greyhounds that are utilised not only here but in the UK and much further afield.  It is important we protect the good name and reputation of the Irish greyhound industry.  This legislation will go some way towards enhancing that reputation.  It will ensure the breeding of these champions,  many of which have been breed in our greyhound industry and hopefully will continue to be bred, is carried out in a proper and responsible way.  I am not saying that was not being done already but this legislation gives statutory strength to authorities such as Bord na gCon, the Irish Coursing Club and local authorities to ensure the establishments are run well and to a high standard.</P>
        <P>As in the case of other legislation, it is important to engage properly with the stakeholders who are directly affected by legislation that comes before either House of the Oireachtas.  The time that has elapsed between the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill and this Bill has given the relevant authorities, officials and stakeholders time to engage properly and come to an agreement on how best the system of management and breeding of greyhounds can be practised.  It will result in a better and enhanced system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The main provision of this Bill, which amends and strengthens the 1958 Act, is the new code of practice for the industry.  There is work to be done by the Department, the officials, Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club to make sure their members and those people whose livelihoods are based on breeding greyhounds are fully aware of the implications of this legislation and of their responsibilities in this area.  I am sure many people who breed greyhounds already implement good practice and high standards in how they look after their breeding bitches and puppy litters.  It is in their interests to ensure they have a high standard because the better the standard of litters, dogs, bitches and racing greyhounds they produce, the more that will benefit the businesses they operate and the reputation of the Irish greyhound industry.</P>
        <P>I welcome the broadening of the appointment of the inspection regime to welfare officers not only from local authorities and NGOs but also to officers of the Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club.  They all will have inspection powers and the power to issue welfare notices.  Nobody knows better than the officials of the Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club who are actively breeding greyhounds and where they are being bred.  It is important that the legislation included these agencies in terms of the appointment of welfare officers.  They have their hand on the pulse and are best placed to engage with the people who will be affected by this regulation.  That is an important inclusion in this amending legislation.</P>
        <P>I welcome that the age limit of qualifying breeding bitches has been increased from the previously proposed age of six months, which was the definition of a breeding bitch in the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill, to the more practical and logical age of 15 months.  That was another practical amendment Fine Gael proposed to the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill, thereby bringing to the attention of the Minister and his officials that it is rare, if ever, that greyhounds will be bred at six months of age and questioning why that age limit would be included in the legislation which would only add to the confusion.  We welcome the fact the age limit has been increased.</P>
        <P>There are many other provisions in the Bill as regards restrictions on the number of litters a bitch can produce.  We argued there should be flexibility on this up to a certain number of litters.  If th<Col N="166"/>ere were additional litters to be bred, that should be considered under veterinary supervision and certification.  In other words, Fine Gael argued that no bitch should be allowed breed extra litters &mdash; I believe it was above six litters at the time &mdash; unless there was certification that the breeding bitch was healthy and able enough to go on breeding.  The reason behind that argument was that if successful breeding bitches that were breeding champions were breeding up to a certain number of litters and if their breeding was restricted unnecessarily without veterinary certification, we and the people in the greyhound industry were fearful that those breeding bitches would literally be transported to another jurisdiction and would continue to breed in that jurisdiction, whether the UK or elsewhere.  That provision did not improve the welfare of bitches; the impact of it was to move the issue elsewhere and over time Ireland could have lost many of its champion breeding bitches and, by extension, much of its excellent reputation for breeding champion greyhounds.  There is still a restriction on the number of litters that can be produced, but there is a degree of flexibility allowed in this Bill whereby, under veterinary inspection and certification, additional litters can be produced.  I welcome that flexibility.</P>
        <P>Overall, Fine Gael is supportive of the Bill.  It is a much more reasoned and practical approach than pertained previously and involves the stakeholders of the greyhound industry in the regulatory regime that will be implemented.  That is so important that it can never be underestimated.  All stakeholders who are affected by legislation should be brought along as far as possible in a consultative manner.  It is only at this stage that is happening in the greyhound industry.  It is important to emphasise to the House that the greyhound industry should be properly supported and investment in it should continue.  The industry has significant potential worldwide and I acknowledge the investment that has been made in infrastructure in the industry.  A successful greyhound stadium has opened in Limerick and there was investment in the stadium in Waterford, which I often attend.  It is important such investment continues because this is an indigenous industry and we can contribute to the breeding lines of champion greyhounds.</P>
        <P>This Bill will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s reputation in the industry.  We will not have champions unless we have proper breeding standards and procedures to ensure the welfare of pups and animals.  It is obvious it was already the case, although perhaps it was not as strictly regulated as will be the case under the Bill.  Greyhound owners pay great attention to their greyhounds because it is in their best interests to ensure the pups they produce are of a high standard.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael supports the Bill, although we may introduce some amendments on Committee Stage to strengthen it.  We welcome this legislation and look forward to ongoing support for the greyhound industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted Senator Coffey and his party support the Bill.  I have no doubt he will table amendments but I am sure they will be worth examining.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill.  The Minister, when he published the legislation, stated its policy objective is to regulate the level of welfare in the greyhound industry to complement the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010.  The approach taken differs in some areas, having regard to the distinct nature and controls applying to the keeping of registered greyhounds.</P>
        <P>The greyhound industry is well regulated and has been for many years.  The industry registers and identifies greyhounds to ensure the integrity of greyhound racing.  This is important because the industry sustains 11,000 full and part-time jobs.  It is estimated &euro;500 million is put into the local economies of the 17 Bord na gCon licensed tracks.  Eight of those are owned by the board and it has a 51% share in the track in Mullingar.  As Senator Coffey h<Col N="167"/>as said, the track in Limerick is outstanding.  Over the years, Bord na gCon has upgraded tracks and stadia, adding to the comfort of the patrons, trainers, owners and dogs.</P>
        <P>There are five Parts in the Bill.  Part 2 is important because it deals with the welfare of greyhounds.  It deals with the setting out of specific standards and powers to make regulations for the welfare of greyhounds.  It deals with the identification of greyhounds and the requirement to notify sale or transfer of greyhounds in order that there can be traceability and attachment to owners.</P>
        <P>Bord na gCon published its 14 principles for best practice in 2006.  Among them are that the registered owner and-or keeper of the greyhound should take full responsibility for the physical and social well-being of the greyhound and should do so with full regard to the dog&rsquo;s welfare.  Registered owners should attempt to provide a suitable home for the retired greyhound.  Registered owners should not give away or gift their retired greyhounds to people who will not care for them or use them for illicit purposes.  Breeding of greyhounds should be based on the current needs of the breeder and the future needs of the industry.  Where euthanasia is inevitable, it should be carried out in a humane manner by a suitably qualified person, veterinary surgeon or local authority dog pound.  When transported all greyhounds should travel in safety and comfort.  Those are six very important principles that I picked out and I compliment Bord na gCon on publishing a best practice guide.</P>
        <P>Part 3 deals with the number of times a greyhound can be used for breeding.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s consultation with the interested bodies and that they have reached agreement on this.  There was a great deal of consideration given and different people would have different opinions on a bitch&rsquo;s age for breeding.  Under the Bill, the minimum age will be 15 months, considerably higher than the minimum breeding age in the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010.  The Irish Coursing Club will not be permitted to register litters born to greyhounds under 15 months and, as a consequence, they will not be permitted to race or be used in coursing events.  It is important such provisions are built into the Bill and that the Irish Coursing Club and Bord na gCon agree to this.  This will be good for the industry as a whole.</P>
        <P>I am from an area where there are greyhound breeders and it is important we do things right.  A lot of money comes from the export of greyhounds to other countries, and Bord na gCon and the ICC must ensure everything is done properly.  Anything that goes wrong could affect the whole industry that provides so much employment and brings in so much money.  The industry is highly regarded by British people who come to Ireland to buy dogs, as do the Spanish.  Our trainers bring dogs to large race meetings in England and it is great to read about them winning there.  It enhances the industry and our breeding programme.  Owners are particularly interested in ensuring everything is done right.  I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank the Minister for introducing this Bill.  I also thank the officials for their briefing.  I acknowledge their offer of help.  I always find it very valuable to have a discussion with experts involved in the drafting of legislation.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  Its Title which refers to the welfare of greyhounds speaks for itself.  People should not be allowed to operate in an industry without regulation.  Legislation to ensure the welfare of animals is paramount.  No one could possibly deviate from this view.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was watching a programme on RTE a few evenings ago on the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals which had visited puppy farms and noted animals being mistreated, which is not very pleasant to see.  Anyone who engages in such abuse of animals should be hauled over the coals and subject to the full rigour of the law.</P>
        <P>The greyhound industry is very important, as has been said.  This is especially the case in areas such as west Cork, in which many people breed greyhounds and participate in greyhound racing, a fine social activit<Col N="168"/>y, in the stadium in Bishopstown.  In recent years the event has evolved to such an extent that the organisers have made it a very good evening out.  I have been present on a number of occasions and it is great to see people using the facility not only for commercial purposes but also for entertainment.  The industry is worth a lot in terms of employment in rural areas and contributes in no small way to the rural economy.  It is, therefore, very important that we be cognisant of this in producing legislation and that we do not over-legislate in this area, thus ensuring a diminishing effect.</P>
        <P>Having examined the debate pack made available to Members, it is interesting to note that 75% of greyhounds racing in the United Kingdom are Irish born.  This speaks volumes about the success of the Irish greyhound industry which is also important in terms of stakeholders.  One of the many criticisms of legislation is that we do not consult enough and are insufficiently involved with stakeholders.  It is important to note that both Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club were consulted on this legislation.  Its publication in early December was welcomed.</P>
        <P>One question the greyhound organisations have for the Minister concerns a point made in his contribution today:</P>
        <P LI="1">Local authorities may appoint welfare officers who are given the same level of powers as stewards of the Irish Coursing Club and I envisage close liaison between personnel from the Irish Coursing Club and the local authorities.  The Bill will form the basis of a co-operative relationship between local authorities, Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
        <P FLI="0">With regard to the proposal that local authorities may appoint welfare officers, will the ban on recruitment in the public sector be relaxed?  Will it involve the creation of jobs?  Will there be the placing of advertisements by local authorities with a view to hiring welfare officers?  I am very interested in this matter because my local authority, Cork County Council, has lost a substantial number of jobs as a result of the recruitment ban, early retirements, retirements and the inability to fill casual vacancies.  If we are to provide legislatively for the appointment of welfare officers by local authorities, they should be given the resources to do so.  Local authorities are strapped for cash and the availability of resources represents a considerable issue for them, as elected members throughout the country would be quick to tell us.  We have experienced it ourselves.  I experienced it in my local authority.  I am interested to know whether there will be provision made in the Bill to make resources available to local authorities.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  I look forward to tabling amendments on Committee and Report Stages in respect of parts we consider need improvement.  I thank the Minister of State for his time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe.  In association with my colleagues on all sides of the House, I welcome this innovative legislation.</P>
        <P>As the Bill and the Minister acknowledge, the starting point was the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010.  The policy objective of the Bill is to provide for the welfare of greyhounds in the greyhound industry, thus complementing the Act.  As will be agreed on all sides of the House, the Minister has agreed that the greyhound industry is already well regulated and has a well established system of self-regulation that provides a very useful and valuable starting point.</P>
        <P>When one considers the context and history of the Bill, it is instructive to note that views on the controversy that surrounded the introduction of the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill were well aired on both sides of the House.  I pay tribute to my colleague on the other side of the House who addressed many of the points raised at the time, with which points many of us were in agreement.  This was certainly reflected in the representations and submissions made by the various interested parties.</P>
        <P>If ever there was confirmation of the legislative relevance and importance of this House, it is evident in the history of greyhound legislation, starting <Col N="169"/>six months ago with the Dog Breeding Establishments Act and the fallout therefrom.  I refer to the consultative environment in which the interested parties &ndash; the Irish Coursing Club, Bord na gCon and the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation &ndash; came together to make submissions to individual Senators and Oireachtas joint committees, a number of whose meetings I attended.  The representatives of the bodies will be the first to acknowledge the vital importance of the Seanad in this process.  They believed that, had the Bill been dealt with unicamerally by the D&aacute;il, many or all of the points raised to establish the Bill as separate legislation which was logical in the context of the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 would have been lost.  This is because the D&aacute;il is undoubtedly a much more adversarial Chamber.  Time would not have been allowed to the extent to which it was allowed in this House to tease out and debate all of the various measures proposed.</P>
        <P>A representative of the greyhound industry pointed out to me as late as today that anybody who suggested this House was irrelevant should note the Bill provided a perfect example of how bodies affected by legislation passing through the Houses could, from the very beginning, have access to Members of the House and various Oireachtas committees.  In the case of this Bill, the relevant bodies were able to put their point across and the Seanad followed on.  While the approach may not have been bipartisan and this side of the House may not have been able to vote in favour of every proposal by the other side, owing to procedural difficulties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;many on both sides shared the sentiment that this was the way forward.  At the beginning of the legislative process it is correct that this is a Seanad Bill considering all that has happened.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to and highlight the extensive engagement by various bodies which engaged in the consultative process and appeared before the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make submissions.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, said his officials had engaged &ldquo;very constructively&rdquo; with the Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club in the preparation of a draft Bill.</P>
        <P>The Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation stated on 11 May last year that it was supporting the Bill.  It stated the Irish Coursing Club was responsible for maintaining the stud book and registered greyhounds and that, as the integrity and value of the industry was very much dependent on a robust stud book, the Irish Coursing Club had invested significant resources to ensure it delivered on this.  The Irish Greyhound Board welcomes the legislation that addresses the issue of puppy farming and indiscriminate breeding.  In preparing the legislation the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food consulted all these bodies and other representatives of the welfare sector.</P>
        <P>The consultations in the lead-up to the passage of the Dog Breeding Establishments legislation were drawn on in framing the Bill.  These included the Dogs Trust, Bord na gCon, the Irish Coursing Club, Veterinary Ireland and the City and County Managers Association.  Attention was also paid to the significant number of submissions made to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the context of the proposed Animal, Health and Welfare Bill.  The main issues raised in regard to dog breeding establishments have resulted in consultees&rsquo; viewpoints being taken into consideration, for the most part, in preparing the Bill.</P>
        <P>This consultation is a perfect example of how various stakeholders were afforded access to the legislative process and listened to as a result of much of the debate in this House and outside it.  The Government responded accordingly and I compliment it on doing so.  The confirmation of our having done the right thing is evidenced in this House today by what I suggest is a bipartisan approach to a welcome Bill.</P>
      
        <P>I hope those outside this House who are quick to denigrate its work, its constitutional and legislative role and its part in our parliamentary democracy might reflect on this experience as being one of many, past and <Col N="170"/>future.  Not only can those outside this House who represent society have direct access to Members, they can effect meaningful change.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

	<P>I am lost for words.  I assume I am to conclude Second Stage.  I had not expected the debate to move so quickly, but I have been impressed with the level of contribution from both sides of the House.  We are all in agreement that the legislation is necessary and brings the industry into the 21st century.  I am mindful that some of the legislation involved in this area dates back to the foundation of the State.  Modernising the legislation is proper, therefore, and putting in place more rigorous standards for the breeding of greyhounds makes sense.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It also makes sense to reflect the many concerns about animal welfare.  Something that has characterised this Government is a greater interest in ensuring animal welfare is protected, as seen in some of the legislation that was before us in the past three or four years.  This Bill has received a great amount of cross-party support.  I look forward to Opposition amendments, as we are <i>ad idem</i> on this matter.  We all recognise the future role of the greyhound industry in providing employment to thousands, if not tens of thousands, of families.  We all recognise the role of tourism in this context, that is, people travelling to Ireland to have a night out at the dogs at the country&rsquo;s many tracks, and that such nights out can play a great part in one&rsquo;s social life.  We recognise the considerable improvement at many tracks in recent years.  We are looking beyond seeing a night at the dogs in an isolated manner.  It is part of a package, a social experience that we can market better in the months and years to come.  We need legislation in place to reinforce the progress made to date and to bring the care and welfare of greyhounds into a modern environment.  All this can be done through the details in this legislation.</P>
        <P>I welcome the concerns put by both sides of the House in this debate and I look forward to seeing the legislation progress.  Instead of being overly complex, it mainly comprises simple, important improvements that are not only in the industry&rsquo;s interests but also in the interests of animal welfare and of those who go for nights out at the dogs.  The Bill&rsquo;s provisions reflect best practice abroad.  It is important that Ireland leads in terms of improving the industry.  Other countries with greyhound industries will benefit from what we are doing.</P>

	<P>I apologise for being late.  I was at a meeting which was going on.  I apologise to the Minister of State and to the Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
        <P>My matter relates to an issue concerning many businesses in my constituency and in the Border county of Donegal, the high cost of commercial rates, coupled with the cost of commercial water rates.  I wish to focus on the issue of commercial rates in the business sector in my constituency.  I am sure the issue is replicat<Col N="171"/>ed in other constituencies.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the difficulties faced by businesses in my constituency on a daily basis.  Reductions in consumer spending are coupled with the inclination among many shoppers to travel a few miles across the Border to the larger multiples in places like Derry, Belfast and Enniskillen.  That issue has abated to some extent with the change in the sterling exchange rate and the increase in VAT in the North.</P>
        <P>The business community in County Donegal and along the Border is facing a challenge in making ends meet, holding on to employees and paying large Revenue, ESB and heating bills as well as commercial rates.  The law of diminishing returns applies in this area.  I have brought many business people in my constituency to meet the finance officials in Donegal County Council.  The officials have advised that while they would like to be able to write off a certain proportion of rates, they cannot do so.  I brought the managing director of a business which employs 35 people in my constituency to meet the head of finance in the council and liaised with the county manager on the case.  The company has been put in jeopardy from a large outstanding rates bill that it simply cannot afford to meet, largely because it is still owed money by other businesses.  It would be in a position to pay a reduced amount but it cannot meet the entire bill.  This is having a negative impact on its balance sheet and the charges are being carried forward at the end of each year.  If rates could be reduced, businesses would make the additional effort to pay them.  All the businesses with which I have dealt have stated clearly that they want to be able to pay rates but simply cannot afford to do so.  The alternative is to close the business but, to be fair to Donegal County Council, it does not want to see this happen.</P>
        <P>This issue needs to be addressed at a national level.  Perhaps a forum could be established to consider solutions but it would have to report in a matter of weeks if we were to prevent more businesses from going to the wall.  I urge the Government and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to assist businesses because local authorities are not able to deal with the issue in isolation.</P>
        <P>The members of Donegal County Council responsibly decided to reduce commercial rates by 3.5% for 2011, but we need to introduce reductions of at least 50% over a period of 15 months to two years if businesses are to be able to get through these difficult times by paying what they can afford.  When a business closes, the local authority and the Exchequer lose out, as do those who lose their jobs.  I ask that a direction be given to local authorities either to reduce rate demands or work with businesses to allow them to survive during the difficult years.  I raise this issue to bring it to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and I hope he will respond favourably for the sake of people who pay taxes and create jobs.  It is incumbent on the Government to protect jobs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Rates income makes an important contribution to funding the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, housing, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.  Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each local authority.  The annual rate on valuation, ARV, which is applied to the valuation of each property to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget.</P>
        <P>Under section 10 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1978, the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, issue a direction in writing to a local authority to limit the ARV.  Such a direction must be issued before the adoption by the authority of an estimate of expenses r<Col N="172"/>elating to the local financial year specified in the direction.  In the period 1999 to 2002, the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government directed local authorities to limit increases to a percentage of the previous year&rsquo;s ARV.  Rates were increasing during this period and it was intended at the time that the cap would help ensure the right balance was struck between meeting the financial needs of local authorities and providing that the rates demand on the business sector was not excessive.  In subsequent years it was left to local authorities to determine the appropriate ARV, having regard to their individual circumstances.</P>
        <P>Local authorities appreciate these are difficult economic times for many businesses.  They have taken a number of initiatives to promote and support enterprise and economic development generally, including the establishment of business support units or equivalent arrangements in each county and city council.  Costs continue to be rigorously examined to maximise efficiencies which, in turn, impact positively on business.  Since taking office the Minister has consistently urged local authorities to exercise restraint in setting rates to support competitiveness in the economy, nationally and locally, and protect the interests of communities.  A significant number of local authorities decreased their ARV for 2010 while the majority kept the same rate as 2009.  The Minister expects to see continued restraint by the sector in 2011.</P>
        <P>Some 29% of local authority income is raised locally from commercial rates.  Being heavily dependent on this and other locally raised charges, it is to the credit of local authorities that they have continued to minimise the impact on the business sector in terms of increased rates and local charges at a time when Exchequer funding is decreasing.  A decrease of 50% in rates income would be very significant for all local authorities.  It would result in locally provided services which many of us take for granted being severely curtailed or the shortfall in income having to be made up by increased charges elsewhere.  A reduction of this nature is simply not feasible if we expect our local authorities to continue to provide the necessary local services such as water, waste, road maintenance and public lighting.  These services are essential in aiding economic renewal and the proper functioning of local communities.</P>
        <P>While it would not be practicable therefore, to issue a direction along the lines suggested, the Minister will continue to impress upon local authorities the need to intensify measures to enhance efficiency with a view to minimising charges for business.  It is the intention that as further local sources of income are realised, local authorities will be required to rebalance the impact of commercial rates on the business sector in line with increasing revenues from other sources.</P>
        <P>I sympathise very much as somebody who has been in the retail sector and has been the victim &mdash; I used that word advisedly &mdash; of very heavy rate hikes.  It is important that we get the balance right.  I will bring the Senator&rsquo;s comments to the Minister and perhaps this can be raised again under another format.</P>
