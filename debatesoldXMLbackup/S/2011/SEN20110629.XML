	<P>I have received notice from Senator David Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to take up the case of an Irishman who died in suspicious circumstances in Germany on 11 December 2010.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Terry Brennan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to clarify the up-to-date position on the removal of a Garda patrol car on Friday last from Carlingford Garda station, County Louth.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator David Cullinane of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social Protection to clarify if and when a national strategy for carers will be published.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to approve the tender for the Finn Valley leisure centre project.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Martin Conway of the following matter:</P><Col N="2"/>

        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Norris, Brennan, Cullinane and &Oacute; Domhnaill as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2011 &mdash; all Stages, with Second Stage to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed seven minutes, the Minister to be called on to reply no later than 1.25 p.m., Committee and Remaining Stages to be taken from 2.30 p.m. to 5 p.m. and resume at the conclusion of Private Members&rsquo; business until 8.30 p.m., if not previously concluded; and No. 13, motion No. 2, to commence at 5 p.m. and conclude not later than 7 p.m.  Business shall be interrupted between 1.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator Cullinane and his wife, Kathleen, on the arrival of their son on Monday.  On the Order of Business, I thank the Leader for providing some additional time for the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2011 after Private Members&rsquo; business, which is somewhat of a concession.  However, we will oppose the Order of Business on the basis that the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2011 is to be dealt with in one day.  As some of my colleagues mentioned yesterday, the amended Bill was only published and circulated yesterday following changes made in the D&aacute;il.  Members on all sides will not know until the Minister comes into the Chamber at 11.45 a.m. to speak to us about his views on the Bill whether they will wish to table amendments.  However, we have been told by the Bills Office that the deadline to table amendments is 11 a.m.  We cannot accept that, even though we are broadly supportive of the Bill.</P>
        <P>This sets a dangerous precedent in regard to most important legislation.  For the first time since the foundation of the State, the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s powers will be spilt between two Departments.  We deserve time to consider this Bill.  As I said, we are broadly supportive of the Bill, as are many Members, but how in God&rsquo;s name can this House, which is supposed to scrutinise legislation, do that scrutiny correctly when Second Stage will finish at 1.30 p.m.?  The Minister will probably speak for 20 to 30 minutes from 11.45 a.m., even though the deadline for tabling amendments will have expired.  I ask that the deadline for amendments to the Bill be extended to 30 minutes after completion of Second Stage.  This is not the way to deal with legislation, as rushed legislation is poor.  One can see examples of rushed legislation not having the required effect with all Governments, including the previous one with which I was involved.  I ask all Members of the House to consider what is being done; the Bill is being rushed through the Seanad &mdash; with scant regard being shown for the Upper House &mdash; and it is probably the most important Bill that we will deal with this term.  It concerns separation of powers from the Minister for Finance to a new Minister responsible for public expenditure and reform.  We will oppose the Order of Business on that basis.</P>
        <P>I am sorry to inform the Leader that I cannot guarantee the smooth passage of the Bill through the Seanad because of the way it has been scheduled.  When the Order of Business was published last week we were somewhat happier as a day was left between taking Second <Col N="3"/>Stage and Committee and Remaining Stages.  That would have given all Members time to consider what is in the Bill and the amendments put down by the Government or the Opposition.  There is no time to give proper consideration of the Bill as it stands, although I welcome the addition of an hour and a half to the debate.  I appreciate that.</P>
        <P>What is the position of parties in tabling amendments?  We have been told by the Bills Office that the deadline is 11 a.m. and the Minister will not even have spoken at that stage.  It is not the way to do business and if this is the way in which other Bills will be brought to the House and rushed through, there is no point in us even sitting.</P>

	<P>I join in congratulating Senator Cullinane on the happy arrival of his son.  In respect of the timing for the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, all of us are agreed that it is not ideal for any Bill to pass through the House in one day.  I said as much when I was on the other side of the Chamber.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is far from ideal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Saying it is far from ideal is very different from saying it is deplorable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>There are already 30 amendments to the Bill and we are all agreed that the legislation is very important.  The fact that its measures are not yet in force means there has been a hold-up not only in the economic reform process that the new Department, headed by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will be tasked with, but also with the political reform.  As we know from experience, that was almost as significant on doorsteps as the economic reform process.  It is very much in everybody&rsquo;s interest that this Bill be progressed speedily.  I agree with Senators that it is not an ideal arrangement.  There will be a far more preferable arrangement tomorrow as we will just have Second Stage of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011, with Committee and Remaining Stages next week.  That is a far more complex Bill because of the amount of different issues with which it deals.  There is a difference between the two Bills.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>For the information of the House, no deadline was given by the Bills Office with regard to amendments for the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to hear that.  We were told specifically that the deadline was 11 a.m.  If it can be clarified that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding is amendments can be taken at any time.</P>

	<P>This Bill has doubled in size since its time in the D&aacute;il.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for the clarification.  All of us have found that in practice the Bills Office can be more flexible than might be initially suggested, which is welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is an opportune day to call for a further debate on methods of bottom-up job creation.  On the day the Government is launching the national internship scheme, with places for 5,000 jobs in training, we should congratulate the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton.  We should also applaud the launch by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade this morning of a new creative quarter in the Liberties in Dublin 8.  The Fumbally Exchange was set up by George Boyle, a former architect with Murray &Oacute; Laoire Architects.  Along with a number of colleagues she has set up a new creative hub where start-up design businesses can be established for a very reasonable rent in a quarter that was left decimated by the closure of Murray O&rsquo;Laoire Architects.  Those people should be congratulated for their bottom-up approach to job creation.  It is the sort of initiative we should support across the Houses of the Oireachtas and we must do our best to facilitate them.</P>
        <P>I ask for a debate on the HSE report produced yesterday by the crisis pregnancy wing of the executive.  It detailed the experience of mothers in the workplace and found that, alarmingly, a third of mothers in work during their pregnancy stated that they experienced unfair treatment.  It is the first Irish study of its kind and it would be worthwhile considering how mothers are treated in the workplace.  On the day we are congratulating Senator Cullinane, we might also consider how fathers are treated in the workplace and whether paid paternity leave can be introduced.</P>

	<P>We pass on our congratulations and comhgairdeas le Seanad&oacute;ir David Cullinane agus a bhean ch&eacute;ile agus a chlann.  I will pick up a point raised by Senator O&rsquo;Brien.  As a new Senator I feel uncomfortable that we are being rushed into taking decisions.  I am all on for working what hours God or the Cathaoirleach would give us but I am uncomfortable about the Order of Business.  I abstained on yesterday&rsquo;s vote on the Order of Business because I felt uneasy about the way this Bill is being dealt with.  I am in favour of this historic Bill but we are being given very little time to contribute in the way we are honoured to.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There are low price seats for the matinees.  A quote from that very important play is that &ldquo;to remember everything is a form of madness.&rdquo;  I had the privilege this weekend of hosting the first ever national citizens&rsquo; assembly, with more than 100 randomly selected citizens from the Twenty-six Counties, from the age of 18 to 80, discussing political reform.  It was a humbling experience for me to hear the voices and opinions of citizens on political reform.  We brought in experts to discuss various issues on gender quotas, mandatory voting, the proportional representation system and Seanad reform.  There was a detailed discussion.</P>
        <P>One of the debates concerned the Seanad and we considered whether the Seanad should be abolished, reformed or be replaced by a citizens assembly.  The reform issue was debated with the 2004 report instigated by Ms Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.  We used a proportional representation vote which eliminated the citizens assembly idea, leaving abolition and reform as two options, with <Col N="5"/>reform winning out by 64% to 31%.  In the discussion the citizens were unaware of the power, duty and possible reform of the Seanad.</P>
        <P>A motion was passed by this House only two weeks ago about inviting citizens of repute to this floor to discuss issues and inform us.  Has the Committee on Procedures and Privileges met since the motion was passed unanimously by the House and has it formulated a solution?  I know my grouping has written to the committee with a suggestion for a name but we would like somebody before the House before we break on 27 July.  Has the Leader an update on the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s concerns about the ordering of business, as I expressed yesterday.  This is an issue that can be resolved, once we start to have leaders&rsquo; meetings, if we work out amicably and in advance the business to be transacted.  There will, of course, be occasions on which it will be necessary to bring forward legislation at a fast pace.  I am not convinced, however, that this legislation requires that degree of speed on our part.  It can easily become an excuse to use.  It may well be that legislation is timely, necessary and desirable and should not be delayed unduly, but I do not see why its passage could not be spread over a couple of weeks.  Certainly, this is an issue we need to attend to.  </P>
        <P>Perhaps a similar issue arises with the Private Members&rsquo; motion I am bringing forward today.  I note the Government has tabled an amendment which I only received this morning.  I will look at it and form my own view, but I am sure it is a very good one.  It would be great if we could find a way of doing business where we would be in contact with each other about proposed amendments to see whether we could arrive at an agreement.  That would reflect well on the House, as would a degree of contact between the Executive and the Legislature generally.  For example, I happen to know informally that it is the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, who probably will take the legislation this evening, although I would have thought it had elements within the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  A telephone call from somebody in the relevant Minister&rsquo;s Department about what it was proposing would reflect well on the way business is done in the House.  Such contact would enable the adoption of a consensus based approach generally.</P>
        <P>I had the honour, with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and many others, to attend the launch of a biography by Dr. Finola Kennedy about, perhaps, one of the greatest Irishmen of the 20th century, Frank Duff, the founder of the Legion of Mary.  Two things struck me while attending the book launch and reflecting afterwards on the character of Mr. Duff.  He was an extremely enlightened man by the standards of his time in terms of his concern for the dignity of women, in particular.  He had an enlightened and far-seeing approach to the supports needed by lone mothers.  At a time when the church and State were doing nothing to enable lone mothers to keep their children, he was pioneering ways forward.  We do not do enough to honour such people.  When prominent politicians die, we have brief conversations about which street we should name after them.  What are we doing to promote the memory and legacy of other great Irishmen and women who can be an example to us all, particularly in these challenging times?</P>
        <P>I was delighted when Senator Ivana Bacik referred to the very important report by the equality officer and the HSE&rsquo;s crisis pregnancy programme which found that 30% of working women experienced severe stress and what they termed crisis pregnancies because of unfair treatment, financial penalties, the denial of promotion and even dismissal.  It was young women expecting their second child who were particularly hard hit.  It would be a great tribute to the legacy of Frank Duff&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A question, please.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="6"/>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;if we were to provide for better and more enlightened parental leave arrangements.  It would also be a great tribute to him, because he did so much to tackle prostitution, if we were to hear at an early time from the Government on what it planned to do about the criminalisation of the users of persons involved in prostitution, as has happened very successfully in Nordic countries.  I would welcome feedback from the Government on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With Senator Ivana Bacik, I welcome the announcement on the first 5,000 places on the internship programme, although it is regrettable the number is so small.  A difficulty I have with it, one that is borne out by the Union of Students in Ireland, concerns the reason one must be three months unemployed before one can take up a place.  Surely the object of this activity is to ensure people are not unemployed.  If graduates are suitable for participation in an internship programme, surely they should be allowed to go straight on to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On another issue, that of health, I noted there was irritation in the House when some Members raised issues which might have been local, as far as other Members were concerned.  Several of the pre-election commitments made by the Government parties that were unambiguous and clear will now not be honoured.  Naturally, if this amounts to a neglect of a portion of the population, far from being a local issue, it is a national issue.  It may be beyond the gin and tonic belt or the Pale or the concerns of the vast majority involved in the mainstream establishment media, but the issues raised are very real to those living in not as well populated parts of the country such as the west and north west.  As regards the contributions yesterday of Senators John Kelly of the Labour Party and Terry Leyden, they are no less important or worthy of debate or consideration by the House than any that might concern those living in Dublin or any other part of the country.</P>
        <P>I say to the Leader, for whom I have profound respect, that irrespective of whether he is committed to having a line Minister come to the House on a particular date, it is not within his sole and exclusive preserve to determine this.  On an ongoing basis there are issues which demand agility and immediate movement by the Houses.  It is because of its paralysis that this House and others have come under the scrutiny by those who wish to see it abolished.  If other Members and I believe there is an issue to be raised, however parochial, that is of concern, by all means one should call for a debate on that day.  Whether the Leader thinks one is listening is completely irrelevant.  The people must be represented in the House.  On a daily basis we must be prepared to seize the opportunity to represent them to the best of our ability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the call by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien for a change to the Order of Business.  It is regrettable that at such an early stage in the Government&rsquo;s life it should take this House for granted.  There is an opportunity for Members of the House to stand together to show its independence of the Executive.  Any Bill, particularly one dealing with the Department of Finance, given its failures in the past decade, should be subject to the most careful consideration and scrutiny in this House.  Ramming through all sections of a Bill on one day is something of which the Government parties when in opposition were rightly critical and opposed.  I would like to think there will be some consistency in that regard.  The failure not to do this today will set a precedent which, unfortunately, will tarnish this House.  This is not the first time in this session that the Government has chosen to do this and it can only be to facilitate a Minister&rsquo;s diary.  Yesterday I listened carefully to the Leader say there was a desire for the Bill to be signed next week.  Second Stage could be taken today, followed by Committee and Remaining Stages tomorrow afternoon, which means the Bill could be returned to the D&aacute;il on Tuesday and signed into law on Wednesday.  It is not a pressing matter that has to be dealt with in this fashion.  It is obviously being done to facilitate diaries, with which I disagree.</P><Col N="7"/>
        <P>I support the call made yesterday by Senator Tom Sheahan for the Minister to come into the House to discuss the possibility of introducing pricing orders in respect of professional fees.  The Senator raised interesting points and could have gone further by referring not only to the amounts paid by the State to GPs under the general medical card scheme but also the various announcements by VHI which, in some instances, has paid up to &euro;1 million to hospital consultants.  It brings into focus the abuse of privilege in our system.  It is welcome that the Minister did tackle the issue of excessive pay levels within parts of the public and private sectors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.  Will the Leader arrange for a Minister to come to the House for a discussion on the matter, given that the rates of pay for top executives in the public sector will not exceed &euro;4,000 per week?  Will the Minister consider imposing a maximum fee charge on barristers of &euro;800 per day?  This needs to be done.  Unfortunately, politicians and the public apparatus seem to be totally oblivious to the need or do not have the moral courage to tackle the vested interests which operate as a cartel to the detriment of the economy and citizens.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator Cullinane on his good news.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader make time available tomorrow for a discussion in the House on the NAMA transparency Bill, which we intend to introduce?  I do not doubt that my colleague from County Kerry, Senator Paul Coghlan, will be delighted to support legislation that aims to bring transparency to the way NAMA does its business.  The Bill, which is very short, would require NAMA to publish on its website details of every property it controls, or in respect of which it has issued a loan.  It would allow everybody to see what properties are available or for sale, what value has been placed on them, what loan was originally provided in respect of them, how they can be purchased, who the auctioneer is and, eventually, the sale price that is achieved.  I hope Senators on the other side of the House will support this important legislation.  I do not want everyone to come back in two years&rsquo; time to wring their hands and ask for a tribunal to be established.  Rather than at some stage in the future wondering how it all went wrong, we should introduce a preventative measure now.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A motion on the Order Paper today proposes that the Seanad should &ldquo;appoint an Honorary Senator to represent the Global Irish Community Overseas&rdquo;.  As a result of our sad and tragic history of emigration, there are 80 million people in the Irish community overseas.  Of the 40 million of them who are in the United States, some 10 million are under the age of 18.  This is a huge resource.  I am glad Fine Gael and the Labour Party have been calling for some time for a representative of emigrants to be appointed to the Seanad.  In 2006, they issued a joint policy document, Reaching Out: Caring for the Irish Abroad, in which they said they would appoint a Seanad&oacute;ir to represent the Irish overseas.  The Taoiseach was involved in negotiations when Mr. Jim Higgins proposed to step down as a Senator to take up a position as a full-time MEP.  It was proposed at that time that Fianna F&aacute;il would assist in appointing a Senator to represent the Irish overseas.  A former mayor of San Jos&eacute;, Mr. Tom McEnery, who lectures in Stanford University, wrote an interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently.  He said that rather than abolishing the Seanad, a Senator should be appointed to represent the Irish community overseas, in places like Silicon Valley.  He suggested that such a move would bring back industry and value to this country.  There are too many people to mention in this context.  This can be done.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader provide time for a discussion on the motion I have mentioned?  As a resolution of the House, it would not impose any costs on the taxpayer.  The <Col N="8"/>person in question would not be paid a wage.  At this time, it can only be for the good of everyone that a community of 80 million people be harnessed for the benefit of Ireland.  I ask the Leader to support the motion.</P>

        <P>I welcome today&rsquo;s announcement that the social welfare internship programme is to be rolled out.  I look forward to hearing the details of it.  I am disappointed with two elements of it.  First, as has already been mentioned this morning, one has to be unemployed for three months before one can avail of the programme.  Second, I understand that the internship programme will be limited to 5,000 places, which represents just over 1% of the 450,000 people in this country who are unemployed.  Can the Leader ascertain whether there will be another phase of the internship programme?  Will it be flexible?  Will it facilitate a broad church of disciplines?  Will it give young people who find themselves in this regrettable position an opportunity to improve their skills and participate in the workplace?  It is a novel idea and a good one.  It is a step in the right direction.  I am afraid it may be too restrictive.  Certainly, the numbers are very limited.  Can the Leader tell us whether the Minister plans on increasing the number of people who can avail of this programme?  Will the Minister consider abolishing the provision whereby one has to be unemployed for three months before one can benefit from it?  Will she come to the House to give us an overall briefing on this programme in due course?</P>

	<P>I add my voice to the congratulations that have been extended on the birth of baby Finn Cullinane.  I am not sure if the name was chosen because it rhymes with &ldquo;Sinn&rdquo;.  I congratulate Senator Cullinane, his wife and his parents.</P>
        <P>I join others in expressing concern about rushed legislation.  It is something we have to avoid.  We should never do this.  Legislation has been rushed in the past.  As Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien said, rushed legislation is often bad legislation.  I would like to tell new Members about a Bill that was passed by the D&aacute;il very rapidly and came to this House after the D&aacute;il had adjourned for the summer.  I cannot remember the name of it, but I know it involved banning public opinion polls prior to elections.  During the debate in this House &mdash; it was late at night &mdash; Deputy Ross, who was a Senator at the time, realised that a blunder had been made.  He pointed out that the prohibition on public opinion polls during the three weeks prior to an election would expire at midnight on the morning of the election, just before people went to the polls.  It would have been disastrous.  It would have finished it.  When this oversight was pointed out on Committee Stage in this House, the Bill was dropped and never saw the light of day again.  I have mentioned that as an example of what we can do in the second House.  We can scrutinise legislation and make sure it does not go through in a rushed form.  I am concerned that we are squeezing all three Stages in today.  As Senator O&rsquo;Brien said, we will be able to give very little attention to Report Stage after we have completed Second and Committee Stages.  I urge the Leader to avoid similar arrangements in the future.  I urge him to support Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business, which proposes that the arrangements for today be reconsidered.</P>
        <P>I also draw the attention of the House to the launch of Springboard, which is a worthy effort to get people back to work if they have a skill, an ability or an education that is no longer suitable to whatever has developed.  Many people who worked in construction, for example, have got degrees or other qualifications under this worthwhile programme.  They need different qualifications now.  I would love to think the Minister for Education and Skills could come in here to debate this and many other areas of the education system.</P>

	<P>The leaving certificate applied programme is particularly close to my heart. It got very little attention when the media concentrated on the leaving certificate examinations in recent weeks.  The leaving certificate applied programme identifies intelligences that are not measured in a traditional academic way.  It is not getting enough publicity or worthy attention.  It enables a large number of teenagers to develop confidence and the ability to step into jobs.  Once they have confidence, they are able to add benefits to the community as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted that two top semi-State executives &mdash; Mr. Gabriel D&rsquo;Arcy of Bord na M&oacute;na and Mr. John Mullins of Bord G&aacute;is &mdash; have shown leadership by waiving their bonus payments.  We need to see this type of leadership at this juncture.  We should not have to introduce legislation to require people to forego their bonus payments.  We said as a House yesterday that the bonus culture must go.  Top executives should be aware that they are well paid through their basic salaries.  I would like more of them to follow the example shown.  This House should monitor the progress being made.  There are times when we are reactive on issues like this and there are times when we should be proactive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important for this House to debate our education system.  I am following up on what Senators Quinn and Mac Conghail said previously.  The Minister for Education and Skills is making far-reaching decisions quite quickly at the moment.  Some of his decisions are good and to be welcomed.  This must be a House of ideas and vision.  We must lead debate.  In that context, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Quinn, to come to the House as soon as possible so that we can debate our vision for the education system at primary, secondary and tertiary levels.  Is it right that the grinds system is leading the education system in this country, that parents are paying hand over fist to ensure that their children get through the examinations system?  Last year I got grinds for my junior certificate boy.  That is wrong.  I was paying at least &euro;75 a week to ensure that he got reasonable results.  It is fundamentally wrong.  We need to look at how we can achieve good outcomes while ensuring a holistic education and how we retain caring, interested and enlightened teachers in this system.  There is much to debate and there is no better House to do it in.  I look forward to hearing from the Leader that the Minister, Deputy Quinn, is coming in to debate the vision for the education system as soon as possible.</P>

        <P>As the House will be aware, there are many bad news stories brought into this Chamber.  However, there is a good news story as I am sure the Leader of House will agree, coming from Waterford, namely, that the tall ships event will take place tomorrow.  It is being formally <Col N="10"/>launched by the Taoiseach.  It will be a spectacular event where, hopefully, up to 500,000 people will travel to Waterford city.  This is not merely a Waterford city event, or even a regional event.  This is a national and international event.  Some 50 tall ships will come to Waterford.  It was over 11 centuries ago that the Vikings came to Waterford.  I am not sure about the reception that they got all of those centuries ago, but I know that the tall ships will get a fantastic reception from the people of Waterford.  There are hundreds of volunteers who have been part of making this a success.  I commend all of those volunteers, the management of Waterford City Council and all of the councillors who played a blinder in ensuring that Waterford put its best foot forward.  It is a fantastic event.</P>
        <P>It dovetails nicely with another good news story which came from Waterford last week, namely, the establishment of a Viking triangle of three museums now in the heart of Waterford city in the Mall which complements the Waterford Crystal facility.  I note that each visiting captain who comes with the tall ships will be given a specially commissioned piece of Waterford crystal.  It is fantastic for the country that Waterford Crystal is still alive and kicking and I am sure the Leader of the House will agree with that.</P>
        <P>On a final point, my party has repeatedly called for a debate on the JLCs and for the Minister to come into the House to discuss his proposals.  Senator Reilly raised this issue yesterday and there was no response.  The Cabinet has discussed this issue.  It has been deferred for a number of weeks.  It is of fundamental importance to hundreds of thousands of working people in the State that we have an opportunity to discuss his proposals and the Duffy-Walsh report.  I would appeal to the Leader of the House to ensure time is made available for this debate.  Somebody spoke earlier about the amendment which is being tabled about this House being taken for granted.  I do not want a situation where we learn that decisions which are made by the Cabinet on something so fundamentally important are announced at a press conference before we have had an opportunity to have any say or input into those proposals.  I would ask the Leader of the House to devote time next week to that important issue.</P>

        <P>I wish to ask the Leader about a separate, slightly related subject.  The question of trust and confidence in the banking system is so important now that the State&rsquo;s stake is so vast, for instance, it is 93% in AIB.  In these circumstances the paucity of public interest directors guarding the State&rsquo;s interest in these financial institutions is an important matter that needs to be addressed.  In AIB there are only three public interest directors for a 93% stake.  That does not ring true nor does it reflect the situation that should exist.  None of those responsible for this situation should still be in place.  They should all be well off the stage by now.  I would ask the Leader about the matter, as he has agreed to give us a debate on banking.  I want to repeat my call for that debate and hear the Leader further on it.</P>

	<P>I rise to send out an SOS &mdash; save our Seanad.  I am encouraged that in the five or six weeks since we have come back, the Leader is making valiant efforts to change the way we do business in the House.  I must acknowledge that.  I am also encouraged by Senator Mac Conghail&rsquo;s remarks, which indicate a lack of knowledge of what we do here, the importance of this House, etc.  In an effort to improve the status of the House, I remarked on a number of occasions in the House, but particularly on the first day back when we elected the Cathaoirleach, on a hobbyhorse of mine but something I would like to see happen sooner rather than later.  I would ask the Leader to arrange for the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland to be invited to this House separately as soon as possible.  It would be a major step forward.  It would cement the peace process, apart from adding to the status of this House which would be a side issue.  I formally request that the Leader would advance in so far as he can that very worthwhile call that First Minister, Mr. Robinson, and Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, come to this Chamber.  We could have a debate on progress in Northern Ireland.  Nerves were frayed recently when we heard of certain incidents in Belfast but we in this House have a major opportunity to grasp something that the previous Seanad failed to do.  I formally request that the Leader arranges a debate on Northern Ireland but, at the same time, also invites the First Minister.  I am sure it can be done logistically.  I sincerely ask the Leader that this be done, if possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I want to ask the Leader whether there is any progress on the proposal to the CPP to invite members of civic society to address the House.  I seek the Leader&rsquo;s opinion on the welcome news that some of the chiefs of semi-State companies are voluntarily forgoing their bonuses and ask that we invite those who do not forgo their bonuses to explain to the Seanad why they should retain them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the announcement that the national internship programme is to be formally launched today.  It is a programme that will provide opportunities for 5,000 young graduates who are currently unemployed.  When the national internship programme was announced in the budget by the previous Government last December, the payment to be made available at the time per graduate was &euro;100 above the social welfare payment.  I am disappointed the figure is being reduced by the new Government to &euro;50 above the social welfare payment.  This is a retrograde step, one which may make the scheme less attractive for graduates who may wish to take part in it.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that the Leader has signalled there will be a debate on the fishing industry on 20 July.  The issue of the mackerel quota has been emerging during the past 48 hours from the European Union with regard to boats which fish out of ports in Ireland.  There is an ongoing issue with regard to Ireland seeking additional quota with the co-operation of the Icelandic Government and the Faroe Islands.  It seems we have reached a stalemate.  It has never been more important to raise the issue at national level in order that it can be raised in the European Union.  There is an obvious obligation on the Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries to deal with the issue, but I am unsure whether she is dealing with it comprehensively.  I seek an emergency debate because this is a national emergency, given the importance of the fishing industry to coastal communities, especially along the west coast.  We should hold an emergency debate on the issue of mackerel quotas, their importance to the country and the efforts the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should make on our behalf in the European Union.  If that means the Minister meeting the European Commissioner, so be it.  Perhaps the Leader might update the House today on the steps which have been taken by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to invite Commissioners to the House.  It is appropriate to invite the Commission for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries to the House.</P>

        <P>I ask the Leader to convey the congratulations of the House to RTE for its sweep of radio awards at the prestigious international radio awards ceremony in New York.  Not only did those involved win the title of best overall radio programme in the world or best overall radio station in the world, but several individual programmes were successful also.  Sadly, none of mine was involved; it was thought they were not good enough to be submitted.  I suggest the Leader convey the congratulations of the House to the RTE head of radio, Clare Duignan, because this is more good news.  RTE is the State broadcaster and public service broadcasting is under threat internationally.  This is a perfect example of the reasons it should be retained, no more than in the case of the Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I share Senator Mark Daly&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the appointment of a Senator to represent the diaspora and I have no difficulty with his suggestion.  As a former emigrant, since coming to the House I have made it a point of principle to raise on each and every occasion matters relating to the diaspora.  Wearing my other hat as a broadcaster, I have continued to broadcast programmes for and about the diaspora with which I maintain strong links, especially in Britain.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was struck, as I am sure were other Members, by the reaction in certain quarters to the announcement made by Niall O&rsquo;Dowd, that fine Irish patriot who has done so much to further the cause of Ireland in America, not least in respect of the peace process.  There has been <Col N="13"/>admittedly a somewhat muted negative reaction to the fact that he has been out of the country for 30 years.  I found this not only astonishing but also offensive because we owe our emigrants so much.  They have done so much for the country.  We are delighted to welcome President Obama and go to extraordinary lengths to establish his genealogy in Ireland.  I am no apologist for Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd in what he is attempting to do, as that is his own affair; I simply emphasise the point that we should embrace the success stories of the diaspora.</P>

He is a leader in his field.  He has done so much to direct the focus of corporate America which has resulted in the creation of jobs in this country.  It is time some of those sending barbs in his direction, especially people involved in the media, copped on.  In that context, I call on the Leader to allocate time for a debate on the diaspora.  Let us get out in the open exactly how the House believes we should harness the Niall O&rsquo;Dowds of this world.  There has been so much positivity.  Brian Cowen set up the emigrants task force in 2002 which resulted in several million euro of taxpayers money going to good causes in all the places to which Senator Mark Daly referred.  A global network was created as a result of the event at Farmleigh, an initiative that came initially from Mr. David McWilliams</P>

If ever anyone sought a representative for the diaspora, she is the person who has been showing the way.  Perhaps the Leader might consider asking the relevant Minister to consider that those interested among the diaspora be given the right to vote in Presidential elections as Irish citizens.  I call on the Leader to allocate Government time for a debate, if not before the recess, in the immediate aftermath, on the diaspora and the many positive things that those of us in this country, including this and previous Governments, have done and continue to do and, more importantly, how we can harness the enormous goodwill internationally towards Ireland, especially with a view to creating jobs at home.</P>

The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill was before the House yesterday and we had sufficient time to deal with all of the problems highlighted, despite the protestations yesterday morning.  Only four amendments by Sinn F&eacute;in were tabled.  There was sufficient time to deal with the Bill and I suggest there will be sufficient time to deal with the Bill to be taken today.  I am not satisfied with the practice of dealing with Bills in their entirety in one day.  However, it is possible in the coming weeks that further emergency legislation will be taken in this and the Lower House and that the same arrangements will apply in both Chambers.  I am not at liberty to name the legislation other than to indicate there will be an urgency which may necessitate it being taken in one day.  When the agenda for next week is circulated, it may not include any business for next Friday, but Members can take it that the House will sit on that day to deal with legislation.</P>

	<P>Senators Ivana Bacik and Martin Conway, among others, asked about job creation and the internship scheme, with concerns being expressed about the three-month requirement.  I will raise the matter with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.  The Minister had intended to come to the House for statements on the internship scheme but is unable to do so.  However, she has given a firm commitment to facilitate a debate in September during which she will present a progress report on how the scheme has been operating in the intervening months.  It will be useful to have that discussion when the scheme is up and running.</P>
        <P>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail asked about the establishment of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The motion was passed last week and the committee will meet next Tuesday.  We hope to discuss and implement many aspects of the motion at that meeting.  I support the call to have a distinguished person address the Chamber before the end of the session.  It is the wish of every Member to improve the status of the House and I will do everything possible to meet that end and comply with Members&rsquo; wishes in that regard.  Progress will be made, but it must await next week&rsquo;s meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges when we will have an opportunity to consider the proposals made by Members on all sides of the House for an opening up of the Seanad, including by way of accommodating addresses by distinguished persons.</P>
        <P>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen asked about party and group leaders&rsquo; meetings.  Such meetings will commence next week.  The various leaders have received e-mails indicating that they will take place every Tuesday at 2.10 p.m.</P><Col N="15"/>
        <P>Senator Marc MacSharry spoke about the prerogative of Members making comments in the House.  Any Member may raise any matter with the permission of the Cathaoirleach.  Fortunately, the Leader is also allowed to have opinions on matters.</P>
        <P>Senator Jim Walsh has asked about an issue he has raised on several occasions, namely, professional fees, including legal fees.  I understand the Minister intends to address this issue and I will endeavour to facilitate a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Mark Daly referred to the NAMA Bill he is proposing.  His party is scheduled to have Private Members&rsquo; time in the coming weeks which will afford him ample time to bring forward that proposal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Several Members referred to a role for the Seanad in representing the diaspora, with particular reference to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees.  Several taoisigh had ample opportunity to appoint Members from the diaspora but failed to do so.  I agree in principle with the suggestion, but there are many in this Seanad well qualified to represent the diaspora.</P>
        <P>Senator Feargal Quinn spoke about the important matter of the leaving certificate applied examination, while Senator Fidelma Healy Eames called for a debate on education.  We will endeavour to have that debate, which is overdue, in the next term.</P>
        <P>On the issue of chief executive officers of semi-State bodies, we have had leadership from some of the people concerned and I hope it will trickle down among all the others.  If ever leadership was needed, it is now.</P>
        <P>Senator David Cullinane referred to something close to my own heart.  The Tall Ships festival in Waterford, Ireland&rsquo;s oldest city, will be opened on Thursday by the Taoiseach and continue until Sunday.  It is hoped the festival will attract at least 500,000 visitors to Waterford and the south east.  All we need is good weather.</P>
        <P>On reform of the JLC system, we have had two debates in recent weeks on the jobs initiative and competitiveness.  I proposed that Members raise their concerns about the JLC system with the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy John Perry, in the course of these debates, which several did.  Nevertheless, I will try to accommodate a debate on the specific issue raised.</P>
        <P>Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the paucity of public interest directors in financial institutions.  I understand a newspaper advertisement was published two months ago inviting applications from members of the public for directorships of the banks and that there were several hundred responses.  It is my understanding it is the intention of the Government to appoint more public interest directors to the banks in the coming months.</P>
        <P>Senators Denis O&rsquo;Donovan and John Gilroy suggested the Northern Ireland First Minister be invited to the Chamber.  That issue is on the agenda for debate at next week&rsquo;s meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I have already discussed it with several Members.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his elevation.  I wish him as much luck and success as possible in his new position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Leas-Chathaoirleach on his election.  As this is my first visit to the Seanad I congratulate all the Members and wish them well in the important work they have ahead of them in what is to be hoped will be mapping a course for our country and society to a better place.</P>
        <P>I am privileged to introduce this Bill.  Its primary purpose is to provide the legislative basis which will allow for the formal establishment of the Department of public expenditure and reform and the transfer of certain functions from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for public expenditure and reform.  It is intended that the establishment of the Department will place the two important issues of expenditure management and public service reform at the heart of Government.</P>
        <P>It is highly significant that for the first time a Cabinet level Minister has been given responsibility for driving the reform agenda.  Turning first to the reform agenda, we all know that delivering a programme of reform in the coming years will not be easy.  The Bill represents the beginning of a challenging journey to achieve the vision of a public service that we have set out in the programme for Government.  The people deserve a public service that will be high performing, value for money and accountable.</P>
        <P>The Bill places public service reform functions on a statutory basis for the first time.  As a Government, we realise that the reform agenda cannot simply be imposed on a system of more than 300,000 people without discussion and agreement, active engagement and co-operation, and proactive and ambitious leadership at every level of the public services.  I recently welcomed the conclusions of the implementation body on the Croke Park agreement which indicated that there has been solid and measurable progress to date.  Nevertheless, it must be clear that there is a lot yet to be achieved.</P>
        <P>We need to see an accelerated delivery of the full range of reforms and efficiencies envisaged under the agreement and I look forward to active engagement with public service management and unions in the task over the coming months.  I, together with the Taoiseach, intend to have a formal meeting with the implementation body this afternoon.  For that reason, unfortunately, I will not be able to take all Stages of the Bill but I will return to the House as quickly as I can.  I hope the House will excuse my absence.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In tandem with the extensive public service modernisation reforms being pursued, the Government has an ambitious agenda for budgetary consolidation over the coming years to put the public finances back on to a sound footing.  This will involve further, major savings and efficiencies in the expenditure area, coming on top of the expenditure consolidations of the past two or three years.  There is acceptance that we cannot afford to spend the same amount on our services as we currently do.  Maintaining key services requires prioritisation and smarter, more efficient and more effective ways of delivering those services.</P>
        <P>We find ourselves today facing unprecedented economic challenges.  The recent flow of economic data provides some grounds for cautious optimism.  The public service must play its part in our national recovery.  We have to be ambitious and ensure that the reform initiatives we undertake, informed by the outcome of the comprehensive expenditure review I have initiated and delivered within the Croke Park agreement, will deliver a slimmer, more streamlined, <Col N="18"/>efficient and effective public service.  This is essential if we are to bring permanent sustainability to the Government finances and ensure the public service can, and will continue to, make a positive contribution to our economic growth.  The introduction of pay ceilings for higher posts across the public service, last week, was intended to send a clear signal that reform must begin at the top.</P>
        <P>I turn to the Bill before the House today.  It marks the final part of the first of many steps to achieve the vision we have set out for the public service.  In its own way, it will make a positive contribution to restoring economic growth and sustainability to our national finances.  I will go through the sections and give a brief outline of their content and purpose.</P>
        <P>Part 1 deals with preliminary and general matters.  Specifically, section 1 deals with the Short Title, collective citation and construction.  Section 2 defines certain terms used in the Bill.  Section 3 defines a &ldquo;Public service body&rdquo;.  Section 4 allows for regulations to be prescribed for any matter referred to in this Act.</P>
        <P>Part 2 deals with the new Department of public expenditure and reform.  It transfers many of the general statutory functions of the Minister for Finance in relation to the public service to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and puts public service reform and modernisation functions on a statutory basis for the first time.  Section 5 provides that the Government may determine, by order, a day to be the &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; under the Act.  It is intended that it will be 5 July.  Hopefully, we will have the assent of both Houses, the President&rsquo;s signature and the formal commencement order signed by the Taoiseach.  Section 6 provides for the establishment of the Department of public expenditure and reform, and the Minister for public expenditure and reform in the English language; and An Roinn caiteachais phoibl&iacute; agus athch&oacute;irithe agus an tAire caiteachais phoibl&iacute; agus athch&oacute;irithe in the Irish language.</P>
        <P>Section 7 provides that the Minister for public expenditure and reform will have responsibility for the management of gross voted expenditure and the annual Estimates process, general sanctioning powers on expenditure and policy matters relating to the appraisal, review and evaluation of expenditure, while the Minister for Finance will retain responsibility for overall budgetary parameters.  Section 8 contains a broad provision transferring the general public service statutory functions of the Minister for Finance to the Minister for public expenditure and reform.  A number of offices currently under the aegis of the Minister for Finance will also transfer to me, as Minister for public expenditure and reform, under this section.  These include the Commissioners of Public Works, the Commission for Public Service Appointments, the Public Appointments Service, the Valuation Office and the State Laboratory.</P>
        <P>A large number of remaining statutory functions which are appropriate for transfer to the Minister for public expenditure and reform, will be transferred by way of a Transfer of Functions Order, which will be timed to commence as soon as possible following the commencement of this Act.  In essence, rather than have a recitation of a very long list, we will only formally transfer on a statutory basis that which the Parliamentary Counsel indicated would have to be formally transferred statutorily.  The rest will be transferred by a Transfer of Functions Order.</P>
        <P>The Schedules to the Bill list the functions which will be exercised in co-operation with the Minister for Finance.  Section 9 details the specific public service reform and modernisation functions which are being put on a statutory basis to reflect the new reform function included in the name of the Department.  The Minister will also assume responsibility for existing non-statutory functions of the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach in the area of public service modernisation, development and reform.  In fact, the sub-element of the Department of the Taoiseach concerning modernisation, has already been transferred to my Department.</P><Col N="19"/>
        <P>The statutory functions will include the formulation and development of policies required for the modernisation and development of the public service, and making proposals to Government on the implementation of those policies, along with the co-ordination and review of the implementation of those measures across the public service.  The functions also include the promotion of value for money in the provision of public services and the development of policy and procedural frameworks in relation to the procurement of goods and services by the State.</P>
        <P>Section 10 provides for the transfer to the Department of public expenditure and reform of the administration and business connected with the transferred functions.  Section 11 provides that if legal proceedings involving the Minister for Finance are in train in relation to a transferred function immediately before the appointed day, these proceedings will, following the appointed day, be deemed to relate to the Minister for public expenditure and reform.  Section 12 provides that any work commenced before the appointed day, by or under the authority of the Minister for Finance in relation to a transferred function, will be carried on and completed by the Minister for public expenditure and reform.</P>
        <P>Section 13 provides that any legal document made by the Minister for Finance in relation to a transferred function will continue to have effect as if it had been made by the Minister for public expenditure and reform.  Section 14 provides that any references to the Minister for Finance in relation to a transferred function in any legal document or in the memorandum and articles of association of any company shall be deemed to be references to the Minister for public expenditure and reform.</P>
        <P>Section 15 provides that all property, rights and liabilities, moneys, stocks, shares and securities held by the Minister for Finance in relation to any transferred function will transfer to the Minister for public expenditure and reform without any further legal actions.  Section 15 also provides that the consent of the Minister for Finance will be required in the disposal of assets and the application of the proceeds from the disposal of assets of State bodies, where such assets exceed a value of &euro;50 million.</P>
        <P>Part 3 deals with the performance of certain other functions including those relating to the Estimates.  Section 16 sets out the responsibility of the Minister in the annual Estimates process.  This provides that the Government will approve an &ldquo;annual approved expenditure amount&rdquo; &mdash; in essence, an envelope of expenditure &mdash; which can be reviewed in the course of a financial year if circumstances require.  The Minister for public expenditure and reform will have full responsibility for the management of gross voted expenditure as set out in section 7, within the annual approved expenditure amount or the revised annual approved expenditure amount, as appropriate.  The Minister for Finance may make recommendations to the Minister for public expenditure and reform on the apportionment of the &ldquo;annual, or revised annual, approved expenditure amount&rdquo; as between current and capital expenditure.</P>
        <P>Section 17 provides for appropriate changes to the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965 to give effect to the powers of the Minister for public expenditure and reform in relation to voted expenditure and to link the policy function of the Minister for public expenditure and reform with the payments role of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance will retain technical responsibility for payments from the central fund.  The Secretary-General of the Department of Finance will remain as Accounting Officer for the central fund and the finance accounts.  I wish to clarify that point.  The central fund, from which all public expenditure comes, will remain in the control of the Minister for Finance.  However, the dispersal of funds from the central fund will be made automatically by the Minister for Finance on request from the Minister for public expenditure and reform.  The Accounting Officer will remain as the Secretary General of the Department of Finance.</P><Col N="20"/>
        <P>Section 18 provides that certain functions relating to the promotion and co-ordination of economic and social planning for the development of the economy and the identification of policies for general economic and social development may be exercised by either Minister separately but that they shall consult from time to time in regard to these functions.  This is an interesting element.  One of the tasks we had to do, which is why it has taken so long to bring this Bill before the House, was to trawl every statutory enactment and order back to the early 1920s and, as Members can imagine virtually every Act and statute references in some way the Minister for Finance.  We had to disaggregate what is now appropriate to the new Department and the new Minister.  I do not know if any Member has been here long enough to remember the old Department of economic development that was established at one stage, but the residual economic development function, which was transferred on the abolition of that Department to the Minister for Finance, will be now be shared jointly so that each of us will have an economic development role.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 19 provides that the functions transferred to the Minister for public expenditure and reform, referred to in section 8(2) and detailed in Part 1 of Schedule 2, may be performed with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  These include provisions of certain Acts mainly relating to borrowings by State agencies.  Section 19 also provides that the functions referred to in section 8(3) and detailed in Part 2 of Schedule 2 may be performed only following consultation with the Minister for Finance.  These relate mainly to the review mechanism in the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation.  The FEMPI legislation, as it is sometimes vulgarly called, which is an important part of the process of accruing money to the State, will now transfer to me and any amendment of it will be done following consultation with the Minister for Finance.  The overall macroeconomic state of the economy will remain the purview of the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 20 ensures that responsibility for matters relating to superannuation, remuneration and so on of bodies under the aegis of the Minister for Finance remains with that Minister.  The Minister for Finance will perform those functions following consultation with the Minister for public expenditure and reform.</P>
        <P>Some functions are transferred collectively under section 8.  These relate to the broad public service functions of the Minister relating to superannuation, remuneration and so on and also to the functions of bodies under the aegis of the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sections 21 and 22 are intended to provide for a potential scenario where one Minister may inadvertently perform a function of the other believing it to be a relevant function of that Minister.  Therefore, a function of the Minister for Finance performed by the Minister for public expenditure and reform shall be valid if at the time the Minister for public expenditure and reform believed that the function vested in him under the section and <i>vice versa</i>.  This does not include those functions for which the specific statutory provisions are explicitly transferred under this Bill.  It refers only to functions transferred by way of a general description.  In case Members are concerned about this particular section, it is a genuine Parliamentary Counsel belt and braces job.  We have trawled every function and assigned responsibility either to the new Minister for public expenditure and reform or to the Minister for Finance in regard to all these functions.  However, if matters arise in the future that we have not thought about and it is presumed to be the role of the Minister for Finance but on legal challenge it was deemed actually to be more appropriate to the Minister for public expenditure and reform, they will remain valid as if they were exercised properly with the expectation that they were exercised with the appropriate authority.</P>

The most egregious for democracy I always found was the normal sabre clause in Bills where at the end of a Bill the Minister is deemed to have the power to do anything that might occur to him or her in the event that the powers are not contained in it.  We do not have that sabre clause in this legislation, but Members will find that the Parliamentary Counsel and the team who worked on this legislation were extraordinary thorough.  They found enactments &mdash; unfortunately, the Members will not be exposed to them because they were measures we expunged from the purview of the Minister for Finance in the other House &mdash; which related to functions going back to Victorian times that were transposed into the authority of the Minister for Finance on the creation of the State in regard to corn and all sorts of interesting matters that have long since ceased to be of direct relevance to the Minister for Finance and over which he has no control now.</P>

	<P>We might well.  It is a neater, cleaner Bill that is before us and the functions of both Ministers have been exhaustively trawled in the creation of this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 23, which is another belt and braces job, states that any disputes arising in regard to the performance of functions set out in this Act for Ministers shall be determined by the Taoiseach.  This is a standard provision from the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 4 provides for the necessary amendments to miscellaneous legislation to take account of the establishment of the new Department. Sections 24 to 98 set out those Acts in chronological order from 1924 to date that need to be amended to link the policy role of the Minister for public expenditure and reform.  Many of these provisions relate to the payments role of the Minister for Finance in regard to the Central Fund.   The responsibility for the Central Fund will remain with the Minister for Finance.  However, as a large number of related policy matters are transferring to me, the Bill provides that such transactions on the Central Fund shall be carried out upon the request or with the approval of the Minister for public expenditure and reform.  In addition, some of the provisions in Part 4 deal with references to the Minister for Public Service which need to be tidied up.  There used to be a separate Minister for Public Service at one stage.  These provisions also deal with borrowing matters where the nature of the provision was not suitable for inclusion in Schedule 2.</P>
        <P>Part 5 deals with miscellaneous provisions.  I should explain why these are in the Bill.  Sections 99 and 100 were transposed into the Bill in the other House at the request of the Minister for Finance.  In essence, they have nothing to do with the establishment of the Department of public expenditure and reform.  They are two finance measures but the Minister was anxious that they would both be enacted into law &mdash; I will explain why in a moment &mdash; and this was the most suitable vehicle.  There are other finance vehicles going through the House currently but they are money Bills and to transpose these sections into them would rob those enactments of their money Bill status.  It was determined that they would be better placed in this Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 99 clarifies the legal status of staff of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  As these staff remain employees of the NTMA and will not be civil servants during their period of assignment, there is a need to ensure no legal ambiguity exists in regard to their ability to perform their duties on behalf of the Minister.  That is a little impenetrable if one does not know what is happening in this area.  Senators will be aware that there has been a <Col N="22"/>thorough review of the functionality of the Department of Finance, in particular of its banking division.  There have been a number of overviews, including external overviews by people such as Mr. Nyberg, of which Senators will be aware, and a set of very strong recommendations to strengthen the banking division and its capacity.  The Minister for Finance has been engaged in that.  He has brought in a number of experts and has also seconded a number of individuals from the NTMA to work directly in the Department of Finance.  Since they are not established civil servants and remain employees of the NTMA on secondment, this measure is to ensure there is no legal ambiguity in case there might be any legal doubt about their capacity to act in the name of the Minister under what Senators might be aware is the old Carltona principle, whereby in law, officers of the Minister are deemed to acting with the authority of the Minister.  That is established Irish law, replicating what was established in the Carltona judgment under British law.  This measure gives the same legal capacity to the NTMA staff who are on secondment in case there might be any legal challenge to their ability to sign affidavits or do anything else in the name of Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 100 gives effect to the recommendations of the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters, better known to us all as the Moriarty tribunal, conducted by Mr. Justice Moriarty.  That tribunal recommended that the principle or convention of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners be given a more robust status through legislative provision.  Therefore, the proposed provision places on a statutory basis what has actually been a long-standing convention in this area stretching back to the establishment of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>I will clarify the intention.  Mr. Justice Moriarty&rsquo;s tribunal report recommended that the independence of Revenue to determine the taxation affairs of every individual citizen should be clear and put on a statutory basis.  It has always been there by convention and no Government since the establishment of the Revenue Commissioners has breached it, but it was believed that we should make the convention clear beyond doubt in law.  That is what this provision addresses.  It will be possible to have the proper overview of the Revenue Commissioners in the normal way in general policy terms.</P>
        <P>Schedule 1 contains a list of commercial semi-State bodies that are not included in the definition of &ldquo;public service body&rdquo; for the purposes of section 9 relating to the reform functions.  Schedule 2, Part 1 lists the functions of the Minister for Finance that are transferring to the Minister for public expenditure and reform and that will be exercised with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Sections 8 and 19 refer.  The functions largely relate to borrowings and indemnities.  The Bill provides for a joined-up approach to overseeing borrowing transactions impacting on the Exchequer and to monitoring overall debt levels.</P>
        <P>Schedule 2, Part 2 lists the functions of the Minister for Finance that are transferring to the Minister for public expenditure and reform and that will be exercised following consultation with the Minister for Finance.  Sections 8 and 19 also refer.  These provisions relate to the review provisions in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts.</P>
        <P>Schedule 3 lists the legislation governing payments of superannuation and remuneration from the Central Fund to link the policy role of the Minister for public expenditure and reform in respect of this legislation with the payments role of the Minister for Finance in respect of the Central Fund.  Section 17 refers.</P>
        <P>In addition to the Bill&rsquo;s provisions, I will also be introducing a small number of technical amendments on Committee Stage.  The list has been circulated.  They are technical in nature and include such items as the inclusion of commas that we missed and so on, but we can discuss those later.</P><Col N="23"/>
        <P>The new architecture that we have designed to disaggregate the old functions of the Department of Finance and to create the new Department of public expenditure and reform was come to separately by both Government parties as being the only way in which to drive reform.  In advance of entering into government, I was asked by my party to draw up a reform agenda for the public service, which I did with the help of a co-ordinating crew of academics, experts and people who have held senior positions in other countries&rsquo; public services.  I was strongly advised that, to achieve real reform, we needed a Cabinet-ranked Minister in control of expenditure.  As it transpired, exactly the same advice had been given to Fine Gael.  There was no difficulty during the negotiations on the programme for Government in constructing the architecture we are now presenting to the House.  Most external oversight and those who have been involved in reform initiatives in the past have accepted this architecture as being the way to go.</P>
        <P>I have not mentioned one over-arching structure where the Departments are concerned, something that will co-ordinate economic policy generally.  The Government has established an economic management council, which has been up and running since day 1.  It consists of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance and myself, supported by those staff who are appropriate to the topics in the Department of Finance, the Department of public expenditure and reform, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, the Central Bank and other agencies, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Presenting in a coherent, structured way the message of our economic position was an extremely important item on our agenda.  Unfortunately, a coherent message had not been emanating from Ireland until recently.</P>
        <P>I am asking the House to support and approve the Bill and, in doing so, to provide a sound legislative basis to underpin the formal establishment of the Department of public expenditure and reform and the transfer of certain functions from the Minister for Finance to me as the new Minister for public expenditure and reform.  The Bill is an important step on our reform journey and I heartily commend it to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Cabinet and wish him the best in his endeavours over the next four or five years.  He will be undertaking a crucial role and he can expect my side of the House&rsquo;s support in most of what he will endeavour to do.  Setting out a separate ministerial structure as the Bill does is important if we are to focus on public sector reform and modernisation and driving Exchequer savings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister was probably slightly delayed in attending the Chamber because of our votes this morning.  It is not an indication that my party opposes the Bill, as we do not, but we have grave reservations about the manner in which it is being introduced in the House.  It is important that the Minister be aware of this.  Last week, the schedule listed a reasonable gap between Second Stage on Wednesday and Committee and Remaining Stages on Thursday.  In the Minister&rsquo;s opening remarks, he mentioned the date of the Department&rsquo;s establishment as being 5 July, not 1 July.  While that is welcome, I am concerned by the haste with which the Bill has been introduced in the House and the fact that our schedule has undergone four changes, either at the request of the Minister or his new Department, to facilitate it being dealt with in one day.</P>
        <P>My party colleagues have tabled some reasonable amendments.  Subject to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s contribution, we reserve the right to submit further amendments post Second Stage.  The usual procedure is for a Second Stage debate, following which Members of all parties are allowed time to consider the Minister&rsquo;s contribution and to table amendments as they see fit.  When one can only do this between 1.30 p.m. when Second Stage concludes and 2.30 p.m. when Committee and Remaining Stages are taken, to be concluded at 5 p.m., it is far from ideal.  Why is there a mad rush in this House in particular if the date of the Ministry&rsquo;s establishment on a firm statutory footing is 5 July?  Why does the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s Order of Business for tomorrow, as <Col N="24"/>published by the Government, state that the Lower House will deal with amendments from the Seanad when the Seanad has not even voted on anything yet?  The Minister cannot know whether we will pass any amendment.  The Government enjoys a sizable majority in the Seanad, albeit not as large a one as it enjoys in the Lower House.  Many of us take our roles seriously, but the way in which today&rsquo;s business has been scheduled and the listing of a discussion of Seanad amendments in the D&aacute;il tomorrow are retrograde steps.  Perhaps the Government has people who use crystal balls.  I hope it does, given how we could do with a great deal of foresight where the Minister&rsquo;s role is concerned.</P>
        <P>I have got this matter off my chest.  We support the Bill in principle, but we have been left in a difficult situation, in that many of my colleagues are annoyed by the way in which it is being handled.  Members of the Lower House can speak for themselves, but we cannot guarantee the Bill&rsquo;s smooth passage through this House.  However, we support the Bill and the crucial work the Minister will need to do.</P>
        <P>Section 15 deals with the transfer of assets and the Minister&rsquo;s oversight of any sale of assets valued at more than &euro;50 million.  Many parties have discussed the issue of strategic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the other way around.  I need the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s consent for the disposal of any assets where their value exceeds &euro;50 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>But everything with a value of lower than &euro;50 million falls under the remit of the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  This seems to be an opening for the future privatisation or sale of State assets.  We live in the real world and the State must find money, but I seek a commitment from the Minister.  He is in the middle of his reform programme and is looking for ideas from people, but practically all parties made commitments in respect of strategic State assets.  I refer to our airports, energy providers, water services and so on.  It is important not to pre-empt decisions Government will make.  However, it has reiterated that the sale of strategic State assets is not on the agenda, and I do not believe it should be.  That section of the Bill screams &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo;.  That is what one reads into it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We must have capacity to sell.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>That is agreed.  In terms of strategic State assets and the definition of what they are, I take it that it would include our airports.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned procurement, an area which has been greatly overlooked by previous Governments, including the Government of which my party was a member.  The State spends in the region of &euro;15 billion per year procuring goods and services.  Last year the Committee of Public Accounts produced a detailed forward-looking report on procurement.  The Minister highlighted procurement and it is an area in which substantial savings can be made which will not affect the terms and conditions of employees of the State.  Will the national procurement service, which is under the Department of Finance, be under the Minister&rsquo;s wing?  Will it have a remit to drive savings in each Government agency?  A 10% saving in procurement would provide &euro;1.5 billion to the State.  Many experts, the Forum on Public Procurement and others believe that further savings can be made.</P>
        <P>Senator Clune, former Deputy Bernard Allen, the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, myself and others co-authored the report I mentioned and there are many good ideas in it.  The Minister does not have to reinvent the wheel, he should look at the report.</P>
        <P>The Bill&rsquo;s digest brief we received spoke about staffing levels in the Department of Finance.  I refer to staffing levels in this new Department.  Will the Minister recruit additional staff?  What will the staffing levels be?  Obviously, this is outside the current recruitment embargo <Col N="25"/>which the new Government has not lifted.  What further scope does the Minister have?  He will need the latitude to recruit the best.  Is recruitment of new staff complete?  Is the Minister recruiting from outside the Civil Service and the public sector to get the expertise he requires?</P>
        <P>The first D&aacute;il sat in 1919 and the Minister for Finance is one of the few Ministers mentioned in the Constitution.  We take seriously the transfer of power from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for public expenditure and reform.  We are interested in what looks to be a dispute resolution clause.  If, God forbid, the Minister and the Minister for Finance fell out on a particular matter, although I cannot see that happening&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Not possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;will the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste be brought in so there can be balanced dispute resolution?  To be serious for a moment, there will be contentious issues.  The Minister will be back in the House to discuss Sunday premium hours, joint labour committees, etc., which we have already discussed, so I will not discuss them now.  However, members of all parties, including the Government parties, have different views on them.  What will be the timeframe for dispute resolution?  Some of the decisions the Minister will have to make will be crucial.  The joint labour committees and Sunday premium hours have been kicked to touch until January.  What mechanism will be available to enable the Minister to deal with future disputes?</P>
        <P>I refer to pay and conditions and pensions.  The Minister mentioned the National Treasury Management Agency.  Some pseudo State bodies and third level institutions have transferred all their pension schemes into the National Treasury Management Agency for it to manage.  Rules and regulations were set down by the previous Minister for Finance that no additional benefits should be added to those schemes to enhance the liabilities of those pension schemes.  Unfortunately, under the previous Government&rsquo;s watch &mdash; I brought it to its attention &mdash; that directive from the Department of Finance was ignored by many State bodies and institutions.  I am glad to hear the Minister is considering it.</P>
        <P>We are dealing with a budget deficit.  The State, not to mention the private sector, face a pensions timebomb.  In terms of State pension schemes operated by the NTMA, how will the Minister ensure a directive from him or from the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We will bring in a pensions Bill before the end of this term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>It will deal with that.  I thank the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and wish him the very best in his endeavours on behalf of the country.  The setting up of this Department will involve real reform which will not be imposed but will be done through consensus, agreement and engagement as it would not be possible otherwise.  The Minister has started very well.</P>
        <P>This Bill proposes to transfer functions from the Minister for Finance to the new Department which will be headed by the Minister.  The Department&rsquo;s main focus will be on modernisation and development of the public service.  Key to the modernisation of the public service will be the implementation of the Croke Park agreement.  The new Department will oversee the agreement and its progress.  Genuine reform is being achieved under the Croke Park agreement but the pace must be accelerated, in particular this year and next year.  This is the key focus of the Government in the coming weeks and months.</P>
        <P>The public service employs 300,000 and delivering change will be complex if it is to be done correctly.  Public service numbers have been reduced by almost 16,000, or 5% of the total number, between the end of 2008 and the end of 2010.  The programme for Government <Col N="26"/>requires an additional 5,000 to 8,000 voluntary reductions by the end of 2014 and a further 4,000 in 2015.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is between 18,000 and 21,000 by 2014.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The Croke Park agreement provides an agreed framework for the management of this process.</P>
        <P>The gross pay bill fell by &euro;1.3 billion between 2008 and 2010 while the pensions levy raised almost &euro;1 billion last year, amounting to total savings of &euro;2.3 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Sheahan cannot claim credit for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the progress which has been made and the way the Minister will get the country, which Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s party destroyed and brought it to its knees, back on track.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has taken on this task and he will get the country off its knees.</P>
        <P>The review of progress on the Croke Park agreement will be available next month and this will determine how the reduced figures set out in the programme for Government will be achieved.  Even though a substantial number of retirements is indicated, targeted early exit packages may also be needed.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to reforming the way services are delivered and to ensure meaningful change is made.  Even after a 5% reduction in the number of public servants in two years, it is a key objective of the programme for Government to reduce the number of public servants more quickly.  We need to ensure the next phase is even more ambitious.  If that is to be done without a negative impact on frontline services, a more integrated public service with greater mobility within and between sectors must be delivered.</P>
        <P>In addition to the reduction in the pay bill from reducing the number of employees, some additional savings will be achieved in the cost of the pay bill through work restructuring, particularly where it reduces the amount of premium payments or number of allowances paid or by reducing substitution costs or the use of agency workers.  Discussions are already under way on the following cost saving measures: changes to the working day in the health sector to roll out from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.; revised rosters for garda&iacute;; new ways to handle underperforming civil servants and reduce sick leave absences to improve productivity; and changes at local level to working practices around waste collection and similar services.  The significance of the agreement is rooted in the reality that the scale of the desired changes and reforms cannot simply be imposed on a system of more than 300,000 people without their agreement, active engagement and co-operation, or without proactive and ambitious leadership at every level in public service bodies.</P>
        <P>Under the agreement, public service unions have fully accepted that the guarantees the Government has given to avoid further pay reductions and compulsory redundancies are dependent on driving forward implementation of the programme of modernisation and improvements in productivity against a backdrop of significantly reducing financial and staff resources.  In practice, this means staff must be willing to re-train where necessary, take on more responsibility, work across professional and technical boundaries and be open to travelling within a radius of 45 km to take up a new post.  There is much more to achieve.</P><Col N="27"/>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien raised the issue of procurement procedures.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, is working on the issue and I believe he has been to Britain to investigate best practice there.  It is envisaged there will be savings of &euro;1 billion in procurement.  If that can be achieved, it would be a massive help to the goal of the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  A saving of &euro;1 billion on top of the Croke Park agreement would have the Minister well on his way.</P>
        <P>This Government has made it clear it wishes to honour the commitments made in the agreement but this will only be possible if the agreement is implemented in full.  Notwithstanding progress to date, it is clear much more must be done, as the Fianna F&aacute;il slogan goes.  There is enormous pressure on us to cut expenditure significantly and reduce the size of the public service while at the same time making every effort to maintain services.  If services to the public and to businesses are to be maintained with significantly fewer staff and resources, we will need to see accelerated delivery of the full range of reform and efficiencies envisaged under the agreement.  These include much greater integration of public service organisations in order that services are designed around the practical needs of the citizen.  There should also be better targeting of services to avoid duplication of effort, which is rife in the country at every level up to the Seanad and D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>There should also be accelerated progress in e-government in order that we can deliver faster service to the user, minimise opportunities for fraud and reduce transaction costs for the Exchequer.  There should be as much consolidation as possible for financial, payroll, procurement, pensions and human resources services in each sector, as well as the processing of standard information like medical cards.</P>
        <P>The centralisation of medical cards is a folly and is not working very well.  I ask the Minister to consider that issue again, as it affects people who are hurting and under financial pressure, with families suffering owing to unemployment and the economic downturn.  Centralising the applications for medical cards does not work, and I know this from experience with constituents.  People can meet Department personnel locally to fill out application forms and meet doctors but if the process is centralised in Dublin, there is no human side to it.  There must be a human element to the medical card application process.</P>
        <P>The first review of the Croke Park agreement, which was published earlier this month, showed the following.  The Croke Park agreement can serve as an effective enabler of economic recovery by helping to create greater stability and certainty and, above all, a climate of industrial peace in necessary conditions under which difficult decisions can be taken and implemented.  I am pleased the body has found sustainable pay bill savings of &euro;289 million for the year.  The reported non-pay savings detailed in the report amount to some &euro;308 million.  Costs of &euro;87.5 million were avoided which would otherwise have been incurred, and the report shows that Exchequer pay bill costs fell from a peak of &euro;17.5 billion in 2009 to &euro;15.7 billion in 2010, or almost &euro;15 billion when considering the effect of the pension related deduction of 14.4%.  A further reduction to &euro;14.8 billion is estimated for 2011, representing a 15.5% fall from peak by the end of 2011.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister the very best and any support I can give.  The human touch should not be removed from processes.  Any support I can give will be forthcoming if that is the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Senators, I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him every success in this daunting task.  By any standards, the Department of Finance was not fit for purpose, and the reason the country is in so much difficulty today is because the Department was dysfunctional.  The Nyberg report stated that the Department of Finance was not consciously involved in financial stability issues but one could ask what it was doing.  The Wright report refers to a lack of expertise, with only 39 of the 542 staff trained as economists to masters level or higher.  That is 7%, as opposed to 60% in Canada and 40% in the Nether<Col N="28"/>lands.  There are problems in health and education because the Department of Finance was asleep at the wheel.  I welcome the new troika of Howlin, Noonan and Hayes in looking to implement vital reforms.</P>
        <P>There are no records of the meetings concerning the rescue of the banking system worth five times the country&rsquo;s gross national product.  When the Minister contacted the spending Ministers regarding co-operation with the spending review on 11 April, he said it should be done quickly before they were captured.  Surely the greatest case of regulatory capture of all time must have been the capture of the Irish economy and Exchequer by those banks in September 2008.  They should have been put on the plane to Frankfurt and that is where the problem should have resided.  There was a memorandum of understanding indicating that this would be a European problem and the Minister referred to the problems with the banking section of the Department of Finance.  Those in the Department may have forgotten that there was a mechanism other than virtually bankrupting the country in dealing with insolvent banks.</P>
        <P>There is also a moral hazard problem, as the taxpayers and unemployed have borne the costs of this performance, with banks and their regulators getting away remarkably free.  We are now trying to reinvent the Department of Finance and the entire Irish economy.  In his latest bulletin, the Governor of the Central Bank stated that the banking system must be downsized and reorganised.  That should have been done in 2008 rather than going to significant expense to end up with a smaller banking system.  We should separate the deposits which exist for storage and investment.  The bondholders should be given equity and the Central Bank should involve itself in banking only for the purposes of liquidity and not for solvency.</P>
        <P>We must also examine the accountancy profession.  I am still waiting for the chartered accountants regulatory body to report on how money moved into banks at 11.50 p.m. and moved out at 12.10 a.m. is treated as if it were a real deposit.  The accountants should be rebuked by the Government for their tardiness in dealing with the lack of accountability in accountancy, which seems almost an oxymoron but that is the truth of it.</P>
      
        <P>Turning to the director&rsquo;s responsibility of the Minister, we need a council of economic advisers to bring in what the report calls a contrarian view, that economic policy was decided in too small a circle of people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is to be an independent fiscal council as the Senator is aware.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and the broader economic council as well.  Some of the contrarians have been the subject of a media frenzy.  I think they are extremely valuable people.  I am glad the Minister is present and I hope he meets some of those as well.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We need a central office for project evaluation.  For far too long, capital expenditure has been promoted by spending Departments and they have told the Minister for Finance afterwards that he cannot stop now because so much has been spent on it.  Let us have the cost benefit analysis independently carried out, as recommended by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, and let us have it published and debated for a year.  Then we can decide whether a project is worth proceeding with.  We need more openness.  The documents on the benchmarking exercise, which we are trying to reverse, were kept secret.  They should at least be looked at by the Minister and, perhaps, published.</P>
        <P>We need a value for money culture, as the Minister said.  We have to address the issue of a balanced budget because, without it, we have all the problems in health and education to which this House and the other address themselves.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will address the issue of tax shelters.  Mr. Miche&aacute;l Collins of the department of economics in Trinity College estimates, without analysis, that we give away about &euro;12 <Col N="29"/>billion per year in tax shelters to people who went, mostly with tax lawyers and accountants, through some back stairs into the Department of Finance.  This is another example of regulatory capture.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to trawling.  He comes from a fishing county.  I hope he goes after big fish.  I see reference to such things as the adventure playground standards authority and the industrial alcohol body and so on.  There is even a reference to the returning officer for the presidential election.  In defence of the returning officer, he has not cost us a penny for 14 years.  I advise the Minister to go after the big people in public pay, public private partnerships and dodgy capital projects.  Although he may not wish to, the Minister has to concentrate on the bulk of public expenditure, which is in health, education and welfare.  I just wonder if Sir Humphrey had blown him off course to look at some very minor bodies referred to in the Schedules to the Bill.</P>
        <P>I wonder, too, about the exempted bodies.  The airports have occupied our attention in this House and the Government&rsquo;s attention in the recent past, and we have raised the issue of the mysterious letter from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to the regulator ordering a 41% increase in airport charges, bypassing the normal functions of a regulator.  I hope their exemption does not mean they receive less of the Minister&rsquo;s attention, because they are important bodies.  The McCarthy report on the State companies refers to the fact that they seem to have largely exempted themselves from the controls of their parent Departments, to have spent large sums of capital without very much surveillance, to have paid their chief executives, until the last week or so, exceedingly large sums of money, and to have exempted themselves from the general pay restraint that is happening in the public sector.</P>
        <P>In short, the Ministers, Deputies Howlin, Noonan and Hayes, deserve our support.  It is vital that the finances of this country are put back in order.  The concern I would have about the April document on progress is that it leaves expenditure largely unchanged and brings in a &euro;10 billion increase in taxation.  I would hope that the energies of the Department will not be spent on inventing new forms of taxation but concentrating instead on the value for money we get for the &euro;70 billion or so the Government is spending.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a serious need to overcome what Wright saw by comparison with Canada and the Netherlands, which is the need to recruit top level economists and not have these decisions made by generalists or amateurs.  There is also a need to write down.  The Department used the Freedom of Information Act as an excuse for not writing things down in case someone might make a freedom of information request to see what it did.  That did not serve the Department as we now try to find out from either the banks or the Civil Service what really happened that caused the economic collapse in this country.  I welcome very much the efforts of the Minister and he may be assured of the support of the Seanad from all sides.  Wright draws attention to that briefly.  He said a very poor budgetary process obscured ministerial and Government accountability to Parliament.  We recommend major changes to the budgetary process that would enhance ministerial accountability to Parliament.  I commend the Bill.</P>

	<P>Absolutely not.  It is meant in the best possible taste.  I am delighted to welcome the Minister and this Bill which places public service reform functions on a statutory basis for the first time.  It seems extraordinary that it is the first time this has happened, so we welcome it as significant, albeit technical, legislation.  There will be many opportunities in the months ahead for actions on the part of the Minister to be reviewed and discussed in this House.  At that point I am sure we will all partake in such discussions in the spirit in which he himself would wish.</P>
        <P>The urgency of this task is also highlighted by the situation in Greece as it edges towards potential default.  The idea that we will not give them any more money rung loudly in their ears.  That means they cannot pay their police, doctors and teachers.  Effectively, the country cannot function.  We all know how it feels when one&rsquo;s computer collapses for ten minutes.  One goes into a complete high-octane fever.  One can imagine if that were to happen to the country.  It is simply unimaginable.  We are making sure this country does not default.  In order to do that, we have to own up to our debts and deal with them.  That involves reviewing all the expenditure and calculating where money can be allocated, reallocated, withdrawn or increased.  This is part of what the Department of public enterprise and reform will be doing.  It is a large part of the task of the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  It must be considered against that background.  We do not wish to default.  We do not wish to have a second programme of EU-IMF assistance.</P>
        <P>The decision of the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, to stop an investigation into local authority planning was criticised this morning.  I have spent years investigating things.  I have to say I enjoy a bit of an investigation.  However, I can see that in this case, the Minister of State is wisely saying we need to spend the money elsewhere.  A series of such decisions will have to be taken.  We have to accept that this is what will be happening.  Money will be reallocated or withdrawn.  It is called &ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo; or &ldquo;balancing the books&rdquo;.  I welcome the fact that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has taken to this task with such enthusiasm.  It is not what we have seen in the past.  If we are to find our way out of where we are, we will have to balance the books.  The Minister has pledged to be as fair as he can when he balances the books.  That will be a difficult task because different people have different interpretations of fairness.  We accept the Minister&rsquo;s pledge in good faith because the Labour Party&rsquo;s principles of fairness and equality are at the core of his endeavours.  I have faith that fairness will be a hallmark of the spirit of the work he does along with his officials.  We know the room for manoeuvre in the future is small because the EU-IMF deal left us in no doubt about that.  Every effort we make to balance the books makes the room for manoeuvre a little bigger.  We have to welcome the establishment of this Ministry and the work that will go with it because it will expand the room for manoeuvre, albeit in a small way.</P>
        <P>At a time when we want to move confidently at home, in Europe and in the world, we would do well to say we are trying to put an end to the profligacy, sloppy housekeeping and lack of joined-up spending that we had for 14 years.  I welcome the establishment of the Department of public expenditure and reform, which will be responsible for public spending and accountable for the advice that is given on public spending.  It is a first step towards more transparent, more efficient and more responsible government, which is the sort of government I want to see.  Our citizens are demanding such government and they deserve to have it.  I warn that it will not be easy.  Reform is extremely painful.  There will be harmony and there will be disagreement.  There will be argument and there will be compromise.  This Government has pledged over and again to take action in this area.  The T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and the various Ministers have committed to overhauling how government is done in this country.  As we stand and sit <Col N="31"/>here today to talk about this Bill, part of our responsibility is to encourage the reform of government at every possible stage.  I welcome this Bill and the Minister&rsquo;s efforts.  I wish him well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister on behalf of the Labour Party.  As Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe has said, we are delighted to see him in the House.  We are delighted he has been given this portfolio.  We are delighted that this Bill, which establishes the Department of public expenditure and reform, has cross-party support.  As Senator Barrett said, we accept the need to reform the Department of Finance and to overhaul expenditure management and public service reform.  The seriousness with which the Government is undertaking this task is demonstrated by the fact that this Bill is being brought through the Oireachtas.  We spoke this morning about the unfortunate manner in which it is being dealt with in this House in a single day.  I know the Minister, Deputy Howlin, shares our sense of regret that it has to be done in this way.  In future, we will try to ensure more time is made available to debate Bills.</P>
        <P>This largely technical Bill will establish a much-needed Department with, as the Minister said, a reform agenda at its heart.  The Minister spoke about economic reforms.  Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe has spoken about the need for the comprehensive spending review that the Department will undertake.  She referred to it as a &ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo; review.  I want to refer to another vital aspect of the role of the Minister and the new Department.  We all know that on the doorsteps, the task of constitutional reform was almost as significant for people as economic reform.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to establish a constitutional convention.  There is great excitement about that among citizens generally.  We need to see progress with that aspect of these reforms.  I know that will be a priority for the Minister.  I welcome the Bill.  I am delighted that the Minister is with us to debate it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LorraineHiggins"><NameTxt>Senator Lorraine Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to the House.  I commend him and the departmental officials for expediting the drafting of this legislation and its subsequent introduction in the Oireachtas.  We should not doubt that this Bill puts flesh on the bones of our pre-election commitment to reform.  The Government is determined to modernise and renew the way public services are delivered.  The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2011 will play no small part in restoring economic growth and sustainability to the Government finances.  The main purpose of the Bill is to place the establishment of the Department of public expenditure and reform on a legislative footing.  At the same time, it will transfer some functions that are usually within the remit of the Minister for Finance to the Minister for public expenditure and reform.  The Bill establishes the Department and bestows the power to effect reform on the Minister.  Consequently, it will make fundamental changes to one of our most important Departments.</P>
        <P>It must be recognised that the old ways of the public service strangled the capable and ambitious public servants who were full of enthusiasm and dynamism when they entered the public service.  However, these recessionary times have presented us with an opportunity to make changes and reforms.  We need greater scrutiny of all functions and of expenditure, so we can ensure the best delivery of services and the best bang for our buck.  We will all agree that the Department of Finance has enough to do without being expected to implement these changes as well.  My thoughts, views and ideas on this matter are accompanied by a caveat.  We must be hyper vigilant.  We must ensure that when this Bill is enacted, the Department of Finance is not stripped of its best brains and experience at a critical time in our economic history.</P>
        <P>I heartily welcome the commitment to cut the number of State bodies and quangos, which grew like fertilised grass during the Celtic tiger era.  This should be one of the first tasks of the new Department.  It would allow us to start saving money from the beginning.  Many of these <Col N="32"/>agencies can be amalgamated or made redundant.  While some of these agencies do great work, we need to forensically assess every one of them and determine their necessity and efficiency with regard to every single euro that is spent on them.  There are some questions we must ask.  Are they relevant?  Is their expenditure necessary?  What is the alternative to them?  How do their results benefit the people of this country?  As I see it, the objective must be to guarantee the citizens of Ireland the best possible public service in areas like education, training and health.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have been particularly affected by the reduction in frontline services in recent times.  However, we are not seeing a ripple effect on the rest of the Civil Service.  Many senior and middle managers in the Civil Service are on fat-cat salaries.  They need to face reality and accept that things are changing.  Their salaries are not inconsiderable.  They need to take stock and be open to a voluntary pay cut.  How can we possibly tell people earning the average industrial wage to take unpalatable medicine at a time when the economic elite are being left relatively unscathed?  Change must happen from the top down.  We saw that recently when the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste took pay cuts and Deputies and Senators followed suit.  There may be more such reductions in the future.  Now is the time for others earning above &euro;200,000 to act similarly.  I support this Bill because it provides the necessary legislative basis for the formal establishment of the Department of public expenditure and reform.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the initiative the Minister took in recent days in the area of pay in the public service and in the semi-State sector. The quality and leadership skills of people in these senior positions is more important than pay.  The NTMA, since it was established under the leadership of former Minister for Finance, Mr. Ray MacSharry, and former Taoiseach, the late Mr. Charles Haughey, more than 20 years ago, has done much good work on behalf of the State.  That is an area at which we should look.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we had staff of the right calibre who had the prescience to see what was coming down the tracks, whether in the Department of Finance, the Financial Regulator or the Central Bank, we had been paying them &euro;10 million per annum, and they had taken the right decisions to ensure the correction in the property market and that the liquidity which led to the insolvency within the banks was corrected; if they had taken on the profligacy in the public service with the increase in numbers and pay, and good prudential policies had been pursued, it would have <Col N="33"/>been money well spent.  We must lay emphasis on the quality of staff, not only on the optics.  I am concerned that we are dealing with the optics, having regard to some of what is beingsaid.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am also concerned that I heard the Minister mention that some of the economic indicators are very positive.  I do not know from where he is getting that.  I suspect it is from those within the Department who advised previous Administrations. If one looks at what is happening globally, there are serious challenges ahead of us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I stated that one could be guardedly optimistic, not very positive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I advise the Minister to take as much external advice as he possibly can garner.  Last year when the budget was published and the figures and prognosis were predicated on a 2.75% GDP growth rate this year, I stated that we would be fortunate to get anywhere near half of it.  From speaking to the Minister, I am aware that he expects growth of 2.5% next year.  Budgets should be based on a fairly stagnant economic position for the next five years.  I would bet the Minister a Wexford Opera Festival ticket that during the currency of the Minister&rsquo;s term in Government, if it lasts five years, there will not be a cumulative increase of 5% in GDP.  There are clouds on the international horizon, with a fall-off in exports, the possibility of a double-dip in the United States and the federal debt in the United States now reaching almost 100% of GDP.  Professor Nouriel Roubini, at a meeting I had with him some months ago, mentioned that there is debt of approximately another 100% of GDP among the individual states which would lead to a situation where the United States could be approaching debt of almost 200% of GDP.  The professor relates that once one&rsquo;s borrowings rise beyond 120% of GDP, one is insolvent.</P>
        <P>There are major challenges.  I very much regret that we do not have the opportunity in this debate to expand on many of these issues and interact with the Minister on these serious economic issues.  What is happening is a disgrace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure what I can say about public sector reform in two minutes.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  My party would have shared a broad view with the Labour Party, at least before the election, about the need to ensure that public sector reform was about meeting the needs of citizens.  That is the ultimate benchmark in terms of what we need to do in terms of achieving savings.  We all accept that we need to achieve savings in public spending, but it is most important that we protect frontline services and ensure that the citizens of the State have access to high-quality public services.</P>
        <P>Recently I was disappointed to hear the Minister state that public services have been largely unaffected by the cutbacks or, as he put it, by &ldquo;budgetary consolidation&rdquo; by the previous Government.  There have been cutbacks, for example, in health, education, policing, in special needs assistants and in the hospitals.  For example, there is a crisis in many hospitals across the country due to a shortage of junior doctors and nurses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Not to do with cutbacks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is part of public spending reform.  The Minister should look at the recruitment embargo which is in place across the public sector.  For example, recently I spoke to staff in Waterford Regional Hospital where, because of a shortage of nurses and doctors, it is recruiting staff through agencies and paying premium rates, and that is impacting on its budgets.  Even the recruitment embargo is not having the desired effect of driving down costs.  In hospitals, for example, it is driving up costs.  From local authorities across the country <Col N="34"/>which have seen their staff cut and curtailed, I am aware that services have been affected.  I will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to deal further with the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is great to be back and see an old friend in the Chair.</P>
        <P>I apologise to the House.  I regret we did not have more time.  Those who know me know that I would love to debate every line of this.  I will have opportunities in coming debate.  However, this is largely a technical Bill to, if you like, legalise me and the work that I need to do.  We will deal with the policy side of it in detail, line by line, because I have significant matters to bring to this House.  Before the end of this term I hope to publish the Pensions Bill, and I will graft into that the changes in pay to formalise them legally, including to formalise the pay reductions for members of the Government, and so on, in legislation.  I give the House this assurance.  As far as I can, because I know the time frame on which we are working, I will not seek to curtail debate here in so far as it is practical not to.  I apologise that Senators feel under pressure today but I hope that they will bear with us in terms of the technical nature of this legislation, which is simply an enabling Bill.  Most of it is not much more than a recitation of current statute that simply disaggregates it into the functional work of the Minister for Finance and the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform.  We need to have the bigger debate on a different platform in a more structured way and I am sure we will do that in the committee system as well because we cannot do it all in the House.  I will not have time to deal with everything.</P>
        <P>Procurement is a significant issue.  In response to the commentary of Senator O&rsquo;Brien, we need to do better.  I have held many discussions with the Minister of State to look at procurement policies and best practice elsewhere.  I had a meeting with all of the senior officials and international leaders in Google yesterday.  I will go down to them because they do all their procurement for Google across Europe in Ireland and they are efficient at it.  I have looked at how we can address all of those matters.</P>
        <P>In terms of the staffing of my Department, I would like a chance, perhaps before the committee, to explain what I am doing in the Department.  As the House will be aware, I recruited a new Secretary General.  He was the only assistant secretary who spent some time outside the public system.  I intend to establish a director of reform within the Department who will be an external driver of reform and who, I hope, will have experience in bringing about significant change in a significant private sector body.  If there is such a person in the public sector who has experience elsewhere, of course that person can be considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not even respond to that.</P>
        <P>On the pensions issue, I will have regard to all of the points made by Senator O&rsquo;Brien.</P>
        <P>Senator Sheahan spoke of the Croke Park agreement and the pace of it.  To underscore the requirements for a faster pace, I intend meeting the implementation body this afternoon with the Taoiseach.  That is why I cannot be with the Seanad for the full Committee Stage debate.  I asked the Taoiseach to do that to underscore the centrality of the Croke Park process in Government policy.</P><Col N="35"/>
        <P>I do not quite share Senator Sheahan&rsquo;s view on centralised services.  We must have more centralised services.  We cannot duplicate everything all over the country.  There must be a consequence for rational decisions,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;like in the VECs about which we made a decision this week.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett spoke of the Department of Finance.  There is commentary on the Department of Finance.  There are fine staff who have worked hard.  They have been at the eye of a storm for a long time.  However, we need to restructure it in the way we are setting out.  We need external persons in it and that is why there is the section in the Bill to allow NTMA staff to come in.</P>
        <P>In the minute available, I will not be drawn in to discuss taxation policy which is not my direct purview but I look forward to sharing my views on that elsewhere.</P>
        <P>I omitted to say that we launched a website last week.  It is part of the Department of public expenditure and reform website.  It is intended that on a monthly basis all economic data of the State, in terms of procurement and expenditure down to subhead level, will be available for scrutiny.  That should obviate the need for approximately two thirds of parliamentary questions to the Department of Finance, but all of it in real time.  Currently, it dates back to 1994 so that one can have comparators.  It is manipulative to allow for research and should be of use.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe spoke of balancing the books and that is at the heart of my job.  It links into the commentary of Senator Cullinane.  Everywhere I go everybody wishes us to achieve the end but many want to deny us the means.</P>

	<P>My final commentary is this.  One cannot achieve the Herculean task we have to do, which is nothing less than to regain economic sovereignty for the State, and we cannot be beholden to the kindness of strangers for &euro;18 billion this year to pay for teachers, doctors, etc., unless we get our own house in order.  This Department is determined to play its full role in achieving that.  The enactment of this legislation is an important milestone in that regard.  I thank the Senators for their support.</P>

	<P>This is a very important Bill, providing for the division of the Department of Finance for the first time since the First D&aacute;il in 1919.  My colleagues and I agree with most of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.  However, we completely disagree with the manner in which the Bill is being brought before the Seanad.  Prior to any debate on the legislation in this House, the D&aacute;il Order Paper already indicates that amendments from the Seanad will be discussed in that House tomorrow.  We intend to oppose each section of the Bill in protest at the manner in which this House is being treated, including changes in the scheduling of business which preclude ample time for debate.  I appreciate that the Leader has allocated an additional 90 minutes this evening which we intend to use, but the time allotted remains insufficient.  I oppose the section on that basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>To respond to Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, as I said on the Order of Business and Second Stage, I agree with him and his colleagues that it is less than ideal to have all Stages of a Bill go through the House in one day.  I have raised this issue at meetings of my parliamentary party with a view to ensuring it does not recur.  As the Minister said earlier, he, too, regrets that this is happening.  Unfortunately, it is a matter of timing; it is essential that we get the new Department up and running for the sake of good governance and the reforms we all support.  The Minister has pointed out that this is a technical Bill which makes provision for the establishment of his Department, and I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, will say the same.  We will have more time to debate the substantive issues in this House.  The Leader has already allowed additional time tonight to debate the Bill, until 8.30 p.m., if necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>On that general point, we want the Bill to be passed and the Minister to have the powers accorded therein.  I have made numerous complaints on the Order of Business and in the media about this issue, that the Minister for public expenditure and reform who essentially controls the deficit has no statutory powers and that it is very important that this Bill is passed.  On a practical basis, most Members will try to study the legislation and may try to put together amendments.  They will try to do a serious job of work in this regard, not by raising irrelevant matters but by debating the most important elements of the Bill and trying to improve it as best they can.</P><Col N="38"/>
        <P>The original schedule of business indicated this legislation would be debated on Wednesday and Thursday, which I considered reasonable.  I would not have a difficulty with this or declaring that the debate be limited to three or four hours, as long as Members have time to get through each section and amendment.  I do not agree with the proposition that one can speak forever and, personally, I have no problem with the use of the guillotine.  However, I do have a problem with declaring on Monday, just after the legislation had been printed but before it had been sent to Members, that it would be taken on Wednesday afternoon.  I had received an invitation, for which I was grateful, from the good people of Bellewstown, County Meath to officially open their school this morning.  However, I was obliged to leave that function early because of this Committee Stage debate.  My point is that Members have commitments and are trying to juggle everything and do a good job.  It does not reflect either good governance or public service reform that the first act of the Minister for public expenditure and reform is to state that instead of doing what the programme for Government indicates, time will be provided between Stages of Bills taken in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, this Bill will be taken on a single day, even though the Opposition was informed only a day earlier that it would be taken over two days.  That is unacceptable and Fianna F&aacute;il is laying down a marker in this regard.  The Government can use the guillotine which was used by the previous Government, although I note the Government parties then trenchantly opposed its use.  I did not fully agree with them and still do not, as there is a role for shortened debates and the use of the guillotine.</P>
        <P>On this section, the fact that it comprises a list of Acts for the purpose of definitions highlights some of the Bill&rsquo;s main anomalies and problems.  The Bill is not, in fact, a housekeeping measure, as Senator Ivana Bacik suggested; rather, it proposes a massive transfer of powers and responsibilities from one Minister to another without listing in detail what these powers and responsibilities are.  In section 10 it provides that any statute, in so far as it relates to the administration of functions transferred by subsection (1), in so far as it relates to the functions of the Minister in sections 7 and 8, is transferred to the Minister without stating what these powers are.  While many other Acts are being listed, the Bill also states that if there is anything else the Minister for public expenditure and reform should be doing, that power also is transferred to him or her.  That is not a good way to do business and the Bill is a rushed job.  Its purpose purely is to facilitate a division of responsibilities and powers between Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the Department of Finance which I believe is one of the few mentioned in the Constitution and, therefore, has a special role.  The Minister for Finance is required under the Constitution to be a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and is thereby given special status in the legal system and the nation.  The special status and responsibilities of the Minister for Finance are much greater now in the current economic climate, despite all the talk about the loss of economic sovereignty.  The Minister for Finance has a huge role and huge decision-making power, much of which has been transferred to the Minister for public expenditure and reform.  It is not acceptable that this should be done in such a generalised and rushed manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate her on her appointment, as I neglected to so do earlier.  </P>
        <P>This is a fundamental issue.  If one considers section 2, Senator Thomas Byrne has rightly raised the number of Acts that the Bill will affect when enacted.  It is a broad section which means that, unquestionably, this is not a housekeeping Bill.</P>
        <P>I appreciate Senator Ivana Bacik&rsquo;s comments regarding her disappointment and that of her colleagues about the manner in which the Bill has been dealt with.  However, the question as to who was responsible has not been answered.  Was it the Minister, the Government Chief Whip or the Leader of this House whose responsibility it is to order its business?  Who <Col N="39"/>requested that the Bill be taken on a single day?  While the Minister for public expenditure and reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, expressed his regret in this regard earlier today, who made the decision?</P>
        <P>When first published, the Bill was 23 pages long, but it has doubled in length.  It is now complex legislation that deserves proper scrutiny and Members will do their best to do this today.  It is all the more disappointing, as I believe the Bill has the support of the vast majority of Members, including my party grouping, that it could not have been dealt with in such a way that would have allowed its proper scrutiny.  On the basis that, as Senator Thomas Byrne has noted, this pertains to the Minister with responsibility for public sector reform and that complete disregard has been shown for this House and its functions on the Bill&rsquo;s introduction to it, Fianna F&aacute;il Members intend to oppose this section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, should have welcomed the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, and apologise to her for not doing so.  </P>
        <P>I do not wish to prolong the debate on this issue which Members rehearsed fully on the Order of Business and Second Stage.  The Minister for public expenditure and reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, expressed his regret on Second Stage in this regard.  The debate was originally scheduled to take place over two days and I do not know exactly who decided it should be reduced to a single day.  The reason probably is that Government amendments will now be made in the Seanad and I understand there are difficulties in having it signed into law by the President, given her commitments, to allow it to come into force in time for the Minister to assume functions.  I am not fully aware of what the timescale is, but I regret nevertheless that as a result, it is being taken on a single day.  As I stated, the Government is trying to improve matters by ensuring there will be sufficient time to allow for a full debate on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
        <P>I did not mention housekeeping in this context.  Earlier in discussing the Minister&rsquo;s functions when his Department was established Members referred to them as being about ensuring the balancing of books and housekeeping.  I did state this was a technical Bill to make provision for the establishment of his Department.   Senator Thomas Byrne will be aware that the functions of the Minister are set out in section 8.  In that sense this is a technical Bill and, as Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien has stated, Fianna F&aacute;il supports its spirit.  The amendments are not substantive, in the sense that they go to the heart of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions, and Members can debate them individually.</P>

	<P>I spoke to the amendment, the section and the Bill and I am quite entitled to so do.  I do not accept Senator Ivana Bacik&rsquo;s response that our amendments do not go to the heart of the Bill, as one can propose any amendment one likes to a Bill.  Moreover, I do not accept that this has something to do with the President leaving the country because my understanding is that the Cathaoirleach, together with a number of other parties, is able to sign Bills into law in the President&rsquo;s absence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not delay proceedings further, but it is not a question of Members on this side of the House whining.  They have put a lot of work into tabling amendments that have been published.  I note the Government amendments have also come from its <Col N="40"/>Whips&rsquo; office.  Members take the Bill seriously, as they did when they debated at length the Finance (No. 2) Bill and the Finance (No. 3) Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow Members to get on with it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is that if we allow this to happen, will Members next week be asked to take Bills in their entirety on a single day, thereby not allowing proper scrutiny of legislation?  Fianna F&aacute;il Members are laying down a marker.  Senator Tom Sheahan need not worry, as they will get on with the business in hand.  However, this point must be made and we do so at the outset of Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge Members&rsquo; difficulties in the Bill being taken on a single day.  My colleague, the Minister for public expenditure and reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has already done so, as have Senators Ivana Bacik and Tom Sheahan on behalf of the Government side.  Moreover, at the risk of breaking confidentiality, Senator Ivana Bacik raised the issue at the meeting of the Labour Party Parliamentary Party earlier today.  I acknowledge that the point has been well taken and the Government will learn from it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Especially as Fianna F&aacute;il intends to support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  I also thank the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators for their support for the legislation.  As I stated, the Government acknowledges the points they have raised.  </P>
        <P>In one sense, the Bill is technical in that much of its content pertains to the technical aspect of transferring functions.  However, as Senator Ivana Bacik observed, the functions are set out specifically in the Bill.  Section 10 is a standard provision referring to administration and business; it does not actually transfer functions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My desire is to get through as many amendments as possible.  The House has agreed to devote additional time to the Bill, which is welcome.  I understand the Minister will return to the House at a later stage.  I acknowledge the points made from all sides of the House and the lesson will be learned in dealing with future legislation.</P>

        <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 10, lines 25 to 27, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>

        <P>Section 4 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS</P>
        <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 12, before section 5, but in Part 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;5.&mdash;Section 7 of the Official Languages Act 2003 shall not apply to this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment provides that section 7 of the Official Languages Act 2003 will not apply to this Bill.  Section 7 of the Act mentioned states that, as soon as may be after the enactment of any Act of the Oireachtas, the text thereof shall be printed and published in each of the official languages simultaneously.  I must be honest with Senators in this regard.  Owing to the large number of Committee Stage amendments made in the D&aacute;il, it is expected the Irish translation of this Bill, when enacted, will not be available for a further month.  In the light of this, the amendment provides that the English version of the Bill, when enacted, will be printed and published, with the Irish version being made available as soon as the translation is completed.  This will ensure the Bill, when enacted, will be available to the public.  I acknowledge that, ideally, both versions should be available immediately, but we want to have the Bill available to the public as soon as possible.  The Irish language version will be available as soon as is practically possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Do Irish-speaking members of the public not have a right to receive the Irish language version of the Bill?  It is not just a question of law or adhering to the Official Languages Act, it is also a question of adhering to the Constitution and the fundamental law and culture of the State.  My understanding is that this happened only once during the term of the previous Government and in that case it involved a particularly rushed Finance Bill.  The Minister of State has come to the House and blamed the number of Committee Stage amendments agreed to in the D&aacute;il, but the Government amendments were available last week and if she is blaming the Opposition, I remind her that most of ours were only submitted today and yesterday when the Minister&rsquo;s amendments were submitted.  Therefore, we will not accept the blame.  We will not accept this practice on an ongoing basis.  As I said, it happened only once in the term of the previous Government.  I think it happened in the case of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill last week.  I stand to be corrected on that point, but certainly a reference was made by the Minister.  It is absolutely unacceptable that this practice should become routine.  The timetable is being chopped and changed and major legislation to deal with the deficit is being rushed through.</P>
        <P>The Minister for public expenditure and reform may well become known as the Minister for cuts because his first decision is to cut out the Irish language, which is outrageous. Senator Katherine Zappone spoke yesterday about the social wealth of the country, but we also have to think about its cultural wealth, of which the language is part.  It is a constitutional obligation to have legislation published in the official languages of the State.  No other country is unable to publish legislation in its official language.  I will not put all of the blame on the Department because I understand part of the reason has to do with the fact that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has not been established, although I stand to be corrected on this point.</P><Col N="42"/>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il will not accept the amendment.  When in government, it introduced the Official Languages Act which has had a positive effect.  The people have a right to have their laws promulgated and published in the official languages.  Nobody, therefore, should accept the amendment.  It is not good enough.  This legislation has been delayed already and there has been pressure exerted to have translations completed.  The reason most of the amendments were tabled on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, which doubled the size of the Bill, was the Government did not know what was happening.  We have to rush through this Bill to allow for the division of responsibilities in the coalition Government.  It is a political arrangement that is being turned into law, and the first to be sacrificed is the language, which is completely unacceptable.</P>

I hope we have learned our lesson.  This is my first time in the House and I hope in the future we will see a version of a Bill in the first language of the country available at the same time.  I understand there are enough translators available to make Bills available on the Internet if they are not available in print form at the same time as the English version.  I, therefore, ask that the Bill be made available on the Internet in draft form until such time as it is available in print form.  It would also be easier to make changes before printing.  I ask that this arrangement be facilitated as it would offer a solution to the problem.  I understand the Bill cannot be dealt with until the commission is established, which is another issue.

	<P>I share the sentiments expressed by Senator Thomas Byrne regarding the Irish language.  The Official Languages Act is useful, although I do not agree with all of its elements, particularly when local authorities have to translate county development plans at a cost of &euro;40,000 and &euro;50,000 and not one person reads them.  However, in the case of legislation, what is happening regrettable.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether it is possible to have this matter dealt with in less than one month?  I question why it will take a month to deal with it.  To respect the fact that the Irish language is crucial and deserves equality with English, is it possible to speed up the process?</P>

I refer specifically to Senator C&aacute;it Keane&rsquo;s suggestion that there might be a way of issuing a draft version of the Bill on the Internet.  These are valuable suggestions.  I agree that, ideally, the Bill should be presented in both languages on its enactment, but, frankly, the reason has to do with its size.  The Irish language version will not be available immediately, but I will relay the suggestions made and we will endeavour to publish the Bill in Irish as soon as possible.

	<P>I move amendment 4<i>a</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P><Col N="44"/>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;5.&mdash;The appointed day for the purpose of this Act shall be 1 July 2011.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a minor amendment.  Perhaps the Minister of State could give her views on the day to be appointed.  We thought it was slightly vague and that it might be better to insert a date for the appointed day, rather than giving the Government the mandate to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed amendment is that the date should be 1 July 2011 but it is unlikely that it will be ready in that timescale.  In any event, the appointed day would normally be decided by the Government.  The Government will decide that as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>That is reasonable, if it were to happen, and I certainly hope it does.  It might be worth putting it into legislation, so we might try to insert it on Report Stage.</P>

	<P>Normally the Government decides the date.  I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Section 5 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 6</P>
        <P>Government amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 12, lines 25 to 29, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(2) The member of the Government who is in charge of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&mdash;</P>

        <P FLI="0">Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following subsection:</P><Col N="45"/>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(5) The Minister shall&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) within 40 days of the appointed day lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, a report providing consolidated details of his powers as conferred directly by this Act and any delegation orders, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) within 20 days of the appointed day lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas details of actions and target dates which will fall due during 2011 which he or she views to be significant which relate to the preparation of the annual estimates of expenditure.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of this amendment is to give clarity to the role of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The amendment requires that the Minister shall within 40 days &mdash; it was 20 days in the D&aacute;il, but we have expanded that &mdash; of the appointed day lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, a report providing consolidated details of his powers as conferred directly by this Act and any delegation orders that might be made subsequent to the Act and subsequent to the establishment of the Department.</P>
        <P>This amendment is important because the legislation is vague concerning what powers the Minister will have, which is ironic for the Minister who will be in charge of public service reform.  The amendment seeks that the public will be told exactly what the Minister is doing and what functions he will have.  While the general public might not be too interested in reading a list of statutes or powers, it might be crucial for a citizen of the State who may have an issue with the Department of Finance or the Department of public expenditure and reform, to know what the Minister is doing in the interests of reform, openness and transparency.</P>
        <P>I am impressed by the recent work undertaken by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, as a Minister without portfolio.  He has sought to reform matters and has been quite radical in some respects.  I wonder sometimes whether he is too radical for his own party concerning some of the items that have gone out in correspondence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Far from it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>What he is doing is important for the future of this country.  Nonetheless, people need to understand the Minister&rsquo;s role, what he is going to do and what powers he will have, so that they can contribute to the Minister&rsquo;s proposals.  They may, for example, want to take part in the public consultations the Minister has launched, seeking ideas from the public.  The Minister has, rightly, taken the idea from Mr. David Cameron&rsquo;s Tories and the Lib-Dems in terms of opening up for discussion the public&rsquo;s ideas on expenditure cuts.  I understand the Tories have had some success in this regard.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage, the Minister told the D&aacute;il that the Estimates procedure would remain unchanged, but he also said that the procedures would be substantially altered.  We need to know what his powers and functions are.  The evidence that matters of procedure and responsibility are unclear can be seen in the extent to which the Bill has been changed.  The legislative timetable has been chopped and changed, yet other things have not changed although we are talking about having a Minister for Public Service and Reform.  The public should know what the Minister can and will do.  I think he accepted this in the other House.  Therefore, the amendment seeks to implement what the Minister has already said on the record that he agrees with.   Specifically, the amendment obliges the Minister to bring together in one document all his powers, responsibilities and duties listing the delegations orders, the substitutions, as they might be called, from the Minister for Finance to him as a Cabinet colleague.  It also requires in paragraph (<i>b</i>) that the Minister &ldquo;within 20 days of the appointed day lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas details of actions and target dates which fall due during 2011 which he or she views to be significant which relate to the ... annual estimates of expenditure&rdquo;.  It requires the <Col N="46"/>Minister to let the Oireachtas and, more importantly, the public know what the Estimates process for next year will be.  This amendment should not pose a difficulty.  Presumably in any Department there will be almost a family tree of responsibility, as it were, such as site maps on websites, a map of responsibilities setting out who is in charge of what, where it all falls down, and where the powers come from.  One would assume that, as a matter of good housekeeping, that such a document would be available internally in the Department to enable it to do its work.  We propose that such a document should be published and made available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the amendment, it is important that clarification is given, in a reasonable time, on the exact roles, responsibilities and areas of responsibility.  Section 3(2)(<i>b</i>) provides the Minister will have responsibility of &ldquo;a company established under the Companies Acts all of the shares in which are held (i) by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government, or (ii) by directors appointed by a Minister of the Government&rdquo;.  Will the Minister of State clarify whether Anglo Irish Bank and other nationalised banks will fall under the remit of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, on the basis of this provision set down in the Bill?  Will the Minister be responsible for Anglo Irish Bank, the State&rsquo;s 93% shareholding in AIB, Permanent TSB or the 99% ownership we understand the State will have of Irish Life and Permanent?  Specifically, will the Minister of State clarify whether Anglo Irish Bank, which is fully nationalised, will be covered under section 3(2)(<i>b</i>), which is relevant to this amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the amendment, Senator Byrne&rsquo;s first point seeks to have the Minister provide consolidated details of his powers under the Bill and under any subsequent order.  I do not believe that legislative change is required in this case but I understand the Minister would be happy to consider making available a further explanatory memorandum when the Bill is enacted, giving an overview of the functions that are transferred.  The Minister has indicated that.</P>
        <P>It will also be clear from the delegation order which functions are transferring to the Minister for public expenditure and reform and these will be set out in the schedule to the order which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There are ways in which the information will be transferred to the public, a point about which Senator Byrne was concerned.</P>
        <P>On Senator&rsquo;s Byrne&rsquo;s second point regarding the budget and Estimates process, as the Minister indicated, the Estimates processes are now well established and, as of now, it is not envisaged that there will be a change in the timetable.  The timetable for the annual budget and Estimates will remain as they are, namely, that there is a budget in December along with the initial or budget day Estimates followed by a more detailed Revised Estimates volume in February, which is the normal procedure.</P>
        <P>The Bill draws a distinction between the role of the Minister for Finance, who will be primarily responsible for overall fiscal policy, including the aggregate expenditure level, and the Minister for public expenditure and reform who will be primarily responsible for preparing the annual Book of Estimates.</P>
        <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator O&rsquo;Brien, all matters relating to banking will remain with the Minister for Finance.  Subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) defines a public service body by reference to bodies which have a public service pension scheme in force.  Therefore, matters relating to banking will remain with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I support the amendment.  I support the establishment of this Department but the concern I have about the Bill is whether we will see genuine root and branch reform of the public service and public spending.</P><Col N="47"/>
        <P>On the amendment, I would question the autonomy in real terms of the Minister&rsquo;s position in the Department because the Department and its staff and much of his decision-making powers will remain under the thumb of the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance.  For example, section 14(3) of the Bill gives the Department of Finance control over selling or procuring property which exceeds &euro;50 million.  The Minister is also responsible for managing public expenditure within the overall envelope which has been set by the Government but he is not responsible for the budgetary parameters.  That is a concern in regard to the powers the Minister would have.  The new Department of public expenditure and reform is housed in the Department of Finance and two thirds of the new Department&rsquo;s staff will come from the Department of Finance.  We would have concerns about that.</P>
        <P>In terms of accountability and ensuring we measure progress, I have a number of specific questions for the Minister of State.  How is it intended to measure that success?  What parameters will be used?  For me, the most important element is the delivery of services, the service provision.  The Minister spoke about this earlier in the context of budgets and finance, but the ethos and approach of reform in the public sector must be how we deliver first class, world class, high quality public services to citizens and their level of interaction with public services, how it is measured and the level of service they get.  What built-in mechanisms will there be?  What reforms will be in place to ensure there is measurement in terms of the level of success of the new delivery of services under this Bill and the changes that have been brought in?</P>
        <P>I broadly welcome the Bill but have concerns about the actual powers of the Minister.  The new Department must have teeth and be able to do the job it has been set.  I have a concern about many of the responsibilities still resting with the Department of Finance and the Minister not having the autonomy he and his Department will need to deal aggressively with many of the issues with which he will be faced.  Will the Minister of State respond to some of those questions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of clarification, I thank the Minister of State for her response to my question.  I used the example of Anglo Irish Bank to seek clarification on this position.  I take it the Minister of State is saying that the only companies the Minister for public expenditure and reform will have control of or responsibility for are ones where the State holds the shares and the employees have public sector pensions, and that this will be position in all cases.  Those companies will be ones in which there are public sector workers with public sector pensions and that there are no other companies, of which there is full State ownership, over which the Minister will have control unless the employees are in the public sector.  Is that correct?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will reply to that question at the end of this group of questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendments.  It is important to ensure this will not just be another Department, not simply the old Department of Finance, with two thirds of its staff being sent to the new Department, because that is why we had to be rescued by the IMF.  There must be something different.  There must be better accountability.  The Wright report which analysed the Department of Finance referred to the need for enhanced ministerial accountability to parliament and the public.  As speakers have said, this is not a very good start.  That report stated: &ldquo;a ... poor budgetary process obscured ministerial and government accountability to the Parliament&rdquo;.  It also stated: &ldquo;We recommend major changes in the budgetary process that would enhance Ministerial accountability to Parliament&rdquo;.   The Seanad is trying to play a role in this.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, was open to that and it is a pity he did not have time to be with us longer.  However, I fear this will be just another failed Department and that is what got us into the trouble we are in.  Documents tend not be published.  The require<Col N="48"/>ment in the amendment proposed by Senator Byrne should be seriously considered by the Government.  We need a new kind of open Department.  The old examples are many.  I recall a report on rail safety that forgot to mention the collapse of the Malahide viaduct.  There is a culture of secrecy in the public service.  As the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, wants to correct it, I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, will accept the amendment.  There must be a different relationship between Parliament and failed Departments, which we are trying to reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Senator Sean Barrett, it was not the Department of Finance alone which was responsible for bringing in the IMF.  A lack of regulation of the banking sector and poor political decisions, for example, on planning and tax reliefs for property development played larger roles.  However, the Senator is right on the need for a restructuring of the Department.  We all accept there is such a need, which is the reason the Bill has received broad support.</P>
        <P>Senator Thomas Byrne&rsquo;s amendment allows for a useful debate.  The Minister acknowledged the need for accountability and transparency in the workings of his Department, but I am unsure whether the amendment presents us with the best way of achieving this.  However, we are all in agreement on the end to be achieved.  The Minister referred to the website being established by the Department that will make all economic data dating back to 1994 available for scrutiny on a monthly basis.  This sounds like a better way of keeping the public informed.  To keep the Oireachtas informed, the Bill contains other measures, for example, the requirement under section 16 that information be supplied to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on decisions made under the section.</P>
        <P>Senator David Cullinane referred to the Minister&rsquo;s relationship with the Minister for Finance.  The Bill envisages a close working relationship, which is clear not only in section 15, whereby the consent of the Minister for Finance is required in respect of large amounts of money, but also in section 16, which contains a reference to consultation.</P>
        <P>What the Bill is seeking to do and what we all want to see occur is provide for a delegation of some functions from the Minister for Finance and a change in the way the Department of Finance works under its old guise.  The Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin&rsquo;s comments on recruiting for his Department a new Secretary General who has experience from outside the public service and his plan to appoint a director of reform are important in terms of changing the way the new Department will work and mark a radical departure from the workings of the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the banks are not covered under section 3.  Subsection (2) refers to the definition of &ldquo;relevant body&rdquo; in subsection (1).  Like the Minister, I do not know how this could apply to banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>That was disappointing.  We are seeking a change in the way the Government does things.  There have been many promises and leaks to the media, as well as much talk.  What we want is action.  The public needs to know exactly what the Minister can do.  From reading the legislation, it is impossible to know his full list of powers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>They are listed in section 8.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Not all of the statutory functions being transferred to him are listed.  There is no comprehensive list of what he can do.  We do not know what is contained in the delegation orders, as they will be signed after the enanctment of the legislation.</P><Col N="49"/>
        <P>The amendment seeks to let the public know, by way of this document, how the new Minister will do things differently.  The process would be transparent and there would be accountability.  The public would know what the Minister had to do and could judge him accordingly, as could the Oireachtas.  It has nothing to do with the provision of economic data, which is a separate matter.  Rather, it has to do with what the Minister claims he will do.  We want change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The two Government parties agreed in the programme for Government that they would split the Department of Finance.  There was a row over personnel, but that did not matter.  They wondered how they could split the Department.  They published a Bill, then realised they had forgotten about this aspect and that they needed to make changes.  The Bill was substantially altered on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  It was supposed to be debated in the Seanad for two days, but that was shortened to one.  This is not reform, change or how matters should be handled.  The Government refuses to tell us exactly what the Minister will do.  It refers to how he might or should do something and states it is great and new, but it will not accept a simple amendment.  The website could contain something like a site map of the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  Most business and departmental websites contain &ldquo;About Us&rdquo; and &ldquo;What We Do&rdquo; sections.  That is all we seek.  It is a simple matter. The Minister says he will do something, but he would be better acting with statutory power, whereby the Houses could tell him what they wanted him to do and legislate to ensure he did this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Transparency is all we seek.  It is a reasonable request and everyone seems to agree it is a great idea.  The previous Government, for all its faults and failings, used to accept reasonable amendments from the Opposition when they were well considered, well argued and genuinely meant to improve legislation.  It is difficult to believe the Opposition cannot be treated in the same way. Did I understand the Minister of State correctly when she stated the Estimates process would not be changed?  As that is not what was promised, she might be able to clarify the matter.  If everything is to be as it was &mdash; an Estimates process followed by a budget in December &mdash; there will be no change in the fundamental function of the Minister, yet he promised it would be changed substantially.  When it is the Minister of State&rsquo;s turn, she might discuss this matter again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister committed to publishing a second explanatory memorandum, which would be helpful.  I encourage him to ensure it will contain as much detail as possible and cover the important changes made.  I also suggest the Irish version be published simultaneously.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance was not fit for purpose.  Light regulation and supervision led us down this path.  That the entire banking section of the Department has been replaced by one that will drive change and reform, coupled with the Bill&rsquo;s proposals, is welcome.  Public sector reform is essential.  We need to be able to see government through a clear pane of glass and total accountability.  For this reason, I suggest to the Minister of State that the proposals regarding the website and the further explanatory memorandum are essential if we are to ensure the Bill&rsquo;s provisions will be understood by everyone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Most Members agree with the thrust of the amendment.  In many instances, Departments or Ministers, including former Ministers in the Governments of which my party was part, do not want to be tied down by legislation.  Perhaps it is the timeframe of 40 days that the Minister of State finds objectionable in this instance.  However, Senators have stated the new Department should be different.  Like any other Department, I assume it will report to the Committee of Public Accounts, be open to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and, importantly, its Secretary General will be the Accounting Officer to the committee, but this will not be enough.  No committee can oversee what occurs in a Department of this size.</P><Col N="50"/>
        <P>It is important that there is clarification of the Minister&rsquo;s roles and responsibilities.  I appreciate Senator Ivana Bacik&rsquo;s clarification of the State companies to be covered by the Bill, but outlining what they will be is important.  As far as the public is concerned, it is fine that responsibility for banking policy will stay in the Department of Finance, but we need to state specifically that, while the State owns institutions such as Anglo Irish Bank, they are not covered by this legislation.  That information would be helpful, given that Anglo Irish Bank is a wholly owned State company.</P>
        <P>Accepting the amendment and having a report within 40 days would set out the position clearly.  This should be a new Department.  However, it will not be wholly new, as many of its staff will come from the Department of Finance.  I asked the Minister how many from outside the public sector would be employed within the Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 1 outlines the Acts to be changed by this legislation.  While that is a much less important element of the legislation in the context of the Department it is crucially important to set out clearly the functions and responsibilities of this Department.   I welcome the proposed website.  However, I will give an example of where this did not happen.  The current Government broke with protocol of ten years in funding the jobs initiative, previously termed the jobs budget, when it refused to publish the advice from industry on the levy of 0.6% on private pensions, raising &euro;1.8 billion in taxes, and the negative impact it will have on pension provisions and the pensions sector.  That is probably the most significant initiative this Government has taken in its first 100 days.  While we welcome many of the initiatives of the jobs initiative we are concerned about the manner in which it is funded.  None of the advisory data on that has been published.</P>
        <P>It is important, as provided for in Senator Byrne&rsquo;s amendment, that the requirement to do so is tied into the legislation and that this is not left to the whims of Ministers, be they current or future, to do so.  I support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Barrett asked earlier if this is really a new Department which will bring about the type of reforms we all want or if it is but an extension of the Department of Finance.  I mentioned earlier that approximately two thirds of staff in this Department will be staff moving over from the Department of Finance.  The Secretary General of the new Department has worked in the Department of Finance since 1993.  The Minister for Finance will continue to advise the new Department on the apportionment of current and capital expenditure.  Some of the functions which will be transferred to the Minister for public expenditure and reform, Deputy Howlin, may only be performed with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Again, there is real concern that this Department is but an extension of the Department of Finance, that it is not anything new and will not have the powers or autonomy to do what needs to be done.</P>
        <P>I am sure I will disagree with the Minister when he brings forward proposals on public sector reform.  However, I agree with the need to achieve savings in public spending, getting value for taxpayers money and ensuring we have high quality public services.  We need a new Department with fresh thinking to ensure this is done.  The more I listen to this debate &mdash; I listened to the debates on this in the D&aacute;il &mdash; the more I am concerned that this Department will not have teeth or the autonomy it needs.  If this Department is to be under the thumb of the Minister for or the Department of Finance then it is not new.  Like my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il, I fail to understand why this amendment cannot be accepted.  It is not a big deal.  This is a simple amendment which could be accepted by the Government.  I do not accept Senator Bacik&rsquo;s argument in regard to what the Minister said about the website.  The amendment is more specific in terms of what the Minister should do.</P><Col N="51"/>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The general sentiment in the Seanad is a welcome of the principle of the Bill, which is to create greater focus on public expenditure.  There has not been at any time a great record of control of public expenditure.  Those who were around in the 1980s will recall the Government, led by the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, failed to arrest public expenditure resulting in the country being brought to its knees.  That problem was arrested from 1987 onwards through very difficult political decisions which impacted upon people.  We all recall the cutbacks in heath services and so on which occurred at that time and were necessary.</P>
        <P>What we are trying to do is ensure this legislation is not all about optics or sharing out the important financial portfolio between Fine Gael and the Labour Party; that there is more substance to it than that.  This morning, I welcomed the appointment of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to his new portfolio.  I specifically stated that while he had the intellectual capacity to do the job I was not certain he would do it.  I am conscious that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, was the man who in the mid-1990s abolished water charges which took away a revenue stream of &pound;600 million from the country to save the seat of the now Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Walsh should stick to discussing amendment No. 7.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="52"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>What we are trying to do is ensure that this legislation achieves not alone what we want it to achieve but what the public are crying out for it to achieve.  If we fail to do that, the consequences will be horrendous.</P>
        <P>This year, we will borrow &euro;18 billion to meet the deficit which children of future generations will be saddled with paying.  If this legislation is not about achieving a balanced budget as quickly as possible then we are wasting our time discussing it and this effort is purely for electoral optics.  The amendment before us, which I believe is eminently sensible, seeks to ensure that this Bill, which has no measurement of performance or identifiable targets will oblige the Minister and, in particular, his officials to provide specific targets in a whole range of areas.</P>
        <P>This Bill deals with pay and public service numbers.  I mentioned this morning that pay in respect of the public service increased from &pound;7 billion in 1997 to &euro;20 billion in 2009, with a respective increase in numbers from 220,000 to 370,000, an increase of 150,000.  I was and remain critical of this.  I do not believe anyone here could say the service to the public improved commensurately with that increase in numbers or resultant cost to the taxpayer.  We must learn from that and ensure this does not happen again and that we return the economy to a sustainable level.</P>
        <P>There has been much discussion about banking and a range of other issues.  The one area the Government has direct control over in the current cataclysmic banking, fiscal and economic crisis, which is a global issue, is that of public expenditure.  I want to ensure there is a commitment to this area.  This amendment is a litmus test for the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, with regard to whether they are serious or whether in fact this is dressing up a means of splitting a Department which will be as ineffective as the Department of Finance has been over the past decade.  I ask that the Minister would deal with this issue.</P>
        <P>There is also the issue of privatisation.  Why would we not have specific targets in regard to privatisation?  As one who earned his living in the private sector, I know people do not need to be afraid of privatisation.  I saw initiatives taken with employees in my company, whereby employees were set up with their own companies and took on mechanical machinery which we sold to them and then hired back.  They made many savings which, as a company, we could not get them to achieve.  For example, they travelled to Northern Ireland to get spare parts for the equipment.  It was a success story for them and for the company.</P>
        <P>For too long, the taxpayer has been picking up the tab for inefficiencies and waste right across the public service.  There is not a small office of the public service anywhere that is not capable of achieving savings of a minimum of 10% to 20%, which would go a long way towards correcting the budget deficit we have today.  If we are not serious about tackling this, we are failing as politicians and failing to respond to the confidence which the people have placed in the current Government, which has the largest majority of any Government in the history of the State.  However, that brings responsibilities, which must be faced up to.</P>
        <P>On privatisation, a speaker made a comment earlier&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am discussing the amendment, which is about setting targets.  I am dealing with targets on privatisation, Jody.  With regard to the issue of privatisation, a speaker referred to the dysfunctionality of the public service.  Within recent days, staff at the Passport Office have been too busy to answer telephones due to a backlog.  &ldquo;Please call again&rdquo; is the request.  This has gone on for days but one cannot get through to them.  If ever there was a candidate for privatisation, it has to be the Passport Office.  If one wants to make a query on <Col N="53"/>citizenship with the Department of Justice and Equality, one is asked to put it in writing and told there is a 26 month delay in dealing with appeals on citizenship.  If one wants to make a claim for invalidity pension with the Department of Social Protection, one will find the waiting list is too long and that it will take more than nine months to process the claims.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is our public service today, not last week or last month.  If we are serious about tackling the issues, we must set specific targets.  Anyone who has ever worked in business knows that nothing is achieved by aspirations.  Somewhere in this Bill, we must promote value for money.  It should be mandatory.  People who are paid good, six-figure salaries in the public service should have targets that they must achieve if they are to continue to be employed.  This is what happens in the private sector.</P>
        <P>With regard to procurement, there is no target for what will be saved.  It is stated that it will be looked at, but there is no target.  This is the point I am making.  Ministers should be setting that target and it should be known.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What did increments add to the pay bill since 2008?  The increments have continued as if this country was not in a state of financial collapse.  What about overtime?  It is paid throughout the public service to people on all salaries.  I was amazed to find out that people on six-figure salaries are actually getting compensation days for overtime.  It is extraordinary.</P>
        <P>As one of the significant employers in the country, State Street, which employes several thousand people here, staff who earn below some &euro;33,000 a year will get overtime.  Those earning above that amount work overtime, and there is a pretty regular pattern of having to work overtime, but there is no payment, no time off in lieu and no compensation.  We are in the middle of an economic crisis.  Unless we are all prepared to make the sacrifices and to up our game by at least 150%, and the capacity is definitely within the public service as well as the private sector to do that, we will not extricate ourselves from the position we are in.</P>
        <P>The reason these clear-cut targets and objectives should be set is that, as a fundamental principle, if one wants to achieve change in an organisation, one must have clearly defined objectives that are well understood and appreciated, and known to and subscribed to by all the employees.  Where that exists, there is a dynamic within the organisation for reform and change.  Where one operates on an aspirational basis, which this Bill seems to set out to do, one will achieve nothing other than dividing up the personnel within the Department and creating a few more senior positions for promotion.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>What we are about here is outputs.  We do not have time to lose.  It is quite possible we will be faced within a matter of 12 to 24 months with having to consider devaluation.  Our only way of avoiding this, in my opinion, is by correcting as quickly as possible the budget deficit.  We do not have control over the global financial markets or over global financial trade, which is beginning to stagnate and is a concern, and there are many external issues which will impact negatively on us.  For God&rsquo;s sake, let us do the things we can do.  Let us be brave enough to set the targets.  If the Minister is brave enough to do that and he fails to reach some of those targets for justifiable reasons, I believe everyone here, including the Opposition, should be big enough to commend him on setting the targets in the first place.</P>
        <P>We need a change of ethos and a change of mentality.  I do not see it coming, however.  I regret this because, unfortunately, we and, above all, our children will suffer as a consequence of our generation not taking up the baton, doing things right and ensuring their future will be better than ours.</P>

We should set ourselves a similar challenge in regard to this Bill, which is putting in place a new Department of State which we all hope, for the sake of the country and our economic survival, will work and produce results.  We should be brave enough to declare that, in a few years time, if we can see that the Department of public expenditure and reform has not worked and has not done what it says on the tin, we are willing to shut it down.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should speak to amendment No. 7.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was speaking to it and the thinking behind it.  The point I was trying to make before a quorum was demanded was that perhaps we should try to learn in terms of from where we have come politically.  I believe I am correct in saying the last person to create a major economic Department which was seen as futuristic and novel was the late Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, when he created the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  Professor Martin O&rsquo;Donoghue, who was newly elected to the D&aacute;il, became the Minister in charge of that Department.  There was much expectation about what it would do and how it would generate jobs and change budgetary policy.  I do not have the expertise of some of my colleagues to identify what went wrong, but much went wrong and the Department did not do <Col N="55"/>what it had set out to do.  The new Department of public expenditure and reform must do &ldquo;what it says on the tin&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I know from where we are coming politically and that the amendment will not be accepted, but we must try to take on board the spirit of what is being said and a way of thinking which is reflected not only on the opposite side of the House but throughout society.  We are at an economic precipice and can watch what is happening in Greece on television.  I am not an expert on its economy, but I know that the system of politics, economics and administration has failed and that we in this republic are not a 100 miles away from it.  The political structure the new Department will create must work, but we must also set targets and challenges and have high ambitions.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will probably say she is not in a position to accept the amendment, as drafted, and if the roles were reversed, it would be the same tune but with different dancers.  However, it is important that we try to take on board the spirit of what we all must believe, namely, that the Department must work and that we must give it the tools to enable it to do so.  We must also set strong challenges and have high expectations.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister of State will be as responsive as she can be.  While the amendment will probably not be accepted, we should have some political mechanism, whether through the committees of the Houses or otherwise, to regularly monitor what the Department is achieving.</P>
        <P>I have said previously in this House that one of the great failings of the State in the past 70 or 80 years is that we have not changed sufficiently how Departments of State have been set up.  The way some have been set up has not changed since they were established 70 or 80 years ago.  From time to time there is a need to change the way they have been set up and to create new ones to deal with new challenges.  If a new Department such as this one is created, let us try to ensure it will not become the Department of Economic Planning and Development of the new millennium because, sadly, 40 years ago that Department did not work.  Perhaps the expectations were not high enough and the necessary mechanisms were not put in place to monitor it.  Will the Minister of State try to ensure what all of us want to see happen, namely, a Department working, comes to pass, that we will be able to monitor it and that there will be checks and balances, which is crucial in the interests of the taxpayer and the country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not be acceptable to simply provide an explanatory memorandum because it would only relate to the Bill.  The report we propose in the amendment should be provided.  The Bill must include a reference to the delegation orders which are separate and any other statutes not mentioned in it but which relate to functions of the Minister for Finance.  We are talking about billions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money and a new Department in charge of spending it.  The amendment mentions &ldquo;40 days&rdquo;, but any business in charge of spending billions of euro would have a business plan setting out exactly what it would do before it started in business.</P>
        <P>The refusal to accept the amendment, when its spirit is accepted by Members opposite and the Department, indicates things have not changed, nor will they.  This does not give us much hope there will be change in this Department.  Will the Minister of State clarify whether the Minister will be in the House for Report Stage or later on Committee Stage?  We might decide not to press the amendment now and perhaps change it slightly for the Minister before Report Stage.  Perhaps the Government could work on an amendment to be tabled on Report Stage to cover some of our concerns.   It would make public what the Minister intended to do and the exact list of his powers.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have reformed functions and created a new Department, the business of which will be to reform the way public business is done.  Senator Jim Walsh is right that we need to learn from what happened in the past and the appalling mistakes made in recent years.  That is the clear intention of the Government in its programme for Government, this legislation and the statement the Minister made that he intends to substantially reform the way the public service works.</P>
        <P>The amendment is not particularly substantial.  The first part simply suggests the Minister should provide a report detailing his powers, delegation orders, etc.  The second part is specific to targets set in the budgetary process of 2011.  Very good points have been made by both sides of the House in having targets and being clear about the functions of the Minister, but the amendment does not suggest targets the Department should achieve into the future.  Targets are needed, but the amendment does not cover them.  It is specific to the budgetary process of 2011 in regard to targets, functions and powers.  It is not as broad-ranging as suggested.</P>
        <P>What we need is ongoing evaluation of the work of the Department and I have no doubt that this is the Minister&rsquo;s intention.  It will certainly be the intention of the electorate, a point made by Senator Paul Bradford.  The electorate will watch to ensure the Department does the job it has been set up to do.  The Minister has said he intends to be vigorous and ensure the Department will be strong in reforming the way the public service works.  We must save money and reach targets.  That is the Minister&rsquo;s intention.</P>
        <P>There is the specific issue of functions of the Minister of the new Department and the Minister for Finance, which was raised by Senator Cullinane and others.  The Bill specifically gives function to the new Minister and indicates certain areas where the consent of the Minister for Finance will be required.  There are other areas where there must be consultation with the Department of Finance.  That is appropriate.  Senator Cullinane specifically asked about property exceeding &euro;50 million, and such issues have a significant impact on the Exchequer and require the attention of both Ministers.  That is appropriate because of the roles of the respective Ministers.  There are other specific functions falling under the power of the Minister responsible for public expenditure and reform.</P>
        <P>Senators raised a couple of other issues.  Senator O&rsquo;Brien raised the definition of a public service body at the beginning of the debate on this amendment.  He is correct that a public service pension scheme must be in place before the body is within the definition of a public service body.</P>
        <P>In an earlier intervention Senator Byrne asked about the Estimates process.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, and I have already stated that it is envisaged that the timetable for this year will be as outlined.  It is the normal timeframe for a budget in December, followed by more detailed Revised Estimates in February.  In the future that may well change and it will probably do so.  Apart from anything else, there are budgetary processes across the EU which will affect us as well as other European Union countries that may affect the process into the future.  For this year the intention is that the process will remain as it is.</P>
        <P>There have been very good points and the amendment has thrown up a very good debate on the need to ensure that this is an effective Department and that there are targets and measurements.  The work of the Department should make a real difference with regard to public sector reform and delivering economies.  We must get the country and budgetary processes back on track and this Department will be key in doing so.  The amendment is quite specific and does not cover the broad range of areas that Senators on all sides of the House are correctly concerned about.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is incorrect of the Minister of State to say she will not accept the amendment on the basis of the debate here going beyond the terms of the amendment.  Perhaps the debate has gone beyond the confines of the amendment but I have not gone beyond the confines of my simple amendment.  It seeks within 40 days a report listing consolidated details of the powers conferred directly by this Act in any delegation orders.  That is a list of the powers of the Minister, and it may then be for others to judge whether the Minister is doing his or her job properly on the basis of that list.  We are just seeking the list in the amendment, which would lead to a bit of transparency.  The list should be provided before the Department is set up.  We are looking to consider what the Minister will do, which is perfectly reasonable.</P>

	<P>We will speak about this further.  There is even a provision for the Taoiseach to intervene if the Ministers cannot decide who has a particular function.  If there could be a list of powers under the Act and any delegation orders, we would not need the Taoiseach to intervene on whether a job can be done by the Minister.

The Government has argued it will work differently but is that the reality?  The amendment does not go further and I did not claim that it did.  If people want to target the Department on the basis of the information they get in order to judge performance, that is well and good but we must get that list.

	<P>I move amendment No. 7<i>a</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, between lines 42 and 43 , to insert the following new subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(5) The Minister shall be a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment requires that the Minister be a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  While that might seem to be an unusual amendment coming from a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann &mdash; as far as I am aware, this was not pushed by my party in the D&aacute;il &mdash; the Constitution requires that the Minister having charge of the Department of Finance, together with the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste, be a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Constitution provides that two Ministers can be Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>It seems that when functions from the Department of Finance, as it existed at the time the Constitution was written and for most of the lifetime, practice and interpretation of the Constitution, are being transferred substantially to the Department of public expenditure and reform, it would be constitutional that the Minister having charge of that Department would not be a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann but would only be a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It might be relevant to put that into statute in case any Taoiseach would get a flight of fancy and decide <Col N="59"/>to pick any of the good Senators on the other side of the House to be the Minister for public expenditure and reform.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is quite interesting that a Member of the Seanad would wish to be excluded from being the Minister in this case.  Article 28.7 of the Constitution provides that the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the member of the Government who is in charge of the Department of Finance must be Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Constitution does not include a similar provision in the case of other Ministers and it would be inappropriate for this reference to the Minister for public expenditure to be included in the legislation.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be important that I raised the issue were it to arise again.  I cannot see how it might arise in practice.  It would seem to me that the Minister for public expenditure and reform is in effect a Minister for Finance or has charge of the Department of Finance under the Constitution, but I accept what the Minister of State says.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7<i>b</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, between lines 42 and 43 , to insert the following new subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(5) The Minister shall within 20 days of the appointed day lay before the Oireachtas an account of all actions taken by him in relation to the functions of the Department previous to the appointed day.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This important amendment was lodged at a very late stage, not to inconvenience staff in the House or in the Department but to make the point that if the Government is prepared to use procedures to thwart the actions of democracy and the way Parliament works, then the Opposition is entitled to use whatever legitimate ways it has, of which there are few, to make a point that the debate should not be held in the way it is being held today.  We will continue to make that point.  I think the Minister of State has got the message and I am grateful for that.  Apparently the Minister, Deputy Howlin, said the same.  I apologise to staff if tabling this amendment at a very late stage inconvenienced them, but it is within our rights and it is important that the rights of Opposition Members, who represent a substantial portion of the population and have an important role in these Houses, are recognised within Government in order that legislation can be improved as a result and that in certain instances the Government would agree with us.</P>
        <P>We ask that: &ldquo;The Minister shall within 20 days of the appointed day lay before the Oireachtas an account of all actions taken by him in relation to the functions of the Department previous to the appointed day.&rdquo;  This is a point I have been making over recent weeks on the Order of Business and in the media.  The Minister has been acting as Minister without portfolio, effectively without powers.  He has launched the first progress report on the Croke Park agreement.  The Minister&rsquo;s Secretary General, Mr. Watt, who is an excellent individual, of whom I had limited experience when I was a Government backbencher, and whose appointment to the <Col N="60"/>position I was happy to hear because I think he will do a good job, presumably on the Minister&rsquo;s instructions, has issued a fairly detailed radical and interesting letter to all Departments which will provoke debate there.  Perhaps officials, when they receive the letter, will start panicking because it invites them to look for outsourcing, which means private companies, to do their jobs.  It is a radical letter which will cause shock around the place.  Those are merely a few examples of the actions the Minister has taken.</P>
        <P>My understanding is that while the Government is responsible and accountable to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann under the Constitution, the Minister himself has not been accountable to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and has not been the subject of parliamentary questions because he has been working as a Minister without portfolio.  While the Minister may not have been signing orders or taking official actions because those actions have been taken by the Minister for Finance, he has been carrying out the functions of the Minister for public expenditure and reform and the functions that are transferred by this Bill and he has been doing much good work, much of which we would support.  I certainly support the Minister in any kind of radical thinking that will get us out of the mess we are in.  Radical thinking is needed and the Minister needs to be supported in that, especially by his own backbenchers.  In the debates in this House on privatisation and the outsourcing that will come inevitably, the Minister will encounter many difficulties on his own side.  When we are talking about reform, it is important that, where a Minister who has been acting without power over recent weeks and months and who has not been accountable to the D&aacute;il during that period when he should have been because of this legislation not being implemented, there would be a new way of doing things whereby he would set out what he did before this legislation was passed and would do so 20 days after the appointed day.  That is reasonable.  It is important that the Minister would be accountable, that we would know exactly what he has done and that the Minister would acknowledge that he has been a substitute for the Minister for Finance over recent weeks and months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand what Senator Byrne is seeking to achieve here.  The functions of the Minister were undertaken by the Department of Finance previous to this because the new Department did not exist.  The new Department is being set up under this legislation.  As it did not exist, the functions carried out by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, prior to this were carried out by the Department of Finance.  In that sense, it is not possible to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what the amendment seeks.  The amendment seeks an account of the actions taken by the Minister.  It matters not which Department, whether it is the Department of Finance or not.  Section 9 states the functions of the Minister are to formulate and develop proposals to modernise and develop the public service, to make proposals to Government for the implementation of these policies, to co-ordinate the implementation of such policies, to conduct regular and periodic reviews of the implementation of such policies and to promote value for money.  Those are the jobs the Minister must do under this legislation.  It is fair to say that the Minister has been doing much of that up to now.  What this amendment seeks to achieve is that the Minister would account to Parliament, the D&aacute;il in particular, for what he has been doing on those functions up to now.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s note is not related to the amendment.  It does not matter where the Minister has been doing them.  We know he is a Minister.  He is a Minister under the Constitution appointed by the D&aacute;il.  We want to know what has he been doing because he has not had to answer parliamentary questions or answer for the work he has been doing.  That is reasonable.  It is not a question of which Department.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="61"/>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to inform the House that I have received information that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will be here later this evening.  He may have an opportunity to clarify what he has been doing.  I would again stress the point that the Department being established under this legislation did not have any functions prior to the legislation going through and whatever work the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has been doing was carried out under the Department of Finance up until now.  That is why we cannot incorporate this into the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I will raise this with the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  No one is questioning that he is doing a good job.  No one is questioning that he is doing it in the Department of Finance.  That point is not relevant.  Perhaps the officials did not read the amendment correctly when they were preparing the Minister of State&rsquo;s brief.  They had only a short period to do that.  It is not relevant.  We are merely looking for the Minister to be accountable for the good work he has done.  Let the people know what he has done over recent weeks and months.  It is a reasonable request of a Minister who has been acting without portfolio and without power up to now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>If I may clarify again, I understand what Senator Byrne wants and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will understand what he wants.  It is merely not appropriate to put it into the legislation of a Department that does not yet exist until such time as it has been passed through the various processes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not an important point and I do not expect the Minister will do this.  Is there a provision on where the Department will be located or should it be done under statute?  Is it appropriate to set down in the statute that the Department shall share offices with the Department of Finance?  I assume this will be the case.  Will the Minister of State provide some clarity on this?  It is relevant to the section because we are establishing a new Department.  It is certain there will be some costs in terms of headed paper, name plates and so on and we will allow some costs for that.  I assume offices will not be rented, that there will be some joint servicing of the Department in terms of information technology and such items and that we will not be setting up whole new functions of support within the Department which could be done easily by the set-up in place in the Department of Finance.  Can the Minister of State enlighten us on the practical issues of setting up the buildings and offices and how it will work?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Senator stated, at the moment it is within the Department of Finance.  That is appropriate.  There is a great deal of co-operation between the two Departments and there will be in future.  As of now, I understand there are no plans to rent offices or to incur any excessive expenditure.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, will be able to better clarify the matter for the Senator at a later stage.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 7</P>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), line 45, after &ldquo;the&rdquo; where it firstly occurs, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;setting of certain revenues as may be established by order to be collected and the&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is an important amendment, the purpose of which is to try to include wording which reflects the powers which, we understand, the Minister will have under the Bill.  The Bill provides in principle that the Minister will have control and power, in so far as a Minister has power subject to legislation, in respect of the expenditure of revenue and tax through the Estimates.  I understand the Minister will have power relating to appropriations-in-aid.  We believe it is appropriate that the definition should include &ldquo;revenue&rdquo;.  We cannot accept a definition of expenditure in this case that does not include &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; because it is part and parcel of the Estimates process.  The Minister stated in the D&aacute;il that the term &ldquo;certain revenues&rdquo; was too broad.  There is provision here to allow an order to be made to specify that and to give the Minister more scope.  The Minister is entitled to define his powers under the order as narrowly or as broadly as he sees fit but we should not leave in place a definition which relates purely to expenditure when, in fact, the Estimates process relates to revenue as well.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated in the Upper House that he will have full control of the Estimates process including revenue raised through appropriations-in-aid but the legislation is not so clear.  The Oireachtas research office provided this side of the House with some information in this regard.  The Minister&rsquo;s officials informed the office that the power is implied through the Minister&rsquo;s role in delivering the net Estimates and that there would be a series of delegation of powers between Ministers.  However, we do not have the explanatory memorandum for the Bill as amended in the D&aacute;il.  This is a shame because the Bill has changed dramatically and we should have be given an explanatory memorandum at this stage.  The Minister referred to the gross Estimates.  I was not here for Second Stage and I have not had the opportunity to read what was said.  Perhaps the matter was clarified but Appropriations-in-Aid, which are part of the Estimates, add up to approximately &euro;11 billion and include, significantly, the social insurance fund.  It is an important part of the Estimates.  It is not appropriate that there is no clarity over whether the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure, in this case, the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, will have these powers because it relates to so much money.  We cannot imply powers in respect of billions of euro.  If the Minister has power over appropri<Col N="63"/>ations-in-aid it should be clear in the text.  The Minister should accept that he is taking over what are effectively tax raising powers in respect of the social insurance fund.  If the Minister does not have control over appropriations-in-aid and if he is wrong then he is in a ridiculous position whereby he has power over gross Estimates but not net Estimates.  Will the Minister of State provide a view?  It is an important point because it relates to billions of euro.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s amendment seeks to confer statutory authority on the Minister with responsibility for expenditure and public reform in the setting of certain revenues.  As the Senator is aware, appropriations-in-aid are receipts that accrue directly to Departments or their agencies and which may be retained by those bodies to offset the cost of delivering services rather than submit them to the Exchequer.  The level of appropriations-in-aid is determined in the context of the annual Estimates process.  It is intended that functions of the Minister for Finance relating to appropriations-in-aid will transfer to the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform.  This is reflected in two ways.  Under section 15(5) the annual approved expenditure is a gross amount, including appropriations-in-aid.  The transfer of the functions of the Minister of Finance in other legislation in respect of fees, charges, etc., to the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform will take place mostly in the transfer of functions order.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendment would transfer explicitly to the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform functions relating to the setting of certain revenues.  It is essential that there is no ambiguity in respect of the functions of the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform and the Minister for Finance in regard to matters relating to revenue.  The proposed amendment is somewhat ambiguous since it does not specify or clarify the certain revenues which may be established by order and for which the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform might be responsible.  For this reason I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State clarify the section to which she referred?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was section 15(5).</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>It may be an incorrect reference.  Perhaps it referred to the Bill before it was amended.  It is section 16(5).  The earlier reference was an error.  Does the Senator wish me to outline it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State made the point.  It does not seem to be altogether clear in the legislation that the Minister has this power.  I do not accept that our amendment does not give sufficient scope.  It allows the establishment by order of what certain revenues refer to.  This relates to the social insurance fund which amount to &euro;7 billion, the vast majority of appropriations-in-aid.  It is unusual for the Minister for Finance to be in charge of tax but the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform to be in charge of PRSI.  This creates an anomaly and I do not accept the legislation is clear or that section 16(5) makes it clear.  However, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This is an important amendment which reflects the type of work the Government has, in fairness, been doing reasonably well.  Colleagues and I pushed hard at meetings of our parliamentary party before the election for action on high rates of public sector pay.  The last budget included a provision to impose a limit on salaries in the public sector and it is good that the Government has continued that initiative.</P>
        <P>The first part of amendment No. 8<i>a</i> proposes particular power and functionality for the Minister for public expenditure and reform to develop policies for combating the high salary and pension rates of senior employees of the public service bodies and of excluded bodies.  The second part of the amendment proposes &ldquo;to maintain a published record of all purchase orders in respect of the procurement of goods and services by and on behalf of Departments of State and other public service bodies&rdquo;.  The programme for Government includes a commitment that purchase orders above a certain amount &mdash; &euro;20,000, as I recall &mdash; will be published by the relevant Department.  The provision in this amendment offers a statutory basis for that commitment and makes it a function of the Minister for public expenditure and reform.</P>
        <P>As Senator Jim Walsh said, we should not simply talk about value for money or formulate policies in that regard; we must take action to ensure we get value for money across the board.  One of the ways in which that can be achieved is to examine the very high salaries that pertain at the highest levels of the public sector.  This level of remuneration takes account neither of the economic reality of the public finances nor of commercial realities.  People in similar jobs in private sector bodies are paid far less, and I am sure the bonus culture does not apply in companies with massive debts and where there have been losses for years.  I concur with those who have observed that it seems to be a case of the elite looking after the elite.</P>
        <P>The amendment seeks to set down in statute that the Minister will deal with this matter as part of his or her functions.  It is also important that the Oireachtas sends out a message that we want the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to tackle this issue as one of the core functions of his Ministry.  Public service reform is about ensuring services work better for the citizen.  It is also about demonstrating that those who are paid from public moneys are in touch with citizens and are not intent on ripping off the system with unjustifiable salaries, which makes all of us lose faith in the public service.  In that context, it would be helpful if the Minister would maintain a record of all purchases in respect of the procurement of goods and services by Departments and public service bodies.  This would help to restore public confidence because everybody will be able to see what is being bought and whether value for money is obtained.  If that information is available on a website, people might be in a position to telephone their local Deputy or the relevant Department if they know how a product or service can be obtained at a cheaper price.  This would be greatly advantageous to Departments.  That type of system is already in place in Britain.  The Minister, fair play to him, is following the Tory playbook and getting a lot of ideas from that party.  One idea the Government has taken from its British counterpart relates to the use of ministerial cars, an issue I promoted in my own parliamentary <Col N="65"/>party but which was not acted on.  However, the Tories went further than the current Government by getting rid of cars and drivers for almost all Ministers.  The Government has not even done that and, moreover, it has appointed its friends and colleagues to driver positions rather than allocating those posts to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a win-win situation for Ministers in that they received public acclamation for taking action while securing a certain benefit for themselves.</P>
        <P>The setting up of a website detailing all Departments&rsquo; purchase orders would represent a major move towards the transparency and openness promised in the programme for Government.  We are calling for action on that promise by giving it a legislative basis in the functions of the Minister.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It will be interesting to listen all afternoon to Senator Byrne putting forward his amendments and prefacing each by saying how important it is.  I am sure they are all important, but they are also tenuous.  The proposal in amendment No. 8<i>a</i> regarding purchase orders is clearly accounted for in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The provision regarding levels of salaries and pensions in the public service is not related to this Bill at all but to legislation which will be brought forward by the Minister in due course.  Are we sure these amendments are in order?  I already posed this question and was ruled out of order myself, but I am obliged to ask again.

	<P>The Tory Government is certainly not the inspiration for the Minister&rsquo;s actions.  As far as the Department of public expenditure and reform is concerned, all information on public expenditure belongs to the public and should be available for public use.  The Department&rsquo;s aim is to put Ireland at the leading edge in terms of openness and transparency of public data.  The Department&rsquo;s website already includes general information on all aspects of public expenditure and reform, including an overview of general expenditure trends since 1994 and an outline of the main priorities for public service reform.</P>
        <P>Senator Thomas Byrne and others rightly observed that the Minister has already moved swiftly on the issues encompassed in the first part of this amendment.  In particular, the Government has agreed on the introduction of a general pay ceiling of &euro;200,000 for future appointments to higher positions across the public service and a general pay ceiling of &euro;250,000 for future appointments to chief executive officer posts within commercial semi-State bodies.  We have also taken action in regard to Government pay.</P>

In addition to historical and annual information, it is intended that monthly Exchequer data, general Government expenditure data and the purchase orders made by each Department and Government agency will be made available for public scrutiny.  This approach will encompass the information the Senator is seeking.  Therefore, I do not consider it appropriate to agree to the necessity of accepting the proposed amendment.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  The motion is aimed at highlighting the current plight of whistleblowers in Ireland, the cost to Irish society of not protecting whistleblowers and the simple measures that must be introduced to protect them as a matter of urgency.  This debate is particularly timely, given the allegations coming from Rostrevor House Nursing Home and how the allegations of workers at the home were treated after blowing the whistle.  However, the issue deserves Members&rsquo; attention nonetheless.</P>
        <P>For decades we have been hearing about the devastating consequences of cover-ups, abuse and corruption in Ireland, from the sexual and physical abuse of children, graphically recounted in the Murphy report and elsewhere, to the abuse and maltreatment of former patients at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, as well as from the scandal of the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes competition to the economic catastrophe wrought on the country through wrongdoing in the banks.  We have learned that silence is not always golden.  In addition, we have heard about the plight of those who have chosen not to remain silent.  We have learned how whistleblowers such as Eugene McErlean, former head of audit at Allied Irish Banks, and Noel Wardick at the Irish Red Cross have been ignored and lost their jobs for reporting concerns in good faith.  The story of Bernadette Sullivan at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital shows how whistleblowers are often ostracised and isolated for having reported on one of their own.</P>
        <P>The latest accounts of alleged abuse at Rostrevor House Nursing Home show how the most vulnerable in society can be exposed to and always will be at risk of cruelty and neglect.  A total of 14 staff have been made redundant because of the closure of the nursing home and <Col N="69"/>two of the whistleblowers dismissed.  It has been found, to the cost both of the whistleblower and the victims of wrongdoing, that abuse continues and will happen for as long as the need to protect those who speak out is ignored.  Abuse will continue for as long as society fails to punish those who silence workers attempting to tell the truth.  Unfortunately, when the Rostrevor House Nursing Home workers all lost their jobs, the message sent to workers was that if one reported abuse, together with other innocent colleagues, one would lose one&rsquo;s job, that one&rsquo;s professional reputation might be ruined and that one would not receive support from either HIQA or the HSE.</P>
        <P>Unlike the United Kingdom, with its Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, and New Zealand, with its Protected Disclosures Act 2000, Ireland does not have an overarching whistleblower protection law.  After a series of political corruption scandals, a Bill proposing such a law was tabled in 1999 by the Labour Party.  It languished in the Government&rsquo;s programme for seven years before being dropped because according to the then Minister of State, Tony Killeen, &ldquo;[a] single all-encompassing legislative proposal on whistleblowing would be complex and cumbersome, take considerable time to enact and would not be user friendly for the general public.&rdquo;  These complexities were never fully explained by the then Government and neither did it explain how a single comprehensive and overarching Act would be less user-friendly than a piecemeal, incoherent and scattered legislative approach.  Instead, it chose to introduce legislation on a sectoral basis in a process begun in 1998 and which became official policy in 2006.  It is an approach that only protects employees in some professions and sectors, which leaves employees and other potential whistleblowers in other sectors with little, if any, legal protection.</P>
        <P>Shockingly, there is no statutory protection for whistleblowers in financial services, or in respect of company law issues or the Civil Service.  Particularly important from the point of view of the motion, the protections pertaining to nursing home and medical malpractice lag behind other whistleblower provisions in Irish law.  This point was borne out by a recent study undertaken by the centre for health policy and management at TCD, the findings of which revealed that 88% of nursing staff respondents in Irish hospitals had observed an incident of poor care in the past six months.  The findings indicated that 70% of those who had observed an incident of poor care reported it.  However, only one in four nurses who had reported poor care was satisfied with the way the organisation had handled his or her concerns.</P>
        <P>Whistleblowing in health care settings is extremely important.  For instance, the UK-based Public Concern at Work organisation notes that in the last decade public safety, including patient safety in health care settings, consistently ranked in the top five concerns reported to its helpline.</P>
        <P>The international evidence clearly shows the value of whistleblowing.  More than one in four cases of corruption and fraud is disclosed by whistleblowers.  Many cases of sexual abuse and wrongdoing at work are uncovered by whistleblowers.  The financial benefits alone are worthy of note.  For example, the Department of Justice in the United States has claimed that whistleblowers have saved the American taxpayer $21 billion since the mid-1980s.  Our counterparts in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa introduced comprehensive safeguards for whistleblowers a long time ago.  In the UK, these protections have been used effectively and without legal mishap to foster a culture where speaking up is much more the norm than is the case in Ireland.  Most common law jurisdictions have recognised the importance of flexible comprehensive laws in preventing corruption, fraud, waste of public resources, discrimination and sexual abuse.  Our current sectoral approach allows only for narrowly defined categories of workers to report very narrowly defined categories of offences.  Workers in our financial services, agency staff in hospitals and private health care providers, airline pilots and those reporting violations of company law, are all exposed to retaliation by their <Col N="70"/>employers.  This uneven standard of protection creates uncertainty in the mind of the person reporting wrongdoing at work.  Such doubt can only have a chilling effect on the prospective witness or whistleblower and will continue to pose a barrier to the development of a culture of transparency in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must guard against complacency on this issue.  Any old over-arching law in this area is not enough.  While the introduction of generic Private Members&rsquo; Bills on whistleblower protection in 2010 and again this year was welcome, and particular credit must again go to the Labour Party on this issue, these Bills are still not without their flaws.&ensp;  The protection offered therein is still too narrow and does not cover persons falling outside the traditional employer-employee relationship.  In particular, migrant workers, such as those involved in the current Rostrevor case, and who comprise 16% of workers in the health and home care sectors, would not be protected by the enactment of the Labour and, now, the Technical Group Bill as it currently stands.  This has potentially very serious repercussions for a group of people whose vulnerability is heightened due to their limited employment and residency rights.  Non-executive directors, contractors and consultants, too, fall outside the traditional model and thus fall not to be protected under this proposed legislation.  Another lacuna is that the Bill does not propose criminal sanctions against those who attempt to cover up a report that may be made by a whistleblower to the authorities or who retaliate against a whistleblower reporting concerns about criminal wrongdoing.</P>
        <P>It is also worth mentioning that compensation for workers found to have been victims of whistleblower retaliation should be proportionate to the impact of the retaliation.  The current provision of two years&rsquo; salary under the Unfair Dismissals Act does not go nearly far enough to compensate many of those whistleblowers who have often lost everything.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Employment Permits Act 2006, already offer whistleblower compensation that is deemed to be just and equitable in the circumstances and these provisions could easily be provided for in new legislation.</P>
        <P>Given all we have learned about wrongdoing in all sectors of society and the economy, it is time we introduced a whistleblower law that would protect every worker, irrespective of their nationality or employment status, a person who honestly reports a concern about wrongdoing, waste and other risks to the public good.  It is time we introduced a law that challenges the culture of secrecy and impunity, a law that shows we have learned from the mistakes which have cost this nation and its people so dearly.</P>
        <P>I note and I am grateful for the interest of the Government and Sinn F&eacute;in in proposing amendments to this legislation.  However, I must point out that Transparency International Ireland, to whom I am greatly indebted in the preparation of this motion &mdash; Mr. John Devitt of Transparency International Ireland is in the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery.  In consultation with Mr. Devitt, the following points could be made about the motion.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s amendments look rather similar to the original motion.  They focus on the issue of white-collar crime and there is a valid point to be made in this regard but it is a point which, in the view of Transparency International Ireland and in my view, could distract from the purpose and impact of this motion which is to identify the need for over-arching whistleblower legislation which is primarily to do with the protection of the persons involved.  It is to do with whistleblowers not just where they are reporting on fraud or white-collar crime but in all sorts of different situations.  It is clear that over-arching legislation is required to guarantee a standard of protection for people, as distinct from a piecemeal, hit and miss approach, sector by sector, where there are uneven protections for different groups and for some groups, no protection at all.  It is quite clear that by having over-arching legislation, a standard can be achieved.  It may be necessary in other legislation to deal with the particular issues facing particular sectors but it is absolutely essential <Col N="71"/>to have standard whistleblower legislation of an over-arching nature of the kind that pertains in Great Britain.</P>
        <P>The only thing wrong with the Government&rsquo;s amendment is that it does not go far enough.  It is quite admirable in what it proposes but it fails in its lack of detail to address the other kind of protections needed.  The issue of migrant workers demonstrates clearly that whereas legislation to guarantee the rights of whistleblowers in certain circumstances is essential, there is also the need for wider protection.  I give as an example a person who loses his or her job as a result of making a disclosure in the public interest which leads to the closing down of a nursing home.  In that situation what is clearly called for is some kind of protective approach on the part of the State, similar to what applies in the case of victims of human trafficking where there is a kind of administrative system within the Department of Justice and Equality which, at least in theory, provides victims of human trafficking with various supports.  In the case of a migrant, one does not wish to have such a person disincentivised from making a report in the public interest.  It is quite clear that a person who fears losing his or her job as a result of the closure of the institution about which they have an important complaint to make, will be slow to make that report.  Therefore, it would be necessary for the State to provide assistance for the person who might lose his or her job.  In the case of migrant workers who might need a transfer of their work permit to any new employment, it could be a fast-tracking of that application.  It is more than just a case of legislating.  What is needed is a whole policy and legislative framework that will go on to change the culture in the country and create a culture where people will feel positive about making a necessary disclosure.</P>

	<P>I second the motion.  I express my appreciation to Senator Mullen for tabling this motion as it is a topic that needs to be discussed and one that is worthy of debate.  I note the amendments which add to the debate.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is quite a long time since he was a Member of this House when we worked together.</P>
        <P>I have some experience of a whistleblower.  Some years ago when I was running my supermarket company I received a telephone call asking me to meet a person who worked for one of our suppliers.  I was told the supplier was cheating.  The product being delivered to my company was not what had been promised.  The supplier was putting a dye into the product to make it look like a different product.  The employee had a choice.  He was tempted to go to the newspapers and make a disclosure but had he gone to the newspapers it would have done our company a significant amount of harm.  Instead he came to me.  I went to the supplier and the supplier denied the activity but, suddenly, things changed and the product became a different product.  It was not available to us for a couple of weeks and it was clear they were cheating.  That employee had a choice.  Had he gone to the newspapers and had they published the complaint, the supplier would have been damaged &mdash; although deserving to be damaged &mdash; but it would also have damaged the customers of that supplier.  Therefore, I have some sympathy for whatever decision will be reached in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have to be very careful.  We do not want to find that by setting up whistleblowing legislation, we set up legislation which encourages what I call, denunciation, for example, where a person makes a statement.  I refer to an incident last week &mdash; nothing to do with whistleblowing &mdash; where an individual made a statement about a very well-known personality and it turns out to be incorrect.  The harm that could have been done by that statement is just a reminder of how careful we must be to avoid encouraging denunciation.  When I look back at history I think of two incidences of where denunciation was used.  The Gestapo in the 1930s only had to say <Col N="72"/>they had a belief a person had done something and that person&rsquo;s name was ruined.  A few hundred years previously in the Spanish Inquisition, denunciation was common-place.  A person&rsquo;s good name could be damaged very easily.  The mere hint of a slur can do a great deal of harm because people are of the view there is no smoke without fire.  We need whistleblower legislation but we need to be careful.  Given the experience of the banks in recent times there is little doubt but that we need such legislation.   We want to avoid what I would call a crank&rsquo;s charter, where people can go public too easily and do a huge amount of harm.  There is merit in having legislation on whistleblowers.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen correctly pointed out that it seems to work quite well in Britain.  We have approached the issue in a piecemeal fashion until now in Ireland, going through it sector by sector.  Perhaps that is the way to deal with it.  We should encourage it.  I understand we have it in the areas of health and safety and banking.  If we do not, we should ensure we achieve something.  I want to ensure that whatever legislation is introduced is acceptable and does not do more harm.  Like my colleagues I was shocked by the reports on care homes for the elderly, State and clerical institutions and hospitals.  I sometimes wonder why we are surprised at the scale of sexual and physical abuse of the most vulnerable or the prevalence of wrongdoing across society when so little has been done over the years to protect those who speak up.</P>
        <P>The whistleblowers working in Rostrevor nursing home and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, to which Senator Mullen referred, are examples of what has happened.  The story of the Rostrevor whistleblowers shows how vulnerable migrant and agency workers are in our health service.  Eugene McErlean of AIB and others in the Red Cross demonstrate how vulnerable even the most senior officials are when reporting concerns about financial irregularities or failures in corporate governance.  Above all, these stories show that little has been done by the State for those who have served so many in the past.  These courageous individuals continue to face unemployment and a life of uncertainty because they dared to act in the public interest.  They get little thanks and no compensation for sacrificing their welfare for the common good.  Others have blown the whistle and discovered that their colleagues do not accept what they said.  Such people have lost out and almost been sent to Coventry.</P>
        <P>I fail to see why we have taken so long to introduce some form of whistleblowing guarantees and legislation that would protect workers in the public and private sectors.  Such legislation, as Senator Mullen said, has operated without any difficulty in Britain and Northern Ireland for well over ten years.  It has protected workers and the reputation of those accused of wrongdoing without much drama.  If such a law can enjoy the support of the British business community, why would it face any opposition here?  The reason is because of what I said earlier, namely, that business is concerned about an approach that would aim to solve all problems with one broad sweep of the brush.  We need to introduce whistleblowers legislation but it has to be done carefully, sector by sector, to avoid the pitfalls into which we could otherwise fall.  It is worthy of consideration and the motion and amendments are leading in the right direction to enable us to find a solution.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I thank the Minister for being with us.  I am grateful to Senator Mullen for the theme of this important motion and the need to debate the requirement for whistleblowers legislation.  The Government intends to provide protection for those who come forward in good faith, regardless of where they are from or the state of their employment.  We face a monumental task because we cannot legislate for people, to tell the truth.  We can offer a safeguard and create an environment which it makes it easier for those people who wish to come forward and tell a story or disclose something difficult, but we cannot make them do that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I draw the attention of the House to an event I wrote about in January 2009, the commemoration of the 25 years since the death of the teenager Ann Lovett, something which many people here will remember.  Many people will remember the moment when it was disclosed.  As I wrote in 2009, when she and her tiny baby died, the town that she lived in, Granard, folded them away just as towns and villages in Ireland had done for years.  However, someone in the town understood the enormity of the event and saw fit to tell the media.  Some five days after the funeral, the nation learned of Ann&rsquo;s cold and lonely death, her school bag and her dead son found lying next to her as her life faded away.  It was a turning point in this country.  It was a moment when we saw fit to be able to stand up and tell the truth about something which was very difficult and had happened many times before in Ireland but people had been afraid to come forward.</P>
        <P>In my career as a journalist and documentary maker I have persuaded many people to speak out, even when there was nothing in it for them.  In many cases there is nothing in it for people to come forward and speak up.  We must ensure at every stage that we can offer some protection so that even if there is nothing directly in it for a person, we seek to protect them.  In the first programme ever broadcast on investigating the abuse of children by members of the clergy, people were literally shaking and crying as they told of their pain and experience, yet were unable to say out loud what had happened because of their fear.  They were afraid, if we can believe it, of their families, friends, neighbours or communities.  Effectively, they were afraid of us.  We are afraid of ourselves if we cannot stand up and own up.  That is the culture which we must begin to try to encourage.  We can do this with legislation but it will take time.  When I exposed malpractices in the beef industry, I was personally criticised and told constantly that in the interests or good of Ireland, I should stay quiet.  I found it an extraordinary irony that, for the good of Ireland, we should conceal the truth.  This was not so long ago.  It was 1991, a mere 20 years ago.</P><Col N="74"/>
        <P>I take great heart that I can stand in this House today to discuss whistleblowers legislation and support an amendment in which we recognise the need not to cover up, that the truth is the most important thing and that encouraging people at all stages in all places at all times to come forward with their stories is what we need to do as a society and country to grow up and take our place.  If we want to stay in the darkness of the 19th or 20th centuries and encourage people to stay quiet, we will do ourselves extraordinary damage.</P>
        <P>In 1999 Deputy Pat Rabbitte of the Labour Party introduced a Whistleblowers Protection Bill which was subsequently parked for many years and finally abandoned 2006.  The old bogeymen, legal and constitutional issues, were given as the reason for that.  That was then and this is now.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael have pledged to introduce overarching whistleblowers legislation.  I hope the model for this legislation will be the Public Interest Disclosure Act which, as we know, has worked very well.  To our shame, it has been working in the United Kingdom for the past 11 years.  The words &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; are at the heart of that legislation and should also be at the heart of whistleblowing legislation when brought forward here.  It is not about what is interesting to the public; car crash, gossip-style stories should not drive such legislation.  We are talking genuinely about the public interest.  The Government will introduce legislation to ensure that in the public interest we can finally bring to light issues that cause trouble, including corruption, fraud and even death.  These matters are at the heart of our society and although we cannot legislate to get rid of them, we can encourage finding a better way to cope with their causes under law.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the principle behind the motion.  Having served on the Government side of the House also, I know it is not unusual to receive cross-party support for a motion, although an amendment may be tabled.  When I was on the Government benches, I was often perplexed that we were inevitably instructed to table an amendment to good, non-controversial motions, even though the principle was broadly accepted by the Government of the day.  The Government, with its fresh ideas, might consider supporting good, well meaning motions which would then have the unanimous support of the House.</P>
        <P>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen has made his points well in support of the introduction of whistleblowing legislation.  The last Government did not ignore this matter, but, rightly or wrongly, previous Ministers for Justice and Equality were advised that a sectoral approach was the correct one to take.  I do not think it was, however; a universal approach should be taken to setting out our strategy to protect whistleblowers.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to achieving this objective should be commended and supported.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach recently mentioned a proposal to hold a referendum on this issue which might be held on the same day as the Presidential election.  I would not have a great difficulty with that, except that the most important referendum we need to hold, sooner rather than later, is that on children&rsquo;s rights, a subject which has been on the agenda for over a decade.  It should be fast-tracked.  Such a referendum will be complex, serious and important; therefore, it should not be held in tandem with any other.</P>
        <P>The last Government and its predecessor introduced some whistleblowing provisions in a piecemeal fashion adopting a sectoral approach, including in the Health Act 2007, the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007, the Labour Services Act 2009, the Chari<Col N="75"/>ties Act 2008, the Chemicals Act 2008 and the Employment Law Compliance Act 2008, among others.  Therefore, a serious list of proposals were introduced by the last Government.</P>
        <P>If one takes the Rostrevor House Nursing Home case, it is interesting that there seems to be a stigma in Irish society in that we are slow to come forward to expose wrongdoing within particular organisations.  I am not sure if it is just a fear of being exposed.  Perhaps there is something in the Irish psyche that we hate grassing on others, as a result of which, with or without protection for whistleblowers, people are slow to put up their hands and come forward with information.  Senator Feargal Quinn said somebody had come to him directly and that he had two options.  It was appropriate that he went down that road, rather than going to the media to expose the matter.</P>
        <P>While we obviously wish to protect whistleblowers, we must be careful because we do not want to end up with a crank&rsquo;s charter.  I was impressed by the latter phrase.  As a member of the legal profession, I am aware that a number of years ago a number of individuals who were paranoid about solicitors and the legal profession in general set up websites.  In most instances, they were extremists.  In a recent case, in which an engineer was blatantly wrong, six firms of solicitors and 19 defendants ended up in the High Court.  Therefore, one must be careful in dealing with such issues because it was obvious from day one that he was a crank.  I am not saying, however, that there is no wrongdoing in the legal profession.  There obviously is and it should be weeded out, but there are also extremities.  I ask the Minister to ensure that when the legislation is introduced, there will be balance.  By all means, we should protect whistleblowers &mdash; 90% of them are decent people who want to expose a wrong in their place of work &mdash; but at the same time we must ensure there will be some safeguards in place to ensure we do not end up with a crank&rsquo;s charter.</P>
        <P>I cite the case of a medical person who had 5,000 or 6,000 leaflets circulated about them in a particular town.  Damage could have been done to this decent person by somebody who had a personality difficulty with the medical doctor in question.  We must ensure this activity is curtailed also.</P>
        <P>I welcome the thrust of this laudable motion and thank Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen for introducing it.  I also welcome the tenet of the Government side in stating it supports it but wants to do its own thing, although I would like to see the day when we can adopt a reformed approach.  As I said, when I was on the Government benches, we inevitably opposed Opposition motions, but we should take a broader view in the future.  If a motion receives all-party support in principle, perhaps the Government might take it on board and deal with it when the relevant legislation is brought before the House.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock, and congratulate him on his appointment.  I also commend Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen for bringing the motion before the House.  </P>
        <P>The commitments given in the programme for Government are specific in regard to whistleblowing.  The programme states the Government will introduce whistleblowers legislation.  The Government has reaffirmed its commitment to legislate to protect whistleblowers who speak out against wrongdoing or cover-ups, whether in the public or private sector.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will shortly seek Government approval to prepare framework legislation providing for a universal legal charter covering reporting in good faith and providing protection for all employees in the public and private spheres who engage in disclosure.  The work will be advanced by a specially created new reform unit with the Minister&rsquo;s Department, about which we were informed earlier today.  The Minister has instructed that this work be given top priority.</P><Col N="76"/>
        <P>The Minister envisages that the provisions to be adopted in Ireland should reflect those applicable in the UK.  Its key whistleblowing legislation is the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998.  This applies to almost all workers and employees who ordinarily work in Great Britain.  The areas covered include criminal offences, risk to health and safety, failure to comply with a legal obligation, a miscarriage of justice and environmental damage.  The protections available to all UK employees under the UK Act were given legal effect in Northern Ireland by the public interest disclosure order 1998 and came into operation on 31 October 1999.  The order offers a framework of protection against victimisation or dismissal for workers who blow the whistle on criminal behaviour or wrongdoing, as defined in the legislation.  All employees and other whistleblowers protected under the Act are given equal protection.  The same protections are not available universally in the Republic of Ireland and the Government intends to make good this deficiency as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>The main objectives of the proposed legislation are to bring about a change in behaviour and attitude towards wrongdoing in Irish public and corporate life.  That would be welcome and is long overdue.  I hope the proposed legislation will be brought in by the Minister with the greatest possible expediency.  A further objective is that the introduction of comprehensive whistleblower legislation will bring about a radical change in company behaviour and create a safer environment for people to speak out about wrongdoing in the workplace or in public life.  I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the opportunity to discuss whistleblowing legislation.  I welcome the work done by Senator Mullen in tabling this motion.  I also acknowledge the work of Transparency International in this area.  It provided an excellent briefing for us which assisted us in our preparations.</P>
        <P>In preparing for the debate on this motion, I talked to many NGOs because they are often left to deal with some of the consequences in this regard.  I refer in particular to NGOs working in the area of older people, such as Age Action, whose representatives speak about front-line carers being the ones who have the exchanges with older people and who are seen as a trusted source.  We need to ensure appropriate legislation is in place.  An inspector will not simply inspect a premises and automatically see what is happening there.  We need to protect workers whereby, if they come forward with an allegation, first, it is seriously considered and, second, action is taken.</P>
        <P>The whistleblowers who came forward in the case of the Rostrevor nursing home did the State an excellent service.  They risked everything to stop abuse happening.  This took courage and integrity.  The position of migrant workers has been highlighted by Migrant Rights Centre Ireland.  Many migrant workers are particularly vulnerable because their work permits are connected to their employer.  Therefore, there is a fundamental problem in encouraging them to be whistleblowers, where necessary.  Senator Mullen answered a question I was going to ask about the 16% of workers in the Irish labour force who are migrant workers.  I understand this is 16% of health and home care sector workers.  I was surprised at that high figure.</P>
        <P>We need to protect our whistleblowers because, if we do not, it sends a message to those in power that they can use that power.  I understand what Senator Quinn said in this respect.  Whistleblowing is not about running to the newspapers; it is about responsible employers and taking action.  It is the carrot and stick approach.  People need to feel that, if they do not take action, something will happen and that there will be consequences.  That is the way life works.  For me, that is a strong point as to why we need whistleblowing legislation.  The State needs this protection for whistleblowers.  It needs to ensure workers are confident, feel protected and feel they can put the welfare of people such as the patients in the Rostrevor nursing home first <Col N="77"/>and foremost rather than having to be concerned about their residency status, worker permits and other related issues.  This legislation is extremely important because it will a law that will challenge the culture of secrecy in Ireland.  Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe spoke on that issue.  She rightly said that we cannot legislate for people to tell the truth.  We can, however, protect people and ensure there is an appropriate culture to ensure people come forward and tell.</P>
        <P>On that note, I acknowledge the words of Senator O&rsquo;Donovan. The promised referendum on children&rsquo;s rights is long overdue.  I acknowledge that this legislation is not about children but it is about culture in Ireland.  It is about listening to people and ensuring that, if people come forward with an allegation, we will listen.  People believe that has all been accepted, but six years ago I started working with the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance.  I did an interview with a very well-renowned national broadcaster and talked about the need to listen to children.  One would think that is a simple enough statement particularly when it comes to abuse.  I was challenged on public radio with the response that children lie so why would we listen to children.  Six years have past.  I do not need to convince as many people that we need to listen to children but there is still a culture where people would claim that people lie, it is in their interests to lie so why would we listen.</P>
        <P>There is twofold reason I am supportive of this legislation.  I believe it will have the effect of changing our culture in Ireland, protecting employees and protecting employers in order that they can be responsible, take action and change that culture within their organisations.  Successful businesses tell us that the culture of the organisation drives success.  State agencies all too often have become complacent and we need to ensure we have that culture.  We have seen the work of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, recently.  Increasing demands have been made on it to get involved in more areas, especially in the child care sector, because it is building up a reputation of being able to listen to people.</P>
        <P>I support the motion.  I note the commitment in the programme for Government to bringing forward legislation in this area and I hope we will see it shortly.  For me, this is about reversing the culture of fear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, to the House.  I also welcome the debate on this Private Members&rsquo; motion and the forthcoming legislation on this area which I hope will come to the House shortly.  It will be a welcome addition to the employee protection law and it has wide implications for our society.  In a country where the stroke and the shortcut is all too common &mdash; we saw a little of that not too far form this House recently &mdash; the proposed legislation will be particularly welcome.</P>
        <P>We have seen repeated instances in nursing homes of staff who should be praised for having risked their careers in speaking out.  The report by Ms Justice Maureen Harding Clark on the Neary case in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, to which Senator Mullen referred, found that concerns were being continually raised as early as 1978.  It was not until nearly 20 years later that two midwives risked their careers to highlight their concerns.  At that time, and it is still probably the case although to a lesser extent today, the authority of some senior medical staff was seldom questioned and the devastating effects that had on the lives of hundreds of women are all too clear to us.  This reluctance to speak out was shared by hospital managers, junior doctors, anaesthetists, surgical nurses, general practitioners and many more.</P>
        <P>We do not need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to whistleblowers legislation because the Public Interest Disclosure Act in the UK has been seen to work rather well.  In its passage through the parliament in the UK it received cross-party support and was supported by trade unions and business organisations because it was seen to be in everyone&rsquo;s interest that such legislation would be forthcoming.  It should, therefore, be welcomed here across parties and by all sectoral interests as well.</P><Col N="78"/>
        <P Just="Left">In the UK it has created greater awareness of employee rights, greater willingness to speak out about wrongdoing and more positive public attitudes towards speaking out.  It is seen as a model that many other countries have adopted as well.  I do not want to give too many statistics but a survey in the UK found that 86% of senior executives feel more free to report a case of suspected fraud or bribery compared with 54% of similar grades in European countries that do not have whistleblower protection legislation.  However, the UK model is not without its problems.  One of the concerns raised is the issue surrounding the definition of what is reasonable and in good faith.  Several court judgments have clarified this in the UK and it is now recognised that the words &ldquo;without maliciousness&rdquo;, when added, are sufficient.  That would go some way towards addressing Senator Quinn&rsquo;s concerns in regard to the cranks charter.  I agree with Senator Quinn in that regard.</P>
        <P>Another matter for concern highlighted in the UK legislation has not been addressed, namely, the extension of protection to apply to proceedings before a professional body when an individual may be at risk not alone of losing his or her job but his or her career.  I refer to a case in the UK, Harwood <i>v.</i> the Central Council for Nursing and Midwifery, involving the removal of the principal from the register of nursing, thereby ensuring she lost her licence to practice.  The facts of the case relate to a secret recording of neglect of a patient.  While the fitness to practise committee balanced the rights of patient confidentiality with the whistleblowers legislation, it conceded that this was a case of exceptionally serious concern.  The nurse&rsquo;s name was subsequently removed from the register, resulting in her losing her job and career.  This issue has particular reference to a professional body and organisation.</P>
        <P>While the proposed legislation goes a long way towards offering protection to whistleblowers, it is not a panacea for all problems.  It has proved difficult to protect persons after the event from victimisation or unscrupulous or vindictive employers.  More than 15% of whistleblowers in the UK were dismissed from their jobs before their cases came before the UK equivalent of our appropriate officer.  We can learn a lesson from this.  There is no mention of whether the findings of the appropriate officer would be made public, which I believe is a serious weakness of the proposed legislation on whistleblowers.  It is strange that a law on the promotion of transparency and accountability would not itself be accountable and transparent, which is the least we would require.</P>
        <P>While clearly no one wants the establishment of another quango, I would like to see in place a body similar to the Public Concern at Work Organisation in the UK, which offers support for people availing of this type of legislation.  This body could be attached to an organisation such as the citizens advice centres.  The four main areas in the UK where the Act is seen as being particularly successful are, in Government, financial services, health and social services, all of which hold a particular resonance with people in Ireland.  This motion is timely, important and not dissimilar to the proposed legislation or proposed amendment to the motion.  With some caveats, I support the motion.  I hope to put forward some amendments to the legislation when it comes before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a whistleblower.  I had the experience when I first returned to Ireland of being involved in a few whistleblowing events which taught me much about the manner in which this country is run.  As a result, I am extraordinarily supportive of all efforts to try to ramp up the level of protection in place for whistleblowers.  Over the years, there has been an increasing level of tolerance and encouragement for whistleblowers who are tackling vested interests other than those which are the government, including the agencies.</P>
        <P>It was apparent to me, when I returned to Ireland in 1993, that there were severe deficiencies in cancer services.  Doctors are accused of waving shrouds and creating public hysteria on <Col N="79"/>alleged deficiencies when they are speaking in their own self interest.  However, by any objective assessment, contemporaneously or historically, it is now widely recognised &mdash; and has been recognised by several Governments &mdash; that the circumstances which applied in cancer care in Ireland in the early to mid-1990s were dramatically below the standards that would be acceptable in an equivalently economically resourced European country at that time.</P>
        <P>When I first started making some noises about this, a senior colleague in my institution, famous not alone for his brilliance as a clinician, researcher and academic but his extraordinary ability to cultivate relationships with officials in the Department of Health and Children and other branches of Government, took me aside for a friendly word and told me: &ldquo;Whatever you do, if you do make any noises about deficiencies in the cancer services, make sure you don&rsquo;t do it individually.  Do it through your representative organisation.  If one does not exist, found one because if you do it on your own you will find yourself in a very substantial degree of personal career peril with officialdom.&rdquo;  I was not, perhaps, then as diplomatic as I am now and had a little difficulty taking this advice.</P>
        <P>When, through the channels, I first made overtures to point out the extraordinary level of problems we had and the fact that in a real and proximate sense patients were every week in this country dying or having their prospect of a cure or survival greatly impeded not by a lack of medical knowledge but a failure of a system to apply knowledge which existed, I found myself frustratingly being thwarted, rebuffed and brushed off as yet another hysterical doctor.  I must admit that after a while this got to me and I decided this should be a matter for vigorous public debate.  During the following year, mid to end 1994 to 1995 I ensured it was.  The process was successful, brought about not alone by me but many others.  In 1995, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Michael Noonan, admitted that there were grotesque deficiencies in the cancer services and set about putting them on the top of the national agenda.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having blown that whistle, I was informed by senior colleagues in my hospital that it was good I had completed the first year of my employment as a consultant because during the first 12 months of one&rsquo;s employment one is on probation and can be terminated, not in the Arnold Schwarzenegger sense but in the career sense.  I was delighted to know I had got over that hurdle.  When attending a meeting of the board of my hospital, I was then told that it was the wish of senior figures that I be less vocal about deficiencies in Government policy on cancer services because it had been communicated to the hospital by certain officials that there was a real chance that planned developments, which were necessary in our hospital, might go elsewhere.  When finally the issue was on the public agenda, I was brought into the Department of Health and Children together with other colleagues for a chat during which we were told that it was the wish of the officials that there be no more public debate about this matter and that it would now be dealt with internally.  When I said that I was not in favour of a policy of omerta, the Sicilian code of silence, on issues of this type we were somewhat brushed off.  It happened.  There was substantial debate about deficiencies about cancer services.  It is an awful shame it had to take that route.  I learned some lessons along the way in regard to how the process works.</P>
        <P>For the reasons outlined, I am defensive of the notion of whistleblowing in the health service.  We must ensure we protect not alone whistleblowers against hospital administrators, senior nurses, senior doctors, religious orders but whistleblowers against the organs of the State.</P>

	<P>The Drogheda story was clearly one of many great tragedies.  Many women had their lives terribly altered and ruined as a result of medical bad practise.  I was struck by the fact that there was no real debate at that time about the structures in place in <Col N="80"/>that hospital.  Why was it that so much could depend on the actions of a single doctor?  Was it appropriate that a unit would be so under-resourced that there was not in place a critical mass of experts who could perform the type of peer review on one another that should take place elsewhere?  Was it appropriate that a hospital, which for many years did not have an intensive care unit, was performing surgery like this?  What would have happened if in the middle of the night somebody started bleeding or if a surgeon panicked and did not know what to do and there was no blood bank on site?   I was always struck by the fact that none of these issues were brought up despite their being critically important.</P>
        <P>I had other experiences.  I recall the famous episode of &ldquo;Father Ted&rdquo; in which he wins the golden cleric award and takes advantage in the pulpit to settle old scores.  I will not do that today because I respect the fact that parliamentary privilege provides us with an opportunity to say things against which an appropriate defence cannot be raised.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, to the House with whom I hope we will have some discussion at a later stage on research issues.  I strongly support the movement towards an increased culture of protection of whistleblowing.  I draw everyone&rsquo;s attention to the fact that there was an attempt, when the last senior specialist contract was introduced several years ago, to ensure it contained a gagging order, implicit in which was the notion that the only people who could be advocates on behalf of patients were the people who owned and ran the service, namely, the Government and its officials.</P>
      
        <P>I am very supportive of Senator Mullen&rsquo;s motion and of the wider legislation.  I hope we can change the culture of whistleblowing in this country.</P>

In the present economic circumstances, people are afraid for their jobs, afraid of damaging promotion prospects and even afraid for the jobs of members of their family.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I wish to give an example of how we have changed our attitude in the past ten years.  Approximately 15 years ago, a Deputy asked me to meet some constituents who had a child with a disability.  There was abuse going on in relation to the child.  Over the previous ten to 12 days the parents had gone to four different groups of people highlighting the problem and their concerns.  They had approached the Garda, the school, the bus owner and the health service, but none of them would act.  When they came to me, I made a call to the health service and the Garda.  I even threatened that I would personally take the family to the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin to have the child examined.  It was only then that action was taken.  No family should have to go through such an experience when a serious allegation was made.  That is the kind of issue we have brushed under the carpet for far too long.  To this day we might think that it does not go on, but it does and we are reluctant and slow to take action.</P>
        <P>Another example occurred in the Department of Health.  For 28 years health boards continually highlighted the issue of nursing home charges, but we hoped the problem would go away.  It ended up costing the Department more than &euro;400 million.  Again, many people were afraid of highlighting the issue and doing something about it.  This was at a time when I am sure many health board employees knew what they were being asked to do was incorrect but because no procedure was available to them to blow the whistle, they were afraid of taking any action.</P>
        <P>We have an opportunity now because there has been a total change in attitude in the past ten years.  However, we have not provided the protection or put the necessary legislation in <Col N="81"/>place.  It is interesting to consider legislation in other countries.  One country&rsquo;s legislation specifies under the heading of &ldquo;disclosure&rdquo;:</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) that a criminal offence has been committed, is being committed or is likely to be committed;</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) that a person has failed, is failing or is likely to fail to comply with any legal obligation to which that person is subject;</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>c</i>) that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, is occurring or is likely to occur;</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>d</i>) that the health or safety of an individual has been, is being or is likely to be endangered;</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>e</i>) that the environment has been, is being or is likely to be damaged.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These are five headings included in that legislation which covers a wide area but at the same time allows people to highlight an issue where they have concern and where protection is given in that country.</P>
        <P>A Senator mentioned the British Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, which has been in place for more than 13 years.  In many countries the requisite legislation is in place.  Sometimes it might be argued that it has gone overboard, but at least we have plenty other legislation to examine and establish best practice for this country.  We need to put in place the necessary protection for people who have genuine concerns.  I therefore welcome the proposal and will support the amendment tabled by the Leader of the House.  There is an urgent need to introduce the necessary legislation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Is c&uacute;is &aacute;thais &eacute; domsa deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an r&uacute;n at&aacute; os comhair an T&iacute; &oacute;n Seanad&oacute;ir Mullen, agus t&aacute; l&uacute;ch&aacute;ir orm go bhfuil an r&uacute;n t&aacute;bhachtach seo os comhair an tSeanaid tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na inniu.  I compliment Senator Mullen on tabling the motion on what can be described as essential legislation to give protection to individuals who simply want to tell the truth and who are often discouraged from doing so owing to the lack of protection they are afforded.  In conjunction with the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators, I look forward to supporting Senator Mullen&rsquo;s proposals in this regard.</P>
        <P>As public representatives, we all receive inquiries or calls from individuals working in the public or private sector who feel the necessity to provide information in an open forum but do not feel confident they can do so because they do not have the legal protection.  It is obviously also a cause of concern to us as public servants that individuals would find themselves in that position.  While one could argue that some progress has been made in recent years through the sectoral approach Senator O&rsquo;Donovan mentioned, whereby some elements of whistleblowers protection was enshrined in various Bills approved by the D&aacute;il and Seanad, that was not the correct manner in which to address this issue.  The Government needs to introduce comprehensive legislation to give protection to people who feel the necessity to provide information to bring honour to their profession through the knowledge they possess.  There have been incidents such as what happened at Rostrevor House where the true facts did not come to light in time and individuals who were under care suffered as a result.  It is incumbent on us as legislators to ensure legislation is introduced as soon as possible to deal with that anomaly.</P>
        <P>The motion notes: &ldquo;that less than 40 per cent of Irish employers claim they promote whistleblowing in the workplace compared to almost 90 per cent in the United Kingdom where universal whistleblower safeguards are enshrined in law&rdquo;.  The facts are startling and show there is a total lack of confidence from an employer and employee point of view.  The facilitation of whistleblowing or telling the truth is not made available.</P><Col N="82"/>
        <P>I welcome that the Government intends to introduce whistleblowers legislation and there were indications that a referendum would be held on the issue at the same time as the presidential election.  I am somewhat disappointed that there appears to be a move to delay this, with the holding of a referendum on the issue being put back to some time in the future, possibly 2012 or later, and that other referenda would be held in conjunction with the presidential election later this year.  It is essential that legislative provision is made to provide whistleblower protection, which is why it is so important that we support the motion.  There should be cross-party support for it because, while we all have our political allegiances, we also have an obligation to ensure the truth is heard and to provide protection in order that people will not feel isolated or believe they will be penalised if they tell the truth.  The position of migrant workers offers one example.  I have spoken to migrant workers in my constituency who sometimes feel because they are in vulnerable employment that they must protect their job rather than do the right thing.  We have an obligation to ensure all citizens of the State, whether they were born here, are given legal protection to tell the truth.  I hope the Government sees sense in the motion which has purpose and will ensure it is supported and fast-tracked, if at all possible.</P>
        <P>Given that the Government is pushing back the date of the referendum which may be held in 2012, this draws us onto the second point, namely, the referendum on the protection of the rights of children, which is vitally important.  It appears this referendum is also being delayed to 2012, which is a major concern.  Never was it more important to protect the 1.1 million children in the State.  The Constitution states all the children of the nation should be cherished equally, yet we are not affording the opportunity to protect them by delaying the legislation.  In the other House yesterday and again today a Private Members&rsquo; motion is being debated to provide for the adoption of children in order to give them loving homes and allow Irish families who want to adopt children the right to do so.  While I say it without confidence, I hope the legislation will be supported by the Government in the other House, given that all of the relevant parties and stakeholders are in agreement with the contents of the motion.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen on bringing forward the motion which is important in terms of the value we place on the truth.  It is important to the protection of vulnerable persons within society, particularly in instances where people are in the care of institutions, including homes for the elderly.  We all know of cases in homes for the elderly in which the care provided may not be at the level it should be.  Some of those working in such institutions may want to say more than they can and they should be free to do so.  While I understand there is an amendment to the motion, I make an appeal that the motion be supported and the legislation driven forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues in commending Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen for bringing forward this very important Private Members&rsquo; motion.  We lag way behind, unjustifiably so, in bringing forward whistleblower legislation.  As was pointed out, such legislation has been in place in the United Kingdom since 1998.  When one considers some of the scandals that have happened in this country in recent decades, their revelation required the bravery of individuals who were prepared to put their necks on the line.  I think, in particular, of what Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe has done during the years and the great work done by journalists such as those involved in &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo;.  It should not be necessary for individuals to go to journalists to have wrongs righted or exposed.  There should be a mechanism within the State to protect those who decide to do the right thing.</P>
        <P>There is never smoke without fire; the problem is that the smoke is invisible.  There is, unfortunately, an Irish culture of &ldquo;hear no evil, see no evil&rdquo;, whereby a certain minority who know a wrong is being done are not prepared to admit it is not right and should be corrected. <Col N="83"/> Whistleblower legislation might help to change the culture of saying nothing and keeping to oneself information on wrong behaviour.  We must look at what has been done by brave individuals during the years.</P>
        <P>I am glad the new Government has included the introduction of whistleblower legislation as a priority item in the programme for Government.  While there is an amendment to the motion, which I support, we are taking different roads to the one location.  Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen can be reassured that the sentiments he has outlined echo those of the Government and Members of the House on all sides.  I do not want to repeat what others have said but simply note that what has taken place during the years in various institutions such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE has been nothing short of a disgrace.  Had we whistleblower legislation in place ten or 15 years ago, it would have made life much easier for many and, possibly, protected the lives of some of the most vulnerable in society.</P>

	<P>Our history is littered with examples of how poor government gives way to bad practice.  Those who had the power to protect became the abusers of those who were the most innocent in our society.  Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe said we cannot legislate to make people tell the truth.  However, we need to ensure the legislation we put in place facilitates as much as possible that truth and transparency come to the fore.  It does not bode well when the word we use to describe these people has negative connotations.  The word &ldquo;whistleblower&rdquo; as Gaeilge is &ldquo;sceithre&rdquo;, which means squealer.  We need to try to encourage truth and transparency.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to the value we place on the truth and we need to ensure words we use do not have negative connotations.</P>
        <P>When people come forward to tell the truth and to highlight abuses in the system, they should not be viewed negatively and looked down on.  A good friend of mine raised an issue about a public hospital.  He very much rejects the use of the word &ldquo;whistleblower&rdquo; because of the way he was treated in the workplace and the way he was forced to leave.</P>
        <P>We need to be advocates for people who come forward, tell the truth and shine a light on these abuses and to ensure they receive as much respect as possible.  We need to examine use of word &ldquo;whistleblower&rdquo; or &ldquo;sceithre&rdquo; because it does not bode well for people who tell the truth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Howlin, who is a very appropriate Minister to take this motion.  I agree with the previous speaker from Sinn F&eacute;in, Senator Kathryn Reilly, who said there may be some difficulty with the word &ldquo;whistleblower&rdquo; because in Ireland there has been a tradition of not particularly warming to informants.  I remember Liam O&rsquo;Flaherty&rsquo;s book, The Informer.  She referred to squealers and so on.  However, we have the Garda confidential number, which is very important.  It is very important in my area, in particular with the drugs problem, and I approve of it.  We need to cleanse the name and make it acceptable.  I very much welcome the fact that the two previous speakers belong to a party which, in very large part, has accepted this process as part of our democracy.  It is true in regard to tax as well.</P>
        <P>My colleagues on the Independent benches &mdash; I congratulate Senator Mullen, in particular, on placing this important matter before the House &mdash; have concentrated on the medical area, hospitals and so on, so there is not much point in my dealing with that.  However, I concur with every word they said.  I was particularly impressed by the passionate conviction of Senator Crown who is an important voice in this House.</P>
        <P>I have a suggestion which I have made to my friends in Sinn F&eacute;in, to Senator Mullen, who tabled the motion, and to the Leader of the House in a telephone conversation.  It is a pity that every Wednesday we get into this oppositional situation when in circumstances such as this, we are all on the same side.  As we did at my suggestion last week, we should arrive at consensus in this matter, so we can strengthen the Government&rsquo;s hand in addressing it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This requires certain action which I have suggested and which I understand the Leader is considering, that is, to take the motion in the names of Senators Mullen, Quinn and me and add to it the words in the Government amendment which agree and chime with what has already been said.  They are not contentious.  I have suggested to my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues that they consider removing the only contentious words in their amendment which are in the first line, that is, &ldquo;the appalling record of the State&rdquo;.  Words like &ldquo;appalling&rdquo; raise people&rsquo;s hackles.  They have very kindly indicated to me that they would be prepared to delete them.  Their amendment would then start with the words &ldquo;the need to instill an ethos of good business practice&rdquo;.  Who could possibly disagree with that?  Their amendment calls on the Government to do certain things, the first four of which are directly transcribed from and support our motion.  If one does that, one arrives at a composite motion which covers every party in the <Col N="86"/>House, can be agreed unanimously and which should not offend government.  I am waiting to hear from government and the Minister on this matter.</P>
        <P>I do this in an attempt to be helpful and to ensure the dignity and positive engagement of the Seanad with government continues so that we work together in the interests of the people because that is so important.  I am most grateful to my colleagues for having listened to this suggestion.</P>
        <P>I move on to my particular interest in this matter.  I am glad the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is here because I wish to refer to two matters in the financial world and ask for his assistance in bringing them to government.  The first matter is one I raised in 2008 and which is ongoing.  It concerns somebody who was at the top of Irish Small and Medium Enterprises, ISME, and I know the Minister is quite familiar with it and that questions have been asked.  There is no question of doubt in that a man was framed with the assistance of the authorities, of Departments and of certain elements in our fraud squad.  It is an appalling situation.  This happened because there were certain changes in EU regulations and we had to massage the figures.  It is a highly dangerous situation.</P>

	<P>I apologise to the Acting Chairman for my disrespect.  I wonder about the relevance of what Senator Norris is saying.  It seems rather far off the mark from the motion being debated.

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised this matter and it was not challenged.  Questions along these lines in support of what I say were asked by members of the Senator&rsquo;s party.  Questions were asked in the other House by Deputies Ruair&iacute; Quinn, Phil Hogan, Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe &mdash; who is no longer in the Oireachtas &mdash; and Jimmy Deenihan.  It is a non-contentious matter among ourselves, although I agree with the Senator that it is very serious.  It is troubling to have to raise the matter.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to the Senator for inquiring about the relevance of whistleblowing.  This man blew the whistle on a practice that was very dangerous for this country with regard to its position in the European Union.  For his trouble he was rewarded by first being framed &mdash; an act which has been exposed &mdash; and then by losing his job.  He was a whistleblower and he paid for it.  I would have thought that was germane to the debate but if not, I stand corrected.</P>

	<P>I will mention a second case for the Minister, which I ask him to investigate.  I raised the matter on Tuesday, 23 February 2010, and it relates to a series of very serious breaches of liquidity regulations by one of the senior banks in the Irish financial services <Col N="87"/>sector.  The issue was not taken up anywhere except eventually by one newspaper which copied my Adjournment motion and did not attribute anything to me.  It was the <i>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</i>.  I ask the Minister to refer the matter to the appropriate Minister.  The Government took up such matters when in Opposition and I would like to see the colour of its money now.</P>

	<P>Yes, although I regret that I was not able to respond as quickly as I should have because I was otherwise engaged.  For the sake of clarity, Senator Norris&rsquo;s proposals are just that; as I explained earlier to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, only one amendment can be before the House at any one time and the Chair has not received any indication of further amendments and we do not recognise them.  It is a matter for the Leader at the end of the debate to clarify the position with regard to the remarks of Senator Norris.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am gratified to hear that and I would have been surprised if the Senator had left.  I know if he had left it would have involved an urgent matter.  After a long absence I am delighted to be back in the House twice in the same day.  I will take the concluding Stages of the next legislation also.</P>
        <P>I will address Senator Norris&rsquo;s suggestion first.  My officials have indicated that there has been overwhelming support across the House for the introduction of overarching whistleblowing legislation, which I have sought for a very long time.  We introduced a Bill in the other House in the last term and another Bill was introduced by my colleague, Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  This fits extremely well into the architecture of transparency that we are determined to set into normal practices across business, public administration and the way Ireland Inc. does business.</P>
        <P>With regard to the very generous and helpful proposal from Senator Norris, I know the Senator is well versed in procedure and he cannot introduce his proposal as an amendment.  I understand that all the points made have been supportive and some creative suggestions were made by Senators.  I will carefully study all contributions before crafting the legislation I want to bring to the House at an early date.</P>
        <P>Tonight provides me with the opportunity to reiterate my commitment in advance of legislation, which is urgently required.  I do not particularly want to support a demand from the House to do something when I have already spent years negotiating for it to be done and had it enshrined in the programme for Government.  I will update the House on the Government&rsquo;s decision on the matter and set out the main objectives and considerations that will guide my approach to this legislation.</P>
        <P>The commitments in the programme for Government are quite specific and we will introduce whistleblower legislation.  I make it crystal clear that we will do so in an overarching way.  It is important also to make the point that the content of the original motion tabled today for debate highlights all of the reasons swift action is required in this area.  I strongly commend <Col N="88"/>Senator Mullen and the co-signatories of the motion for allowing me to make this contribution and correctly focusing this House on the important issue.</P>
        <P>Ireland lags behind &mdash; certainly in the English speaking world &mdash; in the protection it affords to whistleblowers.  I heard the distinguished Senator&rsquo;s comments regarding an leagan Gaeilge for &ldquo;whistleblowers&rdquo;, and I will consider that in the context of the legislation to see if there can be a more delicate phrase that may better reflect what we intend.</P>
        <P>The United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have all enacted statutes prohibiting an employer from retaliating against employees for disclosing unlawful conduct.  All of these statutes cover public and private sectors to some extent.  Although no international agreement or convention necessarily mandates protection for good faith reporting at this time, there is a strong acknowledgement and recognition in a number of important international fora of the need for comprehensive legal safeguards to encourage the potential for whistleblowers to bring to light issues of significant public concern.  When an individual brought information to my attention, I felt very vulnerable when I had to defend myself in the High Court and the Supreme Court.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>When the legal bill approached &euro;500,000, I was rather vulnerable until the matter was resolved.  That kind of pressure should not be on any individual with regard to the rightful disclosure of wrongdoing, even if it is an allegation.  The notion that a person must be absolutely right rather than just cause an investigation will put off people.  We must allow for the proper authorities to investigate real concerns of wrongdoing without giving a crank&rsquo;s charter.  It will be a careful balance.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.  Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As this House may be aware, in my comments at the opening of the Speak Up helpline at the Transparency Resource Advice Centre on 26 May I highlighted the Government&rsquo;s intention to move swiftly to introduce legislation in the Oireachtas that will protect whistleblowers who speak out against wrongdoing or cover-ups, whether in public or the private sector.</P>
        <P>The Government recently decided to introduce overarching legislation for enactment by the Oireachtas providing for good faith reporting and protected disclosure on a uniform basis for all sectors of the economy.  The Government also decided to expedite the preparation of this legislation, the urgent requirement for which has been confirmed by recent events, many of which were alluded to in the very fine contributions made this afternoon in the House.  In that context the Government agreed that the newly established Government reform unit in my Department should proceed with the preparation of legislation.  It might be said that we are being a tad premature in establishing reform units in a Department which has not yet been established but we have decided to hit the ground running.  I will seek the support of this House later in establishing the Department.</P>
        <P>This legislation will conform to the key requirements I outlined on 26 May and I intend it to meet all of the main objectives highlighted in Senator Mullen&rsquo;s motion.  It will provide a universal overarching legal charter for good faith reporting and protected disclosure for all employees, as well as for contractors who may have vital information to communicate.  As is the case in the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions, the legislation will cover those working in the public and private sectors.  Recent events have highlighted the particular vulnerabilities that might arise in the case, for example, of migrant workers who might believe they are at <Col N="89"/>particular risk of employer sanction and that the maintenance of their existence in the State might be challenged.  A key priority will be to ensure the legislation treats all parties equally and fairly within an overarching legal framework that is open and transparent.</P>
        <P>The House will understand it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on the elements of the motion relating to the current controversy surrounding the alleged abuse of patients at Rostrevor House Nursing Home.  I refer Senators to the reported comments of my colleague, the Minister for Health who is examining these matters carefully.</P>
        <P>The goals of the legislation I am committed to bringing forward are closely aligned with those of the Private Members&rsquo; motion before the House and the Private Members&rsquo; Bill introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, in 1999.  The long-standing commitment to introduce whistleblower legislation was included as a priority measure in the programme for Government.  I am strongly committed to delivering on this commitment by having appropriate legislation in place as soon as is practicable.  The legislation will build on international precedents and best practice, the sectoral protections already in place in legislation and the provisions of the Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  It will address a number of significant issues, including the precise definitions of &ldquo;good faith reporting&rdquo; and &ldquo;protected disclosure&rdquo; that will be adopted, the scope of the issues to be comprehended by whistleblowing, the rights of the complainant, the rights of the person, body or organisation complained of, the appeal mechanisms and the sanctions and redress.</P>
        <P>The process of preparing the legislation will need to address any possible legal obstacles which may have led to the adoption of the sectoral approach by the previous Administration.  I am on record as having drawn attention to the unsatisfactory outcome of the sectoral approach adopted.  The unsatisfactory nature of the current situation is underscored by developments in a number of sectors, not least the banking sector, as detailed in the Nyberg report, to which I referred in my previous contribution in the House earlier today.  The effectiveness of regulatory systems across the whole economy and society needs to be enhanced substantially.  It is clear that in the absence of appropriate safeguards for whistleblowers, regulators will remain at a disadvantage in seeking to identify and produce evidence of the legal standard required of malfeasance and misconduct in public and private bodies.  It is interesting that even where robust oversight bodies are in place, one has to depend on an individual within an organisation to blow the whistle.  It is often the case that inspections do not reveal the full picture or the full truth.  If regulators are at a disadvantage, the health, safety and economic and financial well-being of citizens will remain at risk from behaviour, the serious adverse consequences of which could have been pre-empted by early detection and strong sanctions.</P>
        <P>Some significant sectors have been covered under the sectoral approach previously adopted.  The legislation introduced provides an initial platform for the work that needs to be undertaken.  However, I strongly share the assessment in the motion that the sectoral approach to whistleblower protection has afforded whistleblowers inconsistent, inadequate and often confusing standards of protection.  Moreover, substantial sectors and activities in the economy are not covered.  I will have regard to the comments made by Senator Feargal Quinn today.  They will be considered when the legislation is being prepared.  Partly as a consequence of the fragmented, unco-ordinated and ineffective sectoral approach, it is clear that public knowledge and awareness of the essential role whistleblowing can play in enhancing regulatory effectiveness and discouraging illegal and criminal behaviour are inadequate.  This highlights the need, in parallel with the implementation of the proposed legislation, to strengthen awareness of the responsibilities of employees, provide for whistleblowing training and guide employers and their workforce.</P><Col N="90"/>
        <P>I am not necessarily proposing that the existing legislation be overturned.  It is appropriate to have specific sectoral safeguards to address specific sectoral issues and risks that might arise.  It is essential that sectoral measures operate within a coherent and cogent overarching society-wide framework which provides legal assurance and certainty in order that any party coming forward when significant matters involving risk to the public arise will be afforded the necessary legal protection to enable him or her to blow the whistle with confidence.  The Government wants to achieve an environment in which legally based operational structures are available to organisations and institutions which facilitate the communication of perceived risk to authority when possible wrongdoing has taken place, is taking place or might take place in the future.  If we can achieve the communication of risk through the provision of legally protected disclosure, a major step forward will have been made.  The adoption of appropriate processes and procedures to allow for the early evaluation of possible wrongdoing and amelioration, where necessary, can only be good for our internal governance and international standing and reputation.</P>
        <P>The disclosure to which the forthcoming legislation will apply must be informed by international best practice and step beyond the bounds of narrow sectoral perspectives.  I agree with those Senators who mentioned the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Council of Europe resolution as being particularly cogent in this context.  The scope of best practice provisions in this area typically covers situations where a criminal offence has been, is being or is likely to be committed; a person has failed, is failing or is likely to fail to comply with any legal obligation to which he or she is subject; a miscarriage of justice has occurred, is occurring or is likely to occur; the health and safety of an individual or group of individuals has been, is being or is likely to be endangered; the environment has been, is being or is likely to be damaged; or information tending to show that any matter falling within any one of the preceding paragraphs has been, is being or is likely to be deliberately concealed.  The Government will aim to ensure to the maximum extent possible that such provisions are included in the legislation that I will bring to this House.</P>
        <P>A key longer term objective, in the context of implementation of the overarching legislation, is to secure the necessary change in the culture and behaviour of public and private sector organisations.  Such a change is needed to ensure serious wrongdoing is identified and brought to light early and the necessary remedial action can be taken quickly.  If the legislation is to be successful, its implementation must be accompanied by a positive evolution of our cultural attitudes towards whistleblowing, which must be freed from the previous negative associations alluded to by Senators.  It is a civic duty to blow the whistle on wrongdoing or criminal activity, or activity damaging to the rights of citizens.  It should not be frowned upon or castigated.  The Government&rsquo;s approach will be founded on realism and pragmatism.  I propose to ensure protected disclosures will be made in accordance with internal procedures adopted by each organisation.  A right to disclose to the head of an organisation will be provided for in certain circumstances.  In exceptional cases, external disclosure to members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or other external designated authorities will be provided for.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has announced that it intends to hold a number of referendums, I hope in tandem with the presidential election.  One of the referendums will relate to the pay of judges, as we have discussed.  Two other referendums will attempt to ensure the Oireachtas can examine wrongdoing.  We will try to loosen the Abbeylara judgment which has tied the hands of committees of inquiry.  In addition, we will try to lessen what has been described as the Howlin judgment.  I refer to the Supreme Court decision requiring the disclosure of the confidential making of allegations to a Member of the Houses.  It is an important part of the constitutional role of elected Members of this and the other House to hear from citizens, in good faith, about wrongdoing on the part of any agent of the State.</P>

	<P>They should not have themselves on the hazard for so doing.  It is proposed that we will seek to redress the decision in question by holding a referendum in tandem with the referendum on the Abbeylara judgment.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about the processes for the development and preparation of the overarching legislation.  Full regard will be had for all relevant human resources, organisational and governance issues; all relevant issues relating to human rights, employment rights and all legal rights; the lessons to date from the operation of the sectoral provisions in force in Ireland; and international experience and best-in-class models of universal legal charters for good faith reporting and protected disclosures.  This will necessitate close collaboration and liaison with a broad range of stakeholders and interested parties including relevant Departments and with the Office of the Attorney General.  I have already begun that dialogue.  I look forward to the guidance, advice and proposals from Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and their relevant committees in the course of the enactment process for the legislation given the evident expertise that exists in these matters that has become so clear in the fine contributions made in this debate so far.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I pointed out in my address to Transparency International on 26 May, we are now in the quite anomalous situation that part of the island of Ireland is fully covered by universal legal whistleblower protection.  As the House may be aware, the protection available to all UK employees under the UK Act were given legal effect in Northern Ireland by the Public Interest Disclosure (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 and came into operation on 31 October 1999.  The order offers a framework of protection against victimisation or dismissal for workers who blow the whistle on criminal behaviour or wrongdoing, as defined in that UK legislation.  All employees and other whistleblowers protected under the Act are given equal protection.  If it is the case that it has been possible to provide and implement such a framework in Northern Ireland, I am fully confident we can find solutions to the issues that have delayed the introduction of the same protection here in the Republic.</P>
        <P>I commend the adoption of the Government&rsquo;s amendment.  I thank Members of all sides for their insightful contributions, and look forward at an early date to being back to discuss the detail of the legislation.  I assure the House that I will provide the space and time to address all Senators&rsquo; concerns and issues at that time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  His actions give truth to the quote:</P>
        <P LI="1">The humblest citizen in all the land, when clad in the armour or a righteous cause, is stronger than all the hosts of error.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">It is curious that I find myself in the situation of a whistleblower in this House &mdash; I am glad that the House affords protection to me &mdash; on credible and trustworthy information that I got from a believable source that developers were buying back their properties from NAMA through third parties at less than the current market value.  I met NAMA and gave the remedy to this, which is that all properties, which are essentially State assets, should be put on a website.  However, NAMA, along with the media, has missed the point.  They kept looking for the source and they wanted evidence.  The media asking me to give up my source is ironic given that they rely on sources for their own information.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If public representatives such as, in his case, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, are given information by concerned citizens acting in the public interest and if we do not bring that to the attention of the House, of the public and of the relevant Ministers with solutions as to what can be done to prevent the ongoing loss to the taxpayer, then we are not doing our jobs.  I <Col N="92"/>welcome the fact that the Government is bringing in whistleblower legislation and Senator Mullen&rsquo;s motion to the House.</P>
        <P>It is long overdue.  Given what happened, it is ironic that in 2004 the Irish Bank Officials Association proposed whistleblower legislation and I am saddened to report that the reply it got back was that we needed comprehensive legislation.  Although there was sectoral legislation but not enough in the financial world, there were those who acted.  In the case of a particular bank, one individual who was a whistleblower suffered considerably as a consequence and lost his job in the bank for blowing the whistle on what was going on and has led partly to where the country is.</P>
        <P>I put a question to the Minister which did not seem to be covered in his contribution.  It is to do with the bank officials of whom I spoke and to do with the church and other organisations.  While we would protect whistleblowers, what would be the position with those who knew there was wrongdoing going on and yet stood silent and did nothing?  Should there be an element of punishment for those who, if in the same position as the Minister, chose not to act who were in dereliction of their duty?  There are many cases like that in finance.  It is very difficult to prove.  People should realise that those who have not the heart and the civic mindedness to act in the public interest should be encouraged to do so in their own interests and that in the event that they have been given credible information and refuse to act because they are afraid of the consequences for themselves, there should be consequences for them.</P>
        <P>I welcome Senator Mullen&rsquo;s motion and hope to see the Minister return to the House to tease out how the matter will be finalised.  I encourage the Minister in protecting whistleblowers to provide for financial protection.  In many cases, for example, where one was a priest in a church afraid to come forward because the vengeance that would come down upon him from on high might ensure that he would be sent to a parish that he found undesirable or a country to which he did not want to go, would there be protection for a whistleblower?  Where somebody in any organisation stated that he or she blew a whistle and as a result has not maintained his or her job and position, and has been downgraded, castigated and set aside by the organisation, there must be an appeals mechanism so that where somebody must come out in public and tell what he or she knows, there are not consequences, not only financial but also for the position in which in some cases he or she would wish to continue.  There should be a Government mechanism of an appeal system to which somebody can turn to state that he or shehas lost out as a result of whistleblowing and wants the Government to instruct theorganisation for whom he or she worked to reinstate him or her and to prevent him or her being blacklisted.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the legislation coming into the House.  I ask the Minister to consider not only whistleblower protection, but the consequences for those who knew what was going on and refused to act.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all of those who contributed to the debate on this evening&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion, my colleagues Senators Quinn, Crown and Norris, and also Senators O&rsquo;Keeffe, Sheahan, O&rsquo;Donovan, van Turnout, Gilroy, Colm Burke, &Oacute; Domhnaill, Conway, &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Reilly.  I also thank the Ministers who were here this evening, the Minister of States, Deputies Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, Ring, Sherlock and O&rsquo;Dowd.  I was beginning to wonder whether there was a new condition known as ministerial attention deficit disorder, as one after the other came and left, but I was delighted to see the Minister, Deputy Howlin, arrive at the end of it all.  Nobody could fault him for not being present for the entire debate given the time <Col N="93"/>he has spent with us today.  He is the Minister with the most knowledge and expertise in this area and I note that it is his particular brief.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will not say much on the various contributions other than to thank speakers for the range of important and well-informed contributions.  On a couple of the concerns, Senator Gilroy called for a group such as Public Concern at Work in Britain.  It is important to note, as the Minister did, the work of Transparency International and, in particular, the Speak Up helpline which offers the kind of forum necessary for those with issues in this area who need to make a disclosure and who face dilemmas of various kinds.  Support is available and it is important to put that on the record.</P>
        <P>It is also useful to point out, because the concern was raised by Senators Quinn and O&rsquo;Donovan, the need to avoid the denunciation scenario.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is important to note that in the British legislation there is provision to facilitate responsible reporting.  There is protection for those who make a genuine effort to report internally before going outside and requiring a higher level of confidence and evidence on the part of the whistleblower.  These are important points.  It is important to encourage people to go internally before going externally.  Although I agree with the Minister that we should guarantee a confidential channel for those who would wish to approach a Member, in general terms I do not envisage a Member as the ideal person to come to with disclosures.  I am keen to see the establishment of certain external persons who would be in a position to take protected disclosures from people.  There is always the fear with politicians, present company excepted naturally, of the potential for grandstanding.  Although I am keen to protect the confidentiality and privileges of Members, it is important to establish other recipients for what may be protected disclosures.</P>
        <P>I advert to the comments of my colleagues from Sinn F&eacute;in, in particular those of Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, on the term &ldquo;whistleblower&rdquo;.  This may be a matter for An Coiste T&eacute;arma&iacute;ochta because the primary problem exists in an teanga Gaeilge with the word &ldquo;sceithire&rdquo;.  I will resist the temptation to suggest that particular parties might be more sensitive than others on this issue.  It appears I did not resist that temptation.  The word &ldquo;whistleblower&rdquo; should not be lost because this is about creating a culture and rebuilding a sense of what an active patriotic duty it is to be a whistleblower where that is the appropriate thing to do.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that we could not agree on a motion this evening.  I do not disagree with anything in the Government&rsquo;s amendment but what it fails to state leaves me somewhat cold.  The recitals in my motion are important and it is important to set the context for what we desire.  With a little more consultation we could have come to an agreed motion on this matter, incorporating the recitals and taking account of the Government&rsquo;s declaration of intent.  This declaration has crystalised somewhat since the programme for Government was produced.  There was a vagueness in the programme for Government that is not in what the Minister has stated to Transparency International and what he has stated this evening.</P>

	<P>I bring to the attention of the House a point of clarification on amendment No. 3.  I should have announced there was a typographical error, as the words, &ldquo;subsection (1)&rdquo; were misplaced.  The amendment should read, &ldquo;In page 10, subsection (1), to delete lines 25 to 27 and substitute the following:&rdquo;.  This has no effect on the amendment made.</P>

	<P>I have little more to add to what I said about amendment No. 8<i>a</i>in my name.  I was praising the Minister in his absence and specifying that some of the work he had done and some of the promises made in the programme for Government should be set out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I like what the Minister is doing in implementing a Government commitment made in the budget, on which most of us are agreed.  There is an impression given that certain politicians are siding with the wealthy, but we are not.  I agree with the Minister that this is outrageous.  There was a battle at our parliamentary party meeting before Christmas to secure some movement on high pay and salary levels.  My party fully supports the Minister&rsquo;s policies.  I suggest he do it right and legally.  This argument that one should wait until they sue <Col N="96"/>is not acceptable because the Minister does not want to go to court to lose a case.  However, there are legal ways to tackle this issue in the case of existing staff.  I compliment the Government in this regard.  In my amendment I propose that this be one of the Minister&rsquo;s specific functions, while the second part of the amendment relates to a commitment given in the programme for Government.  It is a very important commitment, and I remind the Minister that the Tory party in England has successfully done it, even though it has taken them one year to do so.  It is a proposal in the interests of transparency and openness and also achieving value for money.  If all purchase orders were available on-line for the public to see, it would allow anyone to suggest to the Department that a service could be procured at a lower rate or that there was an alternative product available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to be back in the House.  I explained this morning that I would be unable to be present for some of the afternoon session as I had to attend with the Taoiseach a prearranged meeting of the implementation body for the Croke Park agreement and I am afraid I could not alter the Taoiseach&rsquo;s schedule at short notice.  It was an important meeting, but I am glad to be back in the House.</P>
        <P>I welcome Senator Thomas Byrne&rsquo;s amendments because they underscore two important issues, one being high pay in the public service generally.  It was a decision of the Government at its first meeting on the first night to set a standard by reducing the salary of the Taoiseach to &euro;200,000, which for most ordinary working people is an extraordinarily high salary but which for many in the private and public sectors is modest enough.  It flowed from that decision that everybody else in the public service should be below that figure.  However, a considerable number were not, including senior civil servants.  We have examined the matter in great detail in recent months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One can imagine the range of individuals across all elements of the public service, including doctors, judges, senior administrators, researchers and heads of commercial semi-State bodies, all of whom are on separate pay rates.  It was determined that we would set a ceiling of &euro;200,000 in the public sector.  Very generously, all Secretaries General immediately accepted a pay reduction to that level which it should be noted was voluntary.  I must confess that originally I had hoped to be able to reduce incumbents&rsquo; pay to that level by means of legislation and that I accepted detailed advice from the Attorney General who advised that because of the small number involved, the Financial Measures in the Public Interest Act might not be robust enough to deal with the matter because it would not be arguable in court that the sum of money necessary in the public interest and included in the measure was too focused and it might be seen as oppressive legislation.  I was very glad, therefore, when a voluntary decision was made by this cohort of public servants in a public-spirited way.  These are individuals who had already been subject to a number of pay cuts previously.  I want this level to apply right across all elements of the public service.  There will obviously be difficulties in regard to the Judiciary.  We have set out new pay scales, some of which can be confusing.  We have set out a new pay scale for judges which applies the FEMPI proposals or cuts which could not be applied until now because of the constitutional prohibition on the reduction of pay rates to judges, plus 10% which is the reduction that will apply to all new incumbents from 1 January.  That is the new pay rate which will apply to all newly appointed judges.  If and when the people support the referendum to reduce pay, we will apply the FEMPI reductions that apply across the public service, including the pension levy, to the Judiciary which will reduce its pay.  It will impact on it in exactly the same way as everyone else in the public service. I do not want to deal with judges differently to anyone else.</P><Col N="97"/>
        <P>Incumbents who are promoted will be red circled.  For example, if a High Court judge becomes a Supreme Court judge, he or she will not receive the new rate for a Supreme Court judge but will hold on to his or her incumbent rate as a High Court judge.  It sounds complicated but it is fair and the same approach which applies right across the public service so that no public servant feels unduly disadvantaged.</P>
        <P>I will refer briefly to commercial semi-State bodies.  We set the ceiling at &euro;250,000.  I wanted to maintain differentials because as my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, put it &mdash; those in the greyhound fraternity might take exception to it &mdash; the chief executive of Bord na gCon should not be paid the same as the chief executive of the ESB.  In 2007 the previous Government set up an analysis of the relative value of the chief executive officers of commercial semi-State companies in what was called the Hay process.  It set the differentials.  We have applied the same formula to the new rates, that is, the FEMPI rates plus 10%, to create a new starting rate of salaries for the chief executives of all semi-State companies.  As we could not reduce the salaries of incumbents, I have asked people to take a reduction to the new rate or at least a 15% reduction.  Only one individual will breach the &euro;250,000 ceiling, the new chief executive of the ESB.  These are very fair and balanced measures.  One cannot ask people to pay a universal social charge from an income of &euro;80 per week if one does not ask those at the very top to bear a proportionate part of the burden.</P>
        <P>I am very much in favour of what the Senator said.  I acknowledge that the &euro;250,000 threshold and a threshold of &euro;200,000 for the public service generally were announced by the previous Government but I wanted to implement them.  It is part of the solidarity we will need to do very difficult things in the future.  This is not the end of the process, unfortunately.  We have another &euro;3.6 billion in adjustments to make for next year&rsquo;s budget, which brings me to the next point.</P>
        <P>The second part of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment refers to the maintenance of a published record of all purchase orders.  We intend to do that.  I do not know whether the Minister who was in the House earlier mentioned the launch of the website.  It is an extremely important new resource but I am very glad to have it in place.  I intend to have all data on current public expenditure down to subhead level on the website, <i>www.databank.per.gov</i>, as soon as possible and to have retrospective analysis available.  I understand it currently goes back to 1994, but we will go back further.  People will be able to see not only the subhead and full head expenditure thresholds but also the comparators year on year and the implications in terms of personnel growth and diminution.  There will be as much data as anyone could require and it will obviate the need for many parliamentary questions.  I genuinely believe that the more transparent these processes are and the more dialogue we have about them, the more we will have an understanding of our economic circumstances and the more buy-in we will have to achieve our goals.  While the spirit of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment will be captured by the actions of this Government, I do not think it needs to be accepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>My first point is well worn at this stage.  It is interesting to see the Minister applying so vigorously what he affectionately calls the FEMPI legislation which he and his party so vigorously opposed in Parliament.  We are where we are, as was said before.</P>
        <P>On the commitment in the programme for Government to publish all purchase orders in excess of &euro;20,000, will the Minister do that?  It is well below subhead level.  If a Department spends &euro;25,000 on a project or advice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Minister.  I do not know him but I have always admired his competency.  He has proven it today and with the measures that were taken in the first 100 days in Government, such as a reduction in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s salary to &euro;200,000.  He was right to acknowledge what the Secretaries General of Departments did because when good things are done, they are not often recognised.</P>
        <P>I spoke on the Order of Business yesterday about the chief executive of the ESB, who earns &euro;15,000 a week, and other organisations.  We are an island nation with a population of 4 million.  It is not acceptable in the current climate.  The measures the Minister is taking and his response to the amendment tabled by Senator Byrne are very proactive and are what people expected and are getting.  Let us hope a new frugality will prevail as we go forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 8<i>b</i> and 8<i>c</i> are related and may be discussed together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment No. 8<i>b</i> not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8<i>c</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 15, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(3) In carrying out his functions in relation to the processing tasks of public service bodies, the Minister shall not identify or propose self-contained areas of processing tasks that could be considered for outsourcing/transfer to the private sector.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister is probably aware that the amendment incorporates a quotation from a letter a Secretary General sent this week.  It is important that the issue is raised in the Seanad on Committee Stage.  If the Minister is talking about radical moves &mdash; he has to be radical in his job because &euro;3.6 billion in savings are needed this year alone&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>At least.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>We thought we had to save &euro;3 billion last year but it ended up being &euro;6 billion.  We lost our seats, partially as a result of that.  I hope the same fate does not befall the Minister&rsquo;s party.  The reality is that the bond markets turned against this country last year, not only for internal reasons.  It is not always the fault of the people or the nation.</P>
        <P>The people generally have a great love of their public services.  They want to believe in and be served by them.  When a letter was sent stating that certain aspects of the public sector would be outsourced, a certain fear was created.  Outsourcing always has bad connotations.  Recently a major mobile phone company outsourced jobs in the north east to India.  It happened in England where departmental services were outsourced and government services moved abroad, not just to the private sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amendment asks the Minister to notify the Oireachtas when he proposes this will happen in order that we will have a chance to think about it.  It may require legislation.  People would be concerned if their public services were being outsourced.  The proposal will need a strong <Col N="99"/>Department and Minister.  There is agreement that the current Minister is strong.  When Departments receive a letter asking them examine what services could be outsourced, the Minister will be prepared for some resistance.  Will a Department write back saying &ldquo;Yes, you could outsource half the work we do.  Sure, we&rsquo;re totally surplus to requirements&rdquo;?  Are they really going to respond in that way, I wonder?  Therefore, the Minister will have to be strong and not rely totally on what they have done.  The Minister should look to other countries to see what way they do things.  It is worrying when we hear the words &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; and &ldquo;outsourcing&rdquo;, so there should be some statutory check on that situation.  If, for example, the Minister was to outsource social welfare processing, which was mentioned, there is no doubt that would require a statutory check.  The same applies to the Passport Office.  If these matters are being considered, therefore, they should be brought before the Oireachtas so we can debate them at an early stage.</P>
        <P>The Minister needs bold powers and dramatic things will have to happen.  However, if the Minister sticks to his commitment not to raise income tax or cut welfare, and sticks to the Croke Park agreement, I would not be too far wrong in saying that 20% of the State&rsquo;s services would have to be removed completely.  The welfare budget is 40% so if one excludes welfare and pay, 20% of the rest would have to be removed.  If that is what the Minister is thinking of, it will involve a huge amount of outsourcing.  We should have a detailed debate beforehand because I do not know if the public is ready for that or even realises the scale of the task.  It is a lot easier to cut welfare by X% because of the fact that it is 40% of the budget.  Everybody understands that, although they might not like it.  I am not sure, however, if they understand the consequences of having to remove entire parts of the public sector, which is now beginning to be spoken about.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, has also mentioned it.  That would be pretty dramatic so it is important that the Oireachtas should be informed of outsourcing matters when the Minister considers them.</P>
        <P>This harps back to an amendment that was not accepted earlier, which sought a report of the Minister&rsquo;s activities before the legislation is enacted.  I acknowledge the Minister is doing good work but, in fairness, we would like him to set out what he is doing in a report.  This is a part of it because the Department&rsquo;s Secretary General sent out a letter which, presumably, was technically under the aegis of the Department of Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>We felt it was reasonable that the Minister would be accountable for his actions up to now.  We know what he is doing, we see the media briefings and press conferences, but there should be some accountability for what he has done up to now.  This amendment is part of that because it relates to a letter sent out on his instructions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Byrne has raised an important issue concerning the possibility of outsourcing.  At this stage, we are in such dire straits that everything must be looked at.  I am not sure that the general public are too worried about how a particular service is provided.  If they get a good service and value for money, people will be prepared to consider the possibility that some services might be privatised or outsourced.  In considering these matters, however, it will be important for the Minister to have a lot of dialogue, so there must be an opportunity to debate them.  The Seanad is an appropriate place in which to discuss the possibly radical changes the Minister is likely to make to how services are provided.</P>
        <P>Those of us who serve as public representatives see opportunities everywhere for doing things differently and better.  In considering privatisation or outsourcing, the Minister will hopefully be creating employment for Irish business as part of the jobs strategy.  At this stage, therefore, everything has to be on the table and open for discussion.</P><Col N="100"/>
        <P>I welcome the Minister.  In the few hours we have seen him in action there is little doubt that he is a man of immense ability.  He has some wonderful ideas and I have no doubt that he will get the support of the Cabinet to carry through the many promised reforms that are badly needed.  Hopefully, by the time the Government goes to the country again we will be in a much different and better position.  I compliment the Minister on the work he has done to date.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their remarks.  These are important issues and I look forward to debating them with Senators over time when we crystallise some of our proposals.  For a long time in advance of the election, I had been working on these ideas, so it is nice to have a chance to put them into action.  I spent too long developing legislative ideas that went into the waste bin after spending a year preparing them.  It is nice, therefore, that ideas can now hopefully be crystallised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>We are starting that process now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an interesting process to be in.  It is worse, however, when watered-down or inadequate versions of the same thing arise, so that it takes two or three goes to reach what one had argued for, as has happened.</P>
        <P>I take the political point that Senator Byrne is entitled to make concerning the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation.  I do not embrace it with enthusiasm but do so out of necessity right now.  As the Senator knows, the legislation itself requires an annual review which will be presented to the Houses.  We will examine it, however, and I hope to tweak it at least in the context of next year&rsquo;s budget.  I argued outside Government &mdash; and this is a matter primarily for my colleague the Minister for Finance &mdash; that if we can examine the impact it has on the lowest income earners and lessen or ameliorate the impact on them, it would be a good thing.  That is something for the future, however.  As I said, I do not rejoice in the legislation or embrace it, but I regard it as an important component of the financing of the State.</P>
        <P>I want to deal specifically with the amendment before us because it is an important one which concerns outsourcing.  I need to say something about the comprehensive review on expenditure that I have undertaken.  It is fresh in my mind because I have just come from a meeting of the Croke Park agreement&rsquo;s implementation committee.  There is a genuine engagement with both management and the union side in the public service.  There is an understanding of the dreadful hole we are in and what needs to be done to break out of that.  The whole idea of the comprehensive review of expenditure is not to think in the old-fashioned way.  With all due respect to Senator Byrne, I am afraid he is reflecting old thinking here &mdash; that one must cut social welfare across the board.  We need to do things differently.  That is why the letter referred to by the Senator, and which appeared in the media this week, asked people to think fundamentally outside the box.  All ideas should be put on the table and let us decide on them.  I will not ideologically exclude anything from consideration.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have said that we will not reduce welfare rates but we will hopefully reduce the welfare budget, for example, by the elimination of fraud.  Having spoken to social welfare officers, I know there is a significant amount of fraud.  I want to unleash frontline people and that is why I introduced the website for ideas, although some people thought it was a publicity stunt.  On the first day it was in operation, we had 50,000 hits.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We had 2,500 submissions from people on the frontline with really good ideas that I want to incorporate.  When I was going into the Department yesterday, a man stopped me and said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Minister, you&rsquo;re doing a good job.  We&rsquo;re waiting for somebody to bring about reform.  I&rsquo;ve been 40 years in the public service.</P>
        <P FLI="0">So public servants do not have closed minds and they are all taxpayers.  Most of them can see ways ahead.  They are the ones whose euro are being wasted.  They want decent services and to ensure that expenditure is not wasted.  They see where it is being wasted and they want better value for money.  We have superb people in the public service who are delivering really well and we want to unleash their potential fully.</P>
        <P>Senators will see that we will go much further than the programme for Government.  The restructuring of the public service will require a flattening of structures, as well as devolving responsibilities and budget lines so that people at the coalface can make decisions themselves.  In that way we will not have this oversight layer of people with rank who must take numerous decisions to approve matters.  People who know how to spend money will therefore be able to do so.  I have spoken to my ministerial colleagues on the same basis so that they should unleash the deliverers of services, while understanding the pool of money available and properly evaluating its expenditure.  New thinking is at the core of the spending review.</P>
        <P>Once the spending review&rsquo;s proposals have been brought to Government, I intend to bring them before this House so that we can have a full debate on them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There will be resistance to change, of that there is no doubt.  Some people cannot seen things being done differently.  I do not know if most Members do this but I always renew my car tax online.  The payment of second home charge, introduced by the previous Government, can be done online.  That system is a very effective tax collection system.  It is a good idea and why can we not have more of that?  We do not need to set up a bureaucracy to do everything.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With due respect to the previous Administration, there has been a tendency to set up a new quango for everything and that had many consequences.  It isolated the parent Department from responsibility.  New systems were set up and all these bodies had chief executives, directors of publicity and whatever else.  They were not accountable because Deputies could not ask a parliamentary question about most of them.  I have tried to meet everyone concerned since I came to office in recent months.  I met the chief executive officers of the non-commercial semi-State bodies.  I told them that most of them were doing a great job but, unfortunately, we could not afford most of them, that in better times we might be able to come back to them but that now it is incumbent on them, in the first instance, to examine their consciences to see if they can amalgamate or return the function to the parent Department.  The other side is that there are State agencies that are more efficient than the Civil Service.  I do not want to throw the baby out with the bathwater but I want to have a proper analysis of the outputs from State agencies and so on.</P>
        <P>I do not want the notion of outsourcing to be a bugbear.  Many services are outsourced now.  In my local authority area Wexford County Council has determined not to continue with refuse collection because it was in competition with the commercial sector and it was becoming unaffordable.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>In such circumstances, one would make a pragmatic decision that such a business is one in which one should be engaged.  All of us need to be open to see how we can do things differently and more efficiently because we are all in this together.  I said <Col N="102"/>when speaking on the comprehensive spending review that I do not want any spectators.  In terms of what the Government will do, everybody has a part to play in this and everybody has a good idea to contribute and I hope everybody will contribute.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For those reasons I do not propose to recommend the acceptance of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.  I am gratified that he wants me to do personal accounting of my activities up to the passing of this legislation.  I would have thought in terms of all my activities to date that I have been more than well reported in the media.  I am very happy to give a full accounting once I have the statutory authority of a Department.  I have had the status of a Cabinet Minister from the date of my appointment.  I have the title of Minister for public expenditure and reform in law already from the date of my appointment but I hope to have the statutory authority to function as such as soon as the laws are enacted to give effect to that, it carries the signature of the President and the commencement order has been signed.</P>

	<P>I am conscious that Senator Barrett has a number of important amendments further down the list and that I have more or less hogged the debate but there are some issues I wish to raise.  I will not talk for long on them.  We have raised important issues.  I agree with much of what the Minister said.  I resent the implication that we will be bystanders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>What I meant is the notion that something should be done but that it is not up to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is a natural human reaction one would find people have anywhere.  The point being made in this amendment on outsourcing is that if the Minister is considering it he should let the Oireachtas know about it.  The Minister said he has made himself available to the media.  That is not acceptable.  A Minister, first and foremost, is accountable to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and he has not really been accountable in terms of his statutory functions in recent months.  In proposing this amendment I am not denigrating what the Minister did but trying to give effect to what is already provided in the Constitution, namely, that Ministers are accountable to the D&aacute;il.  The Minister should make a report of what he did and it is important that he would list the details to Parliament, not to the media which only print certain details and in that way we would not know everything he has done.  This is a reasonable proposal.  Most people welcome what the Minister is doing but I am not sure that certain sectors of society understand fully what is contemplated by this.  When welfare and public pay are taken out of the budget, 20% or 25% of the money is all that remains.  If the Minister is to take the &euro;3.6 billion from that figure, that will show the scale of the task this year.  The Minister will find he has a good deal of support.  Many services could be outsourced.  I indicate that I will withdraw the following amendment which proposes that the Minister would be banned from talking about privatisation.  That is not our policy but I suspect it is an amendment that many within the Minister&rsquo;s party will be happy to support.  That is possibly why it was put forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Byrne&rsquo;s amendment proposed that the Minister, within 20 days, would act as set out.  Perhaps the Senator has a point, but, legislatively, it is not possible because it requires the Minister to do something in law which is retrospective.  Anything we do in the House must at least have some nodding acquaintance with lawfulness.  I take Senator Bryne&rsquo;s <Col N="103"/>point that the Minister, in the spirit of what the Senator said, might make himself available to do that but, legislatively, I do not believe it is possible.</P>

	<P>I will be fully accountable to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann under the Constitution as soon as the legislation is enacted.  Its Members can ask retrospectively about anything I have done from the moment I was appointed.  They will not be time-barred from doing that.  Therefore, I will be fully accountable.  I am happy to be accountable already.  It certainly took longer than I expected on the day I was appointed to have this enactment but, as I explained this morning, this is the first time that there has been a fundamental restructuring of the Department of Finance.  It required the trawling of every statutory instrument back to 1924, which was a Herculean task.  If I may again probably stray into unacceptable territory, I pay tribute to the people in my office and my Department who did that Herculean task in such quick time to provide to disaggregate functions that not only go back to the foundation of the State, but because many of the powers of the UK Administration were absorbed into the Department of Finance, go back to Victorian times.  We discovered functions of the Minister for Finance that he did not know he had in the trawl that was presented and we have abolished some of them in amendments in the other House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We now have robust legislation to do the twin jobs the Minister for Finance and I are required to do.  One is on the macroeconomic side to ensure that the ship of State is guided well from a macroeconomic perspective, that there is proper interaction with the troika and that the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s focus is on those matters.  The other job is to ensure that I am free to do the reform agenda &mdash; which, bluntly, would not be done by a Minister for Finance because it could not be done by a single Minister for Finance &mdash; and at the same time have control of the resources to ensure that reform is not resisted.</P>
        <P>I appreciate what the Deputy is saying but he will find that my accountability will be full and complete both to this House and the other House.</P>

Section 20 provides that in relation to a limited number of public service type functions the Minister for Finance will consult with the Minister for public expenditure and reform.  The powers of the Minister for Finance in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General under the 1993 Act are not transferring to the Minister for public expenditure and reform.

	<P>Sections 21, 22 and 23 are part of one package.  It would be opportune if the Minister could explain in general terms how this provision will work.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but in my view, under section 22 &mdash; I am aware we are dealing with section 21 &mdash; statutory powers not listed in the Bill which relate to the functions of the Minister and certain sections of this Bill and functions listed therein are being transferred by reason of this Bill.  If there is a row between Ministers or confusion in the mind of a citizen as to which Minister performs a function, a Minister can perform a function if he or she believes he or she has the power.  In fact, it will be a defence in a criminal matter to say one had the power.  Please God, it will never arise that the Minister might need to claim he believed he was doing the right thing, but if it does, I hope that will be a good defence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 23 also relates in that the Taoiseach has a determination and I know the Minister will quote the previous 1939 statute.  While I know it is not the one we are addressing, if that section relates to the Taoiseach deciding which statute applies to which Minister or interpreting a statute, that would be constitutionally questionable.  However, if it merely concerns the allocation of functions and responsibilities &mdash; who washes the dishes tonight or, more likely, who is going to cut the public sector pay bill &mdash; the Taoiseach should be allowed to do this.  There might be a question of statutory interpretation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I can allay the Senator&rsquo;s fears: there is no such intention and will be no such impact.  As I explained this morning, this is a belt and braces set of sections.  This is clearly a complicated structure to disaggregate functionalities.  We have trawled comprehensively through every enactment; almost 200 statutes were reviewed dating back to Victorian times.  We have set out clearly the functions which are being transferred to me and my Department.  There is no ambiguity or doubt about this.  From the day this enactment is commenced, those functions will be legally mine to carry out, nobody else&rsquo;s.  The functions that will not be <Col N="108"/>transferred will remain legally those of the Minister for Finance and there will be no doubt about them.</P>
        <P>In the event that a function had not been noticed, there is a legal safety net to ensure its legality cannot be undone if I acted in a bona fide manner and <i>vice versa</i>.  This might happen, for example, if I make an order regarding a function that in all probability should be mine, but it is interpreted by a court to be properly the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  The role of the Taoiseach simply relates to where there is a lack of clarity as to which Minister should rightly exercise a function.  This is done to have a clear determinant structure and eliminate vagueness &mdash; it would not be my opinion against that of the Minister for Finance.  I am virtually certain that will never arise.  Its citation was, as the Senator rightly stated, in the 1939 Act, where it was left to the Taoiseach to determine functionality if there was vagueness about it.  This is a clear-cut set of safeguards that it is right, proper and prudent to make.  As regards the role of the Taoiseach, they will almost certainly never be utilised.</P>
        <P>I presume that after three months of careful trawling, we have touched on everything, but if something emerges, it will be assigned by way of a transfer of function order to the appropriate Minister.  This is to deal with the possibility that one of the two Ministers affected directly will act in a bone fide manner and exercise a function determined not to be his.  One could imagine there could be very severe financial consequences for the State if there was any doubt about the matter.  As the role of the two Ministries and the two Ministers is or could potentially be of such importance to the State, there is a requirement to put these matters beyond doubt.  That is the import of the three sections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister is right and that this issue will not arise.  The Minister for Finance has so many functions that there could well be a citizen who has a particular bone to pick with the Department of Finance and does not know whose function it is.  This matter would resolve itself if our earlier amendment &mdash; discussed when the Minister was not in the House &mdash; had been accepted.  It sought a report to the Oireachtas listing the functions of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his delegated powers.  He has promised a further explanatory memorandum.  That should have been provided on Monday once the Bill had completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  There is provision that, if a Bill is amended substantially on Committee Stage, the explanatory memorandum can be reviewed.  It would certainly be of assistance to us now.  Has the provision in the 1939 Act ever been exercised by a Taoiseach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just checked with the officials and, to our knowledge, it has not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I hope it never will be.  I understand it deals with a matter of statutory interpretation in which the Taoiseach would have no role, nor could he overrule a court in its interpretation as to who had a particular function.  That is not what is envisaged.  Even if it were to be exercised, it is not a judicial interpretation of law.  It is a matter of which of the two Ministers has responsibility if there is a dispute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister appears to be future-proofing himself against any landmines that might be uncovered.  We know that most likely there will not be any, but if there were to be a change of Administration and there were two new Ministers in the future who possibly end up giving directions and interfering in each other&rsquo;s work, the provision ensures there will be a final adjudicator.  While I might be reading it incorrectly, that is my perception.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The copyright belongs to Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe who named them thus.  Governance rather than government is the issue.  The change of government has taken place, but the governance problems remain.  My amendments seek parliamentary scrutiny on the appointment of the Secretary General of the Department and parliamentary scrutiny of performance.</P>
        <P>I am speaking in the context of the Government having decided there should be parliamentary oversight of the appointment of chairmen of State bodies, which I recall having read.  This should apply also to the board members.  If we are to change to a new model of governance and bring Parliament into the process, which we sincerely want to do, the reform agenda should include a more active parliamentary role.</P>
        <P>The problems we are addressing now include a lack of oversight, as noted in the Wright report, and the whole problem developed a momentum of its own which lead to financial collapse, without the direct involvement of the Parliament.  In the spirit that is already recognised in regard to the appointment of chairmen of State boards, and which I believe should extend to the other board members, the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues might wish to consider some role for Seanad &Eacute;ireann in the appointment of the Secretaries General of Departments, as in the United States Senate.  Parliament needs to restrain the power of the Executive and of the Civil Service, which is one of the lessons I take from our need to be rescued by the IMF.</P><Col N="111"/>
        <P>I propose that the section would state that the officer in question should report back to Parliament on all the matters we have included.  This must succeed and Parliament must be involved because, as the Minister said, the problems are so grave.</P>
        <P>I am encouraged by the Minister&rsquo;s earlier address to Transparency International.  Were he to accept these amendments, he might get life membership of Transparency International.  The purpose is to assist and reform, which is vital, and I ask for the amendments to be considered in that light.  The House and certainly the Independent Senators will assist the Minister in every way to accomplish his goals, which are of huge importance for everybody in the country.  As this could be helpful to him in that regard, I propose it in that spirit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Byrne referred to people being taken to the cleaners.  Unfortunately, this Department is being established because the country has been taken to the cleaners.  The amendment proposed by Senator Barrett envisages the sort of scrutiny of public appointments that was put forward as a suggestion for Seanad reform in the O&rsquo;Rourke report, which we have already debated in the House.  It is a very interesting idea, although some of the provisions in the amendments are unduly prescriptive to be placed in legislation.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, has already referred to the website, which will contain much fuller information and economic data than we have had to date from Government, which is an important point.  However, this should not be placed in legislation.</P>
        <P>I am somewhat troubled by the provision in amendment No. 24 that &ldquo;The Secretary General shall appear before the Oireachtas at quarterly hearings&rdquo;.  This might undermine the role of the Minister and the vital principle that the Minister is the person accountable to the Oireachtas for the Department&rsquo;s work.  The Minister has appointed an excellent Secretary General to the Department in the person of Mr. Robert Watt, so some of what has been said in regard to these amendments is clearly not appropriate.  It is an interesting and welcome idea, nonetheless.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator Barrett on the amendments, in particular amendment No. 24.  The reality is that if accurate work had been done in regard to what is set out in amendment No. 24 in the past ten to 20 years, we might not have some of the problems we face today.  On that basis, it is very important to set out this type of prescriptive requirement in the legislation, requiring the Department and the Secretary General to do this.  As was pointed out, the functions of the Minister as set out in section 9 are all very laudable but are not very specific.  It refers to ideas such as &ldquo;promote value for money&rdquo;.  As Senator Walsh said, it should be to &ldquo;get value for money&rdquo;, and I am sorry he did not put that down as an amendment.  Senator Barrett is being specific, as I believe we should be in legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Would it be an offence not to get value for money?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure we could go that far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Many people would be in hazard on that one.  Who would be the judge?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>If one is promoting value for money, one can do that in a local supermarket.  Getting value for money is a different thing.  This is why it is important to actually state what we are looking for.  Senator Barrett is looking for &ldquo;independently audited assessments of the current, capital, present and future expenditure&rdquo;.  It would be fantastic if this were to happen because it never happened when spending, which the public generally agreed with, was way too high, as we found out later.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 23 calls for the State to &ldquo;conduct a fiscal plan reflecting the impact of proposed policies on a 2, 5, 10 and 20 year projection cycle&rdquo;.  This would be very important <Col N="112"/>given we are talking about a new way of operating.  To bring in the Secretary General would be very useful and could be done separate to the normal accountability of the Minister, given that Secretaries General contribute to committees on occasion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am totally in agreement with the sentiment and motivation of Senator Barrett&rsquo;s amendments and, although I will not accept them, I will explain why.  There is statutory provision for the appointment of a Secretary General under the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.  It prescribes that every Department should have a chief executive, which is now defined as a Secretary General, and the question is how those Secretaries General are appointed.  Until now, they have been appointed by what is know as TLAC &mdash; the Top Level Appointments Commission.  One of the first things I did in the Department was to reform TLAC, whereby there will now be a majority of external members and the chair will be an external member &mdash; that is, from outside the Civil Service.  The membership of TLAC has been increased to nine, of which there are five external members.  All final interviews will be conducted by a sub-panel of the committee, each comprising two civil servants and three external members, and chaired by one of the external members, so the external members will have the determining majority.  In addition, the people whom I have nominated to Government and intend to appoint &mdash; I hope the decision will be signed off on this week, probably in the next day or two &mdash; all have great experience in human resource management externally in the business community.</P>
        <P>This is a better approach than bluntly asking people to present before a committee of the House.  We need expertise and, bluntly, in the determination I made, I needed a new Secretary General fairly sharply to begin the work.  It was a lonely first day in the Department when trying to create a new Department.</P>
        <P>On the specifics, amendment No. 22 refers to two officers, the Secretary General of the department of public expenditure and reform and the Second Secretary General of the public service management division.  This second title existed in the old Department of Finance and will not exist in my Department.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment because that role is being abolished entirely.  Nonetheless, there will be a Secretary General in my Department.  In a subsequent debate, perhaps an Adjournment Debate or in committee, we can go through the new structure of the Department, as I envisage it, with a reformed unit and external people running reform.  The intention of the Senator&rsquo;s amendments will be mirrored in the reality of the structure I intend to put into place.  I hope there will be considerable interaction between me and this House in explaining what we are doing and how we will do it.</P>
        <P>With regard to the nationality of appointees, posts in the Irish Civil Service are open to all European Economic Area nationals, as the House knows.  We will see who applies for posts into the future.  The Senator might be aware that several Secretary General posts across all Departments will be becoming vacant in a relatively short period.  It will be interesting to see how the new TLAC will operate to select those.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister.  What I was trying to get to was the findings in the Wright report that so few of the staff are qualified.  Of 542 staff, only 39 are economists trained to masters level or higher compared with 60% in Canada and 40% in the Netherlands.  I wanted to cast the net was widely as possible and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement about reform of the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC.</P>
        <P>I refer to the other criticisms about the lack of parliamentary oversight when the Department of Finance was getting into trouble and so on.  Nyberg and Wright and, I believe, Regling and Watson indicate the need for some parliamentary involvement.  My fear is that the Minister&rsquo;s <Col N="113"/>enthusiasm might depend on one person.  If he was transferred somewhere else or became head of the IMF or was appointed to one of these arduous tasks, would we have just another Civil Service Department?  If I was working on the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, I would reduce the number of Departments to the constitutional minimum of seven.  I can think of more Departments I would like to abolish than create.  It is very important the Department we create in this legislation meets the needs of the country and its finances at this fairly appalling time.</P>
        <P>I am worried also that the adjustment suggested in the stability pact programme update of April is heavily based on extra taxation with no analysis of the expenditure side.  It seems the others got there before the Minister.  That document provides for &euro;10 billion extra in taxation and no adjustment on the expenditure side.</P>
        <P>It is a matter of some concern that matters are so rushed today and will be again tomorrow.  I dislike Article 25.2.2&deg; of the Constitution being used.  The President should have time to consider all of these matters as well.  I will accede to the Minister and withdraw the amendments in light of his encouragement to continue to think along these lines, which we will do.</P>

        <P>The issue I want to raise concerns a leisure centre project that is crucial to the Finn Valley area of Donegal.  It began as a co-operation between Donegal County Council and a local community group under the aegis of the Finn Valley athletic club.  These parties were endeavouring to develop a leisure centre in the Ballybofey-Stranorlar twin towns area.  This emerged into a larger project that would service a larger area.  A company limited by guarantee has been established and there are a number of directors on the board from Donegal County Council and the Finn Valley athletic club.</P>
        <P>The indicative costing associated with the project is approximately &euro;8.7 million, and a commitment for &euro;3.8 million in grant aid was given by the previous Minister responsible for arts, sport and tourism, with matched funding of &euro;5.1 million to be made available by Donegal County Council.  Some of the money was to be raised as a loan from the council.  Approval was given to proceed to seek expressions of interest from contractors and subsequently to seek tenders from them.  That process has been completed in conjunction with the Department and Donegal County Council.  The tenders have been obtained.  The current position is that completed tenders were submitted to the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport by Donegal County Council and the project management company.  The Department subsequently forwarded the tender documentation to the Office of Public Works so it could be examined by the office&rsquo;s technical staff.  I understand from the OPW and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, that work on the tender documentation has been completed by the OPW and been sent back to the Department.</P>
        <P>Just one more step needs to be taken.  A great deal of the hard work has been done.  The only remaining step involves the Minister getting his hands on a good pen or biro and signing the document giving approval to proceed with the project.  I understand that the money is available and has been ringfenced in the Department.  The council is ready to go.  If we can get the approval, not only will many jobs be created during the construction phase of the project, but an important facility will be delivered to the whole Finn Valley area.  I acknowledge the work done by many people on the ground, including Mr. Patsy McGonagle of Finn Valley AC and many councillors, particularly my local colleague, Mr. Patrick McGowan, to bring this project to its current stage.  I hope we will hear some good news tonight.  The project needs to be progressed to construction stage.  If it gets the green light, there will be much delight in the Finn Valley area.  If the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, can give the green light, he will be more than welcome to cut the ribbon.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue on the Adjournment.  Under the local authority swimming pool programme administered by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, a maximum of &euro;3.8 million in grant aid is provided to local authorities towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools.  In both cases, this is subject to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects <Col N="115"/>located in disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.  Proposals must comply with the standards set out in a departmental document, Procedures for the Planning, Approval and Financing of Swimming Pools and Technical Guidelines.  Under the guidelines, there are four principal stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study.  These, in order of progress, are preliminary report, contract documents, tender and construction.  The Department and its technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage.  Local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval is issued by the Department.</P>
        <P>Some 58 projects have been or are being dealt with under the local authority swimming pool programme since 2000.  Some 46 of them have been completed and two have passed tender report stage.  Ten other projects are at various stages of the programme.  Five of them are preparing contract documents, three of them are preparing preliminary reports and two of them are at the tender document stage.  Of the 46 pools that have been completed and opened under the current round, 14 are new pools, 21 are replacement pools and 11 are refurbished pools.  The 12 remaining pools that are at various stages in the process consist of five new pools, three replacement pools and four refurbishment pools.  The total expenditure under the programme from 2000 to 2010 was &euro;145 million.  This leveraged a total investment of &euro;406 million in respect of the 48 pools for which grant aid was approved.  The &euro;6.65 million that has been allocated for 2011 will be sufficient to meet this year&rsquo;s commitments under the current round of the programme.</P>
        <P>In January 2009, contract documents were approved for a new swimming pool in Ballybofey.  This allowed Donegal County Council to proceed to the next stage, which is the preparation of a tender report.  The tender report in this case was submitted to the Department on 30 May 2011.  It was immediately forwarded to the Office of Public Works for technical examination.  The tender report was approved by the Office of Public Works on 7 June last.  The Department is awaiting further information from Donegal County Council with regard to the project before it submits the tender report to the Minister for approval.  A request for this information was first conveyed to the council on 1 June last.  It has now arrived in the Department.  Some of it did not arrive until yesterday.  It is being examined with a view to preparing a submission to me to approve the tender report.  I expect to receive this submission in the coming days.  I will make a decision on the tender report shortly after that.  The documentation that was required from the county council arrived in the Department yesterday.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise the case of an Irishman who died in Mannheim in Germany on 11 December 2010.  He had been working for a Cork-based company.  I believe its headquarters is in Fermoy, County Cork.  There are conflicting accounts of the circumstances of his death.  The German authorities say he took his own life, but they have produced no medical evidence to support this contention.  The German autopsy reached the same conclusion, despite the fact that there was no psychological evidence to suggest he might be likely to take his own life.  In fact, it was contra-indicated.  People who take their own lives usually distribute favoured possessions.  They do not buy Christmas presents and make detailed arrangements to travel home.  There is a contradiction in that respect.</P>
        <P>The death of the man in question occurred on 11 December 2010.  The autopsy report I mentioned was compiled a couple of days later.  A further autopsy was held in Dublin on 18 December 2010.  This autopsy is extremely important.  I will outline the circumstances of the night this man died for the Minister of State.  This man had ended a nine-year relationship with a German woman.  He had texted her that night to ask her to return the keys of the apartment immediately.  Loud noises &mdash; violent blows being struck and anguished voices &mdash; were heard by neighbours.  In the morning, a neighbouring woman discovered the body and claimed she found it hanging.  This is of interest because of the results of the Irish autopsy report and what we know from the German side.  The distribution of blood in the body suggested a blunt trauma as a result of the man being struck with an instrument and rendered unconscious.  There was evidence of strangulation.  There was evidence that he had been suspended artificially post mortem.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>After the body was returned to Ireland, the Irish autopsy took place on 18 December.  It was undertaken by the deputy State pathologist, Dr. Khalid Jabbar.  Some 35 injuries on Matthew&rsquo;s body could not be accounted for.  It is important that I read these details into the record.  The injuries included a blunt force trauma to the back of the head, numerous contusions and abrasions to the face and body and a severe injury to the lower back consistent with blunt force trauma.  There were also some neck injuries, including a fracture to the neck bone associated with forceful ligature strangulation.  Both autopsies concluded that death occurred by strangulation.  The German autopsy assumed &mdash; I believe incorrectly &mdash; that he had hanged himself.  Matthew&rsquo;s injuries were found by the Irish autopsy to be defensive and could not have been self-inflicted.  Dr. Jabbar informed the coroner that the head injury might have rendered Matthew unconscious for sufficient time for strangulation to be inflicted.  The German autopsy report did not refer to a head injury at all.  That is very significant.  The German police are not being co-operative, unfortunately.  They are insisting that it was a case of suicide.  They are insisting that the family go through a legal process to acquire the records they want to see.  By the time that process is exhausted, those records might well have been destroyed by the German police.</P>
      
        <P>I ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to intervene.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I sincerely thank Senator Norris for sharing time with me on this issue.  As the Cathaoirleach will recall, I raised it some weeks ago on the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris outlined in considerable detail the circumstances of this case.  Needless to say, the deceased&rsquo;s extended family is distraught at his death.  They are convinced that Matthew did not commit suicide.  Obviously, the Coroner&rsquo;s Court in Dublin, in returning an open verdict, had serious concerns.  The various injuries that Senator Norris outlined are in the public domain at this stage.  The Mannheim police, as has been correctly stated, indicated that his death was due to suicide.</P><Col N="117"/>
        <P>The family and I are extremely concerned at the number of injuries found on Matthew&rsquo;s body.  Certainly, there were grounds to have this case reopened.  I support Senator Norris in asking the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to use his influence with his counterpart in Germany to get the police to re-open this case.  There are serious concerns and serious doubts.  The family cannot be expected to continue their lives with this doubt and uncertainty over what happened their loved one in Mannheim in Germany on 11 December 2010.  I note some work has been done on this case but the family is concerned that it is not getting the co-operation from the German authorities that it would like.  I strongly support the call by Senator Norris tonight to ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to do everything possible to help the Fitzpatrick family in their hour of need.</P>

	<P>I congratulate Senator Paddy Burke on his appointment as Cathaoirleach.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators Norris and Mullins for raising this important issue.  I take this opportunity to extend my sincere condolences to the extended family of the person mentioned by the Senators.  It is traumatic for any family to learn of the death of a loved one and for this to have occurred overseas, in tragic circumstances, can only increase the family&rsquo;s distress.  I understand that while he died on 11 December, the family were not informed of his death until approximately 36 hours after his death which greatly added to their grief.</P>
        <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was first alerted to his death in Mannheim, Germany, on 13 December 2010.  The German authorities returned the cause of death as suicide.  However, when the remains were repatriated to Ireland, a post-mortem examination was carried out in Dublin by the Deputy State Pathologist.  On 22 April, at the Coroner&rsquo;s Court in Dublin, a jury returned an open verdict on the cause of death.  I understand the family wishes to have the police investigation in Germany into the cause of death reopened.</P>
        <P>As I am sure the Senators will appreciate, any re-opening of a police investigation may raise the possibility of future legal proceedings.  As I would not wish to prejudice any matter which may be put forward for the determination of a court, I will limit my comments here to the consular matters involved, and the consular assistance provided thus far by the Department to the deceased&rsquo;s family.</P>
        <P>The Department has been in regular contact with the deceased&rsquo;s family since we were notified of his death.  Consular assistance has been provided by the embassy in Berlin and by the consular assistance section here in Dublin.  The arrangements made by the Department included facilitating contacts with police, undertakers and lawyers in Germany and with the Dublin County Coroner&rsquo;s Office and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An officer from the embassy in Berlin travelled to Mannheim on 15 December 2010 and met relatives of the deceased.  The embassy supplied details of English-speaking funeral directors in the region to assist the family in making arrangements for repatriation.  The embassy provided assistance in dealing with the mortuary, local authorities and the appointed funeral director on behalf of the family.  The embassy also supplied a list of English-speaking lawyers practising locally so that the family could get professional legal advice on the case and procedures involved.</P>
        <P>Following repatriation of the deceased&rsquo;s remains, the Embassy provided unofficial translation services for a considerable amount of documentation to facilitate the family&rsquo;s contacts with the German authorities and also translated a number of representations made by the family into German, as Mannheim police had made clear that it was unable to process communications in English.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, the family expressed its desire to gain access to the deceased&rsquo;s apartment to retrieve his personal effects, and informed the embassy that an embassy liaison person was required for this purpose by the Mannheim police.  An officer from the embassy again travelled <Col N="118"/>to Mannheim on 7 January to assist the family in this process, and provided assistance in mediating between the family of the deceased and the family of his former partner.</P>
        <P>I am also informed that the embassy requested the assistance of the Garda liaison officer in The Hague, Netherlands, to further assist the family.  The Department understands, from our contacts with the family, that this link with their local garda&iacute; has been much appreciated, and that the response received overall from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been of great support to the family.  In addition, the embassy in Berlin provided unofficial courtesy translation of extensive police notes on the man&rsquo;s death.</P>
        <P>On 22 March 2011, the Garda liaison officer based in The Hague and the officer from the embassy in Berlin travelled to Mannheim to meet the police officer who led the investigation into the death.  I understand that a senior representative of the state prosecutor&rsquo;s office of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg was also present at this meeting.  The embassy assisted the family to communicate its concerns regarding the manner in which the police investigation had been conducted.</P>
        <P>It is the understanding of the Department, at this point, that the state prosecutor&rsquo;s office in Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg is now considering the report of the Coroner&rsquo;s Court in Dublin and is awaiting documentation from the family.  Clearly, it would not be appropriate for us to interfere with any investigation currently under way in that jurisdiction.  As I am sure the Senator will be aware, the German authorities are fully expected to deal with all operational matters involved in such an investigation.  I am also informed that the Department has advised the family to take professional legal advice on its current position and on the legal options now open to it to pursue this case.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste, who asked me to represent him here this evening, has agreed to meet with the family and I hope that this can be arranged for an early date.  The head of the Department&rsquo;s consular services in Dublin met members of the deceased&rsquo;s family on 25 May and was due to meet them again this week.  I understand that the family have advised that it may not have all of the documentation it had hoped to pass on to the Department available and that this meeting may now take place next week instead.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department, through the embassy in Berlin, and the consular assistance section in Dublin, will continue to provide all possible consular assistance to the family, and will continue to facilitate their dealings with the relevant German authorities in pursuit of their case.</P>

The additional element is that it took place at Christmas when this gentleman was buying Christmas presents and actively preparing to come home, and his family were then not informed in good time.</P>
        <P>I encourage the Minister to ensure that the autopsy report from Dublin is made available to the German police.  That is terribly important.  I do not believe they can withstand the overwhelming evidence that there is something here that needs to be examined further and prosecuted.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister that it would be invidious for any debate in the Seanad to prejudice a possible future court case.  I express my gratitude, and I am sure that of Senator Mullins.  I do not have the privilege of knowing this family but it was good, proper and useful that full consular assistance was made available, in particular, language and legal assistance.

	<P>I apologise for the state of my voice.  My throat is still not in great shape.  However, I take the opportunity to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I have known him for many years.  He is one of the hardest working Deputies I have met in my term of office.  Perhaps this is a parochial issue and I should take up the matter in the morning but I believe it will become a national issue.  I come from what I consider to be the tourism capital of our country.  Not too many of my colleagues could pinpoint the tourism capital of the country.  With respect to my west of Ireland colleagues and my colleague from the south east, as someone who comes from the north east of the country and the Cooley Peninsula I state categorically that Carlingford is the tourism capital of the country.</P>
        <P>During the week I heard that the Garda patrol car had been withdrawn already from the town of Carlingford.  This is a major blow to Carlingford, north Louth and the Cooley Peninsula.  We are only five miles from the Border and the population of approximately 4,500 people have been used to a Garda patrol car.  Some five garda&iacute; and one sergeant work in the town and the car has been taken from them.  I understood this was because it reached the end of its life span at 300,000 miles.  Apparently, a low-loader came from Dublin on Friday and lifted it.</P>
        <P>This is a densely populated area and Carlingford is a busy town throughout the year with many tourist attractions.  There is a wide hinterland, three hotels, many bed and breakfast establishments and, the Minister of State will be pleased to hear, many successful small businesses.  Without a Garda car, policing standards will decline.  I am deeply concerned that the word will go out that the patrol car has been withdrawn from the Carlingford and the Cooley Peninsula area.  We are not too far from Dublin and Belfast and the question of apprehending people will come into consideration.  We have a busy, deep sea port in the area, several credit unions, ATMs and so on.  This is a major blow for the local Garda force.  One patrol car does not suffice or meet the policing requirements of this busy tourism area.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State that if anything can be done to restore the situation whereby a police car operates in Carlingford, it should be done.  The car covered 300,000 miles in five years which justifies its existence.  I appeal to the Minister to consider replacing that car.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I convey apologies on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, who cannot be here.  On his behalf, I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I am aware that the Senator has taken an active interest in the issue and has raised it on several occasions with the Minister.  Unfortunately, due to other commitments, the Minister regrets that he is not in a position to respond to the Senator here this evening.</P>
        <P>The Senator will be aware that, arising from the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the allocation of Garda resources, including transport, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  The Commissioner exercises these functions in consultation with his senior management team.  Such allocations are decided on the basis of the Commissioner&rsquo;s identified operational requirements and priorities, while taking into account several factors, including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each division.</P>
        <P>At divisional level, responsibility for the efficient deployment of Garda vehicles to meet operational requirements is a matter for the divisional officer, a Chief Superintendent.  In this regard the process involves the allocation of the resources available to meet policing needs of the division as a whole and full account is taken of the needs of all the areas concerned, including particular requirements.</P><Col N="120"/>
        <P>The Minister for Justice and Equality consulted the Garda Commissioner in respect of the specific concerns raised by the Senator.  In this connection he has been advised by the Garda authorities that the patrol car previously allocated to Carlingford Garda Station was withdrawn from service on 23 June this year.  However, the Minister has been informed that arrangements have also been put in place by the divisional officer to deploy the Garda car assigned to Omeath between both stations, to ensure that services to the local community are maintained.  In addition, the Garda authorities have reported that this arrangement makes the best use of available resources and they are satisfied that it will contribute significantly towards the policing of both areas.  The Minister has been further assured by the Garda authorities that the allocation of Garda transport along with overall policing arrangements within the Louth division will be kept under ongoing review to ensure that the best possible service is provided to the public.  I am aware that Carlingford is a beautiful part of the world.  The Minister is aware of the situation and will monitor it closely.  The Senator can be assured of it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The matter for discussion is the need for a comprehensive strategy for carers.  Last week in the Chamber we held a discussion about people being cared for and the need to ensure that elderly people were treated in the home as much as possible.  This was in the context of discussing the fair deal scheme and people being treated in nursing homes.  The Minister referred to the need for a comprehensive strategy for carers.</P>
        <P>Many people in communities look after children with disabilities, elderly, frail people and people with various disabilities.  They do Trojan work in the community.  According to the 2002 census a total of 148,754 people cared for others in the State.  This figure will be updated shortly.  Of that, some 40,526 are full-time and 108,228 are part-time.  They carry out 3 million hours of work every week, saving the State more than &euro;2 billion.</P>
        <P>In Waterford there are more than 4,000 carers which makes up more than 5% of the population.  I have worked closely with the Carers Association in Waterford in recent years.  I have attended many conferences and events that the association has held to raise awareness about the needs of carers and to advocate on behalf of carers and those for whom they care.  I am acutely aware of the desperate situation in which many carers find themselves.  The Minister of State will agree that many people become carers overnight when a loved one is the victim of a stroke or when a child is born with a severe disability.  This can be a daunting situation.  Often it falls to organisations such as the Carers Association which relies on fund-raising to fill the gaps.   Many of those caring for very ill people do not have adequate supports, training and education.  Individuals are carrying out work in their home in the course of caring for elderly relatives or those with disabilities which would be undertaken by multidisciplinary teams of staff working around the clock in private nursing homes and residential care facilities.  For example, I met a woman last year who was caring for her husband.  She weighs nine and a half stone but has to lift her husband of 13 stone into the bath tub.  Carers throughout the State are experiencing the same difficulties.  They do very good work which is often neither recognised nor rewarded by the State.</P>
        <P>The Carers Association is seeking the publication of a national strategy for carers which deals comprehensively with all of their needs.  Financial support is part of this in terms of the respite grant, carer&rsquo;s allowance and so on.  However, carers also have health needs.  I am aware of many who have become ill as a result of the stress associated with caring.  They do it out of love for the person for whom they are caring and because they consider it their duty.  However, they often put themselves in danger because of the strenuous nature of their activities.  A recent <Col N="121"/>&ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme showed the difficulties experienced by parents caring for children with disabilities.  A lack of adequate supports makes the job of all carers much more difficult.  There are also social aspects to consider.  The provision of adequate respite support enables carers to live some type of normal life.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, recently said there would be a review of funding for caring for people in the home and that we had to prioritise health spending to ensure there was a greater focus on community care.  I hope the Government will go further than this.  I have attended various national events organised by the Carers Association at which members of the parties now in government gave clear commitments &mdash; not only in the lead-up to the general election but over many years &mdash; that they would come forward with a national carers strategy.  It would be useful if the Government established an interdepartmental task force to examine the holistic needs of carers in order to ensure they were part of the strategy.</P>
        <P>It is important to bear in mind that there are many young people who are carers; the role is not confined to older people.  Each group of carers requires different supports.  A national strategy must make provision for a vast range of needs.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to &ldquo;develop a national carers strategy to support carers and address the issues of concern&rdquo;.  The Government will consider how best to progress the development of the strategy, taking into account the prevailing economic realities and the work previously carried out.</P>
        <P>Each Department is carrying out a comprehensive review of expenditure.  This will help to clarify strategic priorities and the resources available within each Department.  Following this, the Government will be in a position to consider how best to progress the development of a carers strategy.  A significant amount of work was carried out by the previous cross-departmental working group which was chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Health and Children and Social Protection, the Health Service Executive and F&Aacute;S were represented on the group.  The group met on six occasions during 2008 and the expertise of other Departments and agencies was drawn on as particular issues were considered.  Discussions were also held with colleagues in Northern Ireland.  A wide-ranging consultation process was undertaken which included a meeting with the social partners, two meetings with carer representative groups and a public consultation process.</P>
        <P>While each of the themes set out in the terms of reference was examined in terms of the current position, because of the prevailing economic situation it was not possible to agree future targets or time limits which could be achieved.  Given that these economic difficulties have intensified, the delivery of a strategy will not be easy, despite the Government&rsquo;s commitment to it.  It will have to be developed and implemented within the resources available, taking into account our IMF and EU commitments, as well as the outcome of the comprehensive review of expenditure.</P>
        <P>Caring is a complex field involving several Departments.  Although carers can sometimes feel their work goes unnoticed by the State, their communities or even their families, the important and valuable role played by them in society is recognised by the Government.  Caring for another person can have a huge impact on carers and their families and this is particularly true when that care is provided on a full-time basis.  Becoming a carer can be a rewarding experience, but it often involves great sacrifices.  It can have implications for all aspects of a person&rsquo;s life from taxation to transport and from social welfare payments to accessing health services. <Col N="122"/> Reflecting this, services and supports for carers are delivered by a variety of Departments and bodies.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social Protection which provides several income support payments on a weekly basis will have a major role in developing and implementing a strategy.  There are more than 51,000 in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance payment from the Department.  This includes more than 21,000 who are receiving a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance in addition to another social welfare payment.  More than 1,600 are in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  In addition to this group of 52,600, more than 17,000 people who are not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit payment received the annual respite care grant of &euro;1,700 this month.</P>
        <P>The estimated expenditure for carers in 2011, including carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant, is approximately &euro;658 million.  This does not include the household benefits package or free travel which carers also receive.  However, many of the issues of most concern to them are the responsibility of other Departments, in particular the Department of Health.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, recently met representatives of the Carers Association who outlined the particular concerns of carers.  Together with the development of a strategy, these include issues such as front-line services and general supports for the disabled.  The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive are committed to the continued provision of supports to allow people, as far as possible within the constraints of available resources, to remain in their homes.</P>
        <P>It is not possible at this time to outline the contents of the strategy as it has not been drafted.  However, the commitment to develop a strategy during the lifetime of the Government is important.  It will prompt all Departments to address issues of concern for carers, some of which I have mentioned.  I take the opportunity to acknowledge the significant role played by carers in Irish society and reiterate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing appropriate support both for carers and those who are being looked after.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response and welcome his acknowledgment of the role played by carers.  I also welcome the recent meeting between the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and representatives of the Carers Association.  The Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, has indicated that the delivery of a national strategy and the allocation of resources will be dependent on what is possible within the commitments we have given to the IMF and the European Central Bank.  It should not be accountants or financiers, either nationally or internationally, who decide whether people in the State receive care.  That is the primary responsibility of the Government and it has social as well as economic commitments.  We must ensure the State vindicates the rights of its citizens in an area such as this.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that is the case.</P>

	<P>I reiterate that the Government has great concern and respect for the role of carers and will be as sympathetic as possible to their needs within the limited resources available to the State.  The Government&rsquo;s strategy is to maintain quality of life for people being cared for in their home, the best location in which to receive care.  I know from the experience of my own family that the role of carers is absolutely essential.  The Government is committed to ensuring, within the constraints imposed by our limited resources, that we secure value for money in delivering the necessary services.  We will deal directly with those who provide the service, that is, carers.</P>
