	<P Just="Left">I have received notice from Senator Deirdre Clune that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to avail of the opportunity to provide for tier 1 international connectivity to the south of the country by ensuring a connection is made to the Hibernia Express cable that is being laid from the UK to the USA.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re arrangements for the address to Seanad &Eacute;ireann by Dr. Mary Robinson on Thursday, 24 November 2011, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; and No. 2, statements on infrastructure and capital investment, to be taken at 3.30 p.m. and conclude not later than 5.30p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes, to be followed by questions from the floor not to exceed two minutes in each case.  There will be a sos at the conclusion of No. 1.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am confining the Order of Business today to 55 minutes.  Some Members may not get in but I was criticised on the previous day by some of my own people for allowing it to go on and, therefore, I will have to stick to the rules.  If everybody plays by the rules and keeps to their time, many Members will get an opportunity to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The clock starts now.  First, I want to correct the record of the House.  Last week I raised the matter of student fees and the fact that Labour Youth and Labour Party Members were not at the march.  I am happy to correct the record of House in that the national chairperson of Labour Youth contacted me to tell me that there were some members of Labour Youth at the march.  I commend them for taking that stance in opposition to their own party.  It is a difficult thing to do.  He was also able to confirm that there was only one member of the Labour Party Parliamentary Party at the march, the newly elected Member, <Col N="564"/>Deputy Patrick Nulty.  I am happy to correct the record of the House and the Labour Party Members might reflect on the reason they let down their youth movement so badly.</P>
        <P>Second, and most importantly, regarding the mortgage arrears implementation strategy, we had a very good debate here some weeks ago with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  All of us agreed that the Minister of State was very forthcoming.  In response to questions from myself and a Senator on the Government side of the House he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">[We] will not be obliged to wait until the budget is introduced in order to discover what the Government proposes to do.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention &mdash; as set out by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan &mdash; to put in place a full implementation strategy in advance of the budget.  This will mean that no one will be obliged to wait until the first week of December to discover what are the Government&rsquo;s proposals.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He also stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is the responsibility of [...] Members of this House to ensure that we deliver on what we have proposed.  That is what holding a Government to account involves.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I intend to hold the Government to account here today because last Tuesday the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in response to my colleague in the other House, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am planning to make an announcement before Christmas [not before the budget] but whether that is before or after the budget I cannot say.  It is more likely to be in those weeks between the budget and the Christmas recess.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Government has had the Keane report for almost nine weeks.  The Minister of State came into this House and stated on the record, which I welcomed at the time, that we will have a full implementation strategy on mortgage arrears published in advance of the budget but his boss, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has stated that we will not.  I do not believe the Minister, Deputy Noonan, when he states the strategy will be published before Christmas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We saw the figures last week.  Almost 10% of mortgages in this country are in distress and the Government is doing nothing about it.  As the Government side has defeated a family home Bill already in this House, what is it doing on mortgages?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State or the Minister for Finance should return to the House and tell us why we are obliged to wait until after the budget to hear the Government&rsquo;s proposals.  Only three weeks ago we were told they would be published in advance of the budget but the Government has reneged on that promise.  I hope Members on the Government side will take up that issue.</P>
        <P>Turning to what I may call &ldquo;Joan&rsquo;s 12 Steps to Economic Recovery&rdquo;, which was published by the current Minister for Social Protection in advance of the election in February, the seventh step states that she will protect child benefit.  I hope she does and I hope the Government is not flying a kite and causing grave concern to thousands of families by suggesting a &euro;10 cut in child benefit.  This will be fought tooth and nail by my party.  Nowhere in any agreement does it state that child benefit will be cut.  I remind Members opposite&mdash;&mdash;-</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Senator is not entitled to display emblems in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that the Labour Party leader, Deputy Gilmore, and the leader of the Labour Party group in the Seanad, Senator Bacik, on 19 February 2011 promised that the Labour Party would not agree to a child benefit cut.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>We can paper the walls with all these promises they have made.  What is the position on child benefit?  Will the Leader confirm that the Government will not cut child benefit to hard-pressed families?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Senator's time is up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, to call on the Minister for Health to attend the House today to tell us what the Government is doing in respect of the 120 State run community nursing homes, including the home in Abbeyleix and St. Brigid&rsquo;s in Dublin.  I want him to confirm that it is not Government policy to close all these community run beds for the elderly.  There should be a debate on the very important service given to our elderly by the community nursing homes.  I agree with Senator John Whelan of the Labour Party, who said this was a bridge too far for him.  I hope the Members opposite support this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure if I went to my local hardware store I would probably find wallpaper with a design called &ldquo;Fianna F&aacute;il promises&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I would like to wish the Cabinet well in its discussions on the budget.  In the midst of all the rumour, innuendoes and suggestions, protocol always is that the budget will be announced when it is announced.  I would like to see some sort of decency maintained in that respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should say that to the Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Please allow Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>On a different matter, I would like to commend a model which is coming to the Button Factory in Dublin on Thursday.  It is the &ldquo;Leitrim Equation 2&rdquo; model of musical delight, which is about more than music.  It is about bringing older and younger people together in a spirit of co-operation to discover the sort of traditions and the cultural richness of Leitrim.  I would like to commend that as a model for the way in which communities can come together and find things in common when times are difficult.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to ask the Leader if the authorities can find as a matter of urgency a way of responding to the increase in the numbers sleeping rough on the streets of Dublin.  This is a problem that is particularly acute in Dublin, although there are people sleeping rough in Cork, Galway and Limerick.  The number of those in Dublin has gone from 60 in 2009 to 70 in 2010 to 87 as of 9 November 2011. If there needs to be an emergency intervention when the weather gets colder, the authorities need to ensure that we do not find people literally on the streets.  This problem occurs every year at this time, but it is particularly difficult this year because there is a shortage of beds to cover the increased numbers.  Direct intervention is needed.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a statement on Egypt and Syria.  We are all aware that people are losing their lives in both of these countries; that there are serious violations of human rights; that although elections have been promised in Egypt for next Monday, there is no certainty they will occur; and that the situation in Syria is deteriorating daily.  It is difficult to calculate how many people have died in Syria &mdash; it may be 3,000, it may be 3,500.  We do not know because coverage is scant, journalists and so on are not allowed in, and human rights organisations have been prevented from entering.  I would appreciate if the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade could make a statement on these matters.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="566"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Members of the House will perhaps know &mdash; certainly if they consult the record &mdash; that over many years I have intervened to protect the right to privacy of citizens of this country against inappropriate media intrusion, such as the publication of the names and occupations of accused persons in a country in which people are held to be innocent until found guilty.  For example, after a robbery in which a man was tied up and stabbed to death, the newspapers said he had died as a result of a bizarre sexual ritual, which was inappropriate and incorrect, and his family were extraordinarily distressed.  I also spoke on the Defamation Bill, with some assistance from Senator Walsh of Fianna F&aacute;il, and we occasioned the withdrawal of the original Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was, therefore, with some interest that I read the report of the initial stages of the inquiry in the UK under Lord Leveson, and I have a specific question to ask the Leader.  Mr. David Sherborne QC made certain accusations against the British media: that they have been illegally accessing people&rsquo;s private voicemails; bribing employees to divulge personal information; blagging sensitive details through deception and trickery; blackmailing vulnerable or opportunistic individuals into breaking confidences about well known people; intruding blatantly into the grief of victims of crime; vilifying ordinary members of the public unwittingly caught up in such events; hounding various well known people and their families and friends purely because this sells newspapers; and bullying those who, in seeking to question these practices, are merely exercising the same freedom of speech behind which much of this behaviour is sought to be shielded or excused by the press.</P>
        <P>I am asking the Leader if he will try to institute an examination of the behaviour of the Irish media, because they are certainly engaging in these practices, to my absolute knowledge &mdash; through knowledge passed on to me and in my own direct personal experience &mdash; and I will be making a complaint, which I ask the Leader to take seriously, on the basis that the editor of a newspaper actually told me that certain recent negative treatments of myself were as a result of such activity, which I properly conducted as an elected Member of this House, and that this was &ldquo;payback time&rdquo;.  I regard that as unacceptable.  I will be making a full statement to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I expect my colleagues to stand by me, particularly in light of the remarks of Lord Leveson when he said he was aware of the fact that potential witnesses, including Members of Parliament, felt threatened by the possibility of further exposure and delving into their private lives should they dare to give evidence.  This is a matter that needs to be examined.  I ask, first, that my complaint be treated as a matter of extreme seriousness and urgency by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and, second, for an examination of the way in which the media operate in this country.  The British media are now, in my opinion, afraid to do the kind of things in the UK that they are prepared to do in this country because they regard us as a colony, and they regard it as appropriate to behave in this manner here although they would no longer do so in Britain.</P>
        <P>I am asking for two things.  First, I ask that my complaint, when I make it shortly, be treated seriously by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It is a specific complaint and will be supported by statements.  Second, I am asking for an examination into the conduct of the Irish media.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien would obviously like the budget speech to be given today in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Government to keep its promises &mdash; that is all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like Senator O&rsquo;Brien &mdash; through the Chair&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to address the Cathaoirleach.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="567"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am addressing the Cathaoirleach, obviously, and my question is for the Leader.</P>
        <P>The Senator should pay attention to what his Government signed up for in the memorandum of understanding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.  No cuts in child benefit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Arising out of that, he knows what he saddled the Government with.  I ask him to await the budget speech.</P>
        <P>I would like to refer to tax exiles.  We learned recently that there are more than 5,800 people domiciled here but non-resident for tax purposes.  The previous Administration brought in what was considered to be a worthwhile measure &mdash; a levy &mdash; but sadly, as we now know, only ten people contributed bringing in a total of &euro;1.48 million.  Something is seriously amiss here and must be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another man from my neck of the woods and that of Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan has made a fantastic contribution to this country.  He has set up his business abroad, he has done well and he has made a significant contribution of more than &euro;95 million to various good works in the mid-west.  Recently we learned of the scholarships he has established.  This gentleman is an example to all others domiciled here but non-resident for tax purposes.  This matter should be addressed urgently.  I am unsure how it should be tweaked but I am keen for us to take up the matter.  I realise we cannot have the Minister here in early course but perhaps the matter will be addressed in the budget, which Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien so eagerly awaits and wishes could be announced today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We must be patient.  Perhaps the Leader will offer a word on the matter or tell us how we can learn more but I will await the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Three times last week, on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, I called for a debate on the budget and, more specifically, on pre-budget proposals from parties, groupings and individuals.  On the three occasions, the Leader failed to respond or to give us a date on when exactly this could take place.  Senator Coghlan spoke of having to wait until the budget is published.  We know from all the leaks we have seen so far that VAT will go up by 2% and that domestic charges, such as water charges&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Cullinane believe all leaks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance confirmed that VAT will go up by 2%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That was only one area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Senator to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While we called for a debate about what should be and what could be in the budget, parliamentarians in Germany were discussing the Irish budget, therefore, it is somewhat rich for Senator Coghlan or anyone from the Government to talk about having to wait until the budget is published when members of foreign parliaments are discussing what could be in the budget.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="568"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think so.  I did not realise they discussed the matter in the German Parliament.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>We have called for a debate in the House.  As far as we can see, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad are being treated with contempt because we are not being given an opportunity to discuss all pre-budget proposals from all groupings properly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator enjoys great freedom here every day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I fail to see what is wrong with the Minister for Finance coming to the House to discuss alternatives not only from political parties or groupings, but to give all of us an opportunity to present to the Minister all the options and alternatives proposed by advocate groups throughout the country.  How many meetings have taken place in this building at which groups have come in to discuss their alternative proposals?  Yet, we have not had one chance to discuss any of these with the Minister for Finance.  It is not good enough that discussions can take place in a German Parliament but not in this House where they should take place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Finance come today to discuss pre-budget alternatives and that Sinn F&eacute;in be given five minutes speaking time.  This matter was voted on last week.  We sought five minutes when group spokespersons are being given eight minutes.  We wrote to the Leader and the Cathaoirleach to get speaking time on important issues.  Perhaps we should have written to Angela Merkel because we may have secured more speaking time that way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s party has done well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I call on the Leader to afford us the five minutes speaking time given to statements being taken today.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Finance come to discuss pre-budget alternatives and that a Sinn F&eacute;in representative have five minutes in this context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is a serious and potentially dangerous situation unfolding in County Roscommon as we speak.  Yesterday, 14 firemen were taken off the payroll of Roscommon County Council for failing to attend a breathing apparatus refresher course.  Every year they attend this course but there is a national proposal that the course would be done on the basis of a pass or fail mechanism although this has not been agreed nationally.  By Wednesday, another tranche from Roscommon County Council will not attend the course until it is agreed nationally.  They will also be taken off the payroll and we will not have sufficient cover in the event of an emergency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The county council responded today in<i> The Irish Times</i> by saying it would like to reassure the public that despite the reduced numbers each fire brigade in the county is fully operational.  That statement is ludicrous because six firemen are needed to mobilise a fire brigade, but most of the units in Roscommon will have five or fewer.  It also admits that the case is before the Labour Relations Commission, yet it is trying to force the hand of the firemen by using  heavy-handed and bullying tactics.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I gather the problem has been created by the ego of one man whom everybody knows and who seems to be trying to settle scores.  I cannot for the life of me understand how anybody could decide to shut down a fire department in a county.  In most cases right across the country chief officers and assistant chief officers of the fire department have no practical training or experience at putting out fires.  They would not know how to put out a cigarette butt, let alone a fire.</P><Col N="569"/>
        <P>I call on the Leader to address this issue with the Minister, Deputy Hogan.  The situation is quite serious and by Wednesday it could be disastrous unless it is dealt with.  I would appreciate a response from the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, look forward to the budget proposals when they are announced.  It is important to note the speculation in the newspapers is coming directly from Cabinet Ministers.  It is very unfortunate because either a genuine battle is taking place to protect certain things or a sham battle is happening which is putting the fear of God into the Irish citizenry, only to then have proposals announced which are better than those initially circulated.  It is a disgraceful way to treat people in the run-up to a budget and it is happening directly from leaks. </P>
        <P Just="Left">We all crave stable government after the general election.  There seems to be a huge instability in the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government.  I want to draw a matter to the attention of the Leader.  There was a major leak from the office of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, on the issue of Ministers driving in bus lanes.  While it is of concern to some people, it is not a huge concern of mine.  The Minister seems to have gone to newspapers to remove himself from the decision and try to absolve himself of responsibility.  That is a brand-new departure in Irish politics.  A Minister has never distanced himself so openly from the decision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is about time Ministers stopped doing this, acted collectively and confidentially, conducted their business around the Cabinet table, took the difficult decisions that are necessary in the interests of the country and stopped protecting their own positions.  It is very dangerous and I am calling for a debate on collective responsibility in the Cabinet.  We are seeing huge breaches of it, in terms of the budget leaks and the other issue to which I referred.  It is a small issue but it is important to make the point.</P>
        <P>My party will introduce a Bill next week on interest rates and forcing the regulator to do what the Taoiseach said it and the banks would be forced to do.  Nothing has happened.  We had a lot of waffle last week from the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes.   The House can vote for or against the proposition next week.  It will be a well drafted Bill.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I want to raise the issue of the pension levy.  We objected to the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  Colleagues may remember we tabled an amendment to the Bill which would have mandated pension funds to absorb the charge, something which was opposed by the Government in the Bill.  It was voted down by the Government side last week.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, wrote to pensioners to tell them there is scope for the pensions industry to absorb the impact of the levy from fee income and charges and he has written to it in that regard.  We now have a new departure.  The Minister will write to the pensions industry but not mandate something.</P>
        <P>I second the proposal of Senator O&rsquo;Brien.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Minister for Health to investigate VHI in regard to coverage for PET and CT scans.  Until this year it provided coverage for those scans but it has introduced new regulations and patients are no longer covered.  An eminent medical person said it is detrimental to good patient care and PET scan use is growing elsewhere, yet VHI is going in the opposite direction. An eminent oncologist has pointed out that he is &ldquo;constantly fighting&rdquo; to get approval for these scans from VHI and that this is &ldquo;absolutely interfering&rdquo; with his ability to treat patients.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">One patient approached the Financial Services Ombudsman and took VHI on.  The company relented in that case and the person in question was afforded cover.  Without access to these <Col N="570"/>tests, patients are embarking on courses of treatment, including surgery, that are unsuitable, unnecessary, costly and, in some cases, cause trauma to the patient.  All of this is happening at the behest of VHI.  Aviva and Quinn Healthcare have not taken the same position, but it may be just a matter of months before they do so, because insurers generally follow one another.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the HSE on its decision to cover public patients for PET and CT scans.  The executive is stepping up to the mark.  However, a cancer specialist has pointed out:</P>
        <P LI="1">Many cancer specialists are pushing their patients across the corridor into the public system to access the scans.  This leaves the HSE to foot the bill for private patients.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Not only is this imposing an additional cost burden on the public system, it is also denying public patients their right of access to care.  There are only seven PET scanners in the country, six of which are in private operation and available for use by public patients, in co-operation with VHI, under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Public patients are suffering as the queues get longer as a consequence of VHI pushing private patients into the public system to access this service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister must take VHI to task in order to ensure it provides cover for people who have been paying insurance for years.  I read about a man who had been a VHI customer for 40 years but had to pay for a PET scan out of his own pocket this year.  That is unacceptable and it must be investigated.</P>

	<P>Senator Norris has made a telling and focused contribution today.  Those of us who are familiar with his work in this Chamber know the courage he has demonstrated on so many occasions.  He has given a voice to people who had no voice and has always been consistent on issues of human rights, privacy and so on.  As such, his concerns should be taken seriously in respect of his submission to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  In the long run he is doing a favour not only to this House, but also to journalism, which we all respect, and the freedom of the media.  I hope the Leader will take his concerns on board.</P>

I hope it is still possible, even at this stage, to defend its independence as a statutory body.  There is unanimity on the Irish language in this Chamber and goodwill throughout the country.  This issue will strike a chord with many people.  I ask the Leader to take it on board.  It is not too late.  We must maintain the independence of that office.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As we prepare for the centenary celebrations of the 1916 Rising, I draw the attention of the House to a forgotten, although no less brave, cohort of men.  During the Second World War almost 5,000 Irishmen left or deserted the Irish Defence Forces to join the British Army to fight for democracy and the future and freedom of Europe.  Many of these brave men never made it home, giving their lives on the battlefield of Europe.  For those who returned, their heroism was met not with honour but hostility.</P>
       <P>In August 1945, the then Government, headed by former Taoiseach, &Eacute;amon De Valera, circulated a list of almost 5,000 service men it labelled as deserters under the Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order 1945.  This list was a blunt political tool denying these men their constitutional right to defend themselves in an Irish court.  Membership of this list meant a person was barred from government employment for seven years and had to forfeit any pay due.  Appallingly, it was the ordinary squaddie that was tarnished as officers were exempt.  It was ordinary working class lads, some decorated for valour, that were not simply forgotten but punished for their part in the fight against fascism. At the time, Fine Gael, in opposition, appealed for their pardon but the then Taoiseach, &Eacute;amon de Valera, and Minister for Defence, Deputy Oscar Traynor, refused.  Since then there has been a movement to have them pardoned as an act of compassion.  I welcomed the statement of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, in the House in July that although desertion could not be excused in any Army he realised that the circumstances were somewhat different and was prepared to give the matter some thought.  For these veterans and their families, I ask the Minister to revoke the Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order 1945 and issue a pardon to these brave men who fought with a sense of idealism and a commitment to protect democracy from tyranny.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I call on the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to come to the House at the earliest possible opportunity to discuss the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates &mdash; A Mission to Prey&rdquo; programme of 23 May in which a friend, a priest I know well, was defamed by RTE.  Members will be aware that in this regard a settlement was reached in recent days with Fr. Kevin Reynolds.  Irreparable damage was done to Fr. Reynolds&rsquo;s reputation and if it were not for his loyal parishioners and friends who stood by him, the damage to his health would also be irreparable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am calling for a public inquiry into how RTE made that programme and the alleged large amounts of taxpayers&rsquo; money spent on repairing the damage done by RTE.  The Minister must determine the cost to the taxpayer of RTE&rsquo;s behaviour, following which funding to RTE should be appropriately cut this year. There are major ethical issues in regard to how the alleged victim was persuaded to make the allegation against Fr. Reynolds.  I believe that other elements of that programme need to be investigated.  I have reason to believe that Christian Brother Dillon who had&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">The very survival of this House is under threat.  I suggest that our behaviour here last week did not enhance our chance of survival.  The way we behaved was not acceptable and we need to be very careful in future that we earn the respect of those who are going to make that decision in the future.  Following Senator Norris&rsquo;s plea to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to give serious consideration to his obviously deeply held concerns, I urge the committee to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask for a debate on the announcement yesterday by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, regarding the guidelines for the size of shopping centres and supermarkets likely to be built on the outskirts of towns.  These guidelines were introduced some years ago.  The Minister is of the opinion that they should be changed.  I was impressed at the size permitted in the Dublin area whereby it would be increased from 3,500 sq. m to 4,000 sq. m and different sizes would apply in cities such as Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  The reason I raise this matter is that the Minister clearly believes that the fight against the rise in the cost of living would be enhanced by this measure.  However, I read that it has come about because the EU-IMF bailout terms insist on such a measure.  It is exactly the sort of measure we should be debating in this House.</P>
        <P>I am concerned at the rise in the cost of living and the fact that the cost of living impacts on every household in the country and if this can be alleviated by the introduction of larger stores, that is well and good.  However, I have been in quite a few towns around the country in the past two years and the main streets of many towns are devastated because of the shopping centres that have been built on the outskirts.  A solution to this problem needs the sort of attention this House could give.  The Minister stated that the recommendations are based on a Forf&aacute;s recommendation of last year.  I am concerned that if we are to bring our costs of retailing and of living into line with other countries, we must ensure that the centres of so many towns are not devastated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was in Drogheda last week and it was interesting to see what could be done by buying local.  Thirty food producers in County Meath and County Louth in the areas close to Drogheda met a group of approximately 50 customers &mdash; eateries such as delicatessens and restaurants.  These businesses did not realise there were so many good producers in their own area.  I suggest that every part of this country should consider buying local and Members could set an example <Col N="573"/>to the rest this Christmas by deciding to buy local and certainly to buy Irish.  The answer is in our own hands.  We should also have a debate in the House.</P>

	<P>I will be brief but what I have to say is important.  It has come to my attention that a young boy in County Kerry who is severely disabled is being denied an eye-activated computer by the Department of Education and Skills.  This computer costs in the region of &euro;12,000 but it is his only way of communicating with the world as he is unable to communicate otherwise.  I know that budgets are tight but what price do we put on a child being able to communicate with this world?  The computer would not even cost as much as what Bertie Ahern used to spend on his make-up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House.  I know the budget is imminent and he is probably tied up with the preparations but I ask that he come to the House as soon as he can to tell us why his Department is refusing to provide funding of &euro;12,000 for a child who badly needs this equipment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I echo the call for an inquiry into the RTE programme.  The general public is outraged.  Some of the articles I read at the weekend leave me in no doubt that RTE has serious questions to answer on this issue.  So far, no head has rolled and although RTE went through the motions of making a full apology, which I accept, I wonder if it came from the heart.  We must look very seriously into that matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Belatedly, and following the discussions of last week, I turn to the proposed closure of the Irish Embassy to the Holy See.  After listening to people in rural Ireland over the weekend, I believe the Government has made a ham-fisted job in this regard.  The subject will not go away.  At this stage, rightly, we have separated church and State, having, in the days of the great Jack Lynch, moved an amendment to the Constitution to establish this.  Although the Catholic Church has no special position under our Constitution it still has a special position in the hearts of a great number of people in this country.  This is seen as a knee-jerk reaction by the Labour Party element in government to try to catch up with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech on the infamous day he went over the top about the Vatican.  This matter must be revisited.  I ask the Leader to invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, to come to the House and discuss the situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fully support the comments of our colleague, Senator Norris, in regard to taking an overall look at and reviewing the media in this country.  Like most Members on this side of the House, I was in the unusual position of not having a party candidate in the presidential election and therefore was able to take a more objective view of media reporting than I normally would.  The whole media handling of the presidential election was a thundering disgrace, to quote an infamous comment made at one time by somebody else belonging to the other side of the House.  It was outrageous.  Each candidate, with the possible exception of the winner, who well deserved to win and will make a great President but concerning whom I did not see much critical analysis, was peeled like an onion every day of the week.  It was mortifying.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It will be a brave man or woman who will put forward himself or herself to be Uachtar&aacute;n na h-&Eacute;ireann in seven years time if he or she is to be subjected to the kind of unfair comment <Col N="574"/>to which Senator Norris was subjected.  I ask people to revisit the headlines in the <i>Irish Independent </i>in the week before polling day and consider the analysis of one particular candidate and the way in which he was dismantled.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Yesterday in the west there was an announcement stating that Ryanair will be flying to and from four destinations in Europe, in France, Spain, Germany and Italy.  This is fantastic news for both the west and midlands and should be celebrated.  No doubt it will increase tourism in the region.  Other airports in the country should take a lead from Knock Airport on this.  It did not happen by accident but was strategic.  The airport reduced its costs and that is why it is getting the business.  Both Shannon Airport and Dublin Airport should learn from Knock, a small airport by comparison, but significant in the successes it has had in a relatively short period.  I do not know if this warrants a debate but it is certainly worth mentioning.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Norris and, in particular, Senator Mullins, regarding their comments on the media.  I cannot put the matter any better than they have, with the different points they made.  It appears the media believe they are in power in this country and we really need to stand up to them.  I do not know who they think they are at this stage.  I do not mean to personalise this &mdash; it  is not a personal issue &mdash; but legally the media is obliged to make an apology to a person they have wronged.  However, in many cases they only do so when they are so advised.  Their behaviour is unacceptable and I join other speakers in seeking a debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Quinn in the comments he made about retail and buying locally.  We must do this and must stand up to the multinationals as much as we stand up to anything else.  It irks me to have to go to certain shops to buy certain items.  I want those items to be available locally.  As Senator Quinn stated, that matter is within our control.  I would welcome a debate on the matter in the House because it warrants one.</P>

I would like to second the amendment to the Order of Business that has been proposed by my colleague, Senator Cullinane.  A number of comments have been made about the order of the House last week.  What happened was regrettable.  There will be two debates at the end of this week about the role of the Seanad.  I would like to confirm that Sinn F&eacute;in and its members want to play a constructive role in this House.  We want to subject Government policy, and the policies of parties that have gone before us, to constructive criticism.  We do not believe we are being afforded an opportunity to do that.  We will use the democratic means that are available to us in this House, just as the Government parties did when they were in opposition.</P><Col N="575"/><P Just="Left">We will do that until we feel our rights have been upheld.  We want to act in a constructive way that adds to and broadens the debate.  If we are able to bring people in from outside the House to discuss the role of the Seanad, we should allow Members to do likewise.</P><P Just="Left">I would like to conclude by asking the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider the possibility of organising a parliamentary confusion workshop.  When one examines some of the statements that have been made by members of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in recent days, it is clear that there is a certain amount of confusion among them.  They are not sure whether they are in government.  They seem to be castigating their own Ministers and their own party policies, only to vote with the Government parties when they come to these Houses.  It would be very useful if a parliamentary confusion workshop could be organised to explain the difference between being in opposition and in government, and between following a party Whip and not following it.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Government has been endeavouring to help unemployed people in genuine ways.  I am shocked and disappointed that in recent days, the INTO has decided to issue a directive to its 32,000 members to the effect that they should not participate in the JobBridge internship scheme for newly qualified teachers.  Everyone in this House should come together to say that is neither acceptable nor right in these times.  The union is objecting and ordering its members not to participate on the grounds of exploitation.  We need to look at the realities.  No posts will be displaced.  All public posts in schools are advertised.  Newly qualified teachers will benefit from this scheme by gaining experience.  Importantly, they will be allowed to complete their periods of probation during these internships.  The classroom teachers whose classes will be taught by those participating in the internship scheme will be allowed to work with those children in their classes who need extra help.  Alternatively, they will be able to work on school improvement plans.  I fail to understand how anybody is being exploited in these circumstances.  It is a win-win all around.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the INTO and the TUI, through the Seanad, to reconsider and reverse this decision.  We are not in ordinary times.  JobBridge is a short-term measure to help our people in the short term.  It is no more and no less than that.  I would like the Leader to ask the Minister, Deputy Quinn, to intervene with the teacher unions as a matter of urgency.  The Minister should allay their fears and request their co-operation for the sake of newly qualified teachers.  Almost 3,000 people have qualified as teachers in the last two years.  If the union&rsquo;s approach continues, it will be protectionism in the extreme.  In my view, it is unfounded.</P>

        <P>We had a Marie Antoinette moment in the House last week.  I apologise if I am perseverating on a matter raised by my esteemed colleague Senator Quinn and others.  As a fair outsider to the political system, what went on here last week was nothing short of appalling.  In fact, it is being understated as to how grossly irresponsible it was to have a series of endless quorum calls, procedural motions and every vote taken in triplicate when everyone knew the result.

Members on the other side seem blissfully unaware that this day 12 months ago, the IMF came to town to clean up the mess caused by Fianna F&aacute;il Governments and to bring some financial assistance to a country that was then bankrupt, and which is now slowly but surely beginning to improve.</P>
        <P>Last week, I called for a debate on the budgetary options because I am politically tired of hearing people pronounce what they are against while failing to come forward with plans and proposals.</P>

	<P>All I hear from Fianna F&aacute;il Members is what they are against.  I know they have much to be silent about concerning what they did over the past 12 years in ruining the country.  A debate on the budget could go in tandem with some reflection on how we have progressed with the EU-IMF deal.  We need to debate the financial options available to us.</P>
        <P>As for my friends in the Sinn F&eacute;in Party who are wondering whether they would get more speaking time on the budget if they wrote to the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, I must remind them that its party and its paramilitary wing was in close contact with the German Government in the 1940s.  Perhaps that level of co-operation might be a wise move.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have been told by many people, particularly the very people for whom Senator Bradford prescribed amnesia tablets, that the proposed VAT increase will cost jobs and businesses along the Border even though, as indicated, it had been in the memorandum of understanding agreed to by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Over a number of years, perhaps not at once.  Is it possible to have a discussion on the economy in the Border counties about which we have heard so much in the past few days and in the light of fact the Fine Gael presidential candidate did not know how many counties were in the State currently.  I ask the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to come to the Seanad to discuss how the proposed budget measures will affect the Border economy and counties such as Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim.  We hear about people crossing the Border in times of recession or at the time of changes in the budget, which is why I am calling for a discussion on the proposals in the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join other speakers in requesting the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte to come to the House for a debate not only on the RTE debacle but the behaviour of the press in general.  We have come to a point where we must reflect seriously on the sweeping powers of the press.  I encourage my colleague, Senator Mullins who has made salient points that he should pass on the additional information he has to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for criminal investigation because it sounds as if it warrants that.</P>
        <P>A number of Members have called for a debate on the budget.  I think it would be a good idea if we were to consider a lengthy pre budget debate in both Houses.  In other countries the <Col N="578"/>Budget Statement is effectively a summation of a period of deliberation, discussion and analysis of pre-budget submissions and various different proposals in the parliaments.  I think the kite flying and leaks that happened in the past couple of weeks and indeed over the years is most unhelpful.  That deliberation and discussion should happen in the parliamentary structure and the budget speech on budget day should be a summation of the best that has emanated for it.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In terms of the child benefit payment, I think the comments of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, were very correct and telling.  It is completely inappropriate that the child benefit payment is not in any way a means tested payment.  Even at this late stage, I call on the Government to look at the possibility of self-declaration.  It is wholly unacceptable that people on an income of &euro;100,000 or &euro;1 million should benefit from this payment.  That is not what the scheme is designed to do.  I think self-declaration followed by a proper means test is the appropriate approach for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join my colleagues in wishing to raise the Fr. Reynolds matter.  I pay tribute to the solicitors who acted for him.  People are open in their criticism of the legal profession, but this was a case where the legal profession stood by their client in spite of the fact that it was up against a major player in the Irish media.  The solicitor took on the media and came through with the truth.  That is a tribute to the solicitor and to the legal team who acted for him.  I recollect dealing with RTE on a similar matter a number of years ago when we served a High Court writ on RTE in the reception area of the RTE studios to find the writ dumped into the waste paper bin in front of our eyes.  That is the way we, as members of the legal profession, were treated by them.  I congratulate the teams who acted for Fr. Reynolds in this case.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise an issue on the European Globalisation Fund, a matter I raised previously.  Last week the European Parliament voted through &euro;35.7 million for Irish construction workers who have lost their jobs.  I know that a number of MEPs have raised concerns about ensuring that every cent of that money is used for the retraining and upskilling of people who have lost their jobs this country.  I would like to have a debate because on previous occasions, some of the money from the European Globalisation Fund had to be refunded to Europe.  I want to ensure that the same mistakes are not made again.  It would be appropriate to have a debate and to identify the issues that arose on the last occasion and ensure they do not arise again.    I would like the Minister to come to the House to explain the difficulties that occurred the last time and to make sure we have dotted all the i&rsquo;s and crossed the t&rsquo;s on this occasion to ensure none of the money has to be refunded.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe has stated the number of homeless people in Dublin has increased significantly.  We should all address this issue as much as possible.  There is a need for more beds for homeless people and I will raise this with the Minister, especially coming up to Christmas as the weather gets colder.</P><P Just="Left">I have made a number of requests to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come to the House to deal with the issues of Syria and Egypt and to have a general debate on foreign affairs.  I will get back to the Senator on that matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris referred to the despicable practices of some media sources in UK and questioned the activities and conduct of the media here.  I assure him that any complaints made to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will be investigated thoroughly, as they have been previously.  Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Mullins, Conway and O&rsquo;Sullivan also sought a debate on the role of, and ownership of, the media.  I will endeavour to have the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources come to the House for a debate.  This issue should be debated in the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Paul Coghlan raised the treatment of tax exiles.  I am sure the matter will be addressed in the budget proposals.  The amount they paid in the past year is certainly not acceptable and I am sure the Minister for Finance will address that matter.</P>
        <P>Senators Cullinane and Bradford sought a debate on pre-budget submissions.  The Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brian Hayes, has attended the House on a number of occasions to deal with the ECB interest rates and other issues.</P>

        <P>Senator Byrne referred to Ministers and the Cabinet acting collectively.  I assure him that they are acting collectively.  The comment made by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, related to a freedom of information request.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Keane referred to the fact that VHI is not providing cover for PET scans.  There is an anomaly in the system in this regard.  I will raise the matter with the Minister for Health because it is ridiculous that consultants can refer public patients for such scans but that VHI will not provide cover for them for people who are paying private health insurance.  Last week, Senator Colm Burke referred to VHI providing cover for patients at a new hospital in Cork.  Perhaps it might be possible to arrange a debate on the overall matter of health insurance with the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; requested debates on the independence of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga and on the Irish language.  I have asked that the Minister of State at the Department ofArts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy McGinley, come before the House for a debate on the Irish language.  I hope to receive a response from the Minister of State on that mattersoon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien referred to seeking pardons for Irish soldiers who fought for the rights of small nations in the Second World War.  The Minister for Justice and Equality and Defence has commented on this matter in the past and I will take it up with him.  Many men from throughout this country left to fight for the rights of small nations during the Second World War.  Consideration should be given to issuing pardons to them.</P>

        <P>Senator Mullins called for a public inquiry into why RTE broadcast a television programme relating to Fr. Kevin Reynolds.  I understand a request has been made to the effect that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture should investigate the matter.  Regardless of what is deemed to be the appropriate forum, the matter will certainly have to be addressed because it is far too serious to be brushed under the carpet at this stage.  Senator Crown inquired about gagging orders and that issue should also form part of the debate on the matter relating to Fr. Reynolds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn inquired about planning regulations and the primacy of town and city centres.  That is an extremely important issue.  In recent years shops and retail outlets in such centres have closed.  Any changes to the planning regulations should be debated in the House.  If new regulations are to be introduced, I will ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come before the House to discuss them.</P><Col N="581"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Moloney referred to the question of obtaining an eye-activated computer for a young boy who lives in the constituency in which she resides.  I suggest that she raise this matter on the Adjournment in order that she might obtain an adequate and first-hand reply from the relevant Minister.</P>
       <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan also asked for a debate with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, on the proposed closure of the embassy to the Holy See.  I am seeking to have him attend the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Noone complimented Knock airport on Ryanair expanding its services.  We all would compliment Knock airport on its negotiations in having its services expanded.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, persons from outside the House will attend the House to discuss the rights of older people, which is a subject for consideration by the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.

        <P Just="Left">In response to Senator Crown, I addressed the question of public bodies being prevented from making gagging orders in cases such as the RTE case.

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Before calling the Minister I welcome a visiting party of economics students from Trinity College.  I welcome the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to be back in the Seanad again so soon.  Last week, I presented the Government&rsquo;s capital spending programme for the next five years to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, having announced it the previous Thursday.  It was part of a series of important announcements leading up to budget day, which commenced with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, publishing the medium-term fiscal statement on 4 November, followed by my announcement of a series of reforms in the public sector on 17 November.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the capital review with the Seanad today and hope that we can have a productive exchange of views.  As in all other matters, I have a very open mind to views that are expressed.  All decisions are difficult, especially in times of retrenchment, and I am aware that Members would like if more projects were proceeding.  We regret having to <Col N="586"/>delay projects but I am interested to hear the reflections of Senators on the programmes I have announced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to reiterate at the start of this debate that the capital allocations I have announced are based on what we can afford.  It is not a wish list, although I am aware that others would like to expand them.  In that context, we have prioritised the investments that are most needed.  Other desirable projects have to be put on hold until the public finances have improved.  The Government&rsquo;s priorities are clear and are evident in the plan &mdash; jobs, schools and health care.  The plan is also based firmly on the fact that we are effectively at the end of a major phase of Exchequer funded capital investment.  In the past decade, some &euro;70 billion was invested in infrastructure and the productive sector.  Judged by a range of measures, the quality and quantity of the country&rsquo;s stock of infrastructure has been considerably augmented in the last decade.</P>
        <P>The plan is grounded in the reality that we need to reduce spending, which is an inescapable reality.  Thus, there has been a reduction in the quantum of expenditure over the medium term.  This must be our priority.  We must reduce our deficit, regain our national sovereignty and put ourselves in a position where we have more resources available again.  We have had to make some stark choices.  We must focus on key needs; hence, we have had to delay some projects that had been planned for some time.</P>
        <P>However, one project that we are happily in a position to part-fund is the construction of the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  When I say &ldquo;part-fund&rdquo; I mean that complete funding will be provided, but from two different sources.  We will supplement this with some of the proceeds from a new licensing arrangement for the national lottery, which will involve an up-front payment in exchange for a longer term licence.  Details of this proposal will be brought to the Government early in the new year.  It is being worked out in detail at present and is obviously commercially sensitive.  Subject to planning approval, it is expected that construction of the hospital will start in 2013 with initial enabling works to start next year.  Without this innovative approach, it would have been a major challenge to find the necessary funding for this important national facility.</P>
        <P>The capital investment report lays out the public capital programme allocations for the coming years.  In addition, the Government is determined to maximise the use of all available resources to promote growth and job creation.  We are pursuing a strategic investment strategy, bringing together a number of strands of non-traditional funding, through NewERA and the strategic investment fund.  On the day of the announcement of the public capital programme, I announced that the strategic investment fund is now in a position to fund up to &euro;1 billion investment in new and existing infrastructure assets primarily aimed at the commercial semi-State sector.  This will be the first of a number of funds we intend to roll out under the umbrella of the strategic investment fund.</P>
        <P>Where it makes sense and offers value for money, we will also be utilising public private partnerships, PPPs, to deliver public infrastructure alongside more traditional procurement.  It must be stated that the private funding market for PPPs is currently very challenging.  Bank credit is in short supply internationally and our sovereign debt situation presents its own difficulties.  At my request, my officials are actively engaging with private institutional investors to see whether it might be possible to match our immediate funding requirements for projects with their long-term income stream needs.  It does appear that there is an emerging interest in infrastructure investment among the pension fund industry, perhaps reflecting the volatility and poor returns from other forms of investment.  A series of meetings is being organised with my Department to progress this matter.  My officials are also in consultation with our European counterparts to explore best practice and similar initiatives undertaken in other jurisdictions. <Col N="587"/> Indeed, I met last Thursday with representatives of the European Investment Bank, including its vice president, along with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, to explore a variety of funding avenues that might prove possible.</P>
        <P>The capital review represents the findings of a Government-wide review of infrastructure and capital investment policy led by my Department.  While I have been up-front that the level of resources available to us does not match the investment of recent years, it remains the case that this plan sets out a significant tranche of investments over the next five years designed to facilitate economic growth and build on our social infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Possible negative consequences of reduced capital spending are tempered by recent improvements in the economy&rsquo;s infrastructure, perhaps best illustrated by completion of the new motorway network.  I should not say completion as there are a few little gaps I am aware of that need to be addressed.  This has aided businesses through much faster travel times.  It helps to boost tourism by easier and faster accessibility to the regions.  With the critical road infrastructure gap largely addressed, a shift in emphasis towards other areas of infrastructure is now possible.</P>
        <P>Despite very difficult budgetary parameters the capital investment programme for 2012 to 2016 will amount to just under &euro;17 billion.  In 2012, the allocation will be &euro;3.9 billion, reducing to &euro;3.3 billion in 2013 and stabilising at &euro;3.2 billion in the following three years.  As I have previously stated, the profile of capital spend will now see an increasing share of what is a scarce resource allocated to the important areas of jobs, schools and health care facilities.</P>
        <P>Creating jobs remains a top priority for Government.  A range of reforms of activation and training are in progress and this review commits major resources to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  While the need to address fiscal targets will require some reduction in funding to research and development, we are ensuring that our direct supports to industry will be maintained in excess of pre-recession levels when total capital expenditure was at its highest.  In other words, although the overall envelope of capital expenditure has shrunk, the percentage directed to direct supports to industry will be greater.</P>
        <P>This will enable the IDA to deliver on its Horizon 2020 strategy, targeting the creation of 105,000 new jobs and 640 investments in the years 2012 to 2014.  Enterprise Ireland will continue to support the growth and development of Irish enterprises in world markets.  Its science technology and innovation budgets will increase the number of high performance start-ups, supported to 95 in 2012, and includes a new fund of &euro;10 million to attract new high performance start-ups.</P>
        <P>While Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s, SFI, budget has been marginally reduced, 2012 will see SFI funded activities move into the applied research arena, which is something we were anxious to do.  The &euro;156 million allocation will enable Science Foundation Ireland to significantly enhance commercialisation opportunities emanating from SFI funded research, particularly through the enhancement of the Technology Innovation Development Award programme.  A total of &euro;27 million will be allocated for the programme for research in third level institutions and for research in the areas of energy, biosciences, arts, humanities, social sciences, medicine, pharmaceuticals, food and health.</P>
        <P>Demographic pressures mean that we must provide for an additional 70,000 pupils in primary and secondary levels.  I have, therefore, allocated &euro;2.1 billion specifically for the delivery of an additional 40 schools &mdash; 20 at primary and 20 at post-primary level &mdash; and the expansion and-or renovation of a further 180 schools.  This level of investment has squeezed out other possible investment in third level areas but we must prioritise and a sufficient number of school places for children has to come first.</P>
        <P>In addition to investing in the national children&rsquo;s hospital, we will sustain capital investment in health care generally.  The review maintains existing levels of health capital investment into <Col N="588"/>the medium term &mdash; &euro;390 million per year or &euro;1,950 billion for the period 2012-2016.  This investment will also allow for the replacement of the Central Mental Hospital, long promised but now to be delivered, and the continued rollout of the national project for radiation oncology ensuring we have full implementation of the national cancer strategy.  We will also be assisting in our focus on primary health care as a key component of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to deliver local care and take pressure off the acute hospital sector.</P>
        <P>In addition to the &euro;5 billion already invested in improving water services in the past decade, environmental infrastructure continues to be a priority for Ireland.  Consequently, alongside structural reforms to the water sector, water services investment will be a key focus of the capital programme I have published.  From 2012 to 2016, over &euro;1.6 billion of Exchequer resources will be committed to the water area.  This will help ensure adequate capacity for economic development and meet pressing environmental targets.</P>
        <P>I have allocated &euro;500 million to the OPW and that includes funding for flood relief programmes in which, as recent events remind us, we need to invest significantly.  In recent years the State has spent heavily to incentivise households and businesses to enhance energy efficiency.  We will continue a level of support in the short term but given fiscal pressures, a transition to non-Exchequer based solutions involving energy suppliers is envisaged during the period of the plan.</P>
        <P>As I have said, the motorway network may be practically complete but we are still allocating significant funding in the transport area.  This will ensure the adequate maintenance of the national road network in order to protect the value of previous investments and target the improvement of specific road segments where there is a clear economic justification.  On the public transport side, it has been necessary to put on hold some of the large scale projects that had been previously signalled.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to ensure we can afford to undertake such projects in the not too distant future. Notwithstanding this, the transport allocation will include the commencement of the linkage of the two Luas lines, incorporating a line extending to Broombridge in north west Dublin, the railway safety programme that has been set out, replacement buses, and the upgrade of existing quality bus corridors will continue to be delivered.</P>
        <P>It is worth pointing out that the smaller projects we are emphasising such as road maintenance projects, school building projects or school renovation projects tend to be significantly more labour intensive than the larger, grandiose engineering works that had been proposed.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;800 million will also be invested in programmes through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, bringing major economic and environmental benefits as that sector is important also to our economic recovery.  It is important to note that the agrisector&rsquo;s contribution to the economy has been hugely resilient.  They are leading the way on exports and the level of funding allocated will be a major help.  Although there have been calls to continue with a high level of capital investment in order to stimulate economic activity, our priority at this time is to reduce the deficit.  The bottom line is we are borrowing &euro;18,000 million this year.  Nobody will give us that money except the troika, and they will give it to us on their own terms and we need to reduce our deficit to 8.6% of GDP next year.  That means increased taxation and cuts worth &euro;3.8 billion.  There is no gainsaying that.  In this context, the public capital programme has to be scaled back.  It is Darby O&rsquo;Gill economics for anybody to suggest that we continue to spend regardless.  However, I believe that we are providing for a level of funding that will not constrain the capacity of the economy to grow.  This is the normal benchmark for deciding on the appropriate level of infrastructure investment.  It is worth pointing out that in the years to 2016, average public capital spending will remain broadly in line with the European average, despite the tight fiscal constraints.</P>

	<P>It now falls on this responsible Government to cure that terrible malaise.</P><Col N="590"/>
        <P>We are continuing to fund a wide range of capital programmes and projects &mdash; &euro;17 billion is still a very significant amount of money.  The areas with an increased share of the overall capital allocation, compared with the last capital review in 2010, are education, health and enterprise, reflecting both my priorities and those of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The public is getting sick and tired of spin and more spin.  The spin we are hearing from the Minister today is the same spin we heard with the publication of the jobs initiative.  Following research by my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, we find that the jobs initiative meant taking money off pensioners and putting it into an Exchequer black hole.  Unfortunately, unemployment has increased throughout that time.</P>
        <P>The Minister and his colleagues are now telling people that the Government is now committed to spending &euro;700 million less per annum than what Fianna F&aacute;il agreed with the troika last year.  The Government is making its own decision in accordance with the economic sovereignty of this State.  According to an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i>  two weeks ago, it is deciding to make the cuts in capital expenditure to avoid the more difficult decisions on welfare and on other areas of current public expenditure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Deputy prefer to cut social welfare?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is cutting capital expenditure, which provides our one chance of creating jobs and getting people off welfare.  Fianna F&aacute;il has proposed a capital expenditure programme amounting to 3.5% of GDP.  The Government&rsquo;s fudge of a programme contains some of our plans, but has no new plans of its own.  In fact, the only project prioritised by the Government parties is the one project they opposed trenchantly in Opposition, which is the construction of the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  How ironic that every other project they supported seems to have gone by the wayside while the project they cynically opposed is getting the go ahead.  We are glad they have seen sense.</P>
        <P>Last December, the Minister, Deputy Burton, stated that even with public finances under pressure, we need to invest in the delivery of the 21st century infrastructure networks that we need to enhance competitiveness and drive growth.  That is exactly the opposite of what the Government is doing today.  What has happened to change Government policy to such an extent that it is cutting &euro;700 million from important infrastructure projects?  It is most unusual for the Labour Party to cut capital spending.  Labour Party Members boast about 40 new schools and 180 extensions to schools.  By doing so, they are allegedly prioritising education.  What about the summer works scheme that has been completely eliminated?  What about minor works for schools that have been completely eliminated?  What about the third level sector?  That has been completely eliminated under the capital budget.  Constructing 180 extensions to schools represents four to five schools on average per constituency.  There are seven schools with two miles of my house that need an extension.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a great record for 14 years in government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a great record because it is due to the increase in population.  Under Fianna F&aacute;il, these schools would have received their extensions.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fact.  We had extra money in the kitty and if the Minister asked his colleagues, he would find out that there are another seven schools within two miles that have got extensions over the last two or three years.  However, it is complete spin to say <Col N="591"/>that health and education are being prioritised.  The only health project that is going ahead is the part-funded national children&rsquo;s hospital, which the Government parties cynically and trenchantly opposed when in opposition and which delayed the project&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the hospital in Navan?  We were told by Fine Gael Deputies before the election that not only were they promising the delivery of a new regional hospital for the north east, but along with the Minister, Deputy Reilly, they had already met investors who were willing to put money into that project.  Were we all told lies before the election?</P>

      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">What about the lies Fianna F&aacute;il told the people this time lastyear?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>This time last year the Labour Party and Fine Gael trenchantly opposed the budget, yet this year they are claiming credit for implementing it.  We implemented it in the budget.  What about the bank resolution legislation that enabled the Government to burn junior bondholders, which they trenchantly opposed this time last year in the D&aacute;il?</P>
        <P>Fine Gael Members have a habit of saying we are cutting X,Y and Z due to Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s deal with the troika.  This non-stop mantra is getting tiresome and it adds nothing to political discourse in the country.  Capital expenditure is one area where every ounce of responsibility for cuts, such as the Slane bypass in my own constituency and metro north in north Dublin, lies with Fine Gael Party and Labour Party Deputies and Senators.  They are responsible for the 9,000 jobs that will be lost to the economy next year.  I know some of those people who were waiting to see if metro north could get the go ahead so that they could continue in their jobs, and I am sure the Senators opposite know some of them too.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Government has made much noise about the focus on health, education, jobs and enterprise, but the facts are that there is little or no reality to that.  Some of the major projects in transport that are stalled or stopped include the Slane bypass, the A5 motorway, metro north, DART underground, the regional hospital in Navan, the prison at Thornton Hall &mdash; I understand there are plans for prisons at Army bases and I am investigating this, because it is not acceptable &mdash; and the relocation of the DIT to Grangegorman.  This is sending out a signal to the world that we are not interested in third level education at a time when our university sector is under more pressure than ever.</P>
        <P>Cutting capital spending is an easy option in a recession.  It is what the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party did in the 1980s.  It is the wrong decision.  Government backbenchers and Ministers were harking on about the need for stimulus in the economy when in opposition over the last few years, but when the opportunity arises to stimulate the economy through major infrastructure projects, they cut and cut because they do not want to take really tough decisions that we took and they opposed, even though they now claim credit for them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My party is opposed to this spending programme.  It goes much further than we were ever willing to go.  It goes further than what the troika suggested we do.  Let us nail this lie about the troika.  Their representatives will tell anybody who has met them that they have no objection to whatever decisions this Government takes under its own economic sovereignty, provided the <Col N="592"/>targets are reached.  The Minister is agreeing with me.  It was open to the Government to make its own decision on capital spending.  It made its decision and we opposed it and the troika had no say over it, as long as the Government got to the bottom line, which we have to reach anyway.</P>
        <P>Added to the hike in VAT being proposed in the budget and the failed jobs initiative, this is a deathly blow to the economy and something that all Government Members need to think long and hard about.  When people complain to them about no hospitals and schools being built or repaired, they should tell them that these decisions were made to avoid other politically difficult decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome and congratulate the Minister. When this programme was published last week, one would expect that there would be some kind of kick back. However, the majority of people, including myself, would think that as we are in recessionary times we should expect the basic provision of services.  We have to go back to the grassroots and our core job.  Everybody understands we are in a recession, but they expect a good level of education for our children, a good health service and the right to feel safe in their homes.</P>
        <P>Two of those issues have been addressed in this programme.  How long has the national children&rsquo;s hospital been on the agenda, with Fianna F&aacute;il in power for 14 of those years?  It was before I ever came into public life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael opposed it trenchantly and held it up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have to think back to know how long it has been on the agenda.  I must compliment the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues on the fact that this is now happening.  Personally, I do not agree with the location of the site, but that is a different issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael accused us of all sorts of things to do with that site.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is going ahead, and the general public will appreciate that the Government is doing what it set out to do and what it has a mandate to do, namely, to provide a national children&rsquo;s hospital.  It must be applauded and I am delighted it is going ahead.</P>
        <P>On the education side, there is no doubt that a lot of money was spent in schools.  I feel sorry for Senator Byrne, who did not achieve much for his constituency while he was in power.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, many of them are in the Louth constituency where I live.  There are many schools in Meath.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I can only speak from my own experience when I was in the other House with Senator Byrne.  Major projects went ahead in my constituency.  Maybe that is a reflection on Senator Byrne, I do not know.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 40 new schools.  I listened with great interest to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, when he outlined the demographics and so on.  These will not be your two and three-teacher schools.  Many of these national schools will be equipped for up to 700 children, while secondary schools will be even larger, to the best of my knowledge.  This is to cater for the demographics.</P><Col N="593"/>
        <P Just="Left">As I outlined, education, health and a feeling of safety in one&rsquo;s home are important.  The latter is something which does not come under the heading of what we are discussing today, but we do need to protect our Garda force as much as we possibly can.  They are the three main things that people expect.  There is realism among the public about where we are, or rather, where we have been driven to, and they want the present Government to get us out of that and get us back on an even keel.</P>
        <P>Regarding investment in infrastructure, I am glad the road network, mainly the motorway network, has been vastly improved over the years.  Now the concentration will be on maintaining our primary and secondary road networks.  I applaud that because the secondary road network was neglected in favour of the motorways.  The important point here is access to the regions.  I am from a very peripheral area in Kerry South and access to our region is not great.  From Dublin to Cork and Dublin to Limerick the roads are excellent, but unfortunately the road from Cork via Macroom and Ballyvourney is in an awful state, which is hindering progress in our region.  From the other side, there is a motorway to Mitchelstown, but access to Kerry via Mallow is not good enough.  I would like to think that will not be forgotten about.  While I applaud and welcome the intention to maintain the road infrastructure we have, access to the most peripheral areas should not be forgotten.</P>
        <P>I welcome the children&rsquo;s hospital very much, and that is where the funding has gone.  Primary health care effectively consists of looking after people in their homes rather than in hospital.  There is a bit of a contradiction here when one considers the cutbacks in home help hours and so on.  There should be a rejig in this regard.</P>
        <P>Recently, the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, announced the creation of 95 jobs in one of his imaginative schemes, but it was at a cost of about &euro;2 million.  Is that right?  I always understood that investment in jobs and so on worked out at about &euro;100,000 per job.  This project works out at about &euro;200,000 per job, or is that a misunderstanding on my part?  If that is what the creation of jobs will cost, we have a hard road ahead of us.</P>
        <P>I recently read that the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Hayes, hopes to introduce reform of procurement procedures which will save up to &euro;2 billion.  Is this possible?  If such savings can be made by changing the way the State does business, that is a proactive and positive measure.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned investment in agriculture.  This is the one industry that is providing a serious return at present.  The goals set for Ireland in Food Harvest 2020, to do with food security and so on, have ensured that the graph is going only one way in agriculture.  I commend the investment in agriculture because it will be more than returned to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>Public private partnerships have been used in many areas to provide services and facilities.  One thing that really galls me is the issue of toll roads.  These were built through public private partnerships, but the Government had to buy them back, and the amount it had to pay sickened me.  I expect that more appropriate fiscal measures will be put in place to ensure we are not fleeced at the end of the line.  Maybe that is how business was done by previous Administrations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Tourism is a massive growth area.  We already have 10% growth in this area, although this has dropped.  The potential in tourism is phenomenal and we really need to grasp the opportunity.  Recently I spoke to the Minister for Finance seeking &euro;1.5 million for a tourism proposal, and he said that if I wanted it for capital, he does not have it and he does not expect to have it in the future.  The Minister spoke in his presentation about means of obtaining funding, be it through private investment or public private partnerships, and said that pension funds and so on are where the real money is.  I mentioned to the Minister for Finance the regeneration <Col N="594"/>project that is under way in Limerick and said that this proposal, for &euro;1 million or &euro;1.5 million, would regenerate the whole of south Kerry, creating jobs and bringing massive inward investment.  I hope that specific projects such as that will be no-brainers for the Government, as they will create jobs and bring employment into areas that are under pressure.  I hope they will be considered in a sympathetic manner.</P>
        <P>Overall, I compliment the Minister on the work he is doing.  I am glad he has kept to the core delivery of services in health, education and job creation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As always, I welcome the Minister to the House and what he is doing to try to restore the economic sovereignty of the country.  I take as one of my themes a comment on page 9 of the infrastructural capital investment document that the Minister produced last week.  It states: &ldquo;There is a need to improve the quality and coverage of programme evaluations and it is all the more critical that individual investment projects are supported by rigorous and objective appraisals.&rdquo;  This was a gap in the system and we need to set up and to have ready for when the economy revives proper capital investment appraisal in this country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is preparing fiscal responsibility legislation.  Proper capital appraisal should be a part of that when it is brought before us.  Too many projects are allegedly analysed by the promoting agencies through public relations hand-outs.  We need a strong central evaluation office.  I will call it COPE, the central office of project evaluation.  In his memorandum in April to the spending Ministers, the Minister suggested they carry out such an evaluation quickly before they are captured.  The capture of so much of the public capital programme by the construction industry and the capture of all of government by the banking industry three years ago did not serve this country well.</P>
        <P>Capital is wealth set aside for the production of future wealth.  It is no longer adequate to mention verbally some benefit and to suggest <i>ipso facto</i> a project should go ahead.  All of this should be quantified to determine whether a project represents any return on the capital involved.  We must carry out <i>ex post</i> cost benefit analyses as well to determine where the mistakes were made because the process involves learning for the future.  The Minister&rsquo;s constituency colleague was here some time ago discussing the Central Statistics Office and its professionalism and independence were the two key factors he stressed.  We need these in economic appraisal and evaluation as well.  We are keen to know whether projects have come in on cost and whether there is any penalty when they do not because that is standard moral hazard problem.  We want to know the shadow prices, test discount rates and the opportunity cost of projects.  We want independence in these evaluations.  We are keen to see measures that the Minister is bringing forward with regard to the registration of lobbyists.  Too many of these projects arise from lobbying.</P>
        <P>The proposed whistleblowing legislation is relevant as well.  Often at gatherings of senior public servants I have been told that a certain person knew that a given project was no good but they did not write it down or tell us.  This is a parliamentary democracy and if there are doubts about projects, they should be expressed.  If the proposed whistleblowing legislation helps this, it will be valuable to us.  Project appraisals should be published at least one year in advance and then the Parliament and those in public life and wider civil society should be allowed to come up with alternatives.  Sometimes the alternatives are damned because they are chosen by the person who is promoting the main project.</P>
        <P>One of the lessons from the independent Irish fiscal advisory council, a good model to follow, is that multipliers in Ireland are small.  This is a small, open economy and one should not expect great stemming benefits.  A project must be good in itself and not reliant on multipliers.  I was <Col N="595"/>pleased to learn that Edgar Morgenroth from the ESRI is helping the Department because he has an outstanding reputation and his expertise is needed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am concerned with some of the old-fashioned rules.  The engineers promoting the Clontarf seafront project maintain they must spend the money in five weeks or it will be gone.  If the money goes back to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, or the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan to spend on something else, I have no objection.  The question is whether it is a good project.  That is an old engineering problem which has been around for some time.</P>
        <P>I am a sceptic of public private partnerships.  The convention centre is mentioned in the document.  What will this cost and what will the annual losses amount to?  Is it simply a case of hire purchase, an expensive way to buy anything?  Capital is not free; it must be properly costed in projects.  I look forward to some of these developments in the fiscal responsibility Act due to come before us.</P>
        <P>Page 18 of the document to which I referred earlier refers to a business case but I am sceptical of this.  Is this a case of a project not passing a cost benefit analysis and then subsequently someone else was asked to prepare a business case, whatever that is?  We need tight definitions rather than a collection of clich&eacute;s.  With regard to the fiscal responsibility Act we are probably dealing with the fact that when the public capital programme was introduced in the 1940s it was done on a rather casual basis.  However, it needs a strong legal basis on which it can be implemented.</P>
        <P>I turn now to some of the correct decisions the Minister made last week and which I commend.  There is always concern when a project is dropped such as the A3 road from Aughnacloy to Derry but there are two seriously underperforming toll booths on the M3 between Kells and Dublin and there is a requirement to compensate the partners involved.  If there is evidence that the demand for something is not what we expected it would be when we planned the project then we should not continue to repeat the mistake.  There are similar concerns with the Limerick to Cork motorway.  The Limerick tunnel is costing us money and we must compensate the private partner because the demand has not materialised.</P>
        <P>I was always sceptical about metro north.  If one is on the east side of the city one can access the airport quickly from Sandymount, Blackrock, Dalkey and such places through the port tunnel and if one is on the west side, the M50 improvements mean one can also get to the airport quickly.  I note there are 1,200 mostly empty parking spaces at the Dunboyne M3 Parkway area by the railway station.  Any case for extending the railway from there to Navan must demonstrate whether there will be a pick-up in demand because it is not evident at the moment.  Besides, Navan is already served from Drogheda by train and if people want this we should establish whether we can run a rail car on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Capital investment is not always a solution and sometimes it goes wrong and one must learn from these lessons.  The DART underground was always a mysterious project.  One can travel from Connolly Station to Heuston Station by LUAS and there is also a double-track railway line with concrete sleepers and electronic signalling that goes past Croke Park, Phibsborough, Cabra, under the Phoenix Park tunnel and into Heuston.  We were asked as part of the DART underground project to build a third railway line between two railway stations in Dublin.  It seems bizarre that the project ever advanced so far in the then Department of Transport.</P>
        <P>Rail safety was mentioned.  I hope the faults in the system that missed the Malahide viaduct collapse are remedied before we put in any more money.  The Sea Scouts seemed to see it and, fortunately, the driver of the train who set off the alarm saw it as well but the people in charge of railway safety at the top level did not see it.</P><Col N="596"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister mentioned integrated ticketing.  It appears that it will cost &euro;60 million to persuade three State transport companies to accept each others tickets.  This is a bizarre situation.  In the Minister&rsquo;s constituency we gave money to Rosslare Europort and then someone took out the train tracks and located them half a mile away in order that one must walk in the rain to get there.  It is a good job we have wheelie suitcases.  What was the purpose of the project to remove the train from a station which had been built with European money and our money?  There have been many other strange capital projects.  We built an investment project in D&uacute;n Laoghaire Port but we did not get any guarantee of its use and it is now idle for half the year because the company concerned has no wish to use it.</P>
        <P>We must also develop industrial policy on a broader front.  Some &euro;4.7 billion is refereed to in the document but the concern is that since 2005 there has been a drop of approximately 50,000 people working in manufacturing.  The public relations hand-outs that accompany industrial policy in Ireland should refer back to reality.</P>
        <P>Brendan Drumm believes our health services are heavily institutionalised and other speakers have referred to this.  I realise the Minister is bringing forward legislation to de-regulate the general practitioner lists so that perhaps some health care can be transferred, as recommended in many of the texts from hospitals, to the general practitioner and the community.  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the new hospital he proposes but perhaps we have too much of a hospital fixation given that there are alternative ways to manage health care.</P>
        <P>More strongly, many people in criminology welcome the decisions to put Thornton Hall on reserve.  Alternatives to be considered include electronic tagging, the probation service, community service and restorative justice.  There is no need for an edifice complex in capital expenditure dominated by the construction industry.  I dislike using the clich&eacute; but if there are better or smarter ways of doing things then we should do them.  The Minister made many correct decisions last week.  We need to improve the context in which the correct decisions were made because I would be afraid once the Exchequer filled up the same people who were awarded projects on previous occasions would be back.</P>
        <P>We need a strong professional, independent economic service in the public sector to do this.  We need to learn the lessons from having to be bailed out by the IMF, the ECB and the EU.  I wish the Minister every success in that endeavour.</P>

It sounds like a statement of the obvious, but we are where we are and it is what it is.</P>
        <P>It is quite interesting that our colleagues on the other side of the House seem to have completely ignored the fact that the previous Government cut spending from its peak by at least 50% and cut it again in 2011.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I find old habits die hard.  It is interesting that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party is lecturing the Labour Party on our spending priorities.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has maintained its commitment to the capital investment group and we will spend &euro;17 billion in the next five years.  It is not a small amount of money and compares favourably with the proportion of GNP spent by our European colleagues, some of which are a lot wealthier than this country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister asking the House for its ideas.  I am delighted the Government has prioritised the future needs of children and young people.  Our most recent census of population clearly indicated that we, unlike many of our European neighbours, have robust population growth, which alone will make the economy more sustainable in the future by ensuring we have a balanced representation of younger earners to older people in society.  The growth in population will have to be funded and we have to make a financial commitment to it.  This programme goes some way to doing that.</P>
        <P>I welcome the commitment of the Government to the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  It is an absolute disgrace that in all the years of the Celtic tiger, when we were incentivising construction in every field in the country, we did not manage to build a state-of-the-art children&rsquo;s hospital.  It is incredible that it falls to this Government, in the middle of the deepest recession this country has ever faced, to have to complete the task the Fianna F&aacute;il Party did not manage to achieve in 14 years.  It is an absolute disgrace.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also welcome the significant commitment of the Government to build primary and second level educational infrastructure.  I regret we do not have the money to do more but I take Government&rsquo;s point that we have to put money in at the bottom.  It is to be hoped we will be better off in a couple of years time and be able to fall back on some ongoing projects in our third level institutions.</P>
        <P>I have a suggestion which relates to the mistakes of the past.  We have a difficulty in this country, due to the excessive cost of housing in the decades to 2007, in that many people were forced to live in the outer suburban commuter belts.  People found themselves living in places like Gorey, which is the Minister&rsquo;s constituency, where the infrastructure simply did not match the growth in population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a very nice place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an excellent place.</P>
        <P>It would be very tempting to start building many schools on greenfield sites but the reality is a lot of older urban areas have suffered from significant ageing population.  Infrastructure and services are in place in areas which do not have children to fill schools.  We need to go back to the drawing board to some extent, in terms of planning, rather than being driven by the immediate demand we are facing.</P>
        <P>With regard to the proportion of the programme devoted to transport infrastructure, it is important to acknowledge that Ireland, due to the actions of the last Government, made major strides in the transport system.  It is only logical that when we reach a point in time where we do not have to keep pushing money into the same road system, we are able to move on.</P>
        <P>We should not be decrying the fact that we are cutting the transport budget, despite the fact it was decried in the national media.  The transport infrastructure in Dublin has suffered through successive decades of Governments ignoring its issues.  I would loved to have seen the DART interconnector.  I disagree with Senator Barrett; we are probably one of the few capital cities in the world where one cannot arrive at an airport, get on a train, get into the centre of town and join an integrated rail structure.</P><Col N="598"/>
        <P>I would also have loved to have seen metro north.  Some of the poorest areas of this country are in the north of Dublin city and metro north would have brought some much needed jobs, despite not being the best return on capital investment in terms of employment.  I am very sorry these projects are not proceeding.  I welcome the Luas interconnector.  It is one of three projects and I hope the Minister has a chance to revisit the other two.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senator Barrett.  We must ensure that projects which comes to selection processes have been robustly arrived at.  Individual Departments conduct their own analysis on which projects should proceed but it is not clear to the ordinary man or woman on the street how decisions on particular projects were reached.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that decisions were made by the last Government &mdash; I will use the Minister&rsquo;s constituency as an example &mdash; where money that was set aside for the N11 around the Beehive, a particularly dangerous section of road, was shelved in favour of the ring road around Waterford because it happened to be the pet project of a particular individual.</P>

It is nothing short of the truth that fortunes were made on foot of this policy by party faithful through land sales and general profiteering with no thought whatsoever as to why&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Premiums for decentralisation were simply thrown out and scattered to the four winds.  It was a bit like &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, where there was one for everyone in the audience. </P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to dust off the Buchanan report.  We have an opportunity to link clear national and regional policy with our infrastructure and capital investment programme.  There needs to be a clear link between regional and national priorities and money spent.  It should be spent in a transparent and costed fashion using principles of best practice.  We need to arrive at a situation where every citizen, taxpayer and individual in the State can look at the decisions made and know exactly how and why they were arrived at.</P>
        <P>I welcome the commitments to jobs and job creation in the capital programme.  I suggest the funding that travels through the IDA and SFI be robustly assessed and targeted to achieve the maximum regional impact.</P><Col N="599"/>
        <P>I ask the Minister to exercise some caution with regard to the housing capital programme.  The current priorities have moved from traditional construction acquisitions policies and the buy and build model towards leased-based and revenue funded options.  Local governments have a long and proud tradition as housing providers in this country.  Although the current Government strategy is focused on moving current support anything away from the Department of Social Protection towards local authorities, there is a real danger that we will find ourselves in a crisis situation with regard to housing much more quickly than would anticipate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are relying on the overhang in the housing system but the reality is that we have almost 100,000 households on the housing waiting lists.  We also have a defunct banking system which will not lend for housing purposes.  We will very quickly find ourselves, given the level of housing needs, population growth and a defunct banking system, in a position where we will not be able to deal with housing need.  I ask the Minister to keep that at the back of his mind in terms of our approach to housing.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to the Limerick regeneration project and his announcement that other regeneration projects will be strategically prioritised.  I am well aware, as we all are, of the misery of the residents of Dolphin House, St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, O&rsquo;Deveney Gardens and other housing developments awaiting regeneration.  These people were left entirely in the lurch by the last Government.  The living conditions in these State housing projects is deplorable and a cause for shame.  We must bear in mind the experience of those residents when considering future public private partnerships.  Such arrangements are not the answer in every case.</P>

	<P>I am making a point, which I am entitled to do.  Senator Hayden referred to political patronage, giving as an example the stretch of the N11 which was not renovated as against the completion of the outer ring road in Waterford.  The majority of funding for the latter came from the disposal of assets by Waterford City Council in conjunction with an additional investment by the council.  The project was driven by the city manager and the council, not by any Minister, and the greater part of its funding came from local funds rather than central government.  If we are talking about political patronage, we might consider <Col N="600"/>the judges appointed by the Labour Party on account of their political connections.  In addition, we had the disgraceful decision, to which the Leader has indicated his agreement, that the VEC headquarters be based in Wexford rather than Waterford.</P>

	<P>I have several questions to put to the Minister.  The domestic economy is on the floor, with 470,000 people out of work and more than 100,000 forced to emigrate.  Electricians, plasterers, plumbers and builders are out of work, yet the Government is taking &euro;700 million from capital investment.  In Waterford, commitments were given in respect of a 50-bed community nursing unit on the grounds of St. Patrick&rsquo;s hospital  and an oncology unit which would provide palliative care.  Neither of these projects is included in the revised capital programme.  Roads throughout the country are in a poor state of repair.  Funding has been taken from local government.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister indicated that &euro;1.6 billion is committed to water services investment between 2012 and 2016.  Under the greater Dublin strategic drainage scheme, it is envisaged that a monster sewage treatment plant will be constructed in north County Dublin, which is not required, at a cost of between &euro;2.3 billion and &euro;2.7 billion.  I urge the Minister to re-evaluate that project, which does not stack up in terms of value for money.  Localised plants are the way forward rather than a massive Ringsend II.  I hope the issue has been raised at the Cabinet by my constituency colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.</P>
        <P>As Senator Hayden said, people are gravely disappointed at the decision not to proceed with metro north, in respect of which firm commitments were given by the Government.  The project would create 6,000 direct construction jobs and 37,000 jobs thereafter.  In my view, the project has been cancelled rather than deferred, despite the commitment given by the Minister for Health before the election.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, gave a similar commitment when he told people in Swords that it was his number one priority and stated his &ldquo;strong support&rdquo; for the project in February 2011.  The people of Dublin North do not believe him when he says the project is merely deferred.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the economic constraints under which the Government is operating, but many of the decisions that were taken &mdash; not all but many of them, particularly in the case of the metro north project &mdash; seem to neglect the needs of north Dublin.  The decision to proceed with the connection of the Luas lines will see construction work taking place on the north side of the city for the benefit of people on the south side.  Will the Minister confirm that the metro north project, on which vast sums have already been spent, will be reviewed in 2015?  It will return money to the Exchequer and we could have 260 jobs immediately if the enabling works were allowed to proceed.  The cancellation of the project is a grave disappointment to the people of my constituency.</P>

Nevertheless, I will answer the question put directly to me by Senator David Cullinane in respect of an issue that is entirely extraneous, namely, the decision as to whether the VEC site should go to Waterford or Wexford when the two were amalgamated.  That decision was made objectively by the Department of Education and Skills.  Wexford was chosen because its population base is larger than both Waterford city and county combined.  There are double the number of schools in Wexford and the number of pupils is considerably greater&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I supported the development of a regional airport in Waterford.  Not everything has to go to Waterford.  There are rational reasons for other things and people must be reasonable.  The notion that one can kick up a fuss if one&rsquo;s own county does not get what it wants, is not what people want now from politics.</P>

	<P Just="Left">That is immutable.  The best analysis we have suggests we need to make adjustments of &euro;3.8 billion to do that.  The Government has decided that this amount should be made up as follows: &euro;1.6 billion in additional taxes; and &euro;2.2 billion in cuts, &euro;1.45 billion of which will be in current and &euro;750 million will be in capital expenditure.  It is a fair point if Fianna F&aacute;il believes we should go deeper on the current side.  In relation to the cuts on the current side, which will be announced on 6 December, 80% of all current expenditure is in the health, social welfare and education areas.  There are no soft options there.  We will get the same critique from people who will the end but will deny the means, which is a failed <Col N="604"/>economic policy.  We need to be honest with people; say it as it is and to map out the truth of what we want to do.  None of these issues is hard.</P>
        <P>If Fianna F&aacute;il genuinely believes that we should have augmented the capital programme, not cut &euro;750 million, but should instead have taken that amount from the current side, making deeper cuts in social welfare, education and health care, that is fine but they should put that on the table so that we can&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien made some constructive points.  I would like to respond to the two specific questions he asked.  The issue of the greater Dublin drainage scheme has been raised on a number of occasions by colleagues of the Senator representing the constituencies directly affected.  I am giving an undertaking now to the Senator that I will have it investigated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was previously Minister in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  There is a propensity for engineers to have big schemes.  They much prefer to build reservoirs than fix leaks.  There is nothing sexy about fixing a hole but construction of a multi million euro dam and piping water for miles is a big event.  I prefer to fix the leaks.  I have given the Senator an undertaking that I will have the matter investigated.</P>
        <P>In response to the Senator&rsquo;s direct and specific question in regard to whether metro north is deferred or cancelled, it is deferred.  It remains a priority.  It is hoped we can fix our economic finances quicker than anticipated and that international pressures will abate leaving us on a quicker path of recovery.  If that happens I guarantee the Senator that metro north will be back on our agenda.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the &euro;3.9 billion of cuts in the capital programme given the circumstances we are in.  It is necessary that spending be reduced by &euro;12.4 billion over the next four years.  As the Minister stated, hard political choices have to be made.  This Government is and will continue to make those choices, not because it wants to but because it must.  The postponement of certain projects will save &euro;750 million, which would otherwise have to be made up through a reduction in services or taxation measures.  It has been agreed that as unpleasant as it is this is the least disruptive choice for our economy and society.  It will have the least impact on our public services, competitiveness, jobs and ultimately our economic recovery.  It is not fair that Senator O&rsquo;Brien has to listen to this.  I often feel sorry for him but the legacy of the Government of which his party was part is shameful.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Some years ago Fianna F&aacute;il announced decentralisation, which was hailed as a stroke of genius.  It now turns out to be a ball of smoke, hubris nonsense that must be confronted.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister will confirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing funding for a substantial number of regeneration projects in urban areas, in particular Limerick, Ballymun and substantial parts of the northside of Cork city.  Is flexibility built into the programmes to allow the transfer of money between programmes, where a particular programme does not appear viable and so on?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for all the information he has given us.  The Minister stated that the creation of jobs remains a top priority of Government.  I recall reading that the IDA stated it was worth its while spending &euro;1 million to create one job.  I know that in this regard the Government proposes spending &euro;17 billion between 2012 and 2016.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us the estimated cost per job?</P>
        <P>I was interested to hear that there is now available in the US a website through which citizens can examine Government spending, in particular on capital projects.  Would the Minister consider the introduction of such a website here?  It would probably not be that expensive but it would give citizens an opportunity of learning about what the Government is spending or planning to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have launched it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Great.  I looking forward to viewing it.</P>
        <P>Prior to the election, Fine Gael announced it would establish a national recovery bank and planned to do so within a few weeks of being in office.  The proposed bank was based on the French system, which appears to work well.  Is that proposal dead?  Perhaps the Minister will tell us the position in regard to Fine Gael&rsquo;s plans for a national recovery bank?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I would like to make a small point which may appear trivial to some people but has been bothering me for some time.  When campaigning for Government, the Labour Party promised better road signage for tourism purposes.  However, this proposal appears completely off the scale in Kerry where every by-road is now adorned with about five signposts.  That could not be good value for money.  Only one signpost is required to inform people of the name or direction of a particular by-road.  Surely this money would be better spent on maintenance of the roads.  There are many signs which tell us where to go over a potholed road.</P>
        <P>There are no sewerage schemes in place in many areas, one being my local townland from which effluent is flowing into the Killarney lakes and the Lough Leane catchment area.  Before attacking rural Ireland in the context of septic tanks we need to take a look at our sewerage <Col N="606"/>schemes in terms of the effluent flowing in our natural beauty spots in Killarney and other areas.  The summer works scheme is an important scheme for schools and should not be abolished.  Funding should be allocated to the summer works scheme.  Last week a school in County Kerry with no students was being kept open by the principal sitting in the school.  The school buildings are available and all that needs to be done is to refurbish them.  If some schools are overcrowded it might be worth considering providing a bus service to take pupils to the empty schools that are sitting idle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Gilroy asked about the regeneration projects and I am very firmly committed to the regeneration projects.  As regards flexibility, we will ensure that all the capital allocated is spent and will be moved within the budget areas if there is an incapacity or a difficulty.  For example, I have indicated the very significant funding allocated to the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  This project is subject to planning permission and I am very optimistic that such permission will be given but it is a process over which we have no control.</P>
        <P>In reply to Senator Quinn, according to figures I have received from IDA Ireland the average cost per job created and sustained by IDA Ireland is &euro;14,000.  The estimate being thrown around by some of 9,000 jobs is based on 12 jobs created per &euro;1 million invested but I think the reality is somewhat different from that.  He asked about the website.  I have created a website in my Department and I intend to have virtually all data contained there.  I am inundated with parliamentary questions, freedom of information requests and so on.  All public data on public expenditure should be in the public domain as soon as possible to the point of determination.  I intend to show tenders on-line as soon as this can be physically done, the outcome of tenders, building projects, allocations to each line Department down to subhead level and the take-down of that.  It is a complicated process but it has been commenced and it is my intention to provide real-time data on public expenditure, hopefully, on a world-model basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister provide a likely date?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department&rsquo;s website will show how far advanced we are.  I have also provided a facility for users to make suggestions on how it could be improved.  I want to have as many services as possible on-line.  To date there are more than 300 Government services accessible on-line as part of the e-government strategy.  If any citizen wishes to suggest other services which are not yet on-line, we want to be able to take those ideas.  It is a work in progress and we have a way to go.</P>
        <P>The Senator referred to the national recovery bank.  I am not certain whether he is referring to the Fine Gael NewERA proposal in advance of the general election.  The Labour Party had a parallel proposal called the strategic investment bank.  I have been in discussions with the National Asset Management Agency, with the National Pensions Reserve Fund and anybody else who will talk to me about how we can structure these things.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund has provided &euro;250 million in the past fortnight as seed capital being leveraged up through international financial partners to an initial fund of &euro;1 billion to invest largely in the commercial semi-State sector.  It is my ambition to have a number of such funds available for different sectoral investors so that investment in green technology and in other areas can be facilitated with seed capital on a commercial basis.  This will be rolled out and the initial fund is up and running.</P><Col N="607"/>
        <P>NewERA has been established.  The process of transferring title to some of the State company assets into one holding company to better manage it is under way and legislation will be introduced in that regard in the not too distant future.</P>
        <P>Senator Moloney asked about signage.  That is a matter best directed to her local county council office.  I do not micro-manage to the extent that I know the expenditure of its roads allocation and I suggest local councillors be asked that question.  Similarly, as regards sewerage schemes &mdash; Senator Moloney says before we attack rural Ireland &mdash; the difficulty with regard to septic tanks is that the European Union has a propensity to prevent us from poisoning ourselves and since we do not mind poisoning our ground waters through sewerage schemes, the EU has to use legal action to prevent this.  If we do not stop polluting our ground waters by means of septic tanks, we will be fined.  I am afraid there is no escaping that logic now and that is the reason the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is taking the action he is.  As I indicated, I am allocating &euro;1.6 billion of the capital programme to water and sanitation schemes and this is a sizeable allocation.  As regards her observations on the schools summer works scheme, I know the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, is very anxious to have a scheme and I would be very surprised if such a scheme were not in existence for next year.</P>

In addition, there may be major problems in regard to Garda numbers.  A certain number of Garda sergeant and inspector positions, in particular, must be filled.

        <P Just="Left">The Galway outer city bypass is not in the current programme.  The issue of tolling on the N17 is something best put to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have stated there are no significant new roads programmes to be commenced under this programme.  We are looking at the possible prospect of leveraging additional public private <Col N="611"/>partnership money and to that end I met last week the vice president of the European Investment Bank, to advance the number one project under  the roads public private partnership scheme, the N11.  As Senator Hayden rightly noted, that was to have been in a previous time concluded when moneys were moved, shall we say.  That is bundled with another project and I am seeking funding from the EIB, co-funded with an Irish bank, to carry out that project.  If that mechanism proves successful I hope we may be able to look at other projects, not only in roads but in energy and other areas.  The European Investment Bank is funding wind farming in the west, for example, and other projects.  This is an area in which I am anxious to leverage any resources I can get.  The first part of the funding is likely but I am not yet sure how much further we can go.  C&eacute;im ar c&eacute;im, mar a deirtear.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no new major road budgets in the capital programme as published.  Notwithstanding that, and in response to our colleague from Galway, I hope there may be leveraging of further funding, depending on presentation of same on a public private partnership basis.  The first up for testing, as it were, is the N11 and the Arklow element thereof.  There is another part, too, as there are two adjoining schemes which are to run at the same time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Which one?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="612"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Newlands Cross works.  These are two separate schemes but for scale purposes they were bundled together.  I should not say so at this stage because it is somewhat premature but having had discussions I am reasonably optimistic about getting those ones over the line.  If we do we might then look at other projects that can be approached from a similar perspective.</P>
        <P>Thornton Hall is not going ahead within the parameters of this programme.  However, I am conscious of the very fair points Senator Cummins made.  We have allocated &euro;24 million to upgrading existing prison facilities and to adding to those prisons.  Senator Barrett also made a very fair point.  We should explore other options.  We imprison certain people now, in very recent times, whom we used not to imprison, for example, for non-payment of fines and so on.  We need to be more discerning in the way we apply this policy and I know my ministerial colleague in justice, Deputy Shatter, will be looking at this.</P>
        <P>As to the allied point on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, the Minister for Children, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has had long discussions with me on that issue and I am very confident we will be able to address it during the coming year.</P>

	<P>I would like to, if I may.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Then I shall revert to other Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is helpful to go back to some of the initial comments.  Senator Sheahan spoke about access in terms of the completion of the national road network.  There are certain related areas, including, I must admit, County Wexford.  The EU route 1, with which <Col N="613"/>some of us who have been around for a certain period are familiar, was originally intended to connect Larne in the North through the port of Rosslare, to the Continent and, ultimately, to Moscow.  That sounds a tad <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i>-like, to say we were on the road to Moscow.  I would settle for Larne to Rosslare.  Unfortunately, that road, while largely built, is not completed.  We need the missing component part in Wicklow, the Enniscorthy by-pass and the last leg into the port of Rosslare to be finished.  This will not be done within the timeframe of this programme.  In all truth, it is unlikely it will be completed in its entirety in the timeframe of the next programme.  That is something we need to work on.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of such areas, and others in County Kerry and one concerning which a vociferous argument was made in the other House, namely, the A5 in the North.  The latter is an important project.   I suppose it was a bit unusual for the previous Government to commit our funds to build a road that was largely to be constructed in Northern Ireland.  There is a commitment to the people of the north west as well.  The Derry-Donegal axis is an important one for the all-Ireland economy.  At a time when we are not proceeding with road projects in general, we unfortunately do not have the &pound;400 million we committed to give.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have given a political commitment, which has been publicly reiterated by the Taoiseach, to the project.  I have met my Northern counterpart, Sammy Wilson, on a number of occasions, most recently yesterday at the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh.  I had another bilateral meeting with him last Friday as part of the general North-South Ministerial Council.  I met him in Dublin before I made the announcement in order that he would be clear on its implications.  We will explore how the road might be completed.  I am glad to have had an opportunity to mention this matter.  It is important for the people of Donegal and the north west in general to know we have not abandoned the project.  We have given an indicative figure.  We will put &pound;25 million into the budget line in 2015 and 2016.  We will work on how we can assist in doing that.</P>
        <P>Senator Sheahan also spoke about the cost of job creation.  I gave the indicative figures.  IDA Ireland has told me that each job costs &euro;14,000 to create.  The important issue of procurement was also raised by the Senator.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, has done a great deal of work on this as part of the other work we are doing.  I suggest that it might be worth the time of the Seanad, if has an opportunity to do so, to invite the Minister of State to go through the various layers of general procurement policy.  The House could discuss how best practice operates and how we can comply with the European tendering regime while ensuring, as far as practicable, that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader of the House is present.  I am sure he will consider the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not my place to suggest how this House should conduct its business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s comments are welcome.  It is a matter for the Leader of the House to consider.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The House might give some thought to it.  Other countries seem to be able to ensure significant projects are devised in a way that results in successful tenderers coming from their own locales.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, might usefully address the House on the matter.</P><Col N="614"/>
        <P Just="Left">I fundamentally agree with what Senator Sheahan said about public private partnerships.  Senator Barrett said he is not enamoured with the notion of public private partnerships.  I used to be strongly opposed to them, but I am now a sceptical supporter of them.  I support them because we have no other option when we are looking for money.  We need them.  The value for money issue must be borne in mind.  We cannot be mugged on them, to be blunt.  We need to make haste slowly.  If there is a clear business case, if it makes sense and if it represents value for money, it could be a way of getting capital.  I am very taken by Senator Barrett&rsquo;s clear and important announcement that capital is not free.  There is a notion that we can go ahead with everything.  There is a cost to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Barrett&rsquo;s contribution is worthy of mention.  Vigorous appraisal is an important part of everything we do.  We started to deal with the general budgetary preparations this year in a way that no other Government has done.  We set out the comprehensive review of expenditure.  We have had a series of announcements.  The medium-term fiscal plan was published by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, earlier this month.  The capital plan we are debating now was published on 10 November last.  That was followed by the reform agenda, which is a meaty programme.  Some people can be dismissive of it.  I hope that does not happen.  I am reminded of the original point I made, which is that we are collectively in the general business of making things better.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Walsh&rsquo;s intervention negates the very point I am making.  We should try to be constructive.  Even if the Senator had a point about what happened last year and the year before, I do not think people give a monkey&rsquo;s about it.  They want people to be constructive and to get us out of this crisis.  We are in a perilous economic spot.  We can do our own evaluation of how we got here, but that is for another day.  If people have constructive ideas for mapping our way out of this crisis, we will see if we can address them.  I will be open to that.  I can do the ground hurling as well as anybody else.  If anybody wants to be partisan and play that game, I can do that as well.</P>

	<P>It is sad that this happens when we try to address things on the basis of trying to engage.  That is fine.  That is well and good.  We will restore this economy with or without the help of those who destroyed it.  We will restore it.  If that is the way they want to play it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to Senator Barrett&rsquo;s point about the need for proper evaluation.  I was about to speak about the budget line.  I hope we can construct the budget preparation in a different way, with a little more openness in terms of ideas and a collective debate on them.  I have spoken at the economic management council about the possibility of doing this.  We will see how it works.  It will not work if it is partisan all the time.  Perhaps it will not work.  Perhaps we are not yet sufficiently politically mature to be able to do that.  I do not know.  We will see.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about the value for money issue with regard to all budget lines.  Senator Barrett rightly referred to the cost-benefit analysis.  We are publishing details of a range of reforms that are aimed at achieving best value for money.  Many of them are embedded in the programme.  I propose to make presentations on the reform agenda, including the value for money issues, at both the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Committee of Public Accounts.  I will see how we can do that.  I would welcome any inputs into that.</P>
        <P>I do not want to take up too much time in case any more Senators have yet to contribute.  Senator Hayden spoke about the shift in population, which is an important issue.  She mentioned the need for transparency and robust evaluation.  Many people have commented on that general theme, which I strongly support.</P>
        <P>I strongly agree with what has been said about decentralisation.  Perhaps we are all too quiet.  Wexford was supposed to gain a decentralised Department of State.  Clearly it will not now be the Aireacht in the traditional sense because that is to remain in Dublin.  Objectively, the decentralisation project caused significant disruption to the totality of the public service at a time when it needed to be focused as never before.  There was a notion that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government would move to Wexford and 300 people would relocate.  Of course, those 300 people would not all have been staff of the Department.  They would have come from a dozen Departments and agencies of State.  The collective <Col N="616"/>memory and the operational capacity were not only lost but sundered for a while.  Parts of Departments have been realigned as part of the restructuring of Departments.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is a brand new Department.  There are bits of Departments all over the shop.  Many of the so-called &ldquo;advance parties&rdquo; are in isolation.  This huge issue needs to be solved.  We have made determinations.  We hope that will be done.</P>
        <P>I assure Senator Quinn that I am determined to put as much data on procurement and expenditure as possible on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I would welcome any observations he might have in that regard.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am asking the Minister whether he agrees that investment is what is most needed by the domestic economy.  We have seen in the past that the policy of taking money out of the economy by cancelling capital projects and taking money from the pockets of low-paid workers clearly does not work.  If there is &euro;5.3 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, it should be invested in the State and in people to get plumbers, architects, builders, plasterers and bricklayers back to work.  This is not just coming from my party.  As I said, last night in Waterford &mdash; I should not mention Waterford in case I might upset the Minister again &mdash; I attended the Irish Congress of Trade Unions regional launch of its pre-budget proposals.  It also calls for a stimulus and investment package, as do many economists.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I accept the Government must pick up the pieces of what was left by the previous Government but what we need most is investment.  Even at the end of the lifetime of the Government <Col N="617"/>and even if all its policies are realised, and I do not believe they will be, the Minister for Finance has stated that there will still be up to 370,000 people out of work.  That is clearly unacceptable to my party, to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and to many other people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s sentiments on decentralisation.  This is a country in which one is only four or five hours away from anywhere.  Therefore, decentralisation, in particular the last tranche of it, was flawed.</P>
        <P>I spoke to the Minister privately about the swimming pool project announced a month or six weeks ago.  It was impractical for many counties to take advantage of the funding.  I did not see anything specific in the capital programme in regard to swimming pools for 2012 but I know from speaking to the Minister that the Government is favourably disposed to looking at this.  It would be a way of sustaining employment, particularly in rural areas.</P>
        <P>In terms of the e-tendering process for projects worth more than &euro;50,000, is there any scope to raise that figure to &euro;250,000 before one must go through the e-tendering process?  I hate to shout about the green jersey but this is a time of crisis and if we are to try to secure employment and if Irish companies are to have any opportunity, e-tendering is probably counterproductive from our point of view.  I realise we have certain EU obligations but is there any scope to up the figure substantially?</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister in regard to procurement.  There is a need for us to jobs proof everything decided across all policy areas because jobs should be the number 2 issue.  The number 1 issue, which will best assist jobs, is restoring consumer confidence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The partisan politics, in particular in the D&aacute;il, which occurred in the past three years, were an absolute shame.  It did not occur in other countries, such as Sweden and Portugal, which had issues in the 1990s and now.  I agree with what the Minister said but it rings a bit hollow coming from those who, over the past three years, did not put the national interest ahead of their own self-interest and party interest.</P>
        <P>I refer to the macro issue of cutting capital expenditure by &euro;750 million.  It is much easier to do that than to cut current expenditure.  The worst may still be to come.  I refer to what is happening in the eurozone.  Will it survive?  That is highly questionable.  Will the European Union survive?  It probably will.  What will happen in China?  I refer to the US where they cannot reach agreement on budget figures, again for partisan political reasons.  It means we are very exposed as an open economy dependent on our exports.  We have an export-driven economy.  If that is dented and unless we get consumer growth, which will be very difficult to achieve, we face dire difficulties.  The one thing capital expenditure does is it creates jobs in the short term but above all, it improves our competitiveness in the medium term.  That argument and debate needs to take place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am a strong advocate for the agrifood sector.  The Minister talked about it being one of the areas which has been very resilient.  Some &euro;800 million has been allocated for the next five years.  I discovered the figure this year was &euro;269 million.  If we are going to reduce it to that, it is a reduction of 37%.  This is the very area in which we should invest.  Have those sums been done correctly?</P>

I have one or two concerns in regard to the allocation of funding to A Vision for Change.  Decisions made in other policy areas may well negate the best of intentions here.

That is what we are bound to do under the stability pact up to which we have signed and what the Government is going to do.  To do that, we will have to cut expenditure.  We have said that this year we will cut capital expenditure by &euro;750 million and current expenditure by &euro;1.45 billion, which is twice as much.

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the matter of Ireland availing of the opportunity to provide tier 1 international connectivity to the south west by ensuring a connection is made to the Hibernia Atlantic Express cable being laid from the US to the UK and on into Europe.  Ireland was not initially involved but there is an opportunity to provide a link which would give international connectivity to the Atlantic corridor region and allow it to become a serious location for data centres.  Technology actions such as this, which are needed to support the development of a smart economy, were identified in a 2009 Government report, the Knowledge Society Strategy.  It stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Direct access to an international IP backbone is needed in the southern part of Ireland akin to the Kelvin project in the North.  The Government should first assess the possibility of interconnection to an existing submarine cable at the nearest point.</P>
        <P LI="1">Reduced latency on international IP links would make Ireland a more attractive location for data centres and associated foreign direct investment.  Such investment would capitalise on and complement the Kelvin project in the North.  This would also make it attractive and feasible to locate data centres outside Dublin.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Although we need a strong centre around the capital, this would provide opportunities for areas outside Dublin.  Cork has received some foreign direct investment, but this type of connectivity is needed if we are to develop cloud computing and other such data centres in the area.</P>
        <P>Initially, the Hibernia Atlantic Express consortium was to provide the link but then the issue came up that the Government might pay for it.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, has addressed this matter in the D&aacute;il and met with Hibernia Atlantic Express on it.  He was concerned about rules governing state aid and the costs involved.  Other high level meetings have been held between the Minister and the consortium along with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and Cork Chamber of Commerce.  While I was not privy to these high level meetings, I would hope some way could be found to ensure connectivity to this tier 1 cable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While it is a private consortium, it is providing exactly what is needed in the region.  We will never get this type of connectivity at this cost if the State were to do it itself.  It provides an ideal opportunity to get connectivity for the south west.  The follow-on benefits of such a move in Cork and the south west have been well documented.  It is important whatever consultations have been held are in the public arena and if the issue of costs and state aid have been circumvented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising the important matter of international communications connectivity.  I am also glad to have the opportunity to highlight the factors <Col N="621"/>that must be considered by the Government before any decisions to intervene in commercial markets can be taken.</P>
        <P>I am well aware of the Hibernia Atlantic Express project and welcome any investment such as this project that would lead to improved international connectivity.  There have been significant investments by various market players in recent years, all of which have added to Ireland&rsquo;s international connectivity capacity.</P>
        <P>The electronic communications market is, and has been since its liberalisation, a commercial competitive market.  Accordingly, the State can only intervene in the market in limited circumstances, for example, where the market is failing to provide services.  In such circumstances, the State intervention would only take place following state aid approval from the European Commission and a public tender procurement process.  In addition, any such assistance would have to demonstrate that value for money would occur.  Accordingly, proposed projects must meet the tests of capital appraisal.  Affordability is another key consideration, particularly in the current acutely difficult fiscal climate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Nonetheless, I recognise the importance of electronic communications infrastructure to national and regional economic development.  Cork city has a significant presence of electronic communications infrastructure.  There are plans to roll out additional backhaul infrastructure which would help in making Cork even more competitive in the provision of backhaul services.  A direct connection into Cork would enhance the region&rsquo;s attractiveness for foreign direct investment, FDI.</P>
        <P>The international connectivity market is, however, a commercial market.  Any proposed intervention would have to avoid distorting the market and avoid undermining investments made by other market players.  It would be unfair to intervene in the market in a manner that would cut across those who have invested private funding in the building of international connectivity networks.</P>
        <P>While I welcome additional international connectivity to the island from other countries, no deficiency in connectivity has been brought to my Department&rsquo;s attention.  The existing network owners have significant capacity available while other consortia are in the process of planning transatlantic connectivity with connections to Ireland.</P>
        <P>The next generation broadband task force, chaired by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and of which I am a member, is considering how best to facilitate the roll-out of next generation broadband across Ireland.  While several issues are being considered and progressed, the matter of international connectivity is not one which is a cause for concern.</P>
        <P>While I would be glad to see direct international connectivity coming into Cork, my Department cannot undermine investments already made or other possible private sector investment by an intervention in this commercial market.  If in the future a decision is taken to intervene in the market, the Department will abide by the various laws and rules governing state aid.  The Department will also be required to ensure any intervention warrants the Exchequer funding required and the procurement process is open to any party that might have an interest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this important topic and I am glad to have had the opportunity to clarify the important matters raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State claimed there is no deficiency in connectivity in the area.  However, a 2009 Forf&aacute;s report on competitiveness in the south west stated:</P><Col N="622"/>
        <P LI="1">. . . quality and cost of broadband services remains a significant issue.  In particular, international backhaul from Cork city and other large urban centres in the region including the Tralee-Killarney hub is at least 25% more expensive than from Dublin or comparable UK regional cities . . .</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am glad the Senator has brought this issue to my attention.  I will point this out to the Department.  It is critical that such facts of which the Department may not be aware are brought to its attention.</P>
