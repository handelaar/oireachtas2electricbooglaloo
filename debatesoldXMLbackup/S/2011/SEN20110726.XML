	<P>I have received notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>

        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Social Protection to outline the reasons supplementary welfare allowance is being refused to an Irish citizen and her family (details supplied) who has appealed a social welfare decision and whether the Department has awarded the same payment to anyone else of similar circumstances.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

       <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I express our deepest condolences to the people of Norway on the brutal and senseless murder of many young people, the bombing in Oslo and the subsequent shootings.</P>
        <P>I also express our satisfaction with the deal done last week.  I commend the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and all others involved in securing a new EU deal.  What this proves is that this is not an Irish issue but a Europe-wide one.  The changes in the interest rate and the term of the loan repayments are welcome.  As I said at the start of this Seanad term, my party will endeavour to be constructive at all times in regard to the business of the Oireachtas.  Credit where credit is due, if one will excuse the pun.  A watching brief is necessary because I do not believe Europe is through this crisis yet.</P>
        <P>I draw Senators&rsquo; attention to a motion on the Order Paper on Palestine, signed by 22 Senators.  It calls for the recognition of a Palestinian state and expresses support for the Palestinians at the UN General Assembly meeting in September.  I realise the Government may be somewhat constrained in this regard but I ask all Senators who have not yet signed this motion to look at the content of what we have tabled in conjunction with other colleagues in the House.  Perhaps Senators will see their way to putting their names to this motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Proposals in regard to the household charge will be put to the Cabinet for a decision today.  It is reported that the charge will be &euro;100 per annum, substantially less than that originally proposed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It appears the Government is rolling back from a flat rate water charge and is moving towards Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s position of metered water charges, charging for water only when meters are in place, providing a certain amount of free water and enshrining in that the ability to pay principle.  Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention that water charges will not be imposed prior to the installation of water meters in households throughout the country?</P>
        <P>As the Leader is aware, Private Members&rsquo; time tomorrow will be devoted to the Family Home Bill 2011, which is sponsored by Senator MacSharry and others.  Earlier this morning, I was interested to read that AIB has indicated it sent proposals to the Central Bank in respect of assisting people whose mortgages are in arrears.  I ask Senators to peruse the Bill to which I refer, particularly as it provides us with an opportunity to enshrine in law protection for homeowners in respect of their principal private residences.  I hope we can engage in a fruitful debate on the legislation tomorrow evening and that we will be able to enshrine in law the protection which many thousands of people are seeking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I join Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien in offering our condolences to the people of Norway in respect of the brutal murders which occurred last weekend.  Everyone would agree that those murders were chilling in nature and must be condemned outright.  For those of us in the Labour Party, it is particularly terrifying to consider the comparison with this country.  We also hold a youth summer camp every year. <Col N="827"/> It is dreadful to think that such a camp, in which teenagers and young children are involved, could be targeted in this appalling and horrific way.  We all offer our sympathy to the people of Norway.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the announcement on Friday last of the reduction in the interest rate and the extension of the period applying to Ireland&rsquo;s loans from the EU, etc.  That was a major achievement on the part of the Government.  Both the Labour Party and Fine Gael made commitments to have the interest rate reduced during the election campaign but many doubted whether this could be done.  We are all glad to see that it now has been done.  As Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien stated, there is a watching brief in respect of this matter because there is a much larger context than just that relating to the loans to Ireland and the terms relating thereto.  What has been achieved will ease our great financial difficulties and is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I accept that it is to be taken without debate but I welcome the motion on changing the name of the Seanad Public Petitions Committee.  For the information of colleagues, it is not intended to change anything about the committee other than its name.  At a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges it was agreed that the name should be changed to the Seanad Public Consultation Committee because this provides a more accurate and appropriate description of what we intend to do, namely, to seek consultation with and submissions from members of the public and to allow for greater engagement with the latter in this House than has been the case heretofore.  The terms of reference already drawn up by the CPP will stand and it is anticipated that the type of public consultation to which I refer will be able to take place from September next.  What is envisaged will be an important new addition to the work of the Seanad.  It will also make that work more effective and visible.</P>
        <P>I welcome the announcement to the effect that the House will debate the Cloyne report this week.  I am aware that the schedule for today and tomorrow is quite crowded.  I compliment the Leader, therefore, for ensuring that the House will be able to engage in a two-hour debate on the report.  I believe I am correct in stating that the debate can continued in the autumn because there may be Senators who may wish to contribute but who may not be able to do so during the two hours set aside.  I hope that, if necessary, the House will be able to continue its debate on the report in the autumn.  We will be in a position to discuss the announcement that the papal nuncio has been recalled, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement that he is awaiting an official response from the Vatican and other matters tomorrow.  I welcome the fact that we will have the opportunity to debate the report this week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with comments that have been made regarding the chilling events that took place in Norway at the weekend.  I am sure all Senators would want to remember those who were lost or injured and their families in their thoughts and prayers.  Let us hope that events of this nature never visit our shores again.</P>
        <P>I wish to note the judgment handed down yesterday in the Circuit Court by Judge Teehan whereby a decision of the Equality Tribunal against a school to the effect that it had indirectly discriminated against a member of the Traveller community was overturned.  Whereas the judge&rsquo;s decision, all things considered, was good, it highlights the complexity that surrounds the issue of school admission and enrolment policies.  In that context, the discussion document put forward by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, is welcome.</P>
        <P>I am seeking &mdash; on the resumption of business in the autumn &mdash; a debate relating to school admission and enrolment policies.  It is clear that there are legitimate but competing values to be considered in respect of this matter.  The right of members of particular faith communities to be able to access an education that reflects their ethos must be considered.  In addition, the need for inclusivity must be respected and we must ensure that people with special needs, <Col N="828"/>members of the Traveller community or immigrants are not at the bottom of the list when it comes to accessing school places.</P>
        <P>A number of issues arise in respect of the matter to which I refer.  These include the fact that there is no easy way to proceed, that different rights are competing with each other and that there is a need to ensure equality and diversity.  However, matters eventually boil down to the need to have adequate numbers of school places and legitimate diversity in school provision in each area in order that people might genuinely access a form of education that meets their particular needs.  If there is a shortage of school places, then there will never be an easy way to determine who should be given a place when a school hits its maximum enrolment and matters come down to a lottery.  In such circumstances, somebody will lose out and he or she will have legitimate grounds for complaint.  There is a need to consider how we might provide resources into the future in order to ensure that people will have genuine choice when seeking to access education.</P>
        <P>I welcome what has been stated in respect of the Cloyne report, particularly Senator Bacik&rsquo;s comments to the effect that the debate on it can be continued in the autumn.  Colleagues will be aware that Senators Quinn, Walsh, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and I have tabled an amendment to the all-party motion on the report.  I would be grateful if other Senators would examine the amendment with fresh and discerning eyes and consider whether they can support it.  In light of the fact that two hours may not be sufficient to allow everyone who wishes to do so to contribute to the debate on this extremely important and sensitive issue tomorrow, perhaps the Leader will confirm that a vote will not be taken at the end of the two-hour period &mdash; either on the motion or the proposed amendment &mdash; and will be held over until the resumption of business in the autumn.  It would be wrong to put the issue to a vote until everybody who wishes to contribute has the opportunity to do so.  That is almost self-evident.  I would welcome the thoughts and contributions of other Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; on that point.</P>
        <P>If the Cathaoirleach will indulge me, I wish to offer a clarification.  My colleague, Senator Norris, was puzzled some weeks ago when I mentioned that I was involved in the trusteeship of approximately 112 voluntary secondary schools.  This led a number of people asking whether it was irresponsible of me to be on so many&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a matter for the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>All I am asking is to be given the opportunity to correct the position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am simply seeking to facilitate the House in its understanding that I am the member of one trusteeship body.  Perhaps what occurred a number of weeks ago highlights the need for Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; to understand the distinction between trusteeships and boards of management, particularly as any confusion in that regard can create unnecessary difficulty for persons such as myself in the context of being obliged to deal with questions that are based on a false premise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P>I join previous speakers in offering my condolences and sympathies to the people of Norway.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to raise the matter of the takeover of Superquinn by the Musgrave Group.  Media reports indicate that Superquinn&rsquo;s existing suppliers have this week received cheques which have bounced.  This will have crippling consequences for their businesses.  Superquinn&rsquo;s loyal suppliers require more certainty and clarity regarding payments owed to them.  I was concerned <Col N="829"/>to discover that payment will be made in respect of deliveries made since Monday last, 18 July, but that payment will not be made with regard to deliveries made before that date.  A dedicated staff complement has been appointed by the Musgrave Group to cater for the suppliers to whom I refer.  Additional information must be provided and a more serious commitment given to suppliers.  Small businesses cannot be allowed to be squeezed out in this way.</P>
        <P>Problems of this nature have arisen in recent years in my county and other Border counties as a result of companies going out of business and leaving sub-contractors and suppliers out of pocket.  What is the position with regard to the Bill relating to this matter which was introduced by Senator Feargal Quinn?  What can be done to safeguard the livelihoods of the people to whom I refer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleague, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, in welcoming the reduction in the interest rate payable by Ireland on its bailout deal and the doubling of the repayment term to 14 years.  European leaders, in the main, have been behind the curve on the debt crisis, but this brings them somewhat up to speed.  Team Ireland must be commended on its work in this regard, including the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, and other members of the negotiating team.  We all welcome the progress made last week.</P>
        <P>These developments offer a timely context for the proposal my colleagues and I will bring forward in Private Members&rsquo; time tomorrow, namely, the Family Home Bill 2011.  Given that we have succeeded in negotiating a lower rate of interest and doubling the repayment term in respect of our international obligations, which will facilitate us in meeting those obligations in the coming years, there is surely an equal obligation on us as legislators to put in place a template to allow families in this country to meet their own obligations.  The Bill we are putting forward provides that template by offering flexible solutions which will allow people the dignity to meet their financial obligations.  It does so by providing the courts with a set of tools which give people the ability to protect themselves, meet their obligations in the medium to long term and ensure they can remain in their family home.  I urge colleagues to take the historic step of acting in unison with us tomorrow.  We will have the opportunity, if the Bill passes Second Stage, to improve it further by way of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In that context, I commend the group, New Beginning, for its recent court victory, which highlighted an anomaly in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009.  That decision effectively casts doubt on any orders for repossession granted in recent years and will therefore afford a stay of execution to some families in danger of losing their homes.  As such, I welcome the ruling, notwithstanding my view that our Private Members&rsquo; Bill, if enacted by the Seanad, will mark a vital and constructive beginning in tackling this important issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Members of the other House have mostly adjourned to the Galway races, with many colour writers and other members of the media&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an unfair comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is highly regrettable that &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; will not be broadcast this week.  This underlines, once again, the disdain and contempt in which the mainstream media hold the actions of this House.  In advance of any referendum, they seem to have decided the Seanad will be abolished and have the gall to claim that proceedings in the House are simply not newsworthy.  It is the news editors of Pat Kenny&rsquo;s shows, other RTE programmes and other mainstream media who determine the news.  How dare they take this view when such important issues are being debated in this House today and tomorrow?  They are showing contempt not only for us but also for the Irish people by denying them the right to know what is happening in the House.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="830"/>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join others in expressing my deep sympathy to the parents of the Norwegian children who died in such tragic circumstances in recent days.  The idea that a gunman can walk up to a child on the beach and shoot him or her at point blank range is horrific to any right-thinking person.  Various newspaper reports have indicated that it took the Norwegian authorities up to 90 minutes to launch a successful counter attack.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Defence what provisions are in place in the State to enable a rapid response in the event of a similar attack?  In the modern world we must be all conscious of the existence of extremists of every hue who are determined to undermine democracy.  We must have confidence that we are equipped and able to respond in an appropriate way.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Will the Leader invite the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Willie Penrose, to the House early in the next session for a debate on social housing?  I am concerned by certain recently introduced statutory instruments governing the allocation of social housing in terms of their implications for tenants participating in the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  Under that scheme, people are accommodated under long-term rental arrangements which are secured by local authorities.  An interpretation has been put forward that the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 makes appropriate allocation for people under the RAS and, as such, they are no longer eligible for inclusion on the social housing waiting list.  As somebody who negotiated the RAS in 2004 and 2005, I am aware that a commitment &mdash; what I would describe as a legal commitment &mdash; was given to those persons on the housing waiting list who availed of RAS accommodation that they would continue to be included on the list.  This matter must be clarified.  It has engendered widespread panic in the community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should submit this matter for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be beneficial if the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, were to clarify for the House the new measures relating to the allocation of social housing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I read during the week that a professor in Columbia University posed the question to his students, as a matter for ethical debate, why 12% of people in one country might have agreed to be organ donors while the corresponding figure in a neighbouring country was 99.9%.  The students discussed, among other issues, whether it was to do with religion or was a question of the availability of advanced surgery techniques.  The answer was that the second country, Austria, has an opt-out or presumed consent system while the other, Germany, does not.  I mention this in reference to the Human Body Organs and Human Tissue Bill 2008 which I introduced in this House and in respect of which Second Stage was adjourned in order to allow the then Government to consult on the proposals.  In those countries which have an opt-out system, with well trained co-ordinators in hospitals, lives are saved.  I am aware of concerns regarding such a system, but it is worthy of another debate in this House.</P>
        <P>I received a letter during the week &mdash; I am not sure whether other Members received the same &mdash; on the subject of the regulation of  betting shop opening hours.  I have no particular enthusiasm for gambling, but it seems the relevant legislation has been in place since 1931.  I understand betting shops, unless there is a horse race, must close at 6.30 p.m. from September until March.  We might well ask whether this should be a matter of concern to us, but I am told that 6,000 people are working in betting shops and that 600 of them may lose their jobs in September.  Although we may be not be enthusiastic about gambling, there is something to be said for at least reviewing regulations based on legislation introduced 80 years ago.</P>
        <P>In the context of the horrific events in Norway, I remind colleagues that I have raised the question in this House of whether it is time to review our national anthem.  I love the melody and the atmosphere of the composition, but it is perhaps time to reconsider the lyrics.  It is a <Col N="831"/>32-county Ireland national anthem and I am not sure whether the lyrics, as we hear them in English, are suitable.  No doubt some will point to the British or French national anthems, for example, as similarly bloodthirsty.  However, at a time when we are concerned at the strong nationalist views expressed by people such as the individual in Norway, it may be time to set a standard by reviewing our anthem.  It is a great tune but the lyrics date from the beginning of the last century and may need to be reconsidered.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>On Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s point regarding the national anthem, the formula we use in certain amendments &mdash;  &ldquo;that the words proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo; &mdash; comes to mind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach may bring clarity to the Seanad after all these years.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Aideen Hayden&rsquo;s comments in regard to the rental accommodation scheme, which has been one of the most successful social housing initiatives of the past decade.  We all offered reassurances to constituents when the scheme was introduced that their participation would not preclude them from remaining on the social housing list.  That issue must be clarified.  It would be helpful if, as the Senator suggested, a debate on social housing were arranged early in the new session.</P>
      
        <P>It remains not just a mystery but a cause of deep annoyance to tens of thousands of people on housing lists that, at a time when there are so many vacant properties in housing estates, we cannot marry that problem with a solution for the people looking for housing.  We need a new formula for housing, local authority housing and social housing.  A debate in the early autumn would be helpful and I support Senator Hayden&rsquo;s comments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the people of Norway, the victims and their families and the AUF party, which is aggrieved at what happened.  We must be careful not to allow one extremist or crazed individual to set the agenda.  That is why I oppose the view proposed by Senator Quinn, that we should change our national anthem on foot of events in Norway.  Comments such as that play into the hands of extremists who want to set the agenda.  It is most unwelcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the comments of Members on the renegotiated bailout.  The language used so far is interesting.  Fianna F&aacute;il has described the deal as constructive and the Labour Party has hailed it as a major achievement.  Senator MacSharry referred to Team Ireland but he is referring to a team of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  The renegotiated deal is the same deal that the two parties in government opposed when they were in opposition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This week, I was reminded of how far the Labour Party had travelled when I heard Deputy Eamon Gilmore saying that people should put the green jersey on and get behind the Government effort in terms of the bailout.  The person most vociferous in the D&aacute;il before the last election, on his feet every day of the week, opposing the bailout and the fact that, as will occur this week, &euro;18 billion of taxpayers money was transferred to banks, was Deputy Eamon Gilmore and this led him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently called for a proper debate about the terms of the bailout.  It is clear there is a consensus among the main political parties, who are happy to sell this country and its taxpayers down the river&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">My question concerns the proposal of Senator Higgins to have a debate on social housing in the autumn, particularly the rental accommodation scheme with which I am familiar in Donegal.  Initially, I was in favour of the scheme because it brought people from substandard accommodation into reasonable accommodation.  However, when we go down the road of bringing people off the housing list, it is counter-productive and therefore I welcome the debate on the scheme and social housing in general, which I take it we will debate in the autumn.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the congratulations offered to the Government and European leaders for the interest rate reduction.  It deserves some nitpicking and we will have the opportunity to do so later.  It is a good deal and it is good news for the country that the interest rate has been substantially reduced.  However, further challenges remain.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We await the decision on charging ordinary folk &euro;100 per house, including local authority housing I presume.  The idea that any Government will pay out &euro;1 billion on unguaranteed senior bonds in November is crazy and I urge the Government to negotiate as hard as it can on this issue.  The public will not put up with &euro;1 billion being paid in November to a particular bondholder at the same time as the harshest budget ever.</P>
        <P>The Government does not realise the opposition it will face over the &euro;100 charge.  It is the most inequitable charge if a millionaire pays the same as an ordinary person.  It is not right and it will not be paid.  There will be mass protests comparable to the poll tax in the UK, which caused major resentment and was the downfall of the Conservative Party Government at the time.  I am utterly opposed to the flat rate charge and there will be massive opposition to a flat rate charge on utility bills.  It is completely wrong in the context of no significant spending cuts in local authorities.  The public will not fund local authorities if it does not get value for money, if staff do not return telephone calls on various issues and do not telephone public representatives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mortgages are in the news and I concur with Senator MacSharry on the point about the interest rate cut and the lengthening of maturities for the Government.  It is about time these were given to the ordinary punter and they are provided for in the Family Home Bill.  Senators will have the opportunity to support this Bill or otherwise, particularly in the context of yesterday&rsquo;s High Court judgment which is significant.  I presume the matter will end up in the Supreme Court but it is a hopeful judgment.</P>
        <P>We have significant difficulty in getting the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, to the Chamber.  Like the High Court judge yesterday, I recommend that the Leader suggests mediation between the Seanad and the Minister is appropriate.  If he cannot attend the Chamber to discuss health issues, perhaps it is because he is too busy with the property develop<Col N="834"/>ment side of his portfolio.  Perhaps some mediation can be used to get the Minister into the Chamber to discuss the important issues that affect all of us.</P>

They write to the bishops and they are prepared to stand up and be counted but the bishops ignore their pleas.</P>

        <P>The Eucharistic Congress 1932 was a laudable event and would be still but the decision on the use of the Phoenix Park, the people&rsquo;s park, should be given serious consideration.  It should not be decided at the stroke of a pen to hand over the people&rsquo;s park to a group of people who treated the ordinary people and the children of this country in such a fashion and with such contempt.  I ask the Leader to write to the City Manger and the councillors about withholding the use of the Phoenix Park.

	<P Just="Left">Very often, in the midst of the big stories and debates, we miss out on some small stories that are generally stories of service, co-operation and compassion.  I refer, in particular, to people who are at the end of the road in solving the problems brought about as a result of the collapse of the Celtic tiger.  They are on the verge and we have debated that here on many occasions.  I was particularly pleased to see that a new group has been established in County Laois called the Phoenix Project, which is an appropriate title.  The sub-title is New Beginnings.  This is directed at helping people who cannot help themselves in the context of not being able to pay their mortgages and their bills.  These are people who would not have &euro;10 in their pocket.  They also try to look after the welfare of their children.</P>
        <P>In all the big controversies and debates these are the forgotten people, the people of no property or means.  We have learned nothing from the history of Ireland in the past.  We are great at looking at something retrospectively and saying what we might have done but these people are in every townland, village, town and city in Ireland, and they have no voice.  This group, the Phoenix Project, has given them a voice.  It is a not for profit organisation.  It has accountants, solicitors, counsellors and support groups, all of whom are available within a resource centre.  There have been many cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I would also say that my matter will not make the headlines like denying the Phoenix Park to the Pope but it may help the ordinary people who are at their wits&rsquo; end.</P>
        <P>I always bow to the judgment of the Cathaoirleach and his instructions but these people should be given a voice here.  I am only asking for a few minutes to give them that voice and if we are able to help those people and save them from suicide, that is what we came in here to do.  We are not here to make grandiose speeches or talk about big policies we do not often understand or saying there are no solutions and coming up with negative attitudes.  The ordinary human being, the individual, is our concern.  This small story could become the big story in the same way as the credit union became the big story in the past.  For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, let us give some time to reality and to the ordinary individuals who have no one to speak forthem.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Recently I have been inundated with business people who are unable to pay their rates.  I did some research on it and I always understood that rates were calculated on the square footage of a business but that is not the case.  It is only part of it.  The other part of the way rates are calculated is on the best achievable rent of a property.  During the Celtic tiger years business people paid their rates willingly, and they paid willingly the annual <Col N="836"/>increases in rates, but in terms of where we are now achievable rents are probably half of what they were three or four years ago.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the House for an open debate which should be given adequate time because there is much to be discussed.  There are many people suffering and businesses closing because they are unable to pay their rates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An issue that I would like included in such a debate is the ongoing review by the Valuation Office rates.  It has taken it a year and a half or two years to cover Dublin.  At such a snail&rsquo;s pace a review of rateable valuation throughout the country will take up to ten years.  While part of the rateable valuation is calculated by the square footage, it should be borne in mind that one could have a 4,000 or 5,000 sq. ft. business with a turnover of &euro;500,000 per year and they are paying their rates on their&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am almost finished.  They are paying rates on the square footage but we must look at the position of professionals who have two rooms who may have a turnover of millions of euro, yet that is not taken into account in the rateable valuation.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the House for an open and frank discussion on rates.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure other Members have already raised the situation in Norway but I wish to add my expression of sympathy to the people of Norway and compliment them on the dignified way in which they have responded to what was described on Fox News, without any evidence, as an attack by Al-Qaeda but which was actually an attack by a Christian fundamentalist.  As a Christian I am deeply ashamed should this turn out to be the fact.  They have responded appropriately by saying that there will be more democracy in Norway rather than less.  That is appropriate.</P>
        <P>I am sure it cannot be done in this session because I understand tomorrow will probably be our last day but in the incoming session in the early autumn I ask the Leader to arrange for a major debate on the fate of the islands around our coast and in particular the impact in Gaeltacht areas, including the islands, of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the cut in budgets.  Traditionally, it has been creating over 1,000 jobs.  It is important, if we want to save our identity, that we save this part of it because it is what makes us unique.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I remember being in Sligo launching a crafts fair and I was particularly impressed by a woodworker who was making furniture.  Instead of levelling out all the gnarls and twists in the wood he left them there such that every piece was unique.  We have lost our beautiful cl&oacute; Gaelach, and I spoke there with a gentleman who must have been slightly older than myself because he said he was in school when the transition was made from the cl&oacute; Gaelach to the Arabic script, and he felt it was a loss.  It was a different language and it lengthened the words because instead of the buailte they put in the &ldquo;h&rdquo; and so on.  I find myself in agreement with him.  We dumbed down the language.  We can save an integral part of our culture if we make sure &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the people on the islands are supported and a small amount of money is invested in them because of their particular disadvantage in terms of economies of scale.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the appointment of the new Chief Justice yesterday and particularly her statement following the making of her constitutional declaration in the presence of the President and other witnesses at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  She proposed a new judicial council and court of appeal.  I am sure the Government will pay attention to her call and agree with her.  She is showing herself to be a fine reforming judge.  She has a good track record in this regard.  I particularly welcome the fact that she is not accepting any salary increase on taking up her new position.  She pointed out that judges are sharing and caring and prepared to play their part in these difficult economic times.  They are not immune to what the rest of society is suffering, nor are they opposed to taking cuts.  The new Chief Justice is leading by example.  Until the question of judges&rsquo; salaries is finally resolved, she is not taking an increase.</P>
        <P>It is most unfortunate that some judges have refused to take cuts.  They have stood aside from the national effort in this emergency and, while I will not say they are giving judges a bad name, they are not doing the cause of the vast majority of judges, who are kind and caring, any good.  I recognise the lead the new Chief Justice is giving and hope the few colleagues who have stood apart will follow her example and pay heed to her lead.</P>

	<P>I join my colleagues in extending sympathy to the people of Norway on their recent tragedy.  It highlights the issues of the arms trade and access to arms.  The seriousness of these issues were never brought home to me more than three years ago when I visited  the area of Chad bordering Sudan, where over 10,000 people under 18 carried machine guns.  Over a period of 18 months, the aid agencies lost over 85 four-wheel drive vehicles because they were stopped by young people carrying machine guns and had to hand over the keys.  Machine guns are bolted to stands on the floors of the jeeps, which are then used as armed personnel carriers.  In Chad over 500,000 people were in refugee camps and sites for internally displaced persons because of the number of bandits carrying machine guns and the lack of law and order, and because of arms and ammunition being so freely available.</P>
        <P>In Somalia, over 4 million people have serious difficulty obtaining access to food.</P>

	<P>My question concerns protection for aid agencies working in the sites for internally displaced persons and refugee camps.

	<P Just="Left">The Seanad is due to go into recess tomorrow, yet in the midst of the jobs crisis, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, has failed or refused to come here, despite numerous requests, to discuss the pressures on indigenous industry.  He is avoiding confronting the real issues facing Irish industry by identifying with <Col N="839"/>the continued success of foreign direct investment promoted by IDA Ireland whose job and export contributions are shoring up the economy at present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For the past week, some 600 local Irish suppliers have been left in the lurch by the midnight manoeuvring that saw the Superquinn Group go into receivership and saw it acquired miraculously by the Musgrave Group the following morning.  The Irish suppliers, many of whom I know from my years with Lir Chocolates, are owed sums of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;90,000.  If they are not paid they will be forced to lay off staff and go out of business altogether.</P>
        <P>Senator Whelan has drawn the attention of the House to the fact that scores of the suppliers were issued with cheques that bounced.  Behind this are the very banks that lent some &euro;300 million to a consortium of property developers to buy the Superquinn group at the height of the property boom.  It is these very banks, including Bank of Ireland, AIB and National Irish Bank, that clinically decided to put the Superquinn group into receivership and sacrifice the suppliers in such a heartless manner.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Brien and others spoke about the dreadful situation in Norway.  I join the House in expressing our deepest sympathy to the people of Norway.  To think that such an atrocity as the shootings happened at a gathering of young people.  As Senator Bacik stated, all of our parties have summer gatherings where young people enjoy themselves.  To see what happened in Norway was dreadful.  I am sure we all join in expressing our deepest sympathy to the people of Norway.</P>
        <P>I welcome the comments made by Senators O&rsquo;Brien, MacSharry and others complimenting the Government on its skills in negotiating a more credible EU-IMF package for Ireland.  It was in the programme for Government that we would renegotiate a more credible agreement and this has been accomplished.  Many commentators questioned the Government&rsquo;s commitment but it has negotiated a radically different package through the hard work of the Ministers and officials involved.  We all owe them a debt of gratitude.</P>
        <P>The most important changes are the lowering of the interest rates by 200 basis points and the extension of the loans to 15 years.  This will reduce the cost of our programme of assistance by between &euro;600 million and &euro;800 million per annum assuming the full drawdown of funds.  The exact amount will depend on the variables such as the technical details associated with the administration of the funds.  The changes will improve our debt sustainability by reducing the cost of borrowing from the EU elements of the programme of assistance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Members stated, many difficult challenges lie ahead.  The decision will ease the repayment burden as set out in the programme for Government but we must all recognise the patience of the people who have given the Government the time to pursue the arguments for lower interest rates and achieve a successful conclusion to the matter.  When we discussed this matter several months ago, I stated it was not a sprint but that it would take time and that we would need a reasoned debate and a reasonable amount of time before these matters could be concluded.  I compliment everybody concerned.</P><Col N="842"/>
        <P>As far as I know, it is still the position of the Government that we will have a charge for water when meters are put in place.  A certain amount of usage will be allowed after which people will be charged.  From reading the newspapers, I understand the Cabinet will deal with a property charge of &euro;100.  After the Cabinet has made a decision everybody will be informed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome Senator Bacik&rsquo;s comments on and explanation for the change in the public consultation committee.  All the other arrangements we agreed will be in place and I hope a number of people will address the House during the next session.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen referred to the complexity of school admissions policies and yesterday&rsquo;s court case.  The Minister for Education and Skills indicated to me last week that he will come to the House early in the new session for a debate on education, which many Members have requested.  With regard to the debate on the Cloyne report, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will be present for the beginning of the debate and the Minister for Justice and Equality will close the debate.  The motion will be put to the House tomorrow evening but we can have a further debate, if necessary, in the new session if Members do not have an opportunity to contribute.  The same all-party motion agreed in the other House will be put and I hope there will be similar support for it when it comes before the House tomorrow night.</P>
        <P>Senators Comiskey, White and others raised the Superquinn issue.  As Senator Whelan stated last week, it is a difficult time for producers and suppliers.  Credit for small business is an issue the Government will continue to address with the banks.  Small businesses are the lifeblood of the economy and I agree that this matter will have to be addressed in a more vigorous way, even at this stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We will debate Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s Family Home Bill 2011 tomorrow.  He also commented on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  I read a letter from RTE previously on the Order of Business regarding it not covering the Seanad when the D&aacute;il was not sitting.  I do not agree with the policy, nor does any other Member, and I share the concerns of Senators about this.</P>
        <P>Senator Hayden raised the issue of the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing attended the House recently for a comprehensive debate but I am sure he will return to address the problem.  A commitment was given that people availing of the scheme would continue to be included on housing lists.  Perhaps the Senator might table an Adjournment matter tomorrow to get an immediate response from the Minister of State on the issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn called for further discussions on organ donations.  We have different views in the House on the matter but it could be discussed again.  I understand the Government is taking steps to amend the Betting Act 1931 and many amendments which are necessary in regard to betting could be introduced in this.  There was an attempt to introduce a betting Bill this session but some problems arose.  It will probably be introduced in the next session.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane and team Sinn F&eacute;in continue to pursue a policy of a curse on everyone&rsquo;s house, bar its own.  Everybody seems to be wrong and they are the only ones who are right.</P>

        <P>Senator Harte also raised the RAS scheme which, as I said, could be addressed by tabling an Adjournment matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Byrne raised the issue of the flat rate property charge, which is a matter for the Cabinet.  I welcome his comments and those of many other Members regarding the interest <Col N="843"/>rate cuts.  The Minister for Health will attend the House to address health matters in the next session.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Keane and Leyden outlined different views on the Eucharistic Congress.  I suggest that both Senators express their opinions in writing to the relevant authorities.  I have no intention of getting involved.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the phoenix group and not-for-profit groups.  The work of volunteers in communities is understated in many cases.  I compliment him on raising the matter on the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Sheahan asked about the calculation of rates.  I will organise a debate on the reform of local government with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the matter can be addressed then.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris called for a debate on Gaeltacht affairs and the islands.  We had a debate on the Irish language recently but I can organise a debate with the Minister of State with responsibility for Gaeltacht affairs, Deputy McGinley.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan congratulated the new Chief Justice.  She is leading by example by not taking an additional salary.  The people will decide the issue of judicial pay in a referendum and, therefore, that is a matter for the future.</P>
        <TimeSt down="3" idown="3">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh called for a debate on the arts.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht will be in the House of the first sitting day of the next session, 14 September.  The issue raised by the Senator regarding the Irish language was discussed at length during the debate we had recently.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will be in the House for eight to ten hours in the next two days.  The Senator might have an opportunity again to discuss the other issue he raised with him but we gave it a long hearing when we discussed the Bill in question.</P>
        <P>Senator Colm Burke referred to the humanitarian situation in Somalia, which is dreadful because of the famine we have witnessed on our television screens every night.  Law and order difficulties are militating against aid agencies bringing help.  We are probably overdue a debate on foreign affairs and the UN and I will arrange to have such a debate in the next session.</P>
        <P>Senators Jim D&rsquo;Arcy and Quinn commented on the national anthem.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden referred to RTE&rsquo;s role and a lack of balance.  I am sure Fianna F&aacute;il is well capable of addressing this matter and putting pressure on the national broadcaster.</P>

    <Title>Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011: Second Stage</Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to introduce the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011 to the Seanad.  I am introducing this Bill in order to provide for a number of legislative measures, many of which are technical amendments, to existing legislation.  As indicated in its Title, the Bill makes a number of provisions, including legislation to enable Ireland to ratify the Aarhus Convention; amendments to the Air Pollution Act 1987; amendments to the Waste Management Acts; essential amendments to the Planning and Development Acts; and changes to the placenames provisions of the Local Government Act 2001.</P>
        <P>The Bill, as I have indicated, deals with a broad variety of issues, some of a technical nature.  There are 6 Parts in the Bill which contains 49 sections, and I would like to refer in some detail to the main provisions.</P>
        <P>Part 1 of the Bill contains the standard preliminary and general sections.  Part 2 will enable Ireland to ratify the Aarhus Convention, which lays down a set of basic rules to promote citizens involvement in environmental decision-making.  Commitment is pledged in the programme for Government to complete ratification and Ireland is the only EU member state yet to do so.  With the Rio+20 conference on sustainable development scheduled for 2012 and Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union approaching in 2013, it is important that ratification takes place as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Attorney General has advised that a number of legislative measures are required before ratification can take place.  These relate in the main to the access to justice pillar of the convention.  They involve a modification of the costs rules associated with environmental court cases and a change to the threshold that applies to judicial review proceedings involving planning matters.</P>
        <P>Part 2 of the Bill, specifically section 3, sets out a new costs rule that will apply in certain environmental court cases.  Under this new rule, each party to the proceedings will pay their own costs.  However, if the applicant is granted the relief sought or if the defendant is found to have breached a provision of environmental law, the applicant may have all or some of his costs paid by the defendant.  If the case involves notice parties, they may also be required to contribute to the applicant&rsquo;s costs if the court considers it appropriate.</P>
        <P>Additional provisions to apply this costs rule to certain other sets of civil proceedings are also included in Part 2 of the Bill.  Furthermore, Part 2 also provides for a new measure that will require the Judiciary to take judicial notice of the convention as a whole and to have regard to its provisions in relevant cases.</P>
        <P>Part 3 of the Bill amends sections 12 and 14 of the Air Pollution Act 1987 to support enforcement activities.  Section 9 of the Bill provides for an increase in the monetary penalties under the Air Pollution Act.  The original fine amounts have not been increased since the Act was <Col N="847"/>first signed into law.  The increased fines will serve as a much more effective deterrent and promote prosecutions for serious offences.</P>
        <P>The new monetary amounts for minor offences are aligned with the bands of fines provided for under the Fines Act 2010.  This improved system of fines is more consistent and practical as the amounts can be periodically updated centrally by the Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure that they retain their monetary value and consequent deterrent power.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fines for conviction on indictment are being increased from &pound;10,000 to &euro;500,000, which is consistent with the maximum fine permitted for conviction on indictment in legislation providing for the transposition of EU directives, as provided for under section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972.  This will bring the monetary penalties for breaches of the Air Pollution Act into line with monetary penalties for breaches of EU environmental legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 10 provides for the introduction of a system of graduated fixed payment notices, formerly known as on-the-spot fines, for certain offences under regulations made under the Air Pollution Act.  Regulations under section 53 of the Act provide for a ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous or smoky coal in certain urban areas and also set a maximum limit of 0.7% for sulphur content in bituminous coal for residential use.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The success of the smoky coal ban is a good example of the positive effects environmental legislation can have on our health and quality of life.  While the ban has largely been effective, I am aware from our partners in local government as well as from members of the industry representative organisation, the solid fuel trade group, of some difficulties in the enforcement of the ban.  There is also some evidence of a drop in sales of smokeless fuel in the past four to five seasons, while sales of bituminous coal have held up or even increased.</P>
        <P>My Department has consulted extensively with local authorities on how best to support the smoky coal ban and to safeguard and, where necessary, improve air quality in our urban areas.  The amendments to the Air Pollution Act contained in this Bill are part of the outcome of this process.  The introduction of fixed payment notices will help to protect air quality in our towns and cities by supporting the enforcement of the smoky coal ban by local authorities.  I intend to consult on further supplementary measures to ensure the continued effectiveness of the ban in the near future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 11 further supports enforcement activities of local authority appointed authorised persons when carrying out their functions under the Air Pollution Act or any regulations made under it.  In cases where an authorised person is obstructed, or reasonably expects to be met with obstruction, he or she may be accompanied by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is consistent with existing measures in support of authorised persons under section 13 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.</P>
        <P>Part 4 of the Bill amends the Waste Management Act 1996 to allow for greater flexibility in setting the plastic bag levy rate and the landfill levy rate.  While it is not my intention to increase the existing levy of 22 cent on plastic bags at this point, I will be keeping the matter of setting the levy at an appropriate rate under ongoing review.  To ensure that the plastic bag levy can adapt to changes in the consumer usage of plastic bags, greater flexibility is required in the setting of the plastic bag levy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the current time, amendments to the rate of the levy are limited to changes in the consumer price index.  The level of plastic bag usage can fluctuate and in order to provide an effective mechanism to respond to these changes, I am introducing section 12, which provides that the ceiling be set at an absolute limit of 70 cent.  This limit is designed to allow for increases to the levy for a number of years.</P><Col N="848"/>
        <P>Section 12 also provides the mechanism by which the levy rate may be increased.  It will allow the application of the consumer price index and a discretionary application of not greater than 10% in any one year, provided that the absolute ceiling of 70 cent is not exceeded.  Any amendment to the rate of the plastic bag levy will be for the purposes of the prevention of the generation of waste and the reduction of the use of plastic bags.  The existing power to amend the rate of interest charged on unpaid levies is to be removed.</P>
        <P>Ireland continues to be overly dependant on landfill.  We are still sending over 60% of our municipal waste to landfill.  I am determined to ensure that the landfill levy acts as an effective deterrent against recyclable waste being sent to landfill and contributes to meeting our landfill directive obligations.  Subject to the enactment of this Bill, I intend that the landfill levy will rise to &euro;50 per tonne from 1 September 2011, &euro;65 per tonne from July 2012 and &euro;75 per tonne from July 2013.</P>
        <P>Section 13 will amend section 73 of the Waste Management Act 1996 by providing that the levy may be increased once in any given financial year, subject to a maximum increase of &euro;50 per tonne.  It also provides for an absolute limit on the levy of &euro;120 per tonne.  In addition, section 13 also inserts similar provisions in relation to interest charged on unpaid levies as is already provided for under the plastic bag levy, namely, that interest on late returns is liable on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>Section 14 introduces legislation to support payments to international organisations from the environment fund.  This will underpin in primary legislation such payments, which are currently made under regulation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 5 deals with amendments to the planning Acts.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the insertion of a new Part into the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is urgently required to provide essential technical amendments to the planning Acts.  The amendments do not depart from the policy intent behind the amendments made by way of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010.  The amendments will enable the commencement of certain provisions in the 2010 planning Act which further implement the environmental impact assessment directive and the birds and habitats directives.  Certain amendments are required to settle EU complaints against Ireland and so must be urgently commenced to avoid incurring EU fines.</P>
        <P>I wish to provide an overview of the planning amendments included in the new Part 5.  Sections 15 and 16 are standard definition sections.  Section 17 is a technical amendment which restates the amendment to section 4 of the 2000 planning Act made by way of section 5 of the 2010 planning Act with required transitional provisions now included.</P>
        <P>Section 18 amends section 13 of the planning Acts on foot of the transfer of the heritage function to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and role of that Minister in varying developing plans.  Section 19 is a consequential amendment to section 30 of the planning Acts on foot of technical revisions in this Bill to Part XAB of the planning Acts.</P>
        <P>Section 20 amends section 50A of the planning Act to the effect that a court may now grant leave to apply for judicial review of planning applications, appeals, referrals and other matters where the applicant has a &ldquo;sufficient interest&rdquo; in the matter which is the subject of the application.  Section 21 amends section 50B of the planning Acts which deals with legal costs in certain environmental matters.  Sections 22, 23 and 24 are technical amendments to sections 57, 82 and 87 of the planning Acts to clarify that exemptions given in the planning regulations do not apply to works to a protected structure or proposed protected structure and, further, do not apply to works in architectural conservation areas or special planning control areas.</P><Col N="849"/>
        <P>Sections 25, 26 and 27 provide technical amendments to sections 130, 135 and 153 of the planning Acts, respectively.  Sections 28 and 29 provide technical amendments to sections 157 and 160 of the planning Acts.  These new sections have the same policy intent as section 47 and 48 of the 2010 planning Act but provide clearer legal text.</P>
        <P>Section 30 provides a technical amendment to section 170 of the planning Acts to correctly reference Part X of the planning Acts which relates to environmental impact assessment.  Section 31 technically modifies the definition of &lsquo;candidate special protection area&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>Sections 32 to 36 are amendments to Part XAB of the planning Acts to reflect the transfer of responsibility for heritage functions to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>Sections 37 to 40 technically amends sections 181A, 181B, 182A and 182C.  Section 41 amends the Seventh Schedule to the planning Acts to clarify the type of health infrastructural development that should be sent directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the strategic consent process.  Section 42 provides for the repeal of certain sections of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 which required technical amendment through this Bill.</P>
        <P>Part 6 deals with other miscellaneous provisions.  The main elements are section 43 which provides for an amendment to the Third Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act by the addition to the Schedule of section 16 of the Air Pollution Act 1987 which relates to the non-disclosure of information.  This means that information obtained by a local authority in connection with its enforcement of the Air Pollution Act will be brought within the scope of the Freedom of Information Acts.</P>
        <P>Section 44 amends the Local Government Act 1998 to allow payments from the local government fund to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to be expended on all public roads, national, regional and local, and in the provision of public transport infrastructure.  Given the current difficulties in the national finances it is important that we make optimal use of the finite financial resources available to Government.  In this context, the proposed amendment will allow the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport discretion in the allocation of local government fund moneys within his responsibilities for national and non-national roads and the provision of public transport infrastructure.  This will permit the effective targeting of investment to those areas of transport infrastructure of highest national priority.</P>
        <P>Section 45 is a technical amendment to section 70 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  In practice the EPA already produces a state of the environment report every four years and the amendment will place this practice on a statutory footing to ensure that the legislation is entirely consistent with Article 5 of the Aarhus Convention.  Section 46 repeals section 62 of the Waste Management Act 1996, a section which has never been used.  Section 47 is a technical savings and transitional section.</P>
        <P>Section 48 of the Bill provides for the substitution of a revised and updated Part 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 for the existing Part 18 dealing with placename provisions.  Other than section 197, the remaining provisions of the existing Part 18 have not been commenced due principally to the difficulty of local government law and the Official Languages Act 2003 working in harmony.  In the absence of commencement, the Local Government Act 1946, as amended, provides the relevant statutory framework.</P>
        <P>The new Part 18 will restate large elements of the existing code but with significant changes and some new provisions.  In an effort to streamline the legislation, it will provide that the placename provisions are contained within one section, as opposed to four sections of the 2001 Act.  Any proposal adopted by a local authority to change a placename must specify the proposed name in Irish only or in English and in Irish; there will be an explicit requirement that any plebiscite held must be by way of secret ballot; and all proposals will require a resolution adopted by half of the members of the council.</P><Col N="850"/>
        <P Just="Left">The incompatibility between local government law and the Official Languages Act has been brought into sharp focus through the long running controversy in respect of the name of An Daingean, or Dingle, and the amendment will also look to solve that particular problem in section 191 of the new Part 18.  As Senators might recall, the official name of Dingle was changed to An Daingean by the Placenames (Ceantair Ghaeltachta) Order of December 2004 made by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs under the Official Languages Act 2003.</P>
        <P>As is well documented at this stage, the change in name has provoked a long running controversy with significant opposition locally based on a perceived lack of consultation prior to the making of the placenames order and the wish to preserve the name Dingle from a tourism perspective.  A campaign was established to change the name of the town to Dingle Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is under the change of placename provisions of the Local Government Act 1946, as amended to which I referred earlier.</P>
        <P>In September 2005, the Attorney General advised that the local government code may not be used to change the name of a place already subject to a placenames order, as in the case of An Daingean and this advice was notified to Kerry County Council which is the sponsoring authority for such a procedure under local government law.  Notwithstanding the advice, the council proceeded to hold a plebiscite under the Local Government Act 1946, as amended, to ascertain whether the majority of qualified electors in the town consented to an application being made to the Government for an order to change the name of An Daingean to Dingle Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is.  The proposal put to the electorate was carried overwhelmingly and Kerry County Council then resolved to apply to the Government to make an order under section 77 of the Local Government Act 1946 to change the name to Dingle Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is.  However, in view of the earlier advice of the Attorney General, it was not possible to accede to the council&rsquo;s request.</P>
        <P>Subsequent efforts by the previous Government to introduce legislation to deal with this issue were unsuccessful and I am, therefore, availing of the earliest possible legislative opportunity to undo the impact of the 2004 placenames order as it applies to An Daingean and to provide, in law, that the name of the town in the English language will be Dingle and in the Irish language will be Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Of more general application, as I have mentioned, the proposals before the House today provide a more coherent, modern and streamlined set of procedures for the changing of placenames.  They allow for greater recognition to be given to the Irish language generally when placename changes are proposed and they set responsibility for this function at local level, where it should properly reside.</P>
        <P>This Bill reflects the Government&rsquo;s intention to address at the earliest opportunity, a range of pressing issues within the remit of my Department.  I want to make progress in a number of areas where uncertainty has too long prevailed.  I am providing certainty in terms of the landfill and plastic bag levies, I am dealing with the ratification of the Aarhus Convention, and I am addressing the long-running issue of placenames.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I look forward to the co-operation of Senators in facilitating the passage of this Bill and to their contributions to the debate. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, who is present to take this important legislation which ties up many anomalies that may be contained within various pieces of legislation which come within his remit.  While we on this side of the House always welcome any legislation that aims to serve the protection of our environment, there are <Col N="851"/>a number of areas within the proposed Bill that are a cause of concern to us, and we will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.  However, in the general context, we will not be opposing the Bill on Second Stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I welcome the clarification provided by this Bill on certain aspects of environmental protection and on the direction being taken by the Department, there are some items I would question.  The provisions to do with smoky coal in Part 3, as mentioned by the Minister, of the Bill are a cause of concern to us.  It is not clear whether this would extend at some stage in the future to solid fuel such as turf, logs or peat or any other fuel that may be generated from within farmlands or agricultural lands and used for domestic purposes only.  That must be clarified.  In rural parts, including the west, due to the increase in oil prices, the vast majority of people are going back to the bog to cut turf to use for their own domestic supply.  There must be absolute clarity in the legislation with regard to this issue in order that there is no fear, now or in the future, that people will be penalised for burning or selling logs, turf or peat within their own communities.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify the position.</P>
        <P>I would like to mention the proposed increase in landfill charges.  I listened to the Minister describe where he is going with this Bill.  We all support efforts to divert waste from landfill to more environmentally friendly methods of dealing with waste.  Last year, 61% of municipal waste went to landfill, which is quite a high proportion.  We also know that in many parts of the country efforts are not being made to divert some of that waste from landfill &mdash; particularly organic and biodegradable waste, which comprises about 30% overall &mdash; through the three-bin system.  While the system has been established in certain parts of the country, it is the considered opinion that if it was in place in all parts of the country it could cut the amount of waste going to landfill by about 40%.  Perhaps that is something the Minister could consider implementing in a more aggressive manner rather than imposing additional charges to try to bring in money for local authorities and the Department by the back door.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is my understanding that about 24% or 25% of households have access to the three-bin system for treatment of biodegradable and organic waste.  I am sure the Minister will agree that on a national level, every effort must be made to try to increase this to at least 50% or 60% in the next couple of years.  If the service was available, people would avail of it.  However, the service is not available in many areas of the country, particularly in rural areas.  The challenge for the Department is to try to make sure the service is available to all households, whether urban or rural.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister said that the landfill charge would increase to &euro;50 per tonne from September of this year, to &euro;65 per tonne in July 2012 and to &euro;75 in July 2013.  In my own local authority area, the current landfill levy is &euro;30 per tonne.  I have spoken to waste collectors in my own county about this.  It will be open to the Minister, if this legislation is passed, to impose the maximum levy of &euro;120 per tonne at any time in the future.  What that would mean, according to private waste collectors and officials within local authorities, is that the cost of bin collection could double from approximately &euro;300 or &euro;400 in certain parts of the country this year to &euro;600 or &euro;800.  That is a burden that householders cannot afford.  The path the Department should follow is to try to find alternative methods of treating waste, rather than penalising householders.  It is not their fault we are trying to divert waste from landfill and that the facilities are not already in place, and they should not be penalised for that.</P>
        <P>In many local authority areas, the capacity of landfill is reaching breaking point.  Alternative methods of treating waste must be found.  For example, in the north west, much of the waste is now leaving counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim and going further south.  It is economically beneficial for waste collectors to do things that way because there is now competition among all county councils to provide the cheapest facilities to dispose of waste.  We will be opposing <Col N="852"/>the increase in the landfill charge because it will potentially push up the cost of waste collection for ordinary households which are currently finding it difficult to meet their increasing bills.</P>
        <P>Something that is not addressed in this Bill, which was a surprise to us, is illegal dumping.  This is a huge issue all over the country.  Fly-tipping takes place in many different areas and it is no different in Donegal, with very many people, some of them coming from the North of Ireland for weekends, dumping their waste into the hedgerows.  It is disgraceful and unacceptable behaviour and I am surprised the opportunity has not been taken to increase the fines for illegal dumping in this Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The plastic bag levy &mdash; which was introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government back in 2001 or 2002, much to the discontent of a plastic bag manufacturer in my constituency &mdash; is referred to in the Bill.  In general terms, it has been hugely successful.  I understand the revenue spin-off to the Exchequer was about &euro;22.5 million back in 2007.  The levy is working.  We no longer see plastic bags in every hedgerow up and down the country.  When the levy was introduced first it was 15 cent.  It is now at 22 cent.  However, to increase the tax to 70 cent per plastic bag in one fell swoop would be totally unacceptable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department should be considering alternatives in conjunction with the retail sector.  As in the United States, paper bags should be available at all retail stores in order that we can move away from plastic bags.  This measure is probably being used as a convenient way to collect money for the Exchequer but we cannot support it because of the effect on the ordinary household.  Mothers who go out to buy the weekly shopping will perhaps have to buy a plastic bag or two because there is no alternative in the supermarket, yet the cost is being increased to 70 cent per bag.</P>
        <P>The last issue to which I wish to refer is that of the transfer of responsibility for special protection areas, SPAs, to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I have no difficulty with that, but I do have a major difficulty with the manner in which the notifications for SPAs are being handled by the Department.  Farmers have received letters advising them that their lands have been categorised as special protection areas, while other farmers, who are adjoining landowners and whose lands have been categorised as special protection areas, have not received such letters.  While farmers are notified of such reclassification, individual farmers must be met, and we will press for this in an amendment to the Bill.  A meeting must be held between Department officials and the farmers whose lands are being reclassified.  The consequences of the reclassification of land as a special protection area are extreme for people with young families who may wish to build houses or even for a farmer in terms of crop rotation.  If a farmer is rotating from a crop of turnips to grassland, he has to notify the Department and get permission to do that or to put in a road or put up fencing.  It is an issue which is affecting many farmers in my parish and adjoining parishes.</P>

It is important that would happen.  It may involve a minor cost to the State, but such a change involves a massive cost to landowners in terms of the land rights they lose under these draconian European Commission guidelines which are imposed on the country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">This is an important, wide-ranging environmental Bill.  The waste management issue is a massive one facing the country.  I welcome the many positive changes proposed in the Bill.  They include the changes in waste management regulations; the provision of flexibility and a mechanism for a graduated approach to the plastic bag levy; a mechanism for changes to the landfill levy, amendments to penalties under air pollution legislation; changes in section 7 on thermal treatment enabling ratification of the Aarhus Convention; changes to the Freedom of Information Act, to placenames and to the Planning and Development Acts, many of which are of a technical nature; and amendments to the Local Government Act to allow local authorities more freedom on the provision of money for public roads and public transport.  The Bill is wide-ranging.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward all these changes and amendments in the environmental area in the short time he has been in office.</P>
        <P>I wish to follow on up on what the previous speaker said about the plastic bag levy.  It was introduced in 2002.  The levy, which was 15 cent at that time, was a  positive initiative and it had the effect of greatly reducing plastic bag litter throughout the country.  Nobody could argue but that levies definitely work, especially the plastic bag levy.  The levy was raised to 22 cent in 2007 and in line with the consumer price index and changes in monetary value over time, the proposed increase in the levy is correct.  When the levy was introduced people took heed of it, but there has been some sliding back and people have started to use plastic bags again, which must be discouraged.</P>
        <P>According to a study carried out by An Taisce and Irish Business Against Litter in 2009, there was a 21% increase in the number of areas that had no evidence of plastic bag litter in the year after the levy was introduced.  However, there has been a gradual increase in the volume of plastic bag litter in the past few years.  The Minister recognises that in the measure proposed in the legislation.  It is important that we do not forget that the original rationale behind the introduction of the levy was to dissuade the public from the use of plastic bags.  The revenue that accrues from the levy is a serious consideration.  In 2008, &euro;26 million was generated in revenue from the levy but revenue is not and should not be the primary aim of the levy.  It is not a fund-raising but an educational measure.  It is designed to hurt people where it hits them most, in their pockets, and to ensure that they do not throw plastic bags around willy nilly.  The Minister has been proactive in the methodological way he is introducing the changes.  It is not the case, as some speakers have said, that he is increasing the levy to 70 cent.  He stated that the increase in the levy will be gradual, that it will be reviewed, that it will not be increased by more than 10% in any one year and that it will be linked to the consumer price index.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The proposed increase in the landfill levy was mentioned by previous speakers.  Landfill is being overused as a means of waste management.  The Minister said that the levy can be capped at &euro;120 per tonne and can be increased by no more than &euro;50 in any one year.  That levy will generate revenue and obviously every penny counts but we must also ensure that we are compliant with waste regulations.  We are overly dependent on the use of landfill.  In the waste hierarchy complete prevention would be and should be the way to go.  Previous Governments, and this Government in particular, have encouraged the use of the three Rs, reduce, re-use and recycle, as the most desirable options.  Advances have been made over the years in that respect and in educating the public, particularly school children.  The extension of recycling facilities countrywide must be rolled out.  I call on the Minister to ensure that will be done.  He has promised to introduce a paper on waste energy in the near future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In terms of the 3.2 million tonnes of municipal waste generated in Ireland, there has been only a 5% decrease of waste going to municipal landfill.  The Environmental Protection Agency in 2010 showed that 90% of municipal household waste went to landfill in 2000.  This percentage was reduced to 61% in 2009.  I acknowledge that while some inroads have been made in reduc<Col N="854"/>ing the percentage of waste going to landfill, 61% of waste going to landfill in 2009 compares starkly to the position that obtains in the Netherlands and Sweden where only 1% of municipal waste goes to landfill.  That is the position towards which we are aiming but we have a long way to go.  The Minister has to act to ensure that we are not fined to the hilt in terms of our waste going to landfill because we have targets to meet by 2013.  How will we meet them?  We cannot bury our heads in the sand and pretend that the waste will fly off into thin air, although some of it does.  A speaker mentioned that litter is left on the side of our roads and that issue must be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are arguments for and against thermal treatment of waste.  The perception of thermal treatment here is not positive.  The Minister has indicated the reason for omitting a levy for this in section 7.  Incineration when it reaches the required threshold for energy recovery is deemed to be on the recovery tier of the waste hierarchy and can have favourable outcomes such as when it involves the recovery of heat generated by combustion for the provision of district heating facilities.  That, I hope, is eventually what will happen; we will have more district heating facilities such as those in Austria and other European countries.  I am not advocating it but if it is a means to an end in reaching a target to ensure waste does not go to landfill, we cannot ignore it and there must be an education process around it.  Similarly, it can be used to generate energy in the form of electricity.  Therefore, it is not all negative.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like the Minister to indicate his plans to introduce a levy for thermal treatment of waste when such a system is up and running.  He stated his reasoning for omitting a levy at this stage was to ensure that the measure dealt with by the previous Government would be based on an approach that the inclusion of levies would not give landfill an advantage over incineration or <i>vice versa</i>.  The Minister has said that he will publish a discussion document for consultation to inform the finalisation of a new waste policy.  The appropriate use of economic instruments such as levies may be considered as part of that process.  I  welcome that as I think it may be necessary fairly soon to reduce the possibility of abuse of over-reliance on incineration or thermal treatment; we must have a proper balance in the waste management matrix.  The Minister has made the point previously that such a levy may be premature at present because the market has not established itself and I acknowledge that.  It is probably the correct way to proceed at this time.  I ask the Minister to keep it under review in terms of the waste hierarchy and waste regulations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has stated that moving from the least desirable waste management option of landfill to options higher up the waste hierarchy is the way we should be proceeding at this point.  I mentioned the plastic bag levy.  We must also ensure there is a levy to deter manufactures from overpackaging of goods.  I ask the Minister to comment.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the provision dealing with the primary legislation underpinning payments from the environment fund. I welcome, in particular, the provision of changes to the Air Pollution Act 1987 by increasing the monetary penalties and for the introduction of a graduated fixed payment for breaches of the Act.  This is much needed as currently penalties cannot be considered a sufficient deterrent to prevent air pollution.  The maintenance of such low penalties would represent poor value for money as local authorities would be investing in court cases and ineffectual judicial proceedings and they would be reluctant to take enforcement action.  Therefore, I welcome this section.</P>
        <P>Given the time constraints that apply I will not deal with the issue of non-smokeless coal.     I will take up the issue on Committee Stage as there will be amendments on the packaging of non-smokeless coal.  The changes to the freedom of information aspects are most welcome in the interests of transparency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and, to a large extent, his proposals are also welcome.  I was very much involved in the introduction of the plastic bag levy ten years ago and although I argued strongly against it, each argument was overcome.  I am now an enthusiast for the measure.  I am on the board of two international organisations in the supermarket business and spend my time arguing that every country should have a plastic bag levy.  It has worked very well and I have no problem with the current cost of 22 cent.  I had a problem when I believed there was a proposal to increase the levy to 70 cent but I understand the Minister&rsquo;s comments that this is a maximum cost so that the measure will not have to be put in legislation on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>I remember when the levy was introduced there was talk of a switch to paper bags.  The Minister of the time indicated if people switched there would be a tax on paper bags as well.  I explained to people that the levy was part of an anti-litter campaign, the main motivation behind the legislation.  I was interested in the fact that reusable paper bags could be considered for the levy.  Washington DC has recently imposed a levy not just on plastic bags but on paper carrier bags also.  I am not proposing such a measure but merely noting it.  It follows successful legislation in Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco, and more than 20 bag taxes have been proposed across American cities in the past year.  A paper bag weighs approximately six times that of a plastic bag, is approximately four times as expensive and takes up to ten times the storage space.</P>
        <P>Certain retailers, mainly clothes retailers, are now using more paper bags so could we incentivise the use of more sustainable means?  I am not sure what that would entail and I could see a problem for a woman buying a new dress, as paying extra for the bag would not necessarily be the right action.</P>
        <P>On the Poolbeg incinerator, I do not concur with the argument that we do not have a need for an incinerator, given that waste from Dublin is still sent to landfills around the country.  We cannot have a scenario similar to the Dublin Port tunnel, which was too small when constructed and not future-proofed.  It is my belief that hundreds of jobs will open up when work begins and there should be far more clarity from the Minister with regard to the market.</P>
        <P>I will comment on the ever-growing electronic product waste problem.  There is not adequate consideration in this Bill of electronic product waste, which will be a much greater issue in future years.  An even greater boom in battery-powered devices is predicted in the coming years.  We can consider electric cars as an example, which are anticipated to place an enormous strain on resources and, ultimately, recycling facilities.  Competition for commodities and the need for better recycling infrastructure is only expected to grow in coming years.</P>
        <P>Last month the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States announced a new grant of $2.5 million to help finance the creation of the first ever comprehensive inventory of electronic product waste output in that country.  The project will co-operate directly with electronic manufacturers, who are happy to tally the units sold but are often less rigorous in reporting those returned for recycling.  The announcement includes the first voluntary commitments made by major companies such as Dell and Sony to the American Environmental Protection Agency, and the aim is to promote the environmentally sound management of used electronics.</P>
        <P>Mr. Michael Dell, the chairman and CEO of Dell, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Last fiscal year, Dell diverted more than 150 million lbs of end-of-life electronics globally from landfills.  We are now on our way to meeting our goal of recycling 1 billion lbs of electronic equipment by 2014.</P><Col N="856"/>
        <P FLI="0">Several such companies are assessing the viability of equipment lease and deposit schemes in an effort to encourage customers to return electronics directly to them at the end of their life cycles.  It is a problem we have in this country.  Should consumers return goods through the same channels in which they were bought?  For example, should manufacturers be obliged to pick up used goods at Power City or Curry&rsquo;s?  If they do not, is too much waste being put into landfill and are we playing a part in putting a burden on the planet?  We must move on that issue.</P>
        <P>What about the public sector and e-waste?  It goes through millions of euro in electronic equipment each year and much is probably not recycled.  By contrast, in the US the federal government aims to now be the US&rsquo;s most responsible user of electronics and lead by example.  The billions of dollars in IT equipment the American Government cycles through annually will be either reused or recycled.  Where is our own public sector&rsquo;s plan?  What is our own Environmental Protection Agency doing in this rapidly expanding field?  Would it not be wise to consider this issue more fully in the Bill?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some experts believe that although collecting and recycling does not currently make economic sense for many materials, it is a shrewd long-term move to begin taking stock.  Could Ireland see opportunity in this?  Should we simply be dumping our old electronic waste on developing countries?  For example, it is estimated that when e-waste is exported to the developing world, only around 25% of gold contained in mobile phones is reclaimed.  I could not believe that gold would not be used.  All the material could be reclaimed if the most advanced recycling technologies available were used.  Are businesses fully exploiting the resources in waste, and how can we develop this sector to perhaps create jobs?  I researched the use of gold in electronics and apparently it has been recycled in other countries.  For example, recycled gold was partly used in the making of gold medals for the Olympics.  How much money are we wasting by not properly recycling this gold and allowing it go to landfill?  According to one source, Mr. Ruediger Kuehr, the PC sector has gold worth hundreds of millions of dollars being written off.</P>
        <P>There are initiatives around the world and challenges remain.  We have taken some steps today but we have not gone far enough.  We must continue to work on the issue in the years ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is very welcome to the Chamber.  As somebody who came through the local authority route to the Houses, similar to the Minister, I know these issues are very relevant to councillors throughout the country and local authorities.  I have a particular interest in landfill charges, in which I see a carrot and stick procedure.  I spent 17 years with a local authority and in the beginning plastic bags were thrown everywhere and rubbish was dumped on the side of the road.</P>
        <P>I was on a tour of Europe several years ago with Donegal County Council, and we visited many cities, particularly in Denmark and Germany, where the local heating systems run by waste were used as part of daily life.  I do not know if we will ever get to the stage where the landfill can be bypassed and heat generators from waste provide energy and heating to homes.  It is an ingenious system that has been in Europe for generations, so we can consider it for the future.  Thermal waste disposal can be examined as we cannot continue to dump our waste in landfill.  At some stage the amount of waste being generated, with the increasing global population, will be greater than can be managed.  We are getting to that stage in Ireland now.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision for landfill charges in the legislation.  Before the plastic bag levy was introduced I proposed it to Letterkenny town council.  I had been on holidays in France, where it was normal for a levy to be charged on plastic bags.</P><Col N="857"/>
      
        <P>At that stage, it might have been the equivalent of 2 cent or 3 cent.  It has not increased by very much.  The attitude in Europe seems to be different.  Plastic bags are not generally handed out unless one asks for them.  When I was on holidays in France recently, I noticed that people generally bring their own bags or boxes with them.  They seem to have moved past the stage of plastic bags.  It is only when people ask for them that they are produced.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said there seems to be an increase in the number of plastic bags in circulation.  It had gone down.  My theory is that the increase has been caused by supermarkets like Asda in Northern Ireland handing out plastic bags without any charge.  Perhaps the Minister will discuss the matter with the authorities on the other side of the Border.  I understand legislation has been, or is about to be, introduced to impose a levy on plastic bags in Northern Ireland.  Having been there, I know that if one asks for 20 plastic bags, one will be handed 20 plastic bags.  The plastic bags one sees in the hedges in counties like Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth probably come from Asda rather than Tesco.  That could be the reason for the increase in the proliferation of plastic bags.</P>
        <P>I welcome the change in local government funding that will allow the local government fund to be used for all roads and for public transport.  From my experience with local authorities over the years, when they want to do work they are often told by the Department that they cannot do so.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate the benefit that local authorities will derive from the extra latitude they are being given.  If they have money to spend, they will be allowed to spend it.  At least it will be there for that use.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>On the question of placenames, I ask the Minister to consider a phenomenon I have encountered over the years.  I refer to the names of local authority housing estates rather than the names of towns.  The name given to an estate is generally changed six months after it is built.  People who had an address like &ldquo;1 New Houses, Letterkenny&rdquo; or &ldquo;1 The Cottages, Letterkenny&rdquo; are asked by the local authority to adopt a different name six months later.  The first name that was given to the estate is generally used for years afterwards.  I know many estates in County Donegal &mdash; I am sure it happens in other areas of the country &mdash; where people say they live somewhere like &ldquo;6 New Houses&rdquo; even though their official address is something like &ldquo;6 St. Colmcille&rsquo;s Avenue&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister can consider making it mandatory for estates to be named before their local authority status commences.  It is not the same as the &ldquo;An Daingean&rdquo; issue, which seems to be as confusing as trying to split the atom.  I do not know how people got to this stage.  It is not a matter for me, however.  I am glad we do not have that issue in County Donegal.  I welcome the changes being made by the Minister and fully support the legislation before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems that every time a Minister comes to this House, he or she is announcing another U-turn in Fine Gael and Labour Party policy.  Now that they feel they are safe in government, they are rearranging their objectives.  It is ironic that in the last week of the D&aacute;il before the summer break in July 2007, a Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; motion condemned incineration and called on the Government to intervene in the planning process in Dublin to stop an incinerator from being constructed there, and now it appears that the landfill levy will be increased.  There may be objective arguments for that, but the reality is that the incinerator operators publicly lobbied for it in recent months, including during the general election campaign.  In effect, this approach will mean the public has to pay more.  Waste charges will increase fairly dramatically.  The Cabinet will make its decision on local charges today.  Everybody is paying this private charge separately.  Everyone will probably have to pay more.  In my view, the increase in the levy is another hammer blow to ordinary working people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to quote from an article about public lobbying by incinerator companies that was published in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> in January 2011.  In the article, a spokesman for a waste <Col N="858"/>management firm, Indaver Ireland, said the company was not opposed to the introduction of an incineration levy and continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">What the levies debate has not focused on sufficiently is landfills.  The current levy on landfills is meaningless, and out of sync with Europe .... the levy is having zero effect.  Even the landfill operators acknowledge the need for higher levies.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Those operators were not quoted in the article.  The spokesman continued:</P>
        <P LI="1">It&rsquo;s essential, too, if we are to incentivise proper waste infrastructure investment and avoid EU fines.  We wait to see whether the government is serious about finally tackling landfills, but the vibes are not good .... The pending legislation offers the prospect of clarity on the policy front, and the general election may also help to clear the air.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It certainly has cleared the air on the issue because Fine Gael has come in and completely reversed all of its previous policies in this regard.</P>
        <P>I am speaking about this issue because an incinerator is being built in my local area.  I have publicly said the planning battle on that front is over, unfortunately, and we should learn to live with it.  That is the right approach.  We should make sure it is monitored properly by the EPA.  It will provide local employment.  I remind the House that it is proposed to develop another incineration facility in County Meath.  That application is currently before An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I would like to refer to some of the statements Fine Gael made on incineration before the recent general election.  The Minister will be interested to hear what Deputy McEntee, who is now a Minister of State, had to say.  According to a Fine Gael press statement:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;The word &lsquo;incinerator&rsquo; should not be in the vocabulary of the new Minister for the Environment, except when he&rsquo;s banning them&rdquo;, the Fine Gael TD for Meath East, Shane McEntee, has said.  He called for a much greater emphasis on environmentally-friendly and people-friendly methods of waste disposal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That summarises the type of campaign Fine Gael and the Labour Party have been running for almost 15 years, since Fianna F&aacute;il went into government in 1997 after a Labour Party Minister had given the go-ahead for incineration.</P>
        <P>The reality is that incinerators create much public disquiet in local areas.  The jury is out on them, to some extent, in relation to health issues.  Genuine fears are being expressed about health issues and incinerators.  It has been proposed that an incinerator be developed at Nobber, County Meath, which is the home village of the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  The local GP is one of the foremost opponents of the proposal in Nobber.  He has made a strong argument against it on health grounds.  We should listen to the arguments of those who come from a medical background.  The individual concerned is a reasonable person who does not try to scare people.</P>
        <P>The Minister might argue that this is Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  The only Government I ever supported did its best to slow down and halt incineration.  That is a fact.  Fine Gael has come full circle since the start of 2007.  Perhaps the Poolbeg incinerator was not as much of an issue as time went on.  That could be why Fine Gael has done this U-turn.  It is striking that it chose to make this issue the subject of one of its first Private Members&rsquo; motions in the last D&aacute;il.  Like this Bill, that motion was considered in the last week before the summer break.  Fine Gael made its policy absolutely clear at the time.</P>
        <P>When Deputy Hannigan, who has done a great deal of good work in campaigning against incineration in County Meath, was a Member of the Seanad, he said it was not the case that <Col N="859"/>people &ldquo;secretly want&rdquo; incineration.  I think he had been accused of that.  I firmly believe he is opposed to incineration.  People have a genuine suspicion that when Opposition parties campaign on issues, they do not really believe what they are saying and they will not do anything about it when they are in government.  We are not talking about Fine Gael having to implement policies that we originally put forward.  We are talking about a party that campaigned to ban incineration &mdash; the Minister was involved in that campaign &mdash; facilitating incineration.  It is not just a question of Fine Gael, which said the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government would ban incineration, doing nothing &mdash; in fact, it is doing the reverse.  There may be objective reasons for the approach being taken.  I wish to make clear that I am not in any way suggesting the Minister is under the influence of Indaver Ireland or any incineration company.  However, it is a fact that by adjusting the landfill levy, he is doing exactly what Indaver Ireland and other incineration companies publicly campaigned for.  It will affect ordinary people.  It is fair and reasonable for the Seanad to hold these promises to account.  As I have said, hardly a week goes by without a complete U-turn on one of these promises.  It is done without any shame.</P>

        <P LI="1">The townland, civil parish, electoral division and non-municipal town that, immediately before the commencement of this section, was known (pursuant to the Order of 2004) as An Daingean shall, from such commencement, be known, in the Irish language, as Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is and, in the English language, as Dingle.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister to the House and, like the people of the great county of Kerry and everyone involved in tourism there, I thank him for this change.  I would like to say it is timely, but it is long overdue.  Regardless, he moved as quickly as he could.  The name was to be amended some time ago under the previous Administration&rsquo;s Dublin mayoralty Bill, but that Bill lapsed and, thanks to the Minister, the Dingle provision has been included in this Bill, which the House will pass today.  I express the gratitude of everyone in Dingle.  When I visited it two weekends ago, this was the first question I was asked.  I have received a number of telephone calls since from people who had heard about the Bill and were confused about whether the matter would need to be referred to the local authority, but such a referral is not envisaged.  In the Minister&rsquo;s response, I am sure he will clarify that the matter will be in order.</P>
        <P>As the House knows, this question was democratically decided by the people of that town in 2006 when a plebiscite was carried overwhelmingly.  I also thank my colleague, Councillor S&eacute;amus Cosa&iacute; Fitzgerald of Dingle, who campaigned for a long time to have the people&rsquo;s wish for a plebiscite upheld.  As the Members at the time will recall, former Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I were often like a duet in the previous Seanad in seeking to have the confusion ended.  Tourists could not recognise that the &ldquo;An Daingean&rdquo; on sign posts referred to Dingle.  As we know, Dingle is an internationally renowned name, as is Killarney.  While we are fond of Cill Airne and the Minister has made provision for the Irish language, we approve of his move to have both English and Irish placenames used in future changes.</P>
        <P>As Dingle is an internationally known brand name, not having it on sign posts has led to considerable confusion.  There are many stories of people travelling extra miles needlessly in trying to reach Dingle.  It is good to know that maps, sign posts and so on will be put right and that both &ldquo;Dingle&rdquo; and &ldquo;Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is&rdquo; will be displayed.  I recognise what the Minister has done.  A victory for democracy, he has followed the plebiscite&rsquo;s decision and put matters right.</P><Col N="860"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill also addresses the issue of incineration, to which the previous speaker referred.  We must face reality, in that we have no more space for landfills.  Incineration is the way forward if we do not want to face increasing fines by the European Union.  I endorse the eminently sensible course being taken by the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; Sinn F&eacute;in go l&aacute;idir ar son rud ar bith a chosn&oacute;idh comhshaol na t&iacute;re seo, agus teasta&iacute;onn breis cosanta chuige sin.  Sin r&aacute;ite, t&aacute; roinnt ruda&iacute; sa Bhille seo a chuireann beag&aacute;in&iacute;n imn&iacute; orainn agus ba mhaith liom iad sin a ard&uacute;.  Measann muide go bhfuil an Bille seo ag cur br&uacute; ar ais ar&iacute;s ar an ghn&aacute;th duine agus gurb iadsan at&aacute; ag &iacute;oc as peaca&iacute; na ndaoine a rinne an scrios sa t&iacute;r seo &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; airgeadais de.  Chomh maith leis sin, measann muid nach bhfuil d&oacute;thain b&eacute;ime &aacute; chur ar na t&aacute;irgeoir&iacute;, na hollmharga&iacute; agus mar sin de agus go bhfuil s&eacute; m&iacute;-r&eacute;as&uacute;nta go maith.</P>
        <P>The Bill should be used as a mechanism to compel manufacturers and wholesalers to reduce the amount of waste they produce.  I concur with Senator Keane on the amount of waste they produce.  We should examine the matter in further detail and these businesses rather than the less well-off should have greater penalties applied to them in respect of the waste they create.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to the promotion of a zero waste strategy that rejects incineration.  Contrary to Senator Byrne&rsquo;s remarks, we seem to be the only party in Leinster House taking this stance on incineration and ecological issues.  Our policy is to keep landfill to a minimum, support waste reduction, reuse and recycling, close all unsafe landfill sites and carry out full remediation of contaminated sites that are not operating properly.  We continue to oppose the environmentally destructive policy of incineration even if it is called thermal treatment.</P>
        <P>Is cuma c&eacute;n t-ainm a thugann duine air, cuir s&iacute;oda ar ghabhar ach is gabhar i gc&oacute;na&iacute; &eacute;.  We take a rights-based approach to the environment.  Having a clean environment is a right that must be upheld to achieve a better quality of life.</P>
        <P>The Bill represents a lost opportunity for the Minister to set progressive timeframed targets to minimise waste going to landfill.  It introduces a provision to allow the Minister to set a plastic bag levy as high as 70 cent.  This is not a good measure because it leaves too much leeway and will penalise people.  We support a bag levy, something that our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues in the Assembly have introduced, but 70 cent is high.  The focus of the Bill is wrong, in that it hits the less well-off.  This scandalous provision comes during a week in which we are investing a further &euro;18 billion in the banks, much of which will be used to underpin unguaranteed bondholders.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>This provision allows the Minister to claim he is doing something about waste reduction, but does it not matter that it will not do what it needs to do?  The provision will have little impact on manufacturers and wholesalers who wrap their products in layer upon layer of plastic.  The bag levy had a good effect on the behaviour of customers, but <Col N="861"/>we need to see similar approaches to manufacturers and businesses to encourage them to change their behaviour and the way they do their business.</P>
        <P>I was interested in the Minister&rsquo;s remark that much of the money to be collected through these measures will be used to improve roads.  The Bill is a clever way of gathering revenue for local government to pay for necessary road works, but Sinn F&eacute;in believes certain moneys currently departing the Exchequer should instead be used for this purpose.</P>
        <P>A major problem lies with the waste that is not in the system.  Approximately 30% or 40% is not accounted for, yet it is visible on our roads and lanes.  Senator Quinn referred to electronic waste.  We do not seem to have the necessary infrastructure in place.  In my area of Connemara, we have campaigned for ten to 15 years for a recycling centre.  We are still waiting for those facilities, which means recycling is difficult.  The Minister has a responsibility to legislate and regulate proactively to safeguard the air, rivers, lakes, wetlands, boglands, remaining forests, coastal zones and seas.  This means actively tackling and combating illegal dumping as part of a range of environmental measures.  I agree with other speakers in this respect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding the Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is issue, mar dhuine Ghaeltachta cuireann s&eacute; d&iacute;om&aacute; orm ar bhealach go bhfuil an ch&eacute;im seo glactha, go bhfuil muid ag lag&uacute; ar&iacute;s rud a bhaineann leis an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>Or four minutes, but I was never great at maths.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to the House.  He must be commended for being one of the few Ministers who attends this Chamber.  I thank him, as it is good to see.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always in good humour, we should add.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">He is usually in good humour, even when we point out where is he wrong on particular issues.  Generally, we welcome the Bill.  As there are 49 sections in it, I will be brief.</P>
        <P>In Part 3 on air pollution, does that apply to people burning peat, turf and sticks in rural areas?  That is what many of them depend on because of the price of fuel.</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister&rsquo;s approach to providing for a 70 cent maximum for the plastic bag levy.  I would not, however, agree that it should be increased from the present 22 cent.  It has been a successful programme since it was introduced and has prevented plastic bag littering.  In Cavan, the only plastic bags one sees now are from the North of Ireland.  Legislation has been recently passed there to address the problem.</P>
        <P>It is disappointing to see that 61% of municipal waste still goes to landfill.  We should aim for 1% and anything that would help achieve this must be welcomed.  I am concerned, however, that increases in charges will lead to more dumping in rural areas.  More litter wardens should be employed to police illegal dumping from the money generated by the plastic bag levy.</P><Col N="862"/>
        <P>The Minister said certain amendments were necessary to Part 5 to settle EU complaints against Ireland and that it must be urgently commenced to avoid incurring EU fines.  What are those concerns?  Sections 15 and 16 are standard definition sections.  What are they?  Section 46 repeals section 62 of the Waste Management Act 1996.  What was that?</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that any proposed change to a placename must be put before the people by secret ballot and adopted by half of the total council membership.</P>
        <P>Section 44 provides for an amendment to section 62(a) of the Local Government Act 1998, which allows the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to expend moneys from the local government fund on all public roads, national, regional or local, and on the provision of public transport infrastructure.  I would like to see that money ring-fenced and regionalised because there is no rail infrastructure in Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister.  As a former distinguished Member of this House, he has a greater understanding and respect for the institution that the Seanad is despite proposals to get rid of us.</P>
        <P>I assume the EU directives include the T90 test.  Has there been any advance in the discussions the Minister had with members of Leitrim County Council and Oireachtas Members from the area?</P>
        <P>Unlike Senator Wilson, I welcome the provision for future Ministers to be able to raise the plastic bag levy to 70 cent if they wish.  I am not suggesting it be raised now but I remember when it first started.  I call into the Liffey Valley shopping centre quite often and it was a microcosm of the real difficulties that arise with plastic bags.  I remember talking to a staff member in Marks and Spencer who told me that prior to the introduction of the levy, the place was like a tip, with plastic bags everywhere, and in the immediate aftermath of the levy&rsquo;s introduction, the environment was pristine.  Recently, however, old habits have started to creep back in.  Has the Department monitored the effectiveness of the legislation and its impact?  Are people getting used to it?  Do stores charge for the bags or are they absorbing the cost?  Is the levy still fit for purpose?  Plastic bags are still being dumped illegally in rural areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister look at the issue of recyclable waste?  Not all plastics can be recycled, although I cannot understand why not.  As a result, there is a tendency in rural areas for people to burn non-recyclable plastics, which then causes air pollution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A new technology will enter the lexicon, fracking.  It relates to the extraction of gas from the Lough Allen basin in six counties.  The information from the European Union is that legislation is insufficient to address this new technology in terms of the adverse impact it could have on the environment.  Does the Department have a role to play in legislating for this, even though it will fall under the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for licensing?  There is an absence of legislation in the European context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will bring the matter Senator Mooney has raised to the attention of my Department but I do not have a response at this stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators raised the increase in the landfill levy.  The indication for the next three years will bring certainty to the market and eliminate the confusion evident for some time.  It is appropriate to do so given the low level of gate fees.  Landfill is the cheapest form of waste management but the least desirable.  When Senators tell me they do not want one form of waste management, they are not giving me any other options, therefore, I must look at the trans<Col N="863"/>position of the EU directive and the waste hierarchy in the context of future policy and whether we will have fines being imposed on us by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>I have said we will divert as much waste as possible away from landfill but we must divert it somewhere else.  We have not made as much progress as we would like in other forms of waste management but between now and the end of the year, I will bring forward a consultation process on waste policy where we will outline other policy propositions that will help us to reduce and recycle more material before it must go anywhere else.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the plastic bag levy.  This measure contributes enormously to the reduction of litter and, notwithstanding the remarks of Senators from the Border areas, I have been in contact with the Minister for the Environment in the North, Alex Attwood, and he is anxious to progress the issue in Assembly so the playing pitch is level in Border counties.  We will be glad to give any assistance we can in the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill also mentioned the special protection areas.  The current Bill amends the definition of a candidate special protection area that was in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010.  It referred to the habitats directive when it should have been the birds directive.  It is a tidying up measure.</P>
        <P>Senators also mentioned the provisions in section 10 relating to solid fuel.  People were concerned that we were going to include turf, peat and wood, but they are exempt under this regulation.  Therefore regulation 31 of Statutory Instrument 118 of 1998 is the reference for the exemption of turf.  The regulations are primarily aimed at prohibiting the sale of bituminous coal, not other materials.  Bags now have to be sealed in a particular prescribed way.</P>
        <P>Senator Wilson asked about definitions concerning a new Part 4.  That has been inserted in the Bill to provide essential technical amendments.  Section 15 inserts a technical amendment which defines the Act of 2000 as meaning the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The Act of 2006 means the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act of 2006.  The Act of 2010 means the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act of 2010.  They are the references to that.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan raised the issue of Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is.  I am glad to take the earliest legislative opportunity to deal with that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Go raibh maith agat.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was dealt with by the people in the past in Dingle.</P>
        <P>Senator Harte mentioned the naming of estates.  Local authorities can attach conditions to planning conditions regarding the appropriate naming of estates.  They do not do so often, but they can do it.  Many local authorities have naming committees comprising local people, officials and elected members.  It is a matter that I would like to see dealt with at local level, rather than bringing in anything prescriptive.  It can be done under the planning conditions, however, if people want to do that before the estate has been commenced or completed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Wilson also mentioned section 46, which deletes section 62 of the Waste Management Act.  This section has not been used.  Section 62 provides powers for the Minister to give effect to Community Acts on waste regulations.  There is a risk that any such regulations might be open to legal challenge.  As there is a clear-cut alternative for making regulations under the European Communities Act 1972, as amended, it is considered that the prudent approach would be to delete section 62 of the Waste Management Act and rely on the provisions of the 1972 European Communities Act.  I know that is very clear to the Senator, as it is to me.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will now turn to the EU complaint, reference C/21606.  As a result of this case, retention permission for projects which require environmental impact assessment had to be removed. <Col N="864"/> There was a court judgment in this matter and we had no option but to pursue what we had to do to comply with the Commission which is not friendly to Ireland.  I inherited 31 infringement cases against Ireland by the European Court of Justice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the T90 case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, that is not the one.  The T90 case is a separate issue about which I have met recently with officials of Leitrim County Council.  To the best of our ability, we are pursuing a resolution to that matter, which is not confined to Leitrim but affects other areas of the country as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn mentioned electronic waste and its reuse.  That matter will be addressed as part of the consultation on waste policy in the coming weeks.  I look forward to the Senator&rsquo;s contribution to that process at that time.</P>
        <P>On Senator Byrne&rsquo;s contribution, the Government&rsquo;s primary aim in the development of a new waste policy is to ensure that we meet our obligations under EU law.  I am sure the Senator would not want the Government to break the law.  The most pressing challenge in this area is compliance with the limits set in the landfill directive for the volume of waste which can be sent to landfill.  The targets are 2013 and 2016.  The Environmental Protection Agency put Ireland at risk of missing these targets in the 2009 national waste report.  We have to address alternatives to landfilling our waste.  With the opening of Ireland&rsquo;s first municipal waste incinerator later this year in the Senator&rsquo;s constituency, it is clear that incineration will play some part in diverting waste from landfill.  A range of other measures are also being taken into account in developing a sustainable waste policy.  For example, the national waste prevention programme will continue to support businesses and the public in reducing the amount of waste produced, thus saving them money in the process.  The roll-out of segregated collections will also help to ensure the diversion of waste from landfill to more productive uses, such as composting and anaerobic digestion.  It is therefore not a question of being pro-incineration but of meeting our obligations under the law.  There is nothing further I can say about that, but we cannot put our heads in the sand.  It was the Senator&rsquo;s government that signed up to incineration.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a final meeting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It was our final meeting before the summer recess.  I hope it will not be our final meeting altogether.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to present the Criminal Justice Bill 2011 to the House.  I am grateful that the Seanad is sitting this week in order to facilitate the taking of this particularly important measure.  It is urgent that the Bill be enacted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The programme for Government is unambiguous in its commitment to the principle that the white collar criminal must be made amenable for his or her crime.  As Minster for Justice and Equality, my top priority is to restore the faith of the people that this principle will be as vigorously applied to white collar crime as it is to all other crime.  Justice delayed is, of course, justice denied.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill is an important step in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to tackle white collar crime.  A fundamental principle of criminal justice is that the person who commits a crime should be brought before the courts and made accountable.  The faith of the people in that principle, as applied to financial wrongdoing, has been severely tested in recent times.  There is widespread concern that the investigation and prosecution of white collar crime in this country is taking too long.  There is no doubt that the complexities of financial crime create a major challenge for investigators and prosecutors.  However, we must find ways to ensure that no matter how complex the crime and no matter how important, wealthy or influential the wrongdoer may be, he or she must be brought before the courts.  I have one simple andiistraightforward message &mdash; there will be no impunity for those who engage in white collar crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With the co-operation of the House, I hope the Bill will complete its passage through the Oireachtas before the summer recess and that it will be brought into operation shortly after enactment.  The main purpose of the Bill is to address delays in the prosecution and investigation of complex crime by improving certain important procedural matters and strengthening Garda investigative powers.  The proposals in the Bill are based on the experiences of those involved in investigations and prosecutions of white collar crime and, in particular, on the experiences of those involved in current investigations into bank fraud and financial irregularities.  My intention is to ensure that the new procedures and powers set out in the Bill will speed up future investigations and prosecutions.  However, it is also my intention that the provisions <Col N="866"/>of the Bill will be available to investigators in order to speed up major investigations under way.  The Bill is being targeted at specified serious and complex offences attracting a penalty of at least five years imprisonment, including offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud, corruption, competition, consumer protection and cybercrime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before I discuss the details of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions, I will briefly outline the main proposals it contains.  First, the Bill provides for a new system to make more effective use of detention periods.  This will allow persons arrested and detained for questioning by the Garda to be released and their detention suspended in order that further investigations can be conducted during the suspension period.  A central provision of the Bill is the new power for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply to court for an order to require any person with relevant information to produce documents, answer questions and provide information for the purposes of the investigation of relevant offences.  Failure to comply with such an order will be an offence.</P>
        <P>The Bill also contains measures relating to how documents are to be produced to the Garda.  These measures are aimed at reducing the delays associated with the production of large volumes of poorly ordered and uncategorised documents to the Garda in the course of its investigations.  The Bill contains other measures to prevent unnecessary delays in investigations arising from claims of legal privilege.  In addition, it provides for presumptions in respect of documents.  This will streamline the admission of evidence.  Furthermore, the Bill provides for the creation of a number of new offences, including an offence similar to the former misprision of felony offence.  The latter relates to a failure to report information to the Garda.  The Bill contains provisions to protect employees from penalisation for disclosing information to the Garda relating to relevant offences.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am also taking the opportunity presented by the Bill to clarify two issues relating to the investigation of crime more generally.  These issues relate to the right of suspects in Garda custody to access legal advice prior to questioning and the circumstances in which questioning may be conducted between the hours of midnight and 8 a.m.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will now deal with the detail of the Bill&rsquo;s main provisions.  The Bill is being targeted at certain complex white collar crime.  Section 3 provides for the scope of the Bill.  Its provisions, other than those relating to the investigation of crime generally, will apply to offences referred to as &ldquo;relevant offences&rdquo;.  A relevant offence means an arrestable offence specified in Schedule 1 or as the Minister may specify by order.  An arrestable offence is an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more.  The offences in Schedule 1 include theft, fraud and corruption offences as well as company law, banking and other financial offences.  The offences which may be specified by order of the Minister are those relating to banking, investment of funds and other financial activities, company law, money laundering and financing terrorism, theft and fraud, bribery and corruption, competition and consumer protection, crimes in respect of electronic communications networks and information systems and the raising and collection of taxes and duties.</P>
        <P>The Minister must consider that the powers under the Bill are, by reason of the nature of the arrestable offence concerned &mdash; and the prolonged period that may be required for the investigation of such offences as a result of the complexity of the matters to be investigated &mdash; necessary for the investigation of that offence.  The Minister must consult with any other relevant Minister before making such an order.</P>
        <P>The proposals in Part 2 of the Bill include a new system to make more effective use of detention periods.  The complexity of recent investigations and the volumes of documents involved have shown that it is not always possible to complete questioning and check facts in <Col N="867"/>one period of detention.  The suspension of detention provisions, provided for in section 7, is being applied to the 24-hour maximum detention period permitted under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.  The amendments will allow the period of detention under section 4 of the 1984 Act to be suspended and the person to be released during the period of suspension.  The purpose of these provisions is to allow the Garda to follow up on information obtained during questioning and to conduct further investigations during the suspension period.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (<i>a</i>) inserts six new subsections into section 4 of the 1984 Act.  Subsection (3A) allows the Garda to suspend the detention of a person being detained in respect of a relevant offence where there are reasonable grounds for considering it necessary to do so for the purpose of permitting inquiries or investigations to be made for the further and proper investigation of that offence.  Subsection (3B) provides that a person&rsquo;s detention may be suspended on no more than two occasions.  The total time for which a person&rsquo;s detention may be suspended must not exceed four months from the date of the first suspension.  The person must return to the Garda station at the date and time specified in the notice given to him or her under subsection (3C) or at such other date and time or Garda station as may be notified under subsection (3D).</P>
        <P>Subsection (3C) provides that the person concerned must be given notice in writing that his or her detention is being suspended, of the Garda station and of the date and time on which he or she must return for the continuation of the detention, and of the consequences of failing to return.  The effect of the notice must be explained to the person orally by a garda.  Subsection (3D) provides for the issuing by a Garda inspector of a notice changing the return date and time or Garda station to which the person must return.</P>
        <P>Subsection (3E) provides for the continuation of a person&rsquo;s detention on his or her return to the Garda station.  It also provides for the person&rsquo;s release where the member in charge of the Garda station concerned no longer has, at the time of the person&rsquo;s return, reasonable grounds for believing the person&rsquo;s continued detention is necessary.  Subsection (3F) clarifies how suspension of detention will operate in cases where the person is detained for another offence or the detention is continued under subsection (5A) of section 4 of the 1984 Act in regard to another offence.</P>
        <P>Section 8 follows up on the provisions of section 7 and deals mainly with the consequences for a person who fails to return to a Garda station after the period of suspension has expired.  Section 8 inserts new sections 4A, 4B and 4C into the Criminal Justice Act 1984.  Section 4A provides that a person who fails to return to a Garda station for the continuation of a period of detention which was suspended may be arrested without warrant and returned to that station.  The period of time commencing on the person&rsquo;s arrest and ending on his or her arrival to the Garda station concerned will be excluded in reckoning a period of detention permitted under section 4 of the 1984 Act.  Section 4B provides for an offence of failing to return to the Garda station concerned.  Section 4C provides for a regulation-making power in regard to the procedures to apply to the suspension of detention.</P>
        <P>I will now refer back to paragraph (<i>c</i>) of section 7.  The provisions in section 7 which I outlined introduce a new procedure in regard to suspended detention and are limited to relevant offences.  In contrast, the amendment in paragraph (<i>c</i>) of section 7 applies to all persons detained under section 4 of the 1984 Act, irrespective of the offence concerned.  It amends subsection (6) of that section in order to clarify the circumstances in which such persons may be questioned between midnight and 8 a.m.</P>
        <P>As a consequence, the norm will be that no questioning will take place between these hours other than where the detained person objects to the suspension of questioning, in which case questioning will continue, or the member in charge authorises questioning for exceptional <Col N="868"/>reasons relating to the particular circumstances of the case.  The circumstances required to justify such an authorisation are specified and include a reasonable belief on the part of the member that to delay questioning until the following morning would involve a risk of injury to other persons, serious damage to property or interference with evidence.  A possible scenario is where a person is detained in connection with a kidnapping that is still in progress and where there is concern for the safety of the victim.  As is already the case under the 1984 Act, any period that is suspended will be excluded from the calculation of the detention period.  I am continuing this approach, as to do otherwise would greatly reduce the amount of time available to the Garda to question a person detained under section 4.  The maximum period of detention permitted under section 4 is 24 hours.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 9 contains further amendments to the 1984 Act which are of general application to persons detained under section 4.  The amendments concern the well established right of a person in Garda custody to access legal advice and are aimed at clarifying the circumstances in which questioning may proceed, notwithstanding that the suspect has not yet had an opportunity to consult with a solicitor.  It is generally Garda practice to delay questioning to facilitate such consultations.  However, recent jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights emphasises the importance of detained persons having, as a rule, access to legal advice in advance of questioning.  Exceptions are permitted but must be based on compelling reasons arising from the circumstances of the particular case.  In order to ensure our laws are fully compliant with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and have the degree of certainty required, it is necessary to clarify the matter in legislation.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (<i>a</i>) inserts two new sections in the Act.  Section 5A contains the general rule that questioning of detained persons is not to proceed pending access to legal advice.  Two exceptions are permitted, namely, where the person waives his or her right to consult or where the member in charge authorises questioning.  The test that must be met before such an authorisation may be given is identical to that which will apply to the questioning of persons between midnight and 8 a.m.  Again, the member must have reasonable grounds for believing that to delay would involve a risk of one of a specified list of circumstances arising.  The list includes injury to other persons, serious damage to property, interference with evidence and so on.</P>
        <P>I am providing for the detention clock to stop subject to a maximum period pending a solicitor making himself or herself available for a consultation.  This provision is necessary to deal with the difficulties encountered by the Garda in contacting available solicitors in, for example, rural districts or at weekends.  I am satisfied that the maximum periods proposed &mdash; three hours for the most part but up to six hours in some circumstances between midnight and 8 a.m. &mdash; strike a reasonable balance between the rights of the detained person and the needs of the investigation of crime.</P>
        <P>Section 5B provides for ministerial regulations in regard to procedural matters concerning access to solicitors.  The proposed regulations will assist the Garda authorities in implementing arrangements to facilitate the right of detained persons to access legal advice.  These amendments refer to persons detained under section 4 of the 1984 Act.  It is important that they also apply to persons detained under other statutory powers such as section 30 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 and section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996.  This is achieved by paragraph (<i>b</i>) of this section and by sections 13 and 14 of the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amendments in paragraphs (<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>) of section 9 and in sections 10 to 12, inclusive, concern the various provisions on the Statute Book which allow inferences adverse to an accused to be drawn in criminal proceedings from his or her failure or refusal, for example, to answer questions asked by garda&iacute; during an investigation which clearly call for answer.  The <Col N="869"/>amendments make clear that in order for an inference to be drawn in proceedings, the accused must have had access to legal advice, other than where he or she has waived that right.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Returning to the issue of white collar crime, experience with recent investigations has shown that inquiries can be hampered by the reluctance of some potential witnesses to make statements or otherwise provide information for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Part 3 of the Bill contains new powers to compel witnesses to provide documents and information for garda&iacute; to assist in the investigation and prosecution of complex crimes.</P>
        <P>Section 15 provides that a garda may apply to the District Court for an order for the making available by a person of particular documents or the provision of particular information, whether by answering specified questions or making a statement setting out the answers to those questions.  The District Court judge must be satisfied there are reasonable grounds for believing that the document or information is relevant to the investigation of the relevant offence concerned, that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it may constitute evidence of or relating to the commission of that offence and that there are reasonable grounds for believing the document or information should be provided, having regard to the likely benefit to the investigation and any other relevant circumstances.  Where the judge orders the production of documents, he or she may order the person to identify and categorise them in a particular manner.  This provision should help to reduce the delays associated with the disclosure of large volumes of poorly ordered and uncategorised documents to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the course of investigations.</P>
        <P>An order providing for access to documents in a specified place may require a garda to be allowed to enter the place to obtain access to the documents.  Provision is made for access to passwords where the documents concerned are in non-legible form, for example, electronic documents on a computer.  It should be noted that the order does not confer any right to production of, or access to, any document subject to legal professional privilege.  However, the order has effect notwithstanding any other obligation to secrecy or other restriction on disclosure of information.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Provision is made for the retention by, or return to, a person of documents where the documents are required for the purposes of a person&rsquo;s business or other legitimate purpose.  The person must undertake in writing to keep the documents safely and securely and, when requested, to furnish them to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in connection with any criminal proceedings for which they are required.  Documents taken away by a garda under section 15 may be retained for use as evidence in any criminal proceedings.</P>
        <P>These provisions are targeted at witnesses, not suspects.  Accordingly, to preserve the right against self-incrimination, a statement or admission made by a person pursuant to an order under section 15 is not admissible as evidence in proceedings against the person for an offence, other than an offence under the section itself.  A person who fails or refuses to comply with an order under section 15 is guilty of an offence.  Provision is also made for an offence of providing false or misleading information or statements.  A person who fails to comply with an undertaking given by him or her under this section is guilty of an offence.  The offences will be punishable by unlimited fines and up to two years imprisonment or both.</P>
        <P>Access to documents by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can be severely delayed by claims of legal privilege which give rise to applications to the High Court.  Section 16 contains provisions aimed at reducing such delays by making provision for determining legal professional privilege issues which arise regarding District Court orders under section 15 requiring the disclosure of documents to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Under the new provisions, where a person refuses to disclose a document or give access to it pursuant to a court order under section 15 on the grounds that it is privileged legal material, <Col N="870"/>the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the person concerned may apply to a District Court judge for a determination as to whether the document is privileged legal material.  Pending the determination of the application, the person concerned is obliged to preserve the document and keep it in a safe and secure place.  The District Court judge may also give interim or interlocutory directions, including, in a case involving a substantial volume of documents, the appointment of an experienced, independent person with legal qualifications to examine the documents and prepare a report for the judge with a view to facilitating the court&rsquo;s determination as to the documents.</P>
        <P>Rules of court may make provision for the expeditious hearing of applications and appeals under section 16.  Section 17 provides for an offence relating to the falsification, concealment or destruction of documents relevant to a Garda investigation into a relevant offence.  The offence is punishable by an unlimited fine and imprisonment for up to five years or both.  Section 18 provides for certain evidential presumptions to arise where documents are admitted as evidence in proceedings for a relevant offence.  It provides for presumptions on the creation, ownership, receipt and other matters relating to documents.  These presumptions may be rebutted by the defendant.  This provision is important to streamline the way in which requirements of evidence can be met concerning documents submitted in complex, white collar crime cases.</P>
        <P>Section 19 provides for a new offence, similar to the former misprision of felony offence, which relates to the failure to report information to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The offence will apply to a person who has information that he or she knows or believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission of a relevant offence or in securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person for such an offence.  A person who fails without reasonable excuse to disclose such information as soon as practicable to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be guilty of an offence.  The offence is punishable by an unlimited fine and imprisonment for up to five years or both.  A similar offence is contained in section 9 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 but it is limited to certain serious offences.</P>
        <P>Section 20 makes provision for the protection of employees who disclose information to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about relevant offences as required by section 19, to ensure that such persons will not suffer penalisation in the workplace.  The section prohibits an employer from penalising an employee for making a disclosure to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about a relevant offence, for giving evidence about that disclosure in any proceedings for a relevant offence, or for giving notice of his or her intention to do so.  The section contains a broad definition of penalisation, which includes any act or omission of an employer that affects an employee to his or her detriment with respect to any term or condition of his or her employment.  The definition also lists specified instances of such acts or omissions.  Complaints about an alleged contravention of section 20 can be presented to a rights commissioner in accordance with the procedure set out in Schedule 2.</P>
        <P>Section 21 provides for a number of offences relating to section 20.  It will be an offence for an employee to make a disclosure to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about a relevant offence knowing the disclosure to be false or being reckless as to whether it is false.  It will be an offence for an employer to penalise an employee in contravention of section 20.</P>
        <P>Section 22 is a standard provision regarding offences by bodies corporate.  Schedule 1 sets out the offences that will be relevant offences for the purposes of the Bill.  If it is subsequently decided that additional offences meet the criteria for designation as relevant offences, they can be specified as relevant offences by way of orders under section 3.  Schedule 2 sets out the procedure for presenting complaints relating to alleged contraventions of section 20 to a rights commissioner and the Labour Court.  I have signed an order to bring into effect a measure to assist juries in their deliberations in complex theft and fraud trials.</P><Col N="871"/>
        <P>The discussions at the recent Irish Criminal Bar Association conference on white collar crime, at which I gave the opening address, made an important contribution to the ongoing debate on how we can find better ways to tackle white collar crime.  The paper delivered by Shane Murphy SC at the conference brought to my attention the fact that section 57 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 had not been commenced.</P>
        <P>Theft and fraud trials can involve the presentation of extensive evidence about company accounts, complex financial transactions and convoluted money trails.  Section 57 of the 2001 Act allows for various documents such as charts, diagrams and summaries of evidence to be given to juries in such cases.  This will allow jury members to review key aspects of evidence in a simplified manner and enhance their ability to reach just and fair decisions.  Section 57 was not commenced previously due to concerns about potential technical and cost difficulties in producing documents such as evidence summaries and transcripts.  The installation of digital audio recording systems in courtrooms has addressed some of those concerns.  In light of these improvements, but also due to the fact that the cost of producing such documents is far outweighed in serious fraud cases by the need for justice to be done, I have made the necessary commencement order to bring section 57 into operation with effect from 1 August.  This is another important step in tackling white collar crime.  For too long, the complexity of evidence in fraud trials has been allowed to stand as a barrier to effective prosecutions.  Along with this Bill the commencement of section 57 of the 2001 Act will strengthen the hands of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Public Prosecutions in their work to investigate and prosecute white collar crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have brought forward the Criminal Justice Bill quickly to deal with issues that are causing problems and delaying or potentially delaying the investigation and prosecution of white collar crime.  It is an important step in ensuring the white collar criminal will be vigorously pursued by the authorities of the State.  We must put an end to any hint of a culture that suggests that the white collar criminal can act with impunity.  In this Bill, I propose to give the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the prosecutors the powers they have told me are necessary to help them investigate white collar crime and to bring prosecutions more efficiently.  The Bill will make an important contribution both to current and future investigations.  It is of the utmost importance that the State is seen to have the capacity to fully and properly investigate all alleged instances of white  collar crime and that our prosecuting services are able to process to prosecution stage files they receive detailing circumstances which lead to a conclusion that a crime has been committed for which a prosecution should ensue.</P>
        <P>In the context of the banking issues that have arisen there is a huge concern among the public that the investigations being undertaken are completed as early as possible and that, in so far as any criminality is revealed, prosecutions ensue.  It is my belief that in so far as there have been delays as a consequence of the Garda finding that witnesses were non-co-operative or those under investigation were not providing the co-operation necessary to facilitate the investigation, in so far as the Garda may have been obstructed in any way in accessing crucial documentation or information electronically held, this Bill, when enacted, will be a vital cog in the armoury of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to facilitate successful outcomes to such investigations.  It will in the future be seen to be an important part of our criminal justice architecture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This side of the House will be supporting this legislation.  We recognise that prior to his departure the outgoing Minister, Dermot Ahern, had done some work in this important area and that the Minister is proceeding swiftly in dealing with it, on which I compliment him.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, there is a perception that people, be it those in the legal profession such as my own and that of the Minister, accountants, those involved in assurance, and those in banking <Col N="872"/>can, as the saying goes, &ldquo;get away with murder&rdquo; in certain instances.  There is a view among the public that white collar crime has gone largely unnoticed and unpunished.  That is something we must set aside clearly and unequivocally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also resonate with the idea that with the collapse of our banking structure and the economic crisis of the past three years starting in 2008, many ordinary people were hurt and affected by lack of regulation and control.  There is a perception also that many of those involved appear to have got away with it.</P>
        <P>The Minister made public comment regarding the investigation into Anglo Irish Bank where a large number of documents and disks were taken from the bank&rsquo;s premises.  I understand an investigation is under way by the Garda, and I wish it luck in that regard, but it seems to be taking a very long time.  When the Minister was on the other side of the House he commented on the lack of progress and I hope that with this new legislation or even without it &mdash; there is existing legislation &mdash; this matter can be pursued vigorously.</P>
        <P>I pose a question to the Minister in good faith.  Is he confident that the investigating branch of the Garda has sufficient capacity to deal with this convoluted area of law?  I am not being disingenuous but I hope it has because this is a new, complex area.  It is like the drug squads.  Thirty years ago drugs were unheard of in Ireland but the drugs gangs got more efficient, sophisticated and lethal and the Garda had to meet that sophistication in its investigations.</P>
        <P>An old country and western song came to mind recently when somebody told me that their house was repossessed.  They said it was a fine thing that the banks robbed them with a gun but some lines in that old song stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Mr. Jones, the horse you sold me was not all that I desired.</P>
        <P LI="1">You swore it was young and healthy, but now I know it&rsquo;s old and tired.</P>
        <P LI="1">Mr. Jones, I&rsquo;d like you better if you robbed me with a gun.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is the perception, namely, that people have been robbed and wronged.</P>
        <P>On the important aspects of the Bill, I welcome the breaking up of the detention period.  It is a new advent and it is important that a suspect can be questioned for, say, four hours, released and be brought back six weeks later for another four or six hours of questioning as may be required.  In the intervening period garda&iacute; can collect other materials to help them carry out their investigation and resolve the crime.  That is important and I welcome it.</P>
        <P>The other aspect concerns the making of a statement.  It is important that when a person uses the right of silence and does not make a statement or co-operate with the Garda the Minister has provided that an application can be made to the District Court by the Garda for orders requiring the production of material or the provision of information.  I presume the Minister sees going to the District Court as a swift mechanism to deal with that problem.  I presume also that an application to the District Court can be made instantaneously 24 hours a day, seven days a week if it is urgent.  That is my understanding of the position.</P>
        <P>On the documentary evidence, similar to the Anglo Irish Bank situation where huge volumes of documents were removed, I understand from the provision in this legislation that an onus can be put on the people from whom the information is being taken to have it coded and indexed in a particular way rather than simply bundling it together because it can take the Garda weeks, months and sometimes years to put all the pieces of the complex jigsaw puzzle together.  That is an important provision.</P><Col N="873"/>
        <P>On the area of legal privilege, somebody stated that the claim for legal privilege is sometimes used to delay and deter an investigation and so forth.  This proposed legislation puts an onus in that regard on a person who refuses to disclose a document to the Garda or to allow possession of it to be taken pursuant to a District Court order.  The legislation also imposes certain severe penalties if there is a lack of co-operation.</P>
        <P>The Minister is also introducing a new Part with regard to the withholding of information.  In that regard, such an offence, if it is proven, is punishable by an unlimited fine, imprisonment for up to five years or both.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to questioning between the hours of midnight and 8 a.m.  In the case of a person detained for 24 hours, they get tired after eight or ten hours.  The notion is that in so far as possible, questioning of a person would cease from midnight to 8 a.m. the following morning.  In that regard, I presume the clock would stop to allow the person get a few hours sleep, have something to eat and start the questioning again the following morning at 8.15 a.m., refreshed and not tired when the clock would start again for the remaining period of the questioning.  That is something I would welcome.  I would welcome also if that could be broadened in other areas of the law.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>With regard to certain serious crimes &mdash; those of subversives, for example &mdash; one can be detained for a maximum of seven days.  Such legislation applied in the United Kingdom at one stage.  I lived there in the 1970s during a bombing campaign by the IRA.  At the time people disembarking from boats and planes, including me, were taken in and questioned for very innocuous reasons.  While I understand the serious purpose of the legislation, the period of detention of 24 hours for a crime so sophisticated as white-collar crime could and should be extended.  Perhaps the Minister will consider extending the statutory period to 48 or 72 hours for certain exceptional and complex circumstances.  This is a very complex area and perhaps we could consider it in future legislation.</P>
        <P>The Minister touched upon a very important legal provision, namely, the right to legal advice.  When one is held in custody for relatively minor crimes, such as drink driving where there is no accident, one is normally entitled to consult a solicitor, if one wishes.  In saying this, I am not detracting from the seriousness of some road traffic accidents.  The right to consult a solicitor is a constitutional right rather than a right established under precedent and statute.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the Minister stated that the Bill makes provision for the detention clock to stop subject to a maximum period pending a solicitor making himself or herself available for the consultation.  This is important because I have heard of garda&iacute; ringing around at 3 a.m. in the hope of finding a friendly local solicitor to visit the Garda station to give legal advice.  Most solicitors, unless they are very young and eager, would prefer not to receive such a call.  I have had to drag myself out of bed on occasion.  I can understand the Minister&rsquo;s view that the clock should be stopped.  There are periods in the week during which the clock has to be stopped.  It is important to take this into account.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to the recent Irish Criminal Bar Association conference and to what Mr. Shane Murphy, SC, said.  I concur and find it hard to believe that the relevant provision in the 2001 Act was never invoked.  I am glad the Minister set the clock ticking in this regard.  Both Mr. Shane Murphy, SC, and Mr. Dominic McGinn, SC, stated clearly in their submissions at the conference that there is an abundance of existing laws and regulations that could be better used.  While this legislation is important and while buttressing is required in so far as this is possible, I ask whether enough use is made of existing laws and regulations, including in respect of the Anglo Irish Bank investigation, for example.  Did we use properly the laws already in place?  If not, why not?  I would hate to see a recurrence of their not being used.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="874"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House.  I refer to Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s final comment on the implementation of existing law.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response to the Senator&rsquo;s observations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A huge premium is placed on the number of Bills the Seanad passes every year.  In the past two or three years in particular, a major complaint of Senators has been that they have spent much of their time discussing reports and making general observations instead of passing legislation, the reason being that legislation has not come from the other House.  We, as politicians, must be careful in trying to strike the correct balance.  It is not necessary for a parliament or country to pass legislation continually.  Obviously, new laws are required in response to new circumstances but we should not be judged solely on the amount of legislation brought forward.  We must ensure that laws that have been passed, not necessarily by the Minister but by his predecessors, are implemented to the full.  It is in this regard that I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response to Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s comments.  We need to ensure time spent passing legislation results in every section and nuance thereof being utilised fully.</P>
        <P>That said, I appreciate the urgent need for the Bill before us.  I note it was published on Friday, 13 May.  I presume that date will prove unlucky for some.  I acknowledge the Minister wants the legislation implemented as soon as possible and will not be delayed by the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a view among the public that white collar crime is not treated as seriously or vigorously as it should be.  We debate all sorts of criminal offences in this House, including social welfare fraud, which is now a very popular topic, and our constituents complain to us that certain sectors of society are getting away with offences.  White collar crime is in this category.  On foot of the Minister&rsquo;s vigorous efforts, the Bill will change this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This legislation is being introduced at a time when the economy and our society are struggling to recover from the banking crisis and economic difficulties caused by bad commercial decisions.  It is appropriate that we try to put in place a mechanism that will ensure that we will set the highest possible standards for business and commerce, and that certain decisions, which sometimes verged on being criminal, particularly in the banking industry, will not be repeated.  Economically, the country cannot afford a repeat of some of the dreadful decisions that were made.  The Criminal Justice Bill 2011 is sending from the Government the strongest possible signal that not only better standards but also the highest standards of propriety will now be required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to a matter raised by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, that is, the investigative expertise of the Garda. The Bill is not designed to assist in the investigation of hit and run accidents, thefts in the local supermarket or even more serious crimes such as murder but will provide for, or assist with, very precise, intricate investigations.  Will the Minister comment on the level of expertise?</P>
        <P>For some years, there has been an embargo on recruitment.  Is the Minister satisfied we have available the expertise for the specialised police investigations required to pursue these offences?</P>
        <P>I very much support the main provisions of the Bill, which introduce changes to the suspension of detention periods.  This is practical and should be of significant assistance.  It is a common sense measure and we could ask why it has not been done previously.</P>
        <P>The issue of withholding information is important.  It is interesting to debate this section because we are beginning to comment on the withholding of information in many areas of society.  In recent weeks, the Government discussed the Cloyne report and the withholding of sensitive information was very much at the core of its concerns.  The Bill is removed from this area of concern, but the law on the withholding of information must be clarified and codified in a more strident fashion.  I note what the Minister stated in this regard.</P><Col N="875"/>
        <P>The law covering the provision of documentary evidence is very important given what the Minister is attempting to do in the Bill and the complex nature of what will be under investigation.  We must place a strong onus on those persons obliged to provide paperwork and documentary evidence to do so in a way which will be at least not unhelpful and, it is hoped, helpful.</P>
        <P>The provision of strong and tough law which people realise will be implemented is one part of the equation.  The other part is that our emphasis must be to try to set higher standards.  The country cannot recover, jobs will not be created, the economy will not be turned around and our younger people will not have a future unless business succeeds.  We must aim to have the ethos and standards of business at the highest possible level.  Our colleague, Senator Quinn, put in place a marvellous business which had the very highest standards.  We must send out the message that commercial and business success can be achieved side by side with high standards.  However, when these standards are broken measures such as this Bill will be required and must be implemented.  We need the carrot and stick.  This is not about penalising business.  The House and the Government must support and encourage business, commerce and entrepreneurs.  However, we must also have checks and balances and the Bill is appropriate in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for introducing the Bill.  I appreciate Senator Bradford&rsquo;s generous comments.</P>
        <P>For many years, we have debated and called for legislation to protect whistleblowers.  The new Bill will protect whistleblowers from dismissal or from being penalised in the workplace.  The Minister is taking a much needed tough stance on white collar crime.  Clearly, the need for this has been identified.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill means it will be offence to not provide information for the Garda on complex white collar crime.  I wonder whether this will be enough.  Is it possible to provide another incentive for those who are sitting on the fence on whether to report, which must happen?  In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to award in certain cases to qualifying whistleblowers no less than 10% and no greater than 30% of the total monetary sanctions collected because of the whistleblower&rsquo;s information.  This is in cases where the government gets back more than $1 million when there is a disclosure.  The fundamental idea behind the whistleblower reward programme in the United States is to encourage people to come forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is evident that many working in the financial sector were aware things were wrong before the crisis hit.  Even in the months leading up to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, that institution&rsquo;s vice president, Matthew Lee, tried to whistleblow on the firm&rsquo;s accounting methods.  His contract was terminated some weeks later, in June 2008.  In Ireland there have been many examples of bankers or those working in the financial sector whose careers were severely affected when they raised concerns about malpractice in the company.  The simple fact is that sometimes these are the only people in a place to highlight such abuses and we need to do everything we can to protect them and to incentivise reporting.</P>
        <P>I do not hold that we need a vast financial reward scheme as part of the whistleblower legislation, but it is a measure worth considering.  Some form of reward may tip the balance for those who have doubts about whether they should report financial wrongdoing.  Also, a reward would probably be a tiny percentage of the significant financial benefit of reporting certain wrongdoing in the financial sector.  More people may come forward with their concerns if we have better protection for whistleblowers, but perhaps they should be rewarded more for doing what is often a remarkably risky act.</P><Col N="876"/>
        <P Just="Left">It is interesting to see the amount of work that goes into a regulatory impact analysis.  This could have an extraordinary impact on the business community.  How will auditors treat offences under section 197(3) of the Companies Act 1990 when a director or an officer of the company fails to provide an auditor with relevant answers within two days of being requested to do so?  An accountant and auditor could find themselves reporting to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a very regular basis, in particular with regard to section 202 on the keeping of books and records.  I am concerned that very few directors take their duties and responsibilities seriously and we have seen many instances of this.  I wonder whether An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to deal with all of the reports that will be required to be made under this new white collar crime legislation.  For this reason, we should consider an amendment to the Bill to improve protection for creditors generally.  The Bill has slipped under the radar of the business community, accountants and other persons who may have to blow the whistle.  I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>When this legislation is enacted, a raft of persons such as bookkeepers, accountants, financial controllers, company employees, solicitors, barristers, estate agents, bankers, company secretaries and more than 500,000 company directors will have a duty to disclose a breach of any of the relevant offences listed in Schedule 1.  Company directors do not know company law as they should and it has been broken for many years.  Company law is approaching its 50th birthday and is a complete dog&rsquo;s dinner comprising 15 individual pieces of legislation which very few understand.  Now, under section 19 of the Criminal Justice Bill 2011, at least 12 new sections of company law will be reportable to the Garda.  Accountants, bookkeepers and auditors in particular will need to upskill immediately in this area as they will be sitting ducks for failure to comply with the professional standards of their own professional bodies, and will probably be those most at risk from prosecution under section 19 as they will have the most information.  Those who work at the coal face in this area claim these laws are broken every day and nobody does anything about it, including the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  The office and the Garda fraud squad do not have the necessary resources to deal with corporate crime, notwithstanding that the Garda Commissioner and Mr. Paul Appleby have repeatedly stated that they have sufficient resources.  The ODCE has 37 staff along with members of the Garda but they would probably need 370 or 3,700 people to deal with non-compliance with company law and, in particular, the whistleblowing provisions in the Companies Acts.  If all the relevant persons blow the whistle, as they are required to do pursuant to section 19, then the ODCE and the Garda fraud squad will need significant resources, including skilled investigators, to review these new mandatory reports.  That is a challenge but the Minister has taken the correct steps and is going in the right direction.  I wonder whether we have the resources to do it.</P>
        <P>I refer to mandatory electronic surveillance in State owned banks.  Who superintends the electronic archival records of Departments in choosing what documents to keep?  I would also like an outline of the Government&rsquo;s plans for the digitisation of archives in the future.  What else can we do to protect against white collar crime?  Given that the banks are owned by the State, can the introduction of more safeguards become mandatory in them to make sure the taxpayer is properly served?  At a time when paper documents have almost been made redundant and electronic communication has increased significantly, we must examine new ways to make sure that wrongdoing is not covered up.  One research firm, Forrester, says that some corporate e-mail archives are increasing by more than 40% a year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Information technology companies specialise in e-discovery, the practice of examining electronic records to unearth important data and relationships.  In one notable case in the US, a link was found between several executives at a firm who had been issuing bogus invoices to <Col N="877"/>inflate its revenues thanks to such software.  That is not unlike the case of Anglo Irish Bank whereby members of the board ended up buying shares in the bank to inflate its value.  Given that so much trust has been lost in the banks, should the Government not insist on mandatory surveillance software like this in the banks, especially given its stake in them?  K&amp;L Gates, a law firm has stated that the recession increases the risk that rogue employees will be tempted to engage in wrongdoing to protect their jobs or bolster their finances.  It would be worthwhile to make provision for e-discovery software to be used in banks.</P>
        <P>The Minister is heading in the right direction but I have concerns about several areas and I urge him to examine them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Hayden.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister who is a regular visitor to the House.  I also welcome the provisions in the Bill to address white collar crime seriously.  In a way it has not been dealt sufficiently seriously previously.  As Senators Bradford and O&rsquo;Donovan acknowledged, there is a perception among the public, in particular, that those engaged in white collar crime, particularly in the banking sector, have been getting away with it for too long.  There is concern that it should be dealt with seriously and it is welcome that we are doing so. I also welcome the commencement of section 27 of the 2001 Act, which, as the Minister said, should have happened before now.</P>
        <P>There is concern about the lack of prosecution arising out of what happened in the banking sector and, in particular, INBS and Anglo Irish Bank.  As Senator Quinn mentioned, there is a sense that reckless bankers went on a testosterone fuelled lending spree, which resulted in the false foundation of the boom and the subsequent collapse, with disastrous consequences for the economy.  The bank guarantee introduced by the previous Government in September 2008 made a bad situation worse by converting private debt into sovereign debt, which resulted in the IMF having to intervene.  The Government seeks to deal with the consequences of that in a context not of its making.  Earlier on the Order of Business, there was a cross-party welcome for the reduction on the interest rates on the bailout loans and the renegotiation that took place last week.  None of us in government chose to be in this position.  Sinn F&eacute;in was highly critical earlier but we will not take lectures from that party on this because we are trying to deal with the consequences of what went on and we need to be able to pay for public services, which is the bottom line.</P>
        <P>There is immense public worry about what will come down the tracks in the budget.  All of us are also concerned about that.  More than 400,000 people are unemployed while those who are working face job losses and pay cuts.  The worry would be easier to cope with if there was a sense of justice being done at the top level and that is why we are debating this legislation.  The Minister referred to a perception of delay in dealing with those who engaged in reckless lending.  Clearly, some of that was not criminal but where criminality took place, prosecutions should result.  I have discussed this with other criminal lawyers and prosecutions should be brought under section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 for false accounting.  This provides for an offence, which appears to have been committed.  Simpler offences such as that could be prosecuted more swiftly than the complex corporate offences that are also under investigation arising from the actions of the banking sector.</P>
        <P>While the Bill seeks to strengthen procedures for dealing with white collar crime, existing laws could have dealt with such crime before now.  They have not been used enough.  Part of the problem has been a lack of enforcement and the absence of a culture in which white collar crime was taken as seriously as street crime.  The legislation contains welcome provisions, particularly that relating to whisteblowing.  That was added on Committee Stage on the D&aacute;il.  The Minister acknowledged that the programme for Government contains a commitment to <Col N="878"/>introduce more comprehensive legislation on whistleblower protection in the medium term.  I do not know whether he can outline the medium term because that legislation is long overdue.  Section 20 and the Second Schedule will go some way to providing protection for whistleblowers.  It is vitally important in aiding investigation into white collar crime.  The offence of withholding information in section 19 is also welcome and Part 3, generally, provides clarity about disclosure of documents and information, which has implications for investigation of white collar crime.</P>
        <P>Part 2 is the most substantive element of the legislation with section 7 providing for enhanced powers to suspend a detention period.  Amendments in this Part relate to the detention regime under the Criminal Justice Act 1984, which are welcome, particularly section 9, which seeks to bring clarity to the law on access to a solicitor.  I have always thought we should go further and provide for the right to have a solicitor present during questioning, as is the case in England and Wales under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.  That would save a great deal of court time and expense currently spent on <i>voir dire</i>.  Many issues raised during criminal trials and judicial reviews relate to questioning during detention periods.  If the right to have a solicitor present was provided for in law, it might address many of these issues.  At least section 9 will clarify the need for consultation before interviews are commenced.  In practice, any portion of an interview carried out in a Garda station before a suspect has had access to a solicitor tends to be excluded.</P>
        <P>I am glad the issue of overnight suspension has been clarified.  Section 7 provides for the power to suspend an interview for up to four months, the rationale behind which I understand.  However, several points need to be clarified.  I note the member in charge who gives permission for the change of time to return must be an inspector.  Has any thought been given to assigning this duty to a higher rank?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Most of the offences covered in the Schedule are complex.  Section 3 refers to the complexity of investigations and so forth.  Sections 4, 17 and 18 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 may not relate to white collar crime and may not be so complex.  Was any thought given to the issue of the use of the new power in section 7?</P>
        <P>I will raise other points on Committee Stage.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senators Bradford, O&rsquo;Donovan and Bacik stated how a question mark hangs over the enforcement of a body of existing law in this area, a point the Minister must consider.  The public would be forgiven for believing that white collar criminals act with impunity.  To date, not one banker, developer or member of any golden circle is behind bars experiencing the delights of slopping out in Mountjoy Prison.  The public are sick of being given the two fingers by those who contrive to dine or holiday in all the right places while happily telling us their former assets are now owned by their wives and partners.  To that extent, I welcome the Minster&rsquo;s commitment to strengthening the Criminal Assets Bureau&rsquo;s powers for future examinations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Criminal Justice Bill 2011 is designed to deal with existing cases before the courts, a welcome development.  No Member underestimates the level of utter frustration and anger among the general public at the perception that those who brought the country to its knees acted with impunity.</P>
        <P>White-collar crime is complex in its nature.  Rather than the process being frustrated by the ticking clock, it is welcome that the interview process of a suspect can be suspended to allow for further investigation of issues as they arise.</P><Col N="879"/>
        <P Just="Left">Section 15, allowing the District Court power to require the production of certain documents and, more importantly, be presented and identified in a particular order is another welcome provision.  As anyone who has ever practised law knows, the best way to hide a document is to hide it like a needle in a haystack</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have reservations about the section 9 exemption of the general rule that the questioning of detained persons should not proceed without access to legal advice.  When an individual waives his or her right to legal advice, a caveat must be included in order that it is a considered waiver and the person is exercising it without any pressure.  The second exemption where the member in charge at the Garda station can proceed with questioning if he or she believes not to proceed would cause injury to others or damage to property runs in the face of a person&rsquo;s right to representation.  We should proceed cautiously in this.  While I understand the reasons for the measure, it flies in the face of accepted constitutional practice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">No crime is victimless.  In this Bill&rsquo;s context, the victim is the country.  I welcome its introduction and believe it will be significant legislation in bringing forward the issue of white collar crime.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I welcome the introduction of the Criminal Justice Bill 2011.  As Senator Bacik stated, there is cross-party support to deal with white collar crime.  Earlier on the Order of Business, I made the point that the Labour Party had a different position on the bank bailout before the general election to the one it has now it is in government.  Senator Bacik just complained about being lectured to by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The same was said by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Brian Cowen, and the late Mr. Brian Lenihan about the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, when he accused the then Taoiseach of economic treason for putting taxpayers&rsquo; money into the banks.

	<P>The Labour Party was good at lecturing people before the election.  If it can give it, then it should certainly be able to take it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a perception that those from a wealthy background or in well paid jobs are favoured in the criminal justice system.  My generation grew up with the brown envelope brigade which saw corruption between developers, the banking system and politics.  As Senator Hayden said, it was not a victimless crime.  When I was growing up, politics was seen as a source of ridicule, particularly when the leader of the country told people to tighten their belts while being involved in a web of corruption.  I remember hearing about meetings of Dublin City Council at which the gallery was packed with developers&rsquo; lobbyists and not with interested members of the public.  My generation now have over-priced properties built in the wrong places because of the corrupt relationship between planners, developers and politicians.  No one has been held to account.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The same perception exists about white-collar crime and what happened in Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Corrupt decisions were made by senior individuals in these banks, yet they have not been held to account.  Now having to bail out these banks <Col N="880"/>due to these decisions, it is galling for the people asked to pay for the bailout, such as those on social welfare or low incomes, not to see one person involved spend one night in a prisoncell.</P>
        <P>The French philosopher, Michel Foucault, wrote in 1977:</P>
        <P LI="1">Visit the places where people are judged, imprisoned or executed . . . One thing will strike you everywhere; everywhere you see two quite distinct classes of men, one of which always meets on the seats of accusers and judges, the other on the benches of the accused.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">While the criminal justice system may accord with realities, it cannot accord with any reasonable conception of justice.  It ought to be a basic principle of any justice system that criminals are treated equally, irrespective of class or background, and damaging crimes should be punished, regardless of by whom and in what context or employment.  The introduction of legislation to deal with the growing plague of white collar crime has long been called for by all political parties. This is welcome.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">The recent collapse of the global economy has started a conversation on a crime that has for too long been viewed as a victimless crime.  We have seen, with Enron, the Irish banking system &mdash; particularly Anglo Irish Bank &mdash; and local authorities and bad planning decisions that these crimes were not victimless.  We all know that many people are now facing and dealing with the consequences of the bad planning decisions made by people who were, essentially, making corrupt decisions.  That is the bottom line and is what happened in this state.  Very few of those people were properly held to account.  I welcome the fact that at least some attempt is being made by the Government to deal with this.  By its nature, white collar crime can be difficult to investigate and prove.  We must be mindful and cognisant of this when dealing with this issue and must support the Minister and the Government to ensure that whatever provisions are put in place are robust, will work and can deal with the complex nature of this type of crime.  The Bill proposes to introduce measures with the aim of assisting the Garda with investigation and prosecution.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with a number of proposals and recommendations being put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in.  While we support the Bill, we want to be constructive and help make things better, not just in terms of the Bill but in shaping the debate.  The first and most important necessity is the establishment of comprehensive and clear corporate liability for corruption offences.  This is vital for the credibility of the State&rsquo;s measures against bribery, which have been criticised in international evaluations in the past.  The OECD working group on bribery has recommended that Ireland codify and clarify the liability of legal persons for bribery offences.  It submitted that the prosecution of legal as well as natural persons for corruption-related offences would serve as a powerful deterrent against corporate complicity in bribery and corruption.  We need a firm commitment that there will be adequate resourcing for the Garda and the regulatory agencies in order to investigate and detect offences and further investment in the enforcement of laws and regulations preventing economic crime is imperative.  I have been asked to conclude so will finish on that important point.  It is absolutely necessary that following the passage of this Bill there will be enforcement.  We can pass all the laws we want as Senator Bradford said earlier, but the important part is the ability to enforce those laws.  There are questions to be asked as to whether the fraud squad has the resources to enable it to do what is necessary in the context of the implementation of this Bill in an adequate manner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for dealing with this issue so comprehensively; it is one of the most important issues that has faced the country because of what has happened.  We cannot tolerate a two-tier judicial system where a certain class of people, simply because of the positions they hold, are not subject to the laws of the land or where crimes which are obvious to all of us &mdash; <Col N="881"/>although perhaps not in terms of the legislation &mdash; can go unpunished.  That has been the hallmark of what has happened in the banking system in recent years.  The attitude has been that the person made a mistake, but it was not necessarily a crime.  However, we know that corrupt and criminal practices were carried out in the banks where people made decisions from which they and their friends profited.  That is what happened in the Irish banking system, yet we were not in a position to properly hold those people to account because of the dearth of legislation to ensure we could do so.  That is wrong.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s tentative steps towards dealing with this complex issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>We on this side of the House are pleased that the Government has brought forward, relatively quickly, a Bill which was conceived by the former Minister, Dermot Ahern, who took a tough approach to crime and was always willing to look at new ways of dealing with it.  It is a credit to the current Minister, Deputy Shatter, that he has come forward with the same type of idealism and willingness to bring forward new measures that will not always get universal support.  However, there is much support on this issue because of the political and economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  I have not heard of any opposition to the Bill but I am sure there is some.  However, it is not as noticeable as with other pieces of legislation in the crime area.  While this is new legislation, it was put forward by the previous Government and much of the work was done by the former Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill reflects much of the frustration expressed by all of us in recent years at the slow pace of the investigation into Anglo Irish Bank and other banks by the Garda and of the efforts being made at that level and in the offices of the prosecutors.  There are still those frustrations.  Fianna F&aacute;il was accused of slowing up the investigation, but members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party were baying for the blood of these bankers because we knew the political ramifications of not dealing with the issue.  I suggest to the Minister that more pressure should be put on the Garda and the prosecutors, without threatening or compromising their independence.  This is important, particularly if there is a prospect of serious charges being brought or convictions being obtained.  The Minister knows he must be very measured in that regard.  The situation is frustrating not only for the Minister but for the whole country in that very little has happened.  I hope this legislation will seek to address that.</P>
        <P>The legislation is not the solution to the problem as these are complicated crimes.  Many of the people who engaged in what I believe was a criminal enterprise were probably so foolish, dull or stupid in themselves they did not realise they were committing crimes.  However, that is no excuse.  Ignorance of the law is no excuse and will not be allowed to be an excuse for these bankers or anyone else who facilitated the crimes that took place in banks that helped to bring economic destruction to this country.</P>
        <P>We welcome this Bill.  I cannot accuse the Government of delaying the Bill, but other legislation was given greater priority, including that dealing with the Smithwick tribunal.  That legislation was brought forward urgently.  We are a bit slower with this.  Fianna F&aacute;il would have been happy to facilitate even earlier passage of this legislation.  I am not being critical, but I believe the Bill should have been the first priority for the Government.  It was published some time in May and much of the work had been done before then.  It is now the end of July.  We would not have criticised a guillotine on important legislation such as this to get it into place, because it was delayed by the general election.  That is the way things happen.</P>
        <P>The former Minister used to say there was a lot of legislation sitting on the shelves in the Department and I used encourage him to bring forward legislation that would show a tough approach to crime and send a message to the community.  I know the Minister is bringing forward the community service Bill today, but we are also looking forward to the forensic evidence and the DNA database Bill.  We support this Bill and will not put forward amend<Col N="882"/>ments because we want to be unambiguous in our support.  However, as much pressure as possible must be put on the people prosecuting and investigating these crimes.  While they are independent, they must also be answerable to a public that is rightly very angry.  We can only hope that the provisions of this Bill will be more effective than previous Bills we have put in place which, though used, have not delivered results, such as the gangland legislation passed a number of years ago.  That legislation has been used, but I am unsure it has produced any results, which is disappointing.</P>
        <P>We wish the Bill a safe and quick passage.</P>

We all agree with him, although the language we might use to describe our anger might be a little different from the language he uses.  Language is very important when discussing these issues.  No party has a monopoly of the annoyance the people feel on this issue.  While we in the Labour Party may not express our annoyance as forcefully as other commentators, many members of the party are privately incandescent with regard to this particular issue.  I note the Minister&rsquo;s comments in his opening address in regard to his determination to see the Bill robustly through the Oireachtas and implemented in the most forceful manner which will, I suspect and hope, give a large degree of satisfaction to a large number of people.  The Minister has, naturally, the support of the Labour Party and it is heartening to see he and the Government have the support of all parties.</P>

	<P>I will start by thanking Senators for their contributions and support for this measure, which is a very important one.  I appreciate the support from all sides of the House. </P>
        <P>I do not want to be unduly contentious but I want to say to Senator Byrne that I wish my predecessor had done all the work on this Bill.  In fairness to him he started some work on it but a substantial amount of work had to be undertaken on this measure.  It was given top priority by me.  In the Department it was the first Bill that we focused on to complete.  A great deal of work was done in my Department and by the current Attorney General.  We were still developing the Bill and because of the urgency in addressing the issues, the Bill was published before there was a full opportunity to deal with the whistleblower provisions in it.  We were very pleased we were able to bring them forward on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il and incorporate them in the Bill because they are an important aspect, particularly because of the content of section 19.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to respond to what has been said by Senators in a general way and hope they will appreciate that as Minister for Justice and Equality I always have to be careful not to say anything that might prejudice any future court proceedings or any criminal prosecutions that might occur.  I share with Senators the outrage at the manner in which some people conducted their financial affairs.  Some were obsessed by greed and had no thought for anyone who stood in their path in their avaricious desire to build monumental construction empires.  In collusion with grossly negligent and inept bankers, they brought this country to the state it is in, together with very bad political decision-making by the previous Government.</P>
        <P>There is something particularly obscene in seeing some of those who engaged in these activities swanning off out of the country and trying to establish themselves abroad and their spouses mysteriously coming into extraordinarily large sums of money that they seem free to invest in property or other ventures without any clear explanation as to what the origins of those moneys were.  In so far as there has been any attempt to divert assets out of this country so as to enable <Col N="883"/>people to avoid meeting their debts and to impose them, in turn, on taxpayers who are having to pick up the wreckage that they have left behind, I hope the rigours of the law can be applied to them and that proper action is available to be taken, not only in a criminal but a civil context.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of the disaster that has afflicted the country, this is an issue not just for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but for NAMA and other bodies to have particular regard to in trying to recoup assets where there is a suggestion they have been dealt with improperly.  This legislation will be of assistance to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As I mentioned, I attended the conference that Shane Murphy and others spoke at.  There was misreporting from it, where one of the speakers was reported as saying we do not need new legislation and that we have lots of legislation dealing with white collar crime.  They were referring to the fact that there is a great body of legislation in the area of white collar crime but what was lacking was a piece of legislation such as this, which assists in the investigation of that crime allowing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to get access to documentation and records, including electronic records, and requiring those who may have witnessed crimes to co-operate with the Garda in a manner that up to now our laws did not necessarily require.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill is opening the door to ensure that those who will not co-operate with the Garda are required to do so.  What is of particular assistance to it, among many provisions in this Bill, is the facility at an early stage in an investigation to apply to a District Court to gain access to information and documentation.  A number of Senators welcomed, referred to and queried the 24 hour period for which people can be held for questioning and the fact that it can be broken up into two occasions.  The reasoning and thinking behind this is that it has been the experience of the Garda in investigating white collar crime that one may need to talk to someone on more than one occasion.  One may, in one&rsquo;s initial conversation or questioning, be given information that one needs to further consider and perhaps validate.  In the context of thereafter accessing information and documentation, one may need to have a further conversation.  That is why we have this structure.</P>
        <P>One of the issues that I gave consideration to was whether a holding period of 24 hours is adequate &mdash; Senator O&rsquo;Donovan raised that issue &mdash; or whether there should be a longer period.  We of course have to have a balance in this in the context of protecting individuals&rsquo; rights and at the same time facilitating the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the investigation that it is undertaking.  If, in the context of white collar crime, experience shows that additional time is required it is a matter I would return to but I hope that will not prove necessary.</P>
        <P>The provisions in section 19 are particularly important because they put a very specific onus on those who are aware of individuals engaging in white collar crime to inform the Garda of what they know and to assist it in its investigations.  I was interested in hearing what Senator Quinn had to say about that.  He is right in one sense.  It will impose obligations on accountants and auditors.  One of the mysteries to me with regard to banking matters is how it was that accounts of financial institutions were audited in circumstances in which the validity of those accounts were seriously questionable.  Towards the end of an accounting year it appears financial arrangements of a temporary nature were engaged in so as to conceal from the end of year accounts the true level of borrowings of individuals or on occasion to create artificial levels of deposits so as to make financial institutions look more secure than perhaps they actually were.</P>
        <P>I ask myself what were some of the major auditing firms in this country doing as accountants.  What was it they were certifying?  What documentation would be examined to facilitate them signing off on these accounts?  They were the people who should have been to the forefront of sounding the danger signals when they had access to examining and finalising accounts in the context of major financial institutions that everyone in this State understood to be operating <Col N="884"/>correctly.  Why did they think that?  They thought it because their accounts were validated on an annualised basis.  Serious questions remain to be answered in those areas.</P>
        <P>It is important that accountants and auditors acquaint themselves with the provisions of section 19 because it will be relevant to the manner in which they undertake their work.  There is nothing unique in that context because currently we have in place &mdash; a point which is relevant in another context to which I intend to return tomorrow in this House &mdash; certain obligations for those professionals who may be employed on behalf of businesses or banks.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">For example, with regard to money laundering, there are particular obligations.  Whether one is a lawyer or an accountant, if one discovers that a client is engaged in money laundering, one has an obligation to report that to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is in that area that the balance between the confidentiality of a solicitor-client or accountant-client relationship and the public good is tilted towards the public good by requiring reporting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 19 is of importance not just in ensuring the ordinary employee or manager in a firm or financial institution must make a report when he or she discovers that the principal directors in the firm, for example, or others are engaged in white-collar crime; it also applies generally, right across the board, to white collar crime, and will affect work undertaken by those professionally involved.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P Just="Left">This legislation will facilitate the Garda in applying existing law more efficiently.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan quite correctly and fairly referred to what I said in opposition when I expressed frustration at the length of time it was taking for the banking investigations to be completed.  One of the first questions I asked on my first day in the Department of Justice and Equality was whether the Garda had enough resources to conduct the investigations that are being undertaken and whether it had the expertise required.  I asked whether additional assistance was needed, for example, from forensic accountants.  I had that conversation with the Garda Commissioner and asked my Department to arrange a meeting between the Garda Commissioner, those involved in the investigations and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to ascertain whether there was anything the new Government could do to facilitate the progress of the investigation.  The answer was &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  They had what they needed in terms of resources, but what they needed was legislation of this nature, which is why this legislation was prioritised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was interested to hear my good friend and colleague Senator Bradford refer to the fact that this Bill was published on Friday 13 May.  We finalised it that week and published it as rapidly as we could.  If Friday 13 May ultimately proves, as we look back on this in two years time, to have been an unlucky day for those engaged in white-collar crime, perhaps it will also prove to be a day whose anniversary we celebrate to mark the publication of an effective measure to tackle the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn referred to something in place in parts of the United States &mdash; a whistleblower reward scheme.  In the context of the finances of the State, we are not in a position to pay people money for doing their duty to the State by assisting the Garda in reporting crime and notifying the Garda when they have information that would be of assistance in the prevention of white collar crime.  That should be seen to be an obligation of all citizens in the State if they know of an event of criminality that may take place and may have catastrophic consequences for individuals, companies or the State.  We should see it as our obligation to make such reports.  It should not be something we are seduced into doing because of the offer of financial reward.  I hope that is not an approach we will have to take; certainly, it is not an approach the Government intends to take.</P><Col N="885"/>
        <P Just="Left">I am conscious that we are yet to have Committee and Report Stages of the Bill, and I appreciate that Fianna F&aacute;il Members, at least, are not tabling amendments.  This does not mean that we should not tease out some of the sections on Committee Stage.  Perhaps we can return to some of the questions I have not answered at that stage, and I am happy to take any other questions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important that the laws we have are applied rigorously to bring to justice people engaged in criminality.  Justice should be blind to the background of individuals &mdash; or, as Senator Cullinane mentioned, their class.  Whether someone openly robs a bank or is engaged in a more pernicious form of white collar crime which is more concealed, the same laws should apply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was unfortunate that section 57 of the Criminal Justice Act 2001 was not brought into force earlier.  It was in my second or third week as Minister that I attended the conference mentioned earlier, at which this was drawn to my attention, and I became anxious that this would be brought into force as soon as possible.  I hope by doing that, when court hearings take place, we will facilitate the furnishing of juries with information that assists them in understanding the nature of evidence given, particularly when dealing with corporate or white collar crime, in order to achieve justice in the outcome of any case that is heard.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their helpful and constructive contributions.  I look forward to taking Committee and Report Stages.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, before section 9, but in Part 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2" Just="Left">&ldquo;9.&mdash;Section 12(1) of the Act of 1987 is amended&mdash;</P>

        <P LI="4" Just="Left">(ii) &ldquo;&euro;8,000&rdquo; for &ldquo;&pound;1,000&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="886"/>
        <P FLI="0">Although Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the proposed changes to the fines, we believe there should be a significant penalty for causing air pollution, particularly if it involves a corporate scenario where a factory is causing such pollution.  That is an important issue in the context of food production.  Now that agriculture has again taken centre stage, we need strict and rigorous laws to deal with pollution.  We need certainty and clarity in this area.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Stanley, highlighted in the D&aacute;il the potential risks air pollution poses for farmers and their lands.  The fines we put in place must be capable of providing a serious deterrent.  We considered the deterrent nature of the fines proposed was not sufficiently strong in a corporate scenario and we proposed this amendment for that to be taken on board and to ensure companies take this issue more seriously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment proposes that the monetary amounts of fines for penalties under the Air Pollution Act be further increased beyond the significant increases that I have already announced.  Paragraph (<i>a</i>) refers to fines on summary conviction and proposes that a larger increase than that proposed by the Government be introduced.  This is not necessary as I propose to align them with the 2010 Fines Act, which will allow them to be updated centrally to ensure they remain effective.  This will allow the Minister for Justice and Equality to revise them on a regular basis, if necessary.</P>
        <P>There are bands and categories associated with the fines under that Act, which came into force on 4 January 2011.  Class A is a maximum fine of &euro;5,000, class B is a maximum fine of &euro;4,000, class C is a maximum fine of &euro;2,500, class D a maximum fine of &euro;1,000 and class E a maximum fine of  &euro;500.  The improved system of fines is a more practical way of dealing with the issue centrally by the Minister for Justice and Equality.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (<i>b</i>) refers to the fine for conviction on indictment and proposes a larger increase than what I propose.  It proposes an increase of &euro;800,000 from &pound;10,000 with a proportionate increase in the daily fine for a continuing offence to &euro;8,000 rather than &euro;5,000.  The increase I propose from &pound;10,000 to &euro;500,000 has been selected to ensure consistency with comparable amounts in all environmental legislation.  Therefore I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="2">In page 10, before section 9, but in Part 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="3" Just="Left">&ldquo;9.&mdash;For the purposes of clarity, the offences regarding sealing and labelling of fuel bags as set out in the Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels) Regulations 1998 (S.I. No. 118 of 1998), and Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels) (Amendment) Regulations 2011(S.I. No. 270 of 2011) shall not include domestic sale of firewood, turf and peat.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister alluded to this matter this morning.  This amendment seeks to remove from provisions regarding fuel bags set out in the Act the sale of firewood, turf and peat.</P><Col N="887"/>
        <P Just="Left">Like the Government parties, we want the labelling and sealing of bags of solid fuel to be regulated in order that smokeless fuels are used in smokeless zones.  Customers should not be able to erroneously buy smoky fuel because it has been labelled as smokeless.  There must be labelling of anthracite, coal and fossil fuels of that type but it is not necessary to seal these bags because customers in a fuel depot can recognise if the contents are firewood or ordinary peat, or turf as it is called in the country.  With regard to turf or wood we feel it is important that the amendment be included.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister clarified the position in his response on Second Stage.  Our concern was that turf, peat and sticks, which are primarily used in country areas, would be subject to the levy.  As the Minister clarified the position, I am happy not to move the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment proposes to insert in section 9 a new provision regarding the sealing and labelling requirements for fuel bags under fuel regulations.  As I stated this morning, turf and timber are exempt from the regulations.  In section 10, the ban on the sale and marketing of certain fuels in restricted areas applies to coal with a gross calorific value of less than 24 megajoules &mdash; bituminous coal &mdash; and any unit of solid fuel with a sulphur content greater than 2%.  Therefore, as turf and wood have a sulphur content much lower than 2%, there is no restriction on these fuels being sold in restricted areas.  Labelling requirements are to aid the enforcement activities of authorised officers.  Authorised officers do not target turf or wood and as such, the amendment is not required.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, to delete lines 30 to 33 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;&rdquo;(3) The amount of the levy shall be specified in the regulations under <i>subsection (2) </i>but shall not exceed an amount of 26 cent for each plastic bag supplied to a customer.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">We discussed the matter this morning.  The plastic bag levy was a great levy.  Before its introduction &mdash; it seems like not so long ago &mdash; every hedgerow in the country had plastic bags and we were all doing the glan suas once or twice a year to clean up our local areas.  We propose that the amount allowed in the legislation be reduced from 70 cent as that is too high.  Currently the charge is 22 cent and it works reasonably well.  This levy will hit those on low incomes and <Col N="888"/>as we heard this morning, another tax has been added for people to pay, with a &euro;100 household levy to be imposed.  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s indication that currently it is not his plan to raise the levy to 70 cent but we do not have any guarantee that it would not happen in the near future.  This is unfair, especially as there seems to be very little in the legislation that brings in manufacturers, wholesalers and the pollution they produce.  That should also be addressed.</P>
        <P>The plastic bag levy has been progressive and it may be introduced in the other part of the island.  It is a good measure that has reduced waste, which we appreciate.  We support the levy in principle but we are committed to robust environmental protection.  That necessarily involves the use of legislation that challenges attitudes and the practices of businesses and consumers alike while promoting behavioural change.  The change proposed to the plastic bag levy focuses too much on consumers, and it will hit low income households to a greater extent.  We must see similar approaches for manufacturers and businesses to encourage them to act accordingly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>We will press our amendment.  We agree with the Minister that the plastic bag levy is important and it is a significant environmental provision.  It is a pillar in trying to bring about the results which have been evident in recent years.  It was noted on Second Stage that we do not see as many plastic bags hurled into ditches and dumped because people are more cautious when they are paying for the plastic bag.  Many people continue to pay for the plastic bag, as is evidenced by the fact that the levy took in &euro;22.5 million in 2007.</P>
        <P>The levy, introduced by the Minister then responsible for the environment, former Deputy Noel Dempsey, was progressive and widely welcomed.  The Minister may look to extend the scope of the levy up to 70 cent over time, and the legislation would allow the Minister to act without coming back to the House.  We could not stand over including this scope in the legislation because households are now being burdened extensively.  The &euro;100 household charge announced this afternoon, effective from next January, is further proof of that.</P>
        <P>Although the householder or shopper should try, as much as possible, to move away from using the plastic bag, it is in some instances a necessity when there is no option to bring one&rsquo;s own bags or boxes to a store.  We will press the amendment as we could only live with a levy with a ceiling of approximately 25 cent per plastic bag.  The 70 cent ceiling leaves the possibility of hitting those vulnerable shoppers who are experiencing enough difficulty in purchasing necessary groceries on a weekly basis without having to pay additionally for plastic bags.</P>
        <P>The current levy of 22 cent per bag is reaping rewards for the consumer but as I noted on Second Stage, the Government and the Department should look to an alternative to plastic bags in supermarkets.  Perhaps work could be done with supermarkets on a national level to find an alternative, such as paper bags.  Other choices could be more environmentally friendly, and recycled paper could be used for making paper bags.  Such products are being rolled out in the United States, and I listened carefully to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Second Stage contribution, who mentioned there is a levy on such bags in some parts of the United States.  We should examine the matter to make products more environmentally friendly.  We will press the amendment to set the levy ceiling at 25 cent per bag.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with my colleagues, Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  Raising the ceiling to 70 cent means this could become a stealth tax down the road and lose its current effect.  The measure is currently very useful.  Senator Harte indicated that the only plastic bags we come across in the ditches around my county are those from Asda and other Northern Irish shops.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s discussions with his counterpart in Northern Ireland, Mr. Alex Attwood, and that plans are progressing to introduce a levy in the <Col N="889"/>North.  That will at least eliminate plastic bag difficulties in the three Southern counties of Ulster.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s work in that regard.  I agree with my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, that if we were to increase the levy to 70 cent we would lose the whole idea behind it and it could become a stealth tax at some future stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been suggested that it is planned to increase the levy to 70 cent.  That is not what is in this legislation.  This Bill provides for an increase in recognition of the proliferation in the number of bags in ditches.  In 2007, the previous Government deemed it necessary to increase the levy from 15 cent to 22 cent, just as we deem it necessary to increase the levy now.  What is good for the goose is good for the gander.  It is proposed to adjust the levy in line with the variations in the consumer price index.  As it cannot be adjusted by more than 10% in one year, it will not increase to 70 cent.  I would like to point out that all the amendments that have been tabled today were tabled in the D&aacute;il, word for word.

	<P>Like Senator Keane, Senator Mooney is deviating from the amendments before the House.  I ask him to stick to the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Certainly.  The then Minister, Dick Roche, increased the levy.  If I remember rightly, he would have liked to have increased it further but the existing legislation did not permit him to do so.  As I am deviating slightly from my two colleagues, Senator Keane will probably get to her feet again to say we should have uniformity of policy.  Our previous experience in this regard influenced me to ask the Minister earlier whether this levy continues to be fit for purpose.  If I understood him correctly, the Minister said he was reasonably satisfied the levy is working well.  I wonder if it is as effective now as it was when it was introduced.  Like the smoking ban, it was very effective initially.  I understand the national smoking average decreased to 22% but has since increased to approximately 29%.  I wonder if the use of plastic bags has increased similarly despite the levy.  I appreciate that we have had a significant increase in population since the levy was first introduced.  That might indicate there is now a greater usage of plastic bags.</P>
        <P>I am a little concerned.  I hope the Minister will confirm that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is continuing to monitor the effectiveness of the levy, regardless of the price that is put on it.  People get used to a particular price.  I also asked a rhetorical question about whether some supermarket groups are absorbing the levy and not passing it on to the customer.  I must confess I have got into the habit of not always looking at my receipt at the checkout to check whether I have been charged for a plastic bag.  Like everybody else, I am human and I sometimes forget to bring a recyclable bag to the supermarket.  I am left with no option but to purchase a plastic bag.  I do not always look at the bill to see whether I have been charged.</P>
        <P>The Minister might have a view on Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh&rsquo;s point about the proliferation of packaging that is used by manufacturers for the most minimal of products.  This age-old problem is not unique to Ireland &mdash; it is found throughout the EU.  I appreciate we cannot act unilaterally in this regard.  I would be interested in the Minister&rsquo;s views, if any, on how we can make progress with reducing the amount of unnecessary packaging.  I understand an organisation in Ireland has pledged to try to achieve such a reduction.  Perhaps some initiatives are being taken to solve the problem of excessive packaging, which bothers everybody.  When one buys small electrical goods like batteries, one often finds they are surrounded by about ten yards of packaging because they are supposed to be safe.  It drives people to distraction.  My efforts to open such packages drive me to distraction.  They are a blight on the environment.  Some sort of collective move should be made to reduce the amount of packaging used.  Much more needs to be done.</P>
        <P>All of us welcome the existence of the plastic bag levy.  We are pleased that it is proving to be effective.  I have added a caveat by expressing my concern that it might not be as effective <Col N="891"/>as it was.  Is the amount of money being charged continuing to act as the disincentive it was when this measure was initiated?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be concerned if the Minister were to increase the levy to 70 cent immediately.  That does not appear to be his intention, however, on the basis of the statement he made today.  It is prudent to give him the option of increasing the levy over a period of years if it is not working at the current level.  I agree with other speakers that the introduction of the levy some years ago by a previous Minister was an extremely good move.  It has tidied up the countryside and led to a significant improvement in our efforts to make our towns, villages and countryside much tidier and more welcoming to our visitors.  I do not agree with Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh that a modest increase on the current 22 cent rate would impose major hardship on any family.  Most families have a supply of reusable bags that they bring to shops on an ongoing basis.  If the levy were to be increased by a few cent, it might give business people an opportunity to make reusable bags available as an incentive to customers to shop in their stores.  Although certain opportunities would be associated with a review of the levy, I would not like the Minister to go wild and increase it to an alarming level like 70 cent.  A modest increase in this small charge would counteract the loss of impact of the current 22 cent level, which was mentioned by Senator Mooney.  I appeal to shopkeepers to be innovative.  At a time when we are trying to get people to spend more money and to go to their local stores, traders should avail of the business opportunity I have mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I feel like I am living in a bit of a parallel universe.  I am flattered that Senator Keane is so mindful of Sinn F&eacute;in policy in both Houses.  Life has changed since this Bill was debated in the D&aacute;il.  As we have mentioned, it was decided today that an extra household charge of &euro;100 should be introduced.  That will change the ballpark figure.  Senator Mullins mentioned that we need to incentivise people to go shopping.  This measure will take money out of the pockets of the most needy people in our society, who have been hit by the universal social charge, job losses, cuts in their pay and increases in education fees etc.  They are being hit left, right and centre.  This extra tax, which seems to be a means of collecting money for local government, will impose an extra burden on those who spend every cent they have in their local shops.  We think it would be completely counter-productive to take more of their money through this levy.  If Fianna F&aacute;il intends to push its amendment, we will be willing to withdraw our amendment and support the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment, which recommends a level of 25 cent as opposed to our level of 26 cent and is equally fair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Senators on this side of the House, I was flabbergasted by Senator Keane&rsquo;s remarks on our position.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Members are colleagues on this side of the House and have every right to table amendments on legislation, as does any Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>If the House does not prove its usefulness, we will not be doing ourselves any justice.  We should not rubber-stamp measures taken in the D&aacute;il.  Perhaps that was how it used to be and we all had some responsibility but, if we are to ensure the Chamber has a purpose prior to a referendum, we must move out of the cosy position to which we were used in years gone by.</P><Col N="892"/>
        <P Just="Left">I meant to raise a point that I subsequently overlooked, namely, the issue of the nine Border counties in our jurisdiction.  People from those counties and further south often travel to the North to shop.  Increasing the plastic bag levy will act as a disincentive.  I know many people who cross the Border to shop on a weekly basis because they are also able to pick up free bags, which they use for putting out ashes, collecting clothes or other household chores.  The law of diminishing returns may have a consequence in this case.  We must be careful with this legislation, which could have many consequences.  If the law of diminishing returns kicks in because we allow an increase in the levy to 50 cent, 60 cent or 70 cent, many people will go up the road to shops in the North instead of in the Republic to buy their groceries, thereby doing the State out of valuable tax revenues.  For example, Asda is a large competitor of ours across the Border and gives out bags for free.  Senator Wilson, a Border Senator, made an interesting comment about Asda bags in hedgerows in County Monaghan.  I have seen them in west County Donegal&rsquo;s hedgerows and anywhere there has been illegal dumping.  The local authority&rsquo;s litter wardens are often heard making the same remarks.</P>
        <P>We must be careful.  I know where the Minister is coming from with this legislation, but I share Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh&rsquo;s view, in that householders with diminished weekly budgets cannot afford to pay this charge.  We must bear this reality in mind.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment on the basis that we would happily revisit the legislation in 12 or 24 months time when he could return to the House and show us the scientific data on whether increasing the levy to 25 cent was the right decision.  I hope he will reconsider the amendment in light of our debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill knows the plastic bag levy has nothing to do with raising revenue.  Rather, this environmental measure was introduced to dictate consumer behaviour.  I congratulate the former Ministers, Mr. Noel Dempsey and Mr. Dick Roche, on introducing and increasing this levy, respectively.  They had good reasons for doing so.</P>
        <P>We want to divert plastic from landfill and every other part of the waste chain.  The plastic bag levy was introduced in 2002 at a rate of 15 cent per bag primarily as an anti-litter initiative.  An astounding success, it led to an immediate decrease in customer usage of plastic bags from 328 bags per person per annum to 21 bags per person per annum.  Plastic bags went from comprising 5% of visible litter to 0.32% in 2002.  There was a subsequent gradual increase in plastic bag usage.  By 2006, usage had increased to 30 bags per person.  In light of this, Mr. Roche increased the levy to 22 cent per bag in July 2007.  This resulted in a decrease in plastic bag usage levels per person in 2008.  To respond to Senator Mooney, the latest data indicate that, in 2010, consumer usage was at the rate of 18 bags person.  The National Litter Pollution Monitoring System Report 2010 indicated that plastic bags represent 0.25% of all litter arising.</P>
        <P>The amendments will defeat the purpose of a levy as a deterrent or as an opportunity to influence consumer behaviour in respect of plastic bags, which we all want to get rid of.  It was for this purpose that Ministers introduced and increased the plastic bag charge and I included an enabling provision up to a maximum of 70 cent, if the Minister of the day so wishes.  The levy cannot increase by more than 10% per annum plus the consumer price index.</P><Col N="893"/>
        <P>Neither I nor my successors would want to end up in a situation in which, due to certain consumer behaviour, we found it necessary to introduce further primary legislation amending this Bill or the Litter Acts to increase the levy again so as to ensure there was less plastic in the waste chain.  I am including an enabling provision up to a maximum of 70 cent.  The Senators&rsquo; amendments would tie the hands of future Ministers for the Environment, Community and Local Government when adopting measures to address consumer behaviour and the ongoing major problem throughout our countryside posed by plastic bags.  Like everyone else, I want to see less plastic.  We want to use a financial instrument called an environmental levy &mdash; the plastic bag levy &mdash; to assist policy in this regard by acting as a deterrent, changing consuming behaviour and meeting the objectives we all desire.  By accepting this amendment, I would defeat the purpose of the objective in favour of which the Senator spoke.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3<i>b</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 14, to delete lines 1 to 3 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" Just="Left">&ldquo;The amount of the levy shall be specified in the Regulations under subsection (1) but shall not exceed an amount of &euro;65 for each tonne of waste disposed of.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This relates to the proposed increase in the landfill levy to a maximum ceiling of &euro;120 per tonne.  On Second Stage the Minister said he would stagger implementation of the increase with a &euro;50 per tonne increase scheduled for September of this year, thereafter increasing to &euro;65 and &euro;75 per tonne in 2012 and 2013, respectively.</P>
        <P>The issue we have with this proposal is that having spoken to several local authorities and private collectors, there is no doubt but that the collectors will pass this levy on to consumers.  Currently, in several counties, including County Donegal, the landfill levy is &euro;30 per tonne.  Even if one was to increase it to &euro;50 per tonne this September, it would be almost double the current levy.  If one was to increase it to the maximum of &euro;120 per tonne, the collectors have unequivocally stated that it could lead to doubling in the annual cost of collecting waste in bins.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know we must move away from sending waste to landfill and find alternative ways to treat and deal with waste and that we must roll out collection of the green bin for biodegradable and organic waste countrywide.  However, we cannot support an increase to &euro;120.  In the north west, the average cost to households with bins is approximately &euro;300 to &euro;400 per annum.  If this is implemented at the higher level of &euro;120 per tonne and if waste is taken to landfill, the potential is there to substantially increase the charge of bin collection up to perhaps &euro;600 and &euro;700 per annum &mdash; effectively doubling the annual charge.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister is staggering the increase in the payment but even at that, it is the wrong way to proceed.  We also tabled amendment No. 3<i>c</i>  which states that the increase should not exceed &euro;7.50 in a calendar year.  We do not dispute the increase to &euro;50 this year but the absolute limit should be &euro;65 per tonne and the increase should not exceed &euro;7.50 in a calendar year.  That would give scope to increase the fee by &euro;7.50 this year which would be a substantial increase, almost 30% when one takes into account that the landfill charge this year is approximately &euro;30.</P>
        <P>Householders simply cannot afford to be hit with all these additional charges.  We learned today of the &euro;100 household charge being rolled out from next year.  The plastic bag levy, if implemented, will have an impact on households.  There is a septic tank charge on the way which will affect 440,000 households.</P>
        <P>If this charge on collectable waste is implemented, households which are at breaking point simply will not be able to sustain themselves.  The alternative is that they will run to the community welfare officer to try to get money to pay for basic household needs.  Community welfare officers are not in a position to pay additional social welfare payments under the exceptional rules payments.  Households will simply not be able to afford these charges, coupled with the increase in interest rates by the European Central Bank which are being passed on by Irish lenders.  Households are at breaking point.</P><Col N="895"/>
        <P>It would be more reasonable to proceed on the basis of &euro;65 per tonne and no more than a &euro;7.50 increase in a calendar year.  This would at least give householders an opportunity to plan ahead.  The increase would be staggered and people would only be obliged to pay an extra &euro;7.50 in any one calendar year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We appreciate from where the Minister is coming.  However, as he stated, this does not relate to making money for the State.  It is more about taking a joined-up approach to the overall situation regarding waste.  There will obviously be a need to deal with the question of incineration at some point in the future.  Trying to put in place a massive disincentive in respect of putting waste into landfill while there is no other alternative is the wrong way to go.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting that in respect of the previous amendment Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill stated that the plastic bag levy is a revenue-raising measure.  He is now stating that what is involved here is not a revenue-raising measure.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator said the opposite a few moments ago.  He may or may not realise that the gate fees relating to landfill sites have decreased to such a degree that materials which could be recycled are being placed in landfill.  I do not believe that is in the interests of environmental or waste policy.  By increasing landfill levies to such an extent, I am giving an incentive to people to move away from landfill and to seek other ways to dispose of waste.  That is the essence of good environmental practice but perhaps the Senator does not want us to proceed in this way.  We need to build on the work of the national waste prevention programme, particularly that aspect of it which relates to the food waste campaign.  We must support the diversion of material from landfill otherwise we will not comply with our 2013 and 2016 targets.  I do not want the taxpayer to be obliged to pay up to &euro;41 million per year in fines to the European Commission in the event of our failing to meet those targets.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P Just="Left">Diverting material from landfill is a critical element of waste policy.  We are placing emphasis on increased recycling.  It will not be possible to encourage people to recycle unless we increase the gate fees relating to landfill.  There is evidence to suggest that discounts are being offered at landfill sites which can accommodate larger volumes.  There is an incentive for certain local authorities that have spent a great deal of money on landfill sites and for private operators that have invested heavily in landfill infrastructure to ensure that the material they require is brought to their facilities.  That prevents this material from being recycled or entering any other part of the waste stream.  I am not exclusively depending on the landfill levy to achieve that to which I refer.  A regulatory impact assessment is being carried out in respect of household food waste regulations and the rolling out of the brown bin system.  I hope this will provide another incentive for people to move away from landfill.</P>
        <P>The restrictions Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill proposes in respect of the amount that can be charged in the form of a landfill levy would ensure that people would continue to have an incentive to move towards landfill at a time when we are trying to divert from it to meet our 2013 and 2016 targets.  Failure to meet those targets will mean that we will be obliged to pay up to &euro;41 million per annum in fines to the European Commission.  I am not prepared to accept that.  Accordingly, I reject the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that he is giving people an incentive to dump waste in rural areas because they will not be able to afford to bring it to landfill sites?  There is already a major problem in respect of people dumping rubbish illegally throughout the country.  What is proposed will only encourage an increase in such behaviour.  That must <Col N="896"/>be borne in mind in the context of the increases proposed.  There are no proposals in the Bill regarding an increase in the fines imposed on people caught dumping rubbish illegally.  Perhaps we should invest more money in order that it might be possible to deploy litter wardens in black spots where rubbish is dumped illegally.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister address some of those issues?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to the &euro;41 million in fines for which the country could be liable in a few years&rsquo; time if we do not divert material from landfill.  That is the stark reality.  However, it is the responsibility of the Minister and his Department to find alternative ways of treating waste.  I accept that work is being done on this but, as Senator Wilson stated, families who pay for their bins to be collected are being penalised.  In some counties waste is not going to landfill.  It is instead being sent on to be incinerated or to be subjected to some other form of treatment either within or outside the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill was amended in the D&aacute;il to make provision in respect of incineration.  However, a similar provision was not made in respect of landfill.  I agree with the Minister that there is a massive issue in respect of the amount of waste going to landfill.  The existing position is not sustainable but penalising ordinary consumers at a time when they cannot afford to pay extra is not the way to proceed.  The only way to deal with this issue is by providing alternative methods of treatment or dealing with the overall problem of waste. Consumers should not be penalised in respect of shortcomings within a Department.  I accept that efforts are being made and that the officials and the Minister work hard.  In light of all of the other charges households will be obliged to pay from January next, people will simply not be in a position to pay an increase that will double their weekly, monthly or annual waste charges.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Wilson is correct to state that what is proposed will lead to an escalation in fly tipping.  I have spoken to environmental groups in respect of this matter and they are of the same opinion.  People will dump waste over the Border or on beaches or they will bury it in their back gardens.  There will be a massive escalation in illegal dumping.  I am concerned that we are going down the wrong road in respect of what is proposed.  I accept where the Minister is coming from and agree with the overall principle that we must divert material from landfill.  However, what is proposed is not the right way to achieve this.  What is being done will affect ordinary householders rather than deal with the matter on a national or macro level by developing solutions.  Ultimately, operators in rural areas who may send the waste they collect to other counties or wherever will pass on the charges being imposed to consumers.  It is only natural that they would do so and consumers will lose out as a result.</P>
        <P>We fully appreciate the financial difficulties with which the State is trying to grapple.  The Minister stated that the plastic bag levy is not a method for collecting revenue.  Am I correct in stating that what is proposed here is a method for collecting revenue?  If it is not, then can we engage in a debate on the real issue of waste management?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The country will have to meet its obligations under the landfill directives to which the Government led by the Deputy&rsquo;s party signed up.  If we do not hit the relevant targets in 2013 and 2016, we will be obliged to pay fines to the European Commission.  Ordinary people will be obliged to pay those fines through their taxes.  Is that the proper way to proceed in respect of waste policy?  I would like to encourage people to move towards recycling and reuse and to divert from landfill so that we will not be obliged to pay the EU fines to which I refer.  In addition, under my proposals, people will have a better way of dealing with the waste management issues in their households.  I am rolling out various other schemes to facilitate this.  A regulatory impact assessment is being carried out in respect of household food waste regulations and the rolling out of the brown bin system.</P>
        <P>If all of the initiatives and policies being introduced &mdash; including those relating to producer responsibility and the business community &mdash; prove successful, then less material will go to landfill and more will go to waste-to-energy facilities.  We are putting an infrastructure in place to deal with all forms of waste.  We are also putting measures in place in respect of diverting from landfill and providing alternatives to which people can go.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill cannot expect me to support an amendment that makes landfill more attractive than recycling.  The Senator&rsquo;s claim that the levy will be passed on to the consumer is incorrect.  This provision will encourage consumers to choose the cheaper option, namely, recycling and will help us to meet our obligations on the environment under national and international law.  The Senator should not expect me to come into the House and advocate breaking the law.  We transposed a European directive on 31 March which was drawn up by the previous Government but never implemented.  I am taking action on an issue on which my predecessor did nothing.  The policies I am implementing will ensure the State does not face enormous fines arising from our failure to deal with waste management issues.  I am incentivising people to go the recycling and re-use route rather than the landfill route.  The Senator seems to be opposed to that.  I do not accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I am totally confused by the Minister&rsquo;s response.  A free recycling service is already available for many households at the doorstep.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, they have a free option.  The Senator wants that waste to go to landfill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>No, that is not what I am saying.  Why would people choose the option for which there is a charge, namely, the bin that is going to landfill, over the free option?  My point is that households are already availing of the free service for recyclable goods.</P>

	<P>People are already choosing the free recycling option.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Where is the Senator&rsquo;s problem in regard to landfill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s argument is contradictory in that households are already availing of the free service.  The problem is that there is no alternative for waste which is <Col N="898"/>not recyclable, which must either go to landfill or be treated in an incineration plant, of which there is none in the north west.  Households have no choice but to send their non-recyclable waste to landfill.  I assure the Minister that every household in my county of Donegal with access to a green bin is availing of it to dispose of recyclable material free of charge.  I have no issue with that.  I agree with the Minister that it is the route we should be going.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, if the European Union has an issue &mdash; which it clearly has &mdash; it is up to the Government, working with the people, to deal with that issue in a manner which does not negatively impact on consumers.  The bottom line is that there are no alternatives in terms of the disposal of material that cannot be recycled.  It is not an issue of cost because the free bin service for recyclable material is already available to a large percentage of households.  It should be rolled out throughout the State.  In any household in my constituency where the green bin service is available, people are choosing to recycle waste because it is free and environmentally friendly.  However, the waste that cannot be recycled is currently going to landfill.  The measures being introduced by the Minister mean people will have to pay higher fees for their bin collection service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I dispute the notion that there is a free recycling service.  In many cases, particularly in rural areas, a private company provides the service and an annual fee is payable in respect of all bins collected.  What will happen as a result of the Minister&rsquo;s provision is that there will be an increase in annual collection service charges to meet the cost of the levy on the landfill element.  Service providers will add a flat-rate charge to each household, irrespective of whether one&rsquo;s bin is full or only half full.  While I can see where the Minister is coming from in principle, what will happen in practice is that all customers of private operators will be hit with an additional flat-rate charge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will outline the solution.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill acknowledged that it is much cheaper to go the recycling route.  That is why I am imposing levies on landfill &mdash; to ensure consumers opt for the cheaper option.  How does the Senator envisage an additional charge for consumers in Donegal arising from the landfill levy given that a cheaper option is available to them?</P>

	<P>Not all material can be recycled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has just referred to the wonderful free recycling service in Donegal.  I am proposing to make it more attractive for consumers to avail of recycling by imposing a levy on landfill.  The objective of the charge is to act as a deterrent.  I also intend to introduce legislation to facilitate the development of waste-to-energy facilities, in respect of which the previous Government gave an undertaking.  That Administration talked about action in this area; I will carry it out.  I will ensure we have, for the first time, a proper waste management structure which complies with national and European law and thus ensures we will not face fines.  The ordinary people whom the Senator and I represent want a better waste management infrastructure.  They do not want to pay fines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>

	<P>I do not want to detract from the exchange between the Minister and my colleague, but Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s observation that not all material is recyclable recalls an issue I raised on Second Stage.  There is some confusion among consumers as to whether certain types of plastic packaging are recyclable.  In some cases the branding indicates they are recyclable when in fact they are not, while in other cases consumers are sending plastic packaging to landfill because they do not realise it can be recycled.  I am not an expert in this area but I assume most forms of plastic are now recyclable.</P>

	<P>Yes, but the arguments made by both the Minister and Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill focus on the promotion of recycling over landfill.  I am merely asking whether it is the case that significant volumes of recyclable plastics are being assigned to landfill in error and whether the Department has any measures to address that.</P>

	<P>This is not about any political party favouring landfill over any other method of disposal.  The Minister is incorrect in stating otherwise.

	<P>The point I am making is directly relevant to the amendment.  The Government is proposing to introduce a levy to increase the cost of disposal to landfill without putting in place an adequate waste collection service to every household in the country.  Waterford city has been a leader in this area for many years, with all households having access to a brown, green and black bin.  However, the same service is not available from many local authorities or private operators.  In those situations, the cost of the service will increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I make no apologies for that because it is what must be done to ensure we do not find ourselves in breach of landfill directives in the future.  Equally, it is the correct action to take for the environment.  Proposals on commercial and household food regulations are out for public consultation and Senators are entitled to make a submission in that regard.  I also intend to introduce measures to reduce the volume of packaging materials used by businesses and wholesalers.  I am taking this opportunity to inform service providers that major decisions will be made in the autumn in regard to waste policy.  This way, there will be no confusion for people in the business that there will a levy increase on 1 September and others in 2012 and 2013 to divert from landfill to other uses in the waste management structure.  I agree that we need uniformity with regard to the application of the three bin system.  That is exactly what we will try to do between now and the end of the year.</P>

        <P LI="2">(2) Sections 4 and 5 of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001 are repealed.</P>
        <P LI="2">(3) The making of a waste management plan shall be a reserved function of the local authority.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is an important issue.  Our approach to waste management should be based on community and environmental sustainability.  There are two aspects to the amendment, one of which deals with incineration or thermal treatment and the other with a repeal of sections of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act to allow councillors and elected representatives, rather than unelected officials, to make decisions on waste management.  When the legislation was amended by former Minister Martin Cullen, there was much controversy over the fact that local politicians were being disregarded and that the views of local representatives were being put to one side in favour of giving unelected officials powers to make decisions on waste management.  The argument made at the time was that elected representatives were not able to make the tough decisions required because of NIMBYism and other reasons.  It is for this reason the law was changed.  I remember very clearly that Fine Gael and other parties joined us in opposing the weakening of the powers of local government and local councillors.  In keeping with this, I hope my amendment can be accepted.</P>
        <P>We face a very significant waste management crisis.  We have just debated the issue of costs.  The Minister is absolutely correct that we must ensure we have waste management policies that are environmentally sustainable and robust and that encourage people to recycle and reduce waste.  The Government is under pressure from EU directives, but we should not have to wait for the European Union, through a directive, to tell us to do the right thing.  We should do it independently.  Unfortunately, as regards incineration, the State has not done the right thing.</P>
        <P>If one considers the Poolbeg incinerator project and the associated farce, for example, one will realise it was designed to take a volume of waste far greater than that which would be generated in Dublin.  This is one of the arguments my party made against incineration.  We spent years burying waste in landfill sites.  The Minister touched on that issue in a previous discussion and stated we were being brought to court by the European Court of Justice because of our failure to divert waste from landfill properly.  We spent years making mistakes in burying waste.  My central point is that we should not make the same mistakes again by burning waste.  We need to concentrate more on recycling and aim at the target of having zero waste.  We should ensure the measures about which the Minister spoke, including packaging, are put in place.  Thus, we could reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfill or, potentially, to an incinerator.</P>
        <P>Members of the Oireachtas and local authorities have been on a number of field trips to examine incinerators, mainly to learn about the environmental and health aspects thereof, and whether they pose a danger to health.  Many of those who went on the trips saw waste incinerated that could easily have been recycled properly.  That is part of the problem.</P>
        <P>The farce surrounding the Poolbeg incinerator project was demonstrated when the councillors and elected representatives were not made party to information on costs associated with the project.  Full information was not given to them, yet they were being asked to make decisions.  There was outrage recently when the costs far exceeded the projected costs.  Inciner<Col N="903"/>ation is not the best way to go because if we put in place a network of incinerators across the State, we will be encouraging people to continue as they are.  When incinerators are built, they need to be fed and reach a certain capacity, implying that we will end up servicing the incinerators rather than putting in place targets to reduce waste.  This is the wrong approach and does not represent international best environmental practice in waste management.  If we continue with failed policies, attempts to put in place incinerators and to use the same formula adopted at Poolbeg, we are heading for disaster.</P>
        <P>The previous Government was reviewing the concept of incineration because of what had happened with the Poolbeg project.  The Green Party which is also opposed to incineration was involved, and, therefore, there was a shift in Government thinking.  I am not sure about the current position on that shift or about the Government&rsquo;s thoughts.  However, I would be interested to hear them.  Building a network of incinerators is not the best way to divert, reduce or manage waste.  It would be the wrong approach and replace one failed system, namely, burying waste, with another, namely, burning waste.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Senator on the third aspect of the amendment, that power be devolved to local government members to deal with waste management plans.  I remind him that Poolbeg incinerator project was approved by councillors in the Dublin regional waste management plan approximately ten or 11 years ago.  The democratic devolution the Senator states did not occur on many occasions did occur in respect of the Poolbeg project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, the information given to the councillors at the time has been proved to have been incorrect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have the greatest of respect for local elected representatives and believe they are very intelligent people who are able to make informed decisions.  If they did not receive the information required, I am sure they asked for it.  I am sure they had all the information they needed to make their decision.  </P>
        <P>I agree with the Senator that it was not acceptable for councillors&rsquo; powers regarding waste management plans to be taken away by former Minister Martin Cullen.  It was done because councillors would not take responsibility.  One can give power to people, but they must accept responsibility when entrusted with it to deal effectively with issues in an open and accountable way and to make decisions for the overall good of their county and community.  That did not always happen and that is why I am sure the former Minister decided to remove the power at the time.  I am prepared to consider restoring as much power as possible to local elected members in the context of local government reform and devolving as many functions as possible to local government.  I am sure there is a significant number of recommendations on these matters in studies carried out by the Department during the years that have never been implemented.  However, I hope this will change in the near future.</P>
        <P>The first aspect of the amendment proposes to make a particular form of waste management, namely, incineration, illegal within the State.  This is a form of waste treatment that is legal under EU law.  I cannot, therefore, accept an amendment that would make it illegal.  The waste framework directive sets out the waste hierarchy as a priority order to be applied in waste management legislation.  Incineration, where it reaches the required threshold of energy recovery, is deemed to be on the recovery tier of the waste hierarchy.  I transposed the directive on 31 March this year.  Landfill which is classed as disposal and below the recovery tier would remain legal under the amendment.  I do not believe in making landfill legal.  I proposed several amendments in the D&aacute;il and had them confirmed in this House to move away from landfill because of the fines that would be imposed on us if we did not do so.  If we do not do as I <Col N="904"/>propose, we will not meet our landfill diversion targets in 2013.  The amendment is contrary to the directive I have transposed.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s immediate challenge is to move away from overdependence on landfill.  A range of alternative infrastructure will be required.  We need to put in place a number of measures, including waste prevention measures, to meet this challenge.  To make one of the options illegal would result in increased costs to the public and businesses and undermine our ability to provide alternatives to landfill and meet our obligations as an EU member state.</P>
        <P>The second part of the amendment proposes to repeal two sections of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act dealing with waste management planning.  Waste management planning is a significant part of waste management policy and deserves due consideration.  It was previously found necessary to provide for the making of waste management plans by city and county managers as an executive function because councillors would not do it.</P>
        <P>The third part of the amendment proposes to restore responsibility for the making of waste management plans to members of local authorities.  I propose to examine this issue in the context of what I stated about devolution.</P>
      
        <P>I will examine the issue of waste management planning and the appropriate role of authorities as part of the development of a new waste policy which will be available for discussion in October or November.  I will publish a discussion document in the coming weeks to deal with these matters.  For these reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I go a certain distance with the Minister.  I remember that when the Minister of the day withdrew the right of councillors to intervene with regard to waste management it attracted a great deal of criticism.  However, decisions being taken on the ground were not in the national interest.  I have always felt the size of our country means local and national representatives work more closely with their constituents than in other countries.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>I was taken somewhat with what Senator Cullinane stated about the number of delegations which have gone to Europe to look at incinerators.  While I am no expert in the area, I have come to the conclusion, particularly as a result of speaking with people &mdash; local representatives in the main &mdash; who have travelled to see incinerators in action, that modern technology means incineration is not the great anti-environmental project which many people state it is.  We will have to deal with waste, and recycling alone will not be sufficient to do so.  The arguments and objections put forward by Senator Cullinane, his party and others are not so much about the concept of incineration <i>per se</i>, although I know he stated he was against it in principle, but about where an incinerator is to be located.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has shown himself to be independent in thought in this regard.  He has tried to create a balance between restoring powers to local authorities, which I fully support as do all of us who have been elected, and taking account of the reality whereby waste management decisions must be taken in the national interest.  If councillors or local authority officials were to thwart these objectives it would not be in the wider interest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I asked the Minister about non-recyclable plastic.  I am grateful to one of the Minister&rsquo;s officials for clarifying the matter.  In principle, everything is recyclable but because of the complex nature of recycling certain components of some widely consumed plastics it would be very costly to do so, and a small country such as Ireland could not take a unilateral position on it.  As a crusading Minister, perhaps the Minister will take on board an initiative at EU level to address the issue of the non-recyclable nature of some plastics.  It will have to be an EU initiative and I hope Ireland will be at the forefront of ensuring this can be done.  Because of our small market, we will not be able to do this and it may thwart the efforts of the Minister <Col N="905"/>and the collective effort to ensure these materials do not go to landfill.  Incinerators are the only way to achieve this.  I infer from the figure of 0.2% which the Minister mentioned earlier with regard to Norway that incinerators are in operation there along with other waste management methods.  This gives the lie to the view that we should not have incineration.  It is used in Scandinavia, which is one of the most environmentally aware regions in the world.</P>
        <P>I am in favour of incineration because not only will modern incinerator technology address the issue of landfill and recycling but it will create energy which can be recycled for the benefit of society.  I make these remarks because I do not agree with the amendment and because it is important that the Minister ensures the incineration debate, which seems to have quietened down, is not resurrected by shibboleths about incineration being wrong and recycling being good with no meeting of minds between them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not about me or my party speaking about big bad incinerators.  I support a waste hierarchy of reduce, reuse and recycle.  My point is that creating an infrastructure or network of incinerators which must be managed will mean huge associated costs of tens of millions of euros.  They will then have to operate to a certain capacity to be justified economically, and this will lend itself to the Government or State agencies not putting in place resources to invest in new technologies to examine ways of diverting or recycling waste which cannot be diverted or recycled.</P>
        <P>We accept and support moving away from landfill, but it is wrong for us to simply replace one failed waste management system, namely, landfill, with incineration.  I gave a number of examples of what we should do to put in place an infrastructure.  In this country, we often put the cart before the horse.  Earlier, the Minister mentioned packaging and a huge amount of packaging is needlessly created and used.  My party put forward a proposal that every supermarket and retail outlet should have a receptacle where people can dispose of needless packaging at source rather than having to dispose of it at home.  We all know a huge amount of packaging should not be associated with many goods that are sold.  Most of this is down to how goods are marketed and how people are enticed to buy them in the first place.  It is not environmentally sustainable.  This is an issue the Minister could examine.</P>
        <P>The State does not have a glass recycling facility as it was closed down by the previous Government.  This comes back to my point on infrastructure; we do not put in place measures to ensure we can reduce needless packaging and invest in new technology which allows us to reduce and recycle waste which at present cannot be reduced or recycled.  Technology changes all the time and much work is done nationally and internationally on research and development.  Ecolab and Waterford IT have done much research on how to re-use various types of waste which we see as needing to go to a landfill or an incinerator.  Building incinerators which have targets to be met is wrong.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is considering new measures in areas such as packaging.  I would welcome a response from him in this regard.  The reason we tabled this amendment is that in five or ten years we do not want to be left with very costly monstrosities when new technology will mean less waste needs to go to incinerators.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In theory, I agree with Senator Cullinane that with regard to waste, reducing is at the top of the hierarchy.  All types of new ideas will come forward in the next ten years, but what is the Minister to do in the meantime?  Is he to keep all the waste in his shed or backyard?  We must be realistic.  We cannot continue with landfill which poisons our watercourses and pollutes our ground.  At present, the solution is incineration and we must go with it.</P><Col N="906"/>
        <P Just="Left">We all very much welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to local government reform.  I hope he will follow through on this and return the powers that have been removed over the years.  The amendments are either not practical at present or they will be addressed in due course by the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Cullinane asked about a packaging levy.  The programme for Government outlined a commitment to drive waste reduction as part of the overall policy on sustainable waste.  One of the possible elements of the waste reduction strategy is a levy on packaging and the Department has commenced a process of consultation with industry.  Submissions can be made until 5 August.  Further details on that initiative are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>As this is the first occasion on which he has visited the House since his appointment, I welcome the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  </P>
        <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 118, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and has been placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration,&rdquo; the Minister will explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  For the convenience of Senators, the Cathaoirleach has arranged for the printing and circulation to them of the amendments.  There are eight other amendments to the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il.  If the House agrees, the Minister will first explain the changes made by the D&aacute;il to the Bill.  We can then deal with the eight amendments to the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
        <P>In regard to the amendments made to the Bill by the D&aacute;il, I am suggesting 21 groupings based on the subject matter of the 96 amendments made.  The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments.  I advise the House that Senators may speak only once on each grouping.  I also remind Senators that the only matters that can be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman for his welcome to the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I find myself in a slightly unusual position in that I am bringing back to this House a Bill initiated by the previous Government in the last Seanad.  I am, therefore, conscious that this is the first time many Senators will have seen or had an opportunity to consider the Bill.  Before addressing the amendments I brought forward in the D&aacute;il to improve the Bill, I will give the House an overview of the context of the Bill, in terms of its origins and objectives, and some <Col N="909"/>background information on the postal market and the regulatory framework that will apply as a result of the enactment of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Postal sector liberalisation is not new and much of the regulatory framework for the postal sector has been in place since the transposition of the first postal services directive in 2000.  The Bill transposes the third postal services directive and puts in place the regulatory framework necessary to govern a fully liberalised postal sector, a sector which has been fully open to competition since January 2011.  The Bill also enshrines and safeguards the universal postal service, that is, the collection and delivery of mail throughout the entire country on every working day.  An Post will remain the designated universal service provider for the next 12 years.  The Bill also provides for enhanced consumer protection measures.</P>
        <P>The Bill has been the subject of a very thorough debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  All Members of the Oireachtas hold their local postperson and post office in high regard and many of the current postal issues were given the benefit of a thorough airing.  I was pleased to participate in the D&aacute;il debate and noted that many of my colleagues made their maiden speeches on postal issues.</P>
        <P>The opening of the postal market means that An Post is already facing a more competitive environment in which there are other operators.  The reality is that &mdash; unfortunately, some Members of the Oireachtas are reluctant to accept this fact &mdash; the greatest competitive pressures on An Post and the postal sector are exerted by the twin threats of the general economic weakness and electronic substitution.  Postal volumes have declined by almost 20% since 2008 and this trend is, unfortunately, set to continue.  In order to address the competitive pressures on the company, An Post needs to build on its true competitive advantages.  If it succeeds in doing so, I see a sustainable business for the company and its highly regarded workforce.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Most of the amendments which I will discuss individually seek to clarify policy around and make minor textual changes to certain provisions in the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, are textual changes made to the Long Title of the Bill.  They include references to the Broadcasting Act 2009, certain provisions of which are being amended by the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendments Nos. 5 and 8 relate to the commencement of the Bill which had been set as 1 January 2011, the date for full market opening as prescribed by the postal services directive.  As the Bill will come into force on its passing, with the exception of section 48, the amendments delete the reference to the original commencement date.  Amendment No. 60 relates to section 48, the commencement of which is dependent on the enactment of the customs Bill and will be by ministerial order.  In addition, amendments Nos. 53, 54 and 86 are drafting amendments that arise as a consequence of amendments Nos. 5 and 8.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendments Nos. 6, 34, 35, 83, 84 and 87 are technical amendments to a number of sections in the Bill that reflect the establishment of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the transfer of certain functions from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  They also account for name changes for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendments Nos. 7, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 22 are drafting amendments that lend clarity to and remove ambiguity from a number of definitions.  Amendments Nos. 23 to 26, inclusive, reflect a commitment made in the programme for Government to safeguarding the universal postal service, which is fundamental to the regulatory framework for the postal sector.  The amendments made to section 17 extend the designation period for An Post as universal service provider from seven years to 12 and provide also that any decision made by ComReg in the designation process, if it decides not to redesignate An Post, shall be subject to ministerial oversight which I consider an important safeguard of the universal postal service.  Substantial <Col N="910"/>redrafting by the Parliamentary Counsel was required to accommodate the amendments, leading to the replacement of section 17 with four new sections, sections 17 to 20, inclusive.  In addition, amendments Nos. 11, 16, 17, 61 and 62 are drafting amendments that arise as a result of the amendments to section 17, mainly in order to update cross-references in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendments Nos. 14, 15, 19 to 21, inclusive, 41, 67, 79 to 82 and 96 are drafting amendments, made mainly at the behest of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, that seek to add clarity and make minor corrections to the text of the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 18, 55, 56, 66, 69, 74 to 76, inclusive, and 78 are being made to reflect Part 2 of the Fines Act 2010 which was commenced earlier this year.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 29 to 32, inclusive, seek to add clarity in respect of the oversight by ComReg of the terms and conditions submitted by An Post or any other universal postal service providers, in relation to their provision of the universal postal service.  In this regard, the main objective of these amendments is to provide that charges for universal services will not be subject to ComReg&rsquo;s approval under this section.  The reason for this is that all charges must be compliant with the tariff principles, as monitored by ComReg, with charges for some universal services being subject to a price cap.</P>
        <P>The intention of the Bill was never for ComReg to approve every price change made by a designated universal service provider and these amendments correct this.  In addition, this set of amendments reduces the transitional period, for the ending of An Post&rsquo;s schemes and the publication and coming into force of its terms and conditions, from six months to three weeks.  In addition, ComReg is to approve An Post&rsquo;s terms and conditions within six months of their publication.  These amendments have led to some redrafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, resulting in the replacement of two sections by four.  In addition, amendments Nos. 27, 28, 39 and 63 are consequential amendments, mainly to update cross references arising as a result of the insertion of these new sections.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 33, 57, 64, 65, 68, 71, 72, 73 and 77 replace references in the Bill to &ldquo;employee&rdquo; with references to &ldquo;employee or agent&rdquo; where appropriate, and are proposed to take account of and apply the rights and obligations of the Bill to the many postal workers who are agents rather than employees of a postal service provider.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 36 and 37 arose following discussion on amendments tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on Committee Stage.  The amendments provided that under section 23, a uniform tariff will apply across the State to any postal service provided at single piece tariff.  The legislation now sets this as the default position.  It also permits ComReg to make a decision, having regard to the reasonable needs of users and with the consent of the Minister, to move away from this default position, should the market necessitate it.  This is in line with the postal directive which permits the imposition of a uniform tariff in the public interest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendments Nos. 38 and 52 are technical amendments that arise as a result of amendments Nos. 36 and 37.  Amendment No. 40 also relates to section 23 and deletes subsection (5) of that section, which linked special tariffs for businesses to terminal dues which is the method of settling accounts in relation to cross-Border post.  This amendment is being made on foot of a requirement of the postal directive to distinguish clearly between the regulation of terminal dues and the regulation of domestic universal services tariffs.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 42 to 44, inclusive, relate to accounting obligations placed on universal postal service providers, and seek to reflect more accurately the intention of the directive in relation to the submission of accounting information by the universal postal service provider to the European Commission.  Amendments Nos. 45 and 46 clarify that the monitoring by ComReg of the quality of universal postal services relates to domestic services only.  While <Col N="911"/>intra-community services are monitored by the EU according to specified standards, the Bill provides that ComReg will have a role to play in any instance of those standards not being met, in that it can issue directions to a universal postal service provider in relation to corrective action to be taken.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a result of discussions held on Committee Stage and in order to address concerns that Deputies Ferris and Mattie McGrath expressed on the matter of access to An Post&rsquo;s postal network, I brought forward an amendment to section 28.  Amendment No. 47 adds to the list of issues, set out in that section, that ComReg must take into account, when settling any disputes around access.  The main effect of the amendment is that it will be an explicit requirement that the capital investment made by a universal service provider in its network must be factored into ComReg&rsquo;s considerations when resolving a disagreement in relation to access issues.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 48 to 51 relate to section 30, which provides that a universal postal service provider may apply to ComReg for funding for the net cost of the universal postal service obligation.  ComReg is required to assess any such application and determine whether or not the universal postal service obligation represents a net cost and is in its opinion an unfair financial burden.</P>
        <P>The effect of these amendments is threefold.  First, to clarify that any request for funding may relate only to a designation made under section 17, that is, no funding can be sought in regard to the current designation under the 2002 regulations.  Second, to clearly set out the timeframe within which a designated universal postal service provider may submit a request for funding to ComReg, so as to give certainty to all players in regard to the timing of any potential request for funding. Third, to clarify that it is ComReg that is responsible for determining the net cost of the provision of the universal postal service and to widen the class of body that ComReg may appoint to verify the calculation of the net cost.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 58 and 59, relating to section 42, permit postal service providers to open postal packets only in cases where there is no return address and which do not comply with the providers&rsquo; terms and conditions.  This allows the provider to ascertain details of the sender in cases where a packet may, for example, be underpaid or not properly packaged.  Amendment No. 70 clarifies that postal packets, whose transmission may be prohibited under this section, may legitimately be sent if they comply with the terms and conditions of the postal service provider concerned.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 85 relates to Chapter 11, which provides for the regulation of free postage for election candidates.  Section 56 will enable the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to designate a postal service provider, for the purposes of providing free election post for candidates and determine the conditions under which it is to be provided.  It also provides that An Post will be the provider of free election post until such time as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform makes a designation order under this section.</P>
        <P>The amendment to this section provides that the terms and conditions of this free postage and the sum payable from the Central Fund for it shall be agreed between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the relevant postal service provider rather than simply determined by the Minister.  This amendment better reflects the contractual nature of these agreements.  The amendment also better reflects the intention that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Defence are consulted, not in regard to the contract, but rather in order for them to satisfy themselves that electoral needs are met.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 88 relates to section 61, which enables the Minister to establish, maintain and operate a national postcode system.  This amendment restates this section in its entirety in order to clarify that the national postcode system may be used by a person or body for purposes <Col N="912"/>other than the provision of postal services.  The amendment aims to avoid any unintended restriction on the use of postcodes.  It provides for terms and conditions of a postcode contract regarding property rights and charging.  It allows for the sharing of the national postcode system with public bodies free of charge to perform their functions.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>Amendments Nos. 89 to 94, inclusive, introduce a number of amendments to the Broadcasting Act 2009.  The purpose of these amendments is twofold: first, to give legal effect to two budget 2011 decisions in relation to television licence fee receipts and, second, to pave the way for the establishment of a funding scheme for public and private broadcasters in relation to the archiving of programme material.  The proposed amendments are of vital importance, in particular as they ensure the ongoing funding of TG4.  There is an urgent need to enact provisions to give effect to the decisions taken.  These amendments seek to generate savings to the Exchequer, while ensuring that RT&Eacute; and TG4 continue to be funded sufficiently to enable delivery of their statutory public service obligations.  I am sure Senators will agree that it is crucial that Irish viewers and listeners can enjoy access to a quality, free to air broadcasting service into the future and in this regard support the rapid passage of this legislation.</P>
        <P>The effect of amendment No. 95 is to ensure that An Post may continue to make schemes, which are statutory instruments, in regard to the services it provides that do not fall within the regulatory framework of the Bill.  These services, for which An Post will still be able to make schemes, are non-postal services and relate primarily to money and postal orders.</P>

	<P>The subject matter of amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill requires that access to a universal service provider&rsquo;s network should be agreed in the first instance on a commercial basis.  I do not believe that legislation that restricts any legitimate commercial activity would best serve the needs of postal users, the economy or An Post.  Therefore, especially in the context of the contracting market size and the need for flexibility in meeting the challenges that the sector faces, I do not propose to accept the Opposition amendments.  However, as I said in my opening address, and in reply to the legitimate concerns raised by Deputies Ferris and McGrath in the other House on the matter of access, I am introducing an amendment in section 33(8) of the Bill which provides that ComReg must consider the capital investment made by a universal service provider in its postal network in arriving at any decision when resolving disputes about access to the network.  I believe this goes some way towards dealing with the concerns expressed in the amendments that have been tabled.</P>
        <P>I must say the same in respect of amendment No. 2.  In our view, a reliance on legal protections to shield An Post from competition will not ensure it is in a position to face the various challenges that lie ahead.  Providing for the continuation of its legal monopoly is expressly prohibited by the directive.  I introduced an amendment in the D&aacute;il on Report Stage which reflects the commitment made in the programme for Government to safeguard universal postal services.  The amendment extends the designation to 12 years, with the Minister now having a consenting role in any decision made by ComReg in the designation process.  However, the Bill <Col N="913"/>provides that ComReg may designate a universal postal service provider after that period of 12 years, and An Post could, if ComReg so decides, be designated beyond that period.</P>

	<P>Is the Senator offering to speak now?</P>

	<P>Yes.  I am just saying that I do not want to hog the time, as we are doing all of this in one go and stopping at 7.30 p.m.</P>
        <P>I was interested that the Minister mentioned the commitment in the programme for Government to protect the universal postal service.  I have mentioned previously the statement in the programme for Government about the position of An Post as the State&rsquo;s postal service provider for the next 20 years.  This will now not be the case, as we can see from this legislation and the amendments.  The period now being talked about is 12 years, with a review after seven years.  This does not provide certainty to An Post in line with the commitment made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in their programme for Government, which was not a million years ago.  It was not even an election promise, which is a bit unusual.  The programme for Government states:</P>
        <P LI="1">A universal postal service is an essential public service, in particular for rural communities and those disadvantaged communities affected by digital divide.  A publicly owned, commercially viable, profitable and efficient An Post is critical to the long-term viability of the postal market.  We will enact into law the Postal Services Bill which opens postal market to competition.  Will protect universal service obligation by assigning it to An Post for at least 20 years, make provision for state subvention and require that any decision by ComReg to reassign or scrap USO is subject to ministerial approval.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As the Minister knows, this did not come from the Labour Party manifesto.  Lord Denning was even quoted: what is said in an election manifesto is not a contractual obligation, but then again it is probably not worth the paper it is written on either.  However, the commitment to which I refer is not from an election manifesto; it is from a programme for Government from just over four months ago.  We are not happy that the Government is doing this after giving that commitment.  I ask the Minister to consider this.  There are some worthy amendments proposed by my colleagues, which were also made in the D&aacute;il by Opposition parties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also refer to the provision for the post code system to acknowledge place names and locations in the Irish language.  With that in mind and bearing in mind that the debate on the <Col N="914"/>Bill is being guillotined, I ask the Minister to provide an answer on that most important issue.  Fundamentally, the postal service as we know it will be radically changed.  Other European countries have managed to comply with the European directives without taking the steps that are being proposed in this legislation.  We must ensure that rural areas will be provided with the service they should be getting and that they are getting at the moment.  Unfortunately, however, this is being changed, even since January.  I ask the Minister to come back to us with regard to the commitment in the programme for Government.  I will not speak any more as I want to ensure my colleagues have a chance to speak, but I ask him to address that specific point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister.  I would like to speak to the amendments in group 5.  There is much concern in rural Ireland about the future of postal services and the potential downgrading of An Post.  I am sure the Minister is aware of that.  Many arguments were made on Second Stage, both here and in the D&aacute;il, about the fact that the post office has a social dimension and is not just about the provision of postal services.  Local post offices are much more than just a service that delivers post.  In many towns and villages across the State, they are seen as pillars of the community &mdash; a place where people interact socially, which is important for pensioners and people who are isolated due to a lack of public transport.  There is a dependency on An Post in rural Ireland.  That is why I want to see An Post retained as the only provider of the collection and delivery of letters.</P>
        <P>An Post has served us very well and I do not see why we would consider its privatisation.  While the Minister will say we are simply opening the market to competition, we saw what happened with Eircom, which led to the privatisation of the industry.  We then saw the slow roll-out, almost at a snail&rsquo;s pace, of broadband infrastructure which proved to be a disaster for rural communities.  For these reasons, I cannot support what the Minister is proposing in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Minister will recall that when he sat on the Opposition benches with Sinn F&eacute;in Members, the then Minister had no understanding of social ownership, the social dimension or the social needs post offices served.  The Minister&rsquo;s party was supportive of the policies and proposals Sinn F&eacute;in was bringing forward.  There was a meeting of minds in our parties on these issues, but it now seems there is a divergence between us and I wonder why that is the case.</P>
        <P>I echo the point made by Senator Mark Daly on the commitment given in the programme for Government covering a 20 year period.  Why is the Government deviating from that commitment?  Why is the period being reduced from 20 years to 12?  What is the reasoning behind this?</P>
        <P>My main argument with the Bill is that I want to see An Post being the only service provider.  I do not believe the opening up of the sector to competition will inevitably lead to the provision of a better service.  Private operators will cherrypick the routes or services they want to provide and it might lead to a weakened system for many, especially those living in rural communities.  For these reasons, I will be opposing the Bill and the amendments I cited in group 5.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Senator Mary White may speak to any of the 21 groupings of amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I will speak about amendment No. 88 in group 19 which deals with the national postcode system.  I propose that we not support the area postcode system decided on by the former Minister with responsibility for communications in the previous Government, Eamon Ryan.  As noted, Fine Gael and the Labour Party supported a distinctly more unambiguous postcode system in their recent manifestos.  For example, the Fine Gael manifesto read: <Col N="915"/>&ldquo;Fine Gael will introduce a new postcode system that works on the principle of codes unique to the location of buildings as opposed to the Government&rsquo;s current plan for an area code system&rdquo;.  Why has the Government altered its previous position on this matter?  Why is the provision included in the Bill much broader in terms of who the system will benefit?</P>
        <P>The system of postcodes which the Government intends to introduce is based on 1960s technology, pre-scanners, pre-GPS and pre-satnav systems.  A system of postcodes has been in the pipeline for many years.  However, it was always thought by the general public and An Post that postcodes were unnecessary.  An Post always stated it did not need postcodes to do its job, even though it now appears to have changed its stance on the subject.  The truth of the matter is that such a system would be of no benefit to rural communities.  Practically 40% of the population is rural based.  Ireland has the largest percentage of rural dwellers in Europe.  The reason such a system would be of no benefit is that in many rural areas there are no street names, let alone house names.  Without this information postcodes would lead the postman to a general area or townland in which there may be up to 50 properties.  He would still have to wander around and ask for directions.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes that additional characters be added to the postcode for selected organisations such as the Revenue Commissions and the Department of Social Protection in order to find the correct properties.  However, the owner of a property who might have to dial 999 to call for an ambulance would not be in possession of a postcode to unambiguously identify his or her house.  Neither would a courier, a census enumerator or even a political canvasser be able to use the postcode to identify individual properties.</P>
        <P>A report by PA Consulting released in 2008 on the website of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources estimated the cost of implementing this inefficient postal system.  It was predicted that the total cost would be approximately &euro;45 million.  I, therefore, ask the Government to reassess its options.  There is state-of-the-art technology available which allocates codes to individual buildings.  This is the technology developed by an Irish company based in Cork and it is so advanced that it has recently been incorporated by a leading international company, Garmin.  I propose that the Government invest in implementing this technology to ensure taxpayers&rsquo; money is not wasted on a substandard system.  Not only would an investment in the company mentioned be efficient and economical, it would lead to the creation of employment in our jobs-straved economy.</P>
        <P>I strongly urge my colleagues to reject the Bill and force the Government to remove all of these faults from the system under consideration.  We need a more proficient, economically-friendly system, not one that will be inefficient and of no use to a significant percentage of the population.  Passing the Bill today would not only be wrong, it would also be a serious waste of money, something of which we must all be conscious when making decisions, as money is one thing we do not have.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, every success in his position and I am confident he will do a superb job.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that at this late stage it is not possible for me to accept the amendment.  I explained why I considered that any restriction on the commercial role of An Post is undesirable.  Listening to some of the contributions &mdash; I identify with many of the sentiments &mdash; it is clear that speakers do not accept that what I am doing is transposing an EU directive.  There are central matters in which I do not have freedom to make changes that some Senators would like.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are now in a competitive environment and the privatisation of Telecom &Eacute;ireann is not analogous because we are not discussing privatisation.  It is true that the country suffered economically because of a lack of investment in broadband, etc., arising from the manner in which what was Telecom &Eacute;ireann changed ownership on a number of occasions and was asset-stripped.  There is no intention, on my part as Minister or on the part of the Government, to <Col N="917"/>privatise An Post.  However, as it must function in a competitive environment in future as a result of the directive, I cannot shackle it in the manner in which Senator Cullinane believes is advantageous.  As we go through the amendments I will have an opportunity to reply to some of the points raised by other Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have been informed that The Netherlands sought a derogation with respect to that EU directive.  If it was good enough for that state it can be good enough for us.  We cannot hide behind EU directives on every issue.  There is a responsibility to ensure we act in the interests of citizens here.  We have the opportunity to seek a derogation from any EU directive if we so wish.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will deal with amendment No. 6 very quickly.  The Minister will remember that postcodes were to be introduced to Ireland by January 2008, more than three and a half years ago.  Little has happened in the intervening period due to clear opposition to previous proposals.  However, in a last minute effort to rush matters before the election, a tender process to select an organisation to implement the planned postcode system was commenced on 17 January 2011, and this tender was to proceed on the basis of the 2006 report by the postcode project board, which recommended an area-based post code.  That was criticised in the Oireachtas report referred to earlier.</P>
        <P>In addition, a few days before the tender was announced, officials from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources were quoted in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> stating that a precise digital address code, such as that designed by Garmin, would not provide the basis of the national system.  Such a statement serves several purposes, one of which was to emphasise that a precise code as advocated would not be selected.  A minimum turnover of &euro;40 million is required for a business to enter the process, which highlights that the tender process is not to design a suitable post code but rather to find a large business process outsourcing company to implement post code design which has already been decided.</P>
        <P>These are the reasons we have concerns about the Government proposals.  I would welcome a response from the Minister and I hope he can support the amendment.</P><P Just="Left">Debate adjourned.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, to delete lines 17 and 18 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" Just="Left">&ldquo; &ldquo;universal social provider&rdquo; means An Post and that An Post is retained as the only provider of the collection and delivery of letters.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will be very brief.  Amendment No. 5 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 18, to delete lines 23 to 46 and in page 19, to delete lines 1 to 20 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" Just="Left">&ldquo;17.&mdash;An Post is designated as the universal postal service provider.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That amendment will provide the Minister with a last chance to honour the commitment given in the programme for Government that he would designate An Post as a universal service provider for 20 years.  We made that point before and I would like a response on why there has been a move from that clear commitment in the programme for Government.  If the Minister supports this amendment he will have taken the last chance for the Government to support what it put forward in the programme for Government, and before that in election promises.  Previous to the election the Minister&rsquo;s party had long-held views on supporting An Post as the universal service provider in this State.</P>
        <P>The Minister indicated that the Bill is not intended to privatise An Post but it is a first step in privatising the service.  Private operators will cherrypick some of the more lucrative services.  I have no doubt that this is a stated intention, although perhaps not from the Minister.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides but there is no doubt that the European Union would like to see states privatise many services currently supported by the State.  It is a stated objective of the Union.  The Minister&rsquo;s partners in the Government, Fine Gael, would most certainly be supportive of the privatisation of An Post.</P>
        <P>I do not necessarily question the Minister&rsquo;s commitment in this respect but I have a concern about the intentions of the European Union directives which are essentially based on a wish to privatise services, including An Post.  I am also concerned about the intentions of the other party in the Government.  I have no doubt that Fine Gael would look to privatise An Post much more quickly than the Minister if given the opportunity to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support my colleague on amendment No. 5.  As the Senator mentioned, we are only supporting Fine Gael and the Labour Party in their commitments in the programme for Government.  As I indicated in my opening address, that document was produced only four months ago.  I do not know what has happened in the meantime but the parties have rowed back on that commitment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fear that we are teeing up An Post for privatisation, which may not equate to a better service.  I do not know if that is the objective of the European Union but we will be bowing to the gods of commercialism while ensuring that rural Ireland does not receive the service it had up until the implementation of this EU directive.  We will support the amendment because, ironically, it supports Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  That is a turn-up for the books but I am sure Fine Gael and Labour Party Senators will vote against their own programme for Government.  That is politics.  I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We are retaining the universal service obligation.  That is at the heart of the Bill.  Every piece of post will be delivered to every house in Ireland five days a week.  That is the commitment.  A further commitment is that An Post will not be privatised.  It is not <Col N="919"/>this Bill that poses any threat to the future of An Post &mdash; it is the prevailing economic conditions and, more pertinently, the growth in electronic substitution.  I said in the other House that the only people who write letters nowadays are Deputies and that is about it.  It was a slight exaggeration, which is something that would not happen in this House.  There has been a decline of almost 20% in postal volumes since 2008.  That is the challenge facing An Post.  It will have to diversify into new products.  That is why we are in the circumstances we are in.</P>
        <P>I think I have done a rather good job, if I may rather immodestly say so.  When I inherited this Bill, the derogation was for seven years &mdash; it is now for 12 years.  I am providing that ComReg may extend it for a further period at the end of the 12-year period if it so wishes.  Given what has happened in the last three or four years, I venture to say it would be a brave Senator who would predict what the circumstances will be 12 years from now.  I am noticing the historical alignment of the grand old republican tradition that envisages Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in coming together again.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistent on this issue, but I assure Senator Daly that it will take me a little time to recover from finding Fianna F&aacute;il rowing in on an anti-privatisation ticket.</P>

	<P>I got a good belt of it from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v in the other House as well.  As long as Fianna F&aacute;il remains opposed to privatisation, I cannot see what the threat to An Post will be.  It appears that both sides of the House are <i>ad idem</i> on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am as astounded about the Minister&rsquo;s position on these issues, and that of his party, as the Minister is about Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s position on them.  His party has flipped on a range of issues in recent weeks and months.  It has been breathtaking.  I would like to return to the point the Minister made about the changing nature of An Post.  He was right to say people are writing fewer letters.  One of the fruits of the increased use of the Internet and e-mail is that people are ordering more items online.  People buy clothes, CDs, DVDs and other products from a host of websites.  The opportunity such activity presents to An Post negates much of the loss of business that has resulted from the decrease in traditional letter writing.  The Minister needs to show some vision by considering how he can support An Post to take advantage of that activity through parcel deliveries, etc.  The Minister should help the company to avail of the opportunities that present themselves as the market changes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is good enough to say the break-up or privatisation of An Post might happen simply because people are sending fewer letters.  We need to support An Post and make sure the opportunities are grasped.  We need to ensure it has the resources and abilities it needs to be capable of adapting its operations in a way that reflects the changing nature of the market.  My family buys much more on the Internet than it would have done in the past.  The changes happening every day are leading to opportunities for the future.  The Minister needs to reflect on that when he talks about An Post&rsquo;s possibilities.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 15, lines 33 and 34, to delete &ldquo;authority for the purposes of the Directive.&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;authority.  The Minister shall reserve the right to veto decisions of the Commission where it is deemed to be in the national interest.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="920"/>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is self-explanatory.  Given that any Minister, in almost all circumstances, would put the national interest before any decision of an outside body like ComReg, we are asking the Minister to take on board our proposal that &ldquo;the Minister shall reserve the right to veto decisions of the Commission where it is deemed to be in the national interest&rdquo;.  This amendment would ensure the interests of the market do not take precedence over the social value of the An Post service, or put that vital public service at risk.  We are returning to the previous discussion about the role of An Post.  It has a broad social role, rather than a purely economic role.  It is important for legislators and the Government to take on board the social aspects of what an organisation like An Post does in rural areas and all other areas.  We have spoken about the value of this public service and the contribution it makes.  The Opposition is keen to ensure the service is protected and not compromised by market value.  More important things than the market need to be considered when it comes to the provision of services to those who are most in need of them and depend on them.</P>
        <P>The spirit and principle of this amendment involve the indefinite protection of the postal service.  That is why we have tabled it.  We either have faith in politics or we do not.  We hope the Minister will take that on board.  Past regulation in other spheres has not been in the national interest.  It is important that services which are provided in the national interest continue to operate as such.  We can be proud of the postal service that has been consistently provided across this island.    Despite the fact that ComReg will be able to continue to regulate An Post for a further 12 to 20 years, as has been said, I have major worries about the future.  I am afraid that the door will be opened to a private company which will cherry-pick the services it wants to provide.  This Bill is all about the liberalisation of the postal service and, in the long term, its privatisation.  I raised similar fears with the Minister during an Adjournment debate on the ESB.  I said on that occasion that the Cahill report needs to be published and we are hoping for a response in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We believe the liberalisation and privatisation of the postal service would be a significant disadvantage to those who most need it, including those living in isolated areas who depend on such social contact.  If one examines the state of this country&rsquo;s transport and health services, one will find that peripheral areas suffered quickly when liberalisation took place.  I appreciate that the Minister has said he hopes to retain the universal nature of the service.  We cannot over-estimate the importance of the service provided over the years by An Post and its local offices.  I refer particularly to An Post&rsquo;s staff on the ground who visit people each day to deliver letters.  The service is of great importance to our communities.  That is why we are asking the Minister not only to retain the veto, but also to include it in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is right to say An Post has played an important social role in Irish life.  I accept and acknowledge that the role of the postman, in particular, is much valued in rural Ireland.  Some of the decisions I have taken in amending the Bill are designed to protect that role as best I can.  An Post is a commercial State company.  I had hoped Senator Quinn might be present as he was chairman of An Post at one stage.  I would say he has some interesting thoughts on An Post as it was then and as it is now.  As it is a commercial State company, it has to have regard to doing things efficiently and well.  I heard lots of stories in the D&aacute;il about the postman who buys messages and takes them home to the widow woman, or cycles up the hill to perform all kinds of roles &mdash; as a social worker and all the rest.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, in particular, took us &ldquo;up the airy mountain, down the rushy glen&rdquo; many times.  At the end of the day, the postman is neither a social a worker nor a shopper for the local community.  While this is not to say that a tradition valued in rural Ireland should not continue, An Post is a commercial entity and must survive in that environment.</P><Col N="921"/>
        <P>Some Senators do not accept my point about the directive and the role of the regulator in circumstances where a country&rsquo;s postal provider is still in state hands.  Under Article 22 of the directive, there must be a separation between the regulator and the Minister where ownership of the provider remains in State hands.  I have no freedom where the effective structural separation of regulatory functions is required by the directive.</P>
        <P>To be honest, we were unfair in the D&aacute;il and should not be unfair here to the role of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  It is not the purpose or role of the regulator to put the postal service in rural Ireland out of commission or to end it as we have known it.  Since coming into existence, not a single decision of the regulator has suggested it is minded to take such a view.  I must have regard to Article 22.  It is the overriding interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 16, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(4) The Commission will take into account the unique value that the postal service has in Ireland with regard to the substantial rural population and that particular care should be taken to ensure that the interests of the market will not take precedence over, or put at risk, this vital public service which is part of the fabric of communities and which provides a sense of national and social inclusion.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We have mentioned the importance of post offices in rural Ireland several times.  The past decade has seen considerable decline in those areas.  I can provide the Minister with examples of the many villages in County Waterford, such as Bunmahon, that have lost shops, post offices and numerous basic services.  This can create problems for villages, leading to them becoming ghost towns.  People are concerned about what the future of the post offices across the State will be if the Bill sees the light of day.</P>
        <P>Given the general decline in services across rural Ireland, this is not just a question of post offices.  For example, three-teacher schools face closure.  We are getting to the heart of what sustains and keeps many rural communities together.  The Minister is technically correct, in that postal workers are not employed to provide groceries or social care, yet they are a valuable social resource for many people in rural communities who do not have daily access to other people.  Due to a lack of public transport, someone may not see another person from one end of the week to the other.  People look forward to dropping down to their local post offices.  My grandparents lived in Bunmahon all of their lives, my grandmother until she was 96 years old and my grandfather until he was 99 years old.  I visited the village on holidays almost every year while I was growing up and I know the importance of the local post office.  We were sent down to get groceries, post letters to family members and so on.  When my grandparents were able to access the post office, it proved a vital service for them.</P>
        <P>I do not call into question the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides, as he sees merit in An Post being a service provider and the State continuing to play a role, but the European agenda evident in many directives puts market forces ahead of communities and individuals.  Since the Minister has criticised this approach for many years, he understands my point about the liberalisation ideology that is dominant in the EU and in many of its initiatives that concern An Post&rsquo;s future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sometimes, people must be put before market forces.  Underpinning many of the Minister&rsquo;s comments is the idea that An Post must be profitable.  While we all accept this, we must also accept that a price cannot be put on supporting rural villages and their inhabitants.  Sometimes, the price is the subsidisation of companies that provide services for rural communities.  The <Col N="922"/>Government should examine how to support the many villages that have suffered because of the Celtic tiger through the closure of shops, restaurants and public houses and have become ghost towns because they lack basic services.  Many people are concerned that, if we remove their one remaining service, the local post office, we will rip the heart out of communities.  I do not accept the Minister wants to do that, but it could come about if the Bill is passed and the liberalisation agenda continues.</P>
        <P>A different Minister could be in the Chamber in five years time.  I categorically state that it will not be a Minister in a Fianna F&aacute;il-Sinn F&eacute;in coalition Government, as the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, proposed.  He knows my position on how advantageous it would be for political parties such as his and mine to work together constructively instead of his party resurrecting Fine Gael every time it is in trouble.</P>

	<P>If the Minister worked with my political party, we would have an opportunity to guarantee the many elements on which we agree, including support for rural communities and protection for the weak and vulnerable and those who do not have access to necessary services.  If the Bill is passed and the path for An Post set by the previous Government is followed, many people living in rural communities will become even more isolated.  This is not what the Minister wants, but it could occur as a consequence of the Bill&rsquo;s passage.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Senator was laying it on with the trowel when he referred to three-teacher schools in rural Ireland closing.  I do not know too many three-teacher schools that are closing.   The demographics are healthy, in that the numbers are going the other way.  I should also take this opportunity to inform Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh that I will determine whether I can publish the Cahill report before he returns in the autumn.  He should keep an eye on the newspapers in August.</P>
        <P>The threat to the post office does not come from the Bill.  I agree with Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s remarks about the role played in rural Ireland by the post office but online postal services alone will not replace what An Post is losing in terms of revenue from conventional post.  Therefore, the post office must diversify.  For example, it has a unique infrastructure of retail outlets, at last count 1,343 post offices spread throughout the country.  Not too many organisations have this type of infrastructure.  Given that the banks are retrenching and do not want to provide over-the-counter services, there is a role for An Post.  It has made a start in this regard and its link with the National Treasury Management Agency has been positive.  It could play a larger role in the tailoring and provision of financial services to the average consumer.  This is probably the way of the future.</P>
        <P>Everything contained in the Bill, in particular the central tenet of retaining the universal service obligation, recognises the value of the postal service, which is at the heart of Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s amendment.  Its whole thrust is to show that we value that and we intend to protect it.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, back to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to be back in the Seanad for a second time today to present this Bill to the House.  As I am sure Senators know, the purpose of the Bill is to encourage the greater use of community service as an alternative sanction to imprisonment.  The Bill reflects the commitment set out in the national recovery plan to extend the use of community service orders by introducing a requirement on judges when considering the imposition of a sentence of 12 months or less, to consider first the alternative sanction of community service.</P>
        <P>Imprisonment &mdash; the deprivation of a person&rsquo;s liberty &mdash; is the most serious sanction available to the State in punishing a person convicted of a criminal offence.  It is rightly regarded as a sentence of last resort.  In the area of penal policy non-custodial or alternative sanctions are an essential part of the sentencing options available to a court when imposing a sanction on a convicted offender.  Many minor offences, while carrying potential sentences of imprisonment, <Col N="924"/>may not warrant a sentence of custody.  This is where non-custodial sentencing options form an essential part of the judicial discretion in sentencing.</P>
        <P>The most common non-custodial sanction used by the courts is the imposition of a fine.  Other alternative sanctions include suspended sentences, application of the Probation of Offenders Act, the imposition of a restriction on movement order, or the imposition of a community service order, on which we are focusing today.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Before addressing the Bill, I would, first, like to briefly outline the existing framework for community service.  As an alternative sanction to imprisonment, community service was first introduced under the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983, the provisions of which were first introduced in a Private Members&rsquo; Bill which I published as long ago as 1982.  Under that Act, a court may make a community service order in respect of an offender who is over the age of 16 years and has been convicted of a criminal offence for which a sentence of imprisonment would be appropriate.  A community service order requires an offender to perform unpaid work for between 40 and 240 hours.  There are a number of conditions which must be met before the making of an order.  A court may not apply a community service order unless satisfied, on the basis of an assessment report of a probation officer, that the offender is a suitable person for the purposes of such an order, that appropriate work is available and that the offender has consented to the order.</P>
        <P>Increasing the use of the community service scheme was one of the main recommendations of the value for money and policy review of the community service scheme which was published in October 2009.  As noted by the review, community service as an alternative sanction to custody achieves several goals benefiting the State, the community and the individual offender.  Community service delivers significant financial savings as it is a considerably cheaper sanction than imprisonment.  An analysis of the costs involved indicate that the comparative cost of a community service order is unlikely to exceed 34% of the alternative cost of imprisonment and may be estimated to be as low as 11% to 12%.</P>
        <P>Community service benefits offenders by diverting them from prison, allowing them to maintain ties with family, friends and community, including continuing in education or employment, as the case may be.  It also offers reparation to the community which benefits from the unpaid work of those serving these orders.  However, despite such benefits, the value for money and policy review identified a significant shortfall in the capacity utilisation of the community service scheme.  Nationwide, capacity utilisation was estimated at only 33%, although, as I will shortly outline, there has been an increase in the number of community service orders, particularly in the Dublin area, in the last year.  That low capacity utilisation, identified by the value for money review, was a reflection of the fact that a very small number of courts were responsible for the majority of community service orders made.  In 2006 only 29 courts, of 108 court venues, accounted for 80% of the total number of community service orders, while just 12 courts accounted for 60% of the orders for that year.  Notwithstanding the recent increase in the use of community service, it is a fact that a relatively small number of courts continue to be responsible for the majority of orders made.</P>
        <P>Today the probation service published its 2010 annual report, following its submission to Government.  The report highlights the prioritisation given to community service in 2010, in particular the development of a new model of community service which was piloted in the Dublin area, prior to extending it nationwide to all appropriate courts.  The model, based around a dedicated community service team with enhanced administrative support, was successful in producing a number of major benefits including more timely and efficient assessments, prompt starting of court orders, improved attendance at work sites and an increased number of orders made.  The annual report identifies that eight out of ten community service orders <Col N="925"/>were commenced within ten days of induction, that seven out of ten were completed within six months and that the greater focus in the Dublin pilot area saw an increase in community service orders of 34%.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the purpose of the Bill &mdash; to encourage greater use of community service orders &mdash; it is extremely encouraging to know that the probation service has in place the necessary structures and procedures which will support and manage the growth in usage.  I have mentioned the beneficiaries of community service &mdash; be it the offender or the Exchequer.  The positive impacts extend into our communities and I would like to outline some of those projects undertaken throughout the country.  In 2009, the community service graffiti removal project was piloted in south Dublin.  Using specialised equipment, it was successful in removing unsightly graffiti in local communities.  It delivered significant savings for communities and councils together with providing a positive and visible benefit for communities.  For the offenders, a sense of job satisfaction was experienced, particularly given the appreciation shown by the communities for the work done.  The positive impact on offenders manifested in consistent attendance, good performance and reductions in warnings.  In 2010, the project was extended to the Dublin City Council area, further rolled out to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown Council area and expanded in Cork.</P>
        <P>Community service has also proved useful in reacting to events in local areas.  In late 2009, following significant flooding in Athlone and Ballinalsoe, those engaged in community service assisted in the local response with flood relief and clean up work.  A significant number of community service projects involve environmental improvement programmes such as the graffiti removal, which I have mentioned, as well as picking up litter, gardening and other environmental improvements.  The positive social and community impacts of these projects mean the probation service actively pursues environmental work projects.  As well as working with local authorities, partnerships are formed with tidy towns groups and others.  Since 2007, the probation service has worked in association with Monaghan Tidy Towns to utilise persons on community service.  As a resource for local communities, the importance of community service should not be underestimated and every effort to extend its use should be encouraged.</P>
        <P>I have mentioned the lead role taken by the probation service in seeking to increase the number of persons that could potentially be placed on community service.  There continues to be scope, however, for greater use of community service.  As I stated at the outset, imprisonment is &mdash; and should be &mdash; a sentence of last resort.  This Bill is focused on those sentences of up to 12 months, recognising that there has been a significant increase in sentences of up to this period of time.  In 2009, 9,216 persons were committed to sentences of up to one year, representing 85% of committals that year.  As these sentences indicate, the offences involved are generally of a minor nature, 40% were for road traffic offences and I believe these offenders should be considered for community service.  I believe if the courts gave greater consideration to community service, without the necessity for this legislation, a great many people who have been sentenced to short terms of imprisonment could by now have undertaken such service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The primary purpose of this Bill is to introduce a requirement on the courts to consider first imposing a community service order as an alternative to custody in certain circumstances.  The proposed amendment provides that a court before which a person is convicted and in circumstances where a sentence of up to 12 months would be appropriate, shall consider, as an alternative to that sentence, the imposition of a community service order.  This requirement to consider imposing a community service order in such cases will be the primary new feature of the community service process.  However, the obligation introduced by this amendment is simply an obligation to consider making a community service order.  Whether the court proceeds to make an order is entirely a matter for the court.  It may be substantially influenced by the probation report that assists the court to make such a decision.  To impose any further obli<Col N="926"/>gation on the court would be an inappropriate interference with the judicial function.  The decision to impose a community service order will also remain dependent on the satisfaction of the conditions for the imposition of such an order as set out in the 1983 Act and to which I earlier referred.</P>
        <P>This is a relatively short Bill and I do not intend to outline its main provisions simply because I have essentially covered them in my speech.  Before concluding, I would like to address the impact of the Bill on prison capacity.  The motivation to deliver the proposals contained in the Bill is not to deliver prison spaces, although in the short term, it may well provide some benefit in this regard.  It is true that the number of committals for sentences of less than 12 months has increased in recent years.  In 2009 85% of the total number of sentenced prisoners committed to prison that year received sentences of up to 12 months.  According to monthly statistics the proportion of people in custody on a daily basis who are serving short sentences is around 15%.  The short nature of these sentences results in quick turnaround of such prisoners with little or no cumulative effect on prisoner numbers for the following year.  Increasing community service will not necessarily significantly impact available prison space.  This Bill is about diverting those persons receiving these relatively short sentences away from prison and making them subject to a sanction which benefits them and their communities.  Community service as an alternative sanction to imprisonment is not new.  Today, we are merely seeking to increase the use that is made of this sentencing option.</P>
        <P>This Bill is a further step in diverting persons from prison where it is appropriate to do so.  The Fines Act 2010 provided a balanced and more humane approach to the determination and collection of fines.  That Act also provides for alternatives to imprisonment, including community service, in the event of a failure to recover a fine or its value in seized goods.  It delivers a key commitment of the Government programme and is a step in our delivering a sentencing system that provides a safer society at a lower cost to the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>I again emphasise that the positive impact of community service is far-reaching &mdash; delivering at a national, community and individual level.  Financial benefits will accrue to the Exchequer from the significantly lower costs associated with community service as compared to imprisonment.  The community obtains a measure of reparation and the benefit of unpaid work.  Community service allows offenders to remain in work or education, to maintain links with family and community and to deliver reparation for the offence.  There are persons sentenced to short terms of imprisonment that could, and should, be subject to a community service order.  This Bill seeks to focus attention on and encourage greater use of this non-custodial sentencing option.  It has also been the experience that a significant number of persons, sentenced to short terms of imprisonment, subsequently reoffend and again are subjected to a custodial sentence.  It is my hope that greater use of community service orders will result in a different perception from some of these individuals and to some extent reduce the level of recidivism.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the Seanad sat late to take the Bill.  I am conscious that it was more than one year ago when as Opposition spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party I made a speech urging that we have such legislation.  My predecessor, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, former Deputy Dermot Ahern, announced some six weeks later the then Government&rsquo;s intention to publish legislation of this nature.  He published a measure of a similar nature, which applied only to persons whom a judge was considering sentencing to a period of up to six months.  I think it is appropriate that it apply to those who are being considered for sentences of up to 12 months.  I think it is correct that we seek to direct those engaged in minor offending, who up to now have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment, to make reparation to the community in the hope it will generate a different perception on their part of the consequence of their offending and redirect the manner in which they consider their behaviour <Col N="927"/><i>vis-&agrave;-vis,</i> the local communities in which they live or whom have been impacted upon by their criminal conduct.</P>
        <P>I hope the Bill will have the support of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill will have the support of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party because as the Minister acknowledged it is another Bill off the Fianna F&aacute;il shelf.  It is a good Bill and we want to see it passed as soon as possible.  The Bill makes it a requirement for judges to consider community service orders as an alternative to prison sentences for minor offences.  The previous Government, whom I supported, published an almost identical Bill earlier this year.  We believe that the greater use, and broad acceptance of community service orders will benefit the Prison Service, the Exchequer, the community that benefits from their work and the offender.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill is designed to increase these orders.  As we know, community service orders direct an offender to do unpaid work in the community for a period as an alternative to prison.  In my role as a local representative, I am often struck by the number of local bodies which express interest in taking on people on community service orders.  There is a demand for services to be provided in the community and this provides readily available personnel, some of whom may have skills which might be suitable.  It also saves that person from going to prison and the humiliation of that if it is not necessary.</P>
        <P>The Bill requires a judge to consider community service where the alternative sentence is imprisonment for 12 months or less.  I acknowledge the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill referred to offences with sentences of six months or less.  It is a matter of taste or judgment and I suppose 12 months is a better option because there was always a distinction in terms of the offences.  If one was imprisoned for longer than 12 months, the offence was considered to be more grave innature.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our Bill never reached Second Stage due to the dissolution of the D&aacute;il.  As that is nobody&rsquo;s fault but our own, I will not blame that on the current Government.  The intention was there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Blame the Green Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The Bill is practically identical to our one with the exception of the six months.</P>
        <P>This was put forward in the programme for Government and we support this aspect of it.  We support the Bill because it will encourage greater use of community service orders and will provide reparations to the community in the form of work for the community.  It will result in financial savings which are not to be underestimated because the Irish Prison Service and prisons are under severe pressure.  It will help the offender to maintain ties with his or her local area and will enhance public safety, although at times there will be legitimate concerns about some of the characters who will appear on these schemes.  Apart from the money saved on prisons, it will make our prisons a better place to be.</P>
        <P>This is part of a comprehensive approach to crime.  We talked about white collar crime earlier and how we are dealing with it in a very tough way and giving really tough investigative powers to our investigators and prosecutors.  Some might say this is going soft on crime but I do not believe it is.  It is part of a comprehensive approach to dealing with what some might describe as a crime epidemic.  It allows us to be smarter and more clever in the way we deal with crime and allocate punishment in society.  It also allows the punishment to be of benefit to the community.  We support the Bill and wish it safe passage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister.  If he continues to process Fianna F&aacute;il-inspired legislation in such a favourable fashion, I am sure we will make great progress.  I <Col N="928"/>appreciate that perhaps the genesis of the legislation came from the last Government, even though it was interesting that the Minister said &mdash; I am sure it was not self-praise &mdash; that back in 1982, he introduced the concept of community service by way of a Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  Much water has flowed under the bridge since.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If one looks at the statistics, it is fair to say that the concept of prisons and the Irish Prison Service has not been particularly successful.  There is a high level of reoffending and prison has become a university of crime for many offenders.  People imprisoned for relatively minor offences meet more hardened criminals in the system, come out of jail and commit more serious offences.  It would be helpful to try to break that cycle.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is this equation that the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Government are only doing a good job if they manage to provide more prison spaces, and we have had a debate on the Thornton Hall project.  I remember in the other House in the mid-1990s or so when consideration was being given to the building of a prison in Castlerea.  For 12 months or so, it appeared that the prison would not be built, perhaps because of Government finances.  It would probably only happen in Ireland but there was a protest march in the town of Castlerea in favour of the prison.  It could be said that there is a marching tradition in Roscommon.</P>
        <P>If one looks at the statistics &mdash; the Minister has done much work on this &mdash; one would have to recognise that prison has not been an appropriate remedy for every offender and the concept of community service is wise.  The Minister&rsquo;s decision, by way of this legislation, to try to extend community service will lead to very positive results.  If we can try to build on community service and, in particular, try to build a broader and better educational perspective into it, it could genuinely change people&rsquo;s opportunities, careers and lives.</P>
        <P>The work done by those on community service is valuable.  The situation in Athlone was instanced but we should aspire to ensure that every person who undertakes community service is very much linked into the educational system as well.  It is fair to say that many of these people come from disadvantaged and socially challenged backgrounds.  Many people sentenced for minor crimes would not have good educational qualifications and, in one sense, one could almost write their life story.  If one can intervene through education and try to ensure the community service involves a significant level of input from an educational perspective, that would certainly be very helpful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister mentioned prison accommodation, to which I referred.  We all appreciate there is an accommodation crisis and that many prisoners are being detained in conditions which are not appropriate to the Ireland of 2011.  The annual report of the Inspector of Prisons generally portrays a most unsatisfactory situation.  Those of us who have read the inspector&rsquo;s reports would have to recognise that progress must be made on prison accommodation.  However, we also appreciate that because of the state of the national finances, it will not be possible in the short to medium term to put in place the level of prison accommodation required.  In that regard, it is fair to say the Minister&rsquo;s efforts in expanding the community service programme will be beneficial on the accommodation side.  I appreciate it is not the primary intention of this Bill but if we manage to reduce the number of people being sentenced for short terms of imprisonment, it will be helpful.</P>
        <P>The Minister gave us an indication of the significant cost savings, which are welcome, but the main advantage of community service is that it genuinely gives an offender a second chance and keeps him or her out of the prison system and the crime university which many of the prisons are.  If the placement is appropriate, it will allow people to see that there is another route in life &mdash; a route of education, work and working within the community.</P><Col N="929"/>
        <P>I take the opportunity to commend the probation officers.  They are the unsung heroes of the broader justice system.  They work in difficult circumstances against long odds but they have a major impact in helping people to try to chart a way to a more positive future and away from a life of crime.  As with many people in the public sector, they do not always get the credit they deserve.  They certainly give value for money and whatever resources the probation service requires, we should try to match its needs.  Not only does it save money in the long run but it helps to transform the lives of young people, in particular.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Bill will be supported by everyone in the House, especially from the point of view of cost and the social benefits to be obtained and in the interests of trying to chart a brighter future and greater opportunities for offenders.  It pushes the right buttons in the context of young offenders, in particular.  I was interested in what the Minister had to say about the small number of courts or districts in which the community service option appeared to be used.  I am not an expert in the field, but I wonder if frequent meetings of those involved in the judicial sphere, at which the range of options available and the penalties that can be imposed are discussed, take place.  Is advice given on such matters or is each judge expected to operate on his or her own initiative?  It is rather unusual that the majority of community service orders are being handed down in a minority of courts.</P>
        <P>This is a matter on which work must be done.  From County Cork to County Donegal, there are many communities which would welcome the work that could be done in their localities on foot of community service orders being handed down.  Such work would be beneficial on several levels.  There is no country other than Ireland in which more community work and greater involvement are required and where more community projects could be initiated.  We have the opportunity, through the legislation before the House, to deal with a number of problems and put in place a decent, fair and progressive solution.</P>
        <P>It is 30 years since the Minister first brought proposals relating to this matter before the Oireachtas.  The Bill represents a significant step forward and I thank him for introducing it.  I look forward to its speedy enactment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  The Bill has the support of my party.  It is interesting that there is sometimes an unfair characterisation of the differences between those on the left in politics in Ireland and those on the right on the issue of prisons, how we deal with crime and sentencing and alternatives to imprisonment.  It is sometimes perceived to be the case that those on the right favour prison sentences and stricter sentencing, while those of us on the left are seen as advocating a different approach.  The Bill which contains good provisions provides an opportunity to engage in a wider and timely debate on sentencing and prison policies in general.</P>
        <P>I take the opportunity to do something I have not done since I was elected to the House, namely, commend the Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il in equal measure for their collective input into the Bill.  It is important that legislation of this nature have the support of all political parties in this and the Lower House.</P>
        <P>At at time when we are facing up to the reality of an already overcrowded prison system, when prison numbers, unfortunately, are continuing to increase, when the operational procedures and conditions within prisons are suited more towards punishment rather than rehabilitation and when many are of the opinion that we are not getting good value for money, it is important to debate the future of how we deal with the issue of crime.  The recent decision by the Minister to review the viability of the Thornton Hall project is to be welcomed.  I congratulate him on initiating the review.  It would be prudent if it formed part of a wider debate on future policy on sentencing and prisons.</P><Col N="930"/>
        <P>There must be a complete reorientation of the penal system away from prison and towards restorative justice in the community.  This is something which many political parties have advocated for a long period.  A number of pilot projects relating to restorative justice have been run in certain towns and cities.  Many of the joint policing committees across the State are exploring ways by which the concept of community restorative justice can be expanded and better implemented.  Community Restorative Justice Ireland which operates in the North works very well.  The Minister will be aware that the entire community restorative justice programme in the North was born out of a different scenario when the RUC was not seen as an acceptable police service.  However, the programme has, with the support of the PSNI and other agencies, become part of the mainstream.  The community restorative justice programme in the North represents a welcome step away from an approach to dealing with certain crime based exclusively within the criminal justice system.  Community restorative justice is often used in dealing with what might be termed lesser crimes.</P>
        <P>We should remove prison from centre stage and devise more imaginative, humane, compassionate and effective ways to deal with the petty offenders who form the majority of those sent to prison each year.  It is often reported in the media that people are sent to prison for very minor offences.  While it is necessary to have sanctions in place, it can be wrong to criminalise people at a very young age.  It is often the case that much of the anti-social behaviour that occurs in housing estates and communities throughout the State is engaged in by 14, 15 and 16 year olds.  In the majority of cases the community response is to seek to have the Garda to crack down on such behaviour and collect information on the activities of the young people involved which is then sent to the anti-social behaviour officers of local authorities.  The approach seems to be to collect as much information as possible on the young people to whom I refer in order that they might be dealt with under the criminal justice system.  While there is merit in doing this in respect of repeat offenders and in giving them every opportunity to cease their activities, the tendency among communities seems to be to begin at that point rather than to examine ways by which it might be possible to steer the young people concerned away from committing crimes.  Senator Paul Bradford referred to the cycle of disadvantage and fact that one could tell, from an early age, that members of certain families would choose a certain path in life.  How to break that cycle is a complex matter.  One of the most effective ways of proceeding in respect of those who may not have come onto the radar in the past, whose families might not have a history of violence or anti-social behaviour but who, for whatever reason, engage in anti-social acts is by considering alternatives to the criminal justice or prison systems.  Community restorative justice offers one option in this regard.</P>
        <P>During the past decade there has been a slow but progressive increase in the prison population.  There has also been a sharp increase in the average number of persons in custody on a daily basis.  This appears to indicate a slow increase in prison numbers exacerbated by an increase in the number of sentences handed down for minor offences.  Many do not end up in prison as a result of the overcrowding problem.</P>
        <P>Everyone accepts that those who commit crime must be held accountable for their actions.  As a result, the relevant sanctions must be in place and the threat of prison must be real.  There are those who must be sent to prison as a result of the nature of their crimes.  I am sure Members on all sides will agree that many young people have been criminalised, perhaps unnecessarily, and that there was a failure in the past to deal properly with the issue of community restorative justice.  We must learn from our mistakes and ensure we move forward with confidence and imagination and begin to do things somewhat differently.</P>
        <P>Members of the Judiciary are free to disregard community service orders as an alternative to imprisonment.  The Minister proposes to change this in the Bill by making it a requirement <Col N="931"/>that such orders be considered as an alternative.  I welcome the provisions proposed in this regard.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to delay proceedings because I am aware that other Senators may wish to contribute.  I commend the Minister for bringing forward the Bill.  I was initially reluctant to become my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on justice in the House.  If I had been aware of the sheer volume of work involved or the number of Bills the Minister proposed to introduce, I might, perhaps, have made a different choice.  I see more of the Minister these days than I do of my wife and family, which is worrying.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I must praise the Minister where it is merited.  While I have not supported all of the proposals he has brought before the House, he deserves to be commended for this proposal.  I am surprised by his support for some aspects of the Bill.  Perhaps there is sometimes an unfair characterisation of those on the political right.  If these provisions are anything to go by, there is a genuine political appetite for a different approach.  It is an approach which embraces community restorative justice as an alternative penal model, accepts that the use of the stick is not always the best approach and recognises that we must, as best we can, support those who are often themselves victims.  That is not an easy position to take when young people are causing difficulties in neighbourhoods.  Public representatives are at the coalface in their communities and subjected to strong public pressure.  Therefore, it is sometimes difficult for us to argue that we should consider different models, offer support to these individuals and their families and not always look on prison as the best option.  I commend the Minister for his departure from past policy on this issue.  I am not claiming he has changed his own position, but I welcome the departure from what has been a tendency to deal with these issues solely within the prison context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, although I do so with trepidation, given his indication that he intends to be here more often in the autumn.  As Senator David Cullinane observed, those of us who took on the justice brief will be looking forward to an increased workload and an even greater degree of contact with the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Bill before us has deservedly received an unqualified welcome from all sides of the House.  The Minister outlined the background to the proposals which will apply to any conviction attracting a prison sentence of up to 12 months.  This sensible approach marks a departure from the policies of some previous Administrations whose &ldquo;get tough on crime&rdquo; approach seemed merely to involve throwing more prison places at the problem without examining the underlying causes of crime and without having regard to alternatives or the purpose of imprisonment.</P>
        <P>On any given day there is a much smaller number of inmates in the prison system compared with the numbers being committed to prison every year.  The Minister indicated that in 2009, 9,216 persons were given sentences of up to one year &mdash; representing 85% of all committals &mdash; yet the proportion in custody on a daily basis serving short sentences was only some 15%.  This anomaly has been described by a leading Irish criminologist, Dr. Paul O&rsquo;Mahony, as a paradox of the prison system in Ireland.  It arises because we have so many offenders serving short sentences, generally for minor, non-violent offences.  There is a question as to what purpose this serves.</P>
        <P>Dr. O&rsquo;Mahony&rsquo;s research shows that prisoners in Mountjoy Prison have, on average, received ten previous custodial sentences, with many undergoing their first period of detention in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, to which Senator Paul Bradford referred as a &ldquo;university of crime&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, it has had a negative effect on many inmates and its closure is long overdue.  This <Col N="932"/>was Labour Party policy prior to the general election and its inclusion in the programme for Government is welcome.  When is that envisaged to happen?  I understand the programme for Government indicated it would take place immediately or as soon as possible.  All the international reports on places of detention in Ireland have recommended its closure for many reasons to do with the conditions in it.  Another important argument in favour of its closure is that it features in the history of so many prisoners where it seems to serve as the beginning of a cycle of recidivist offending and successive short terms of imprisonment.</P>
        <P>I have been a regular visitor to Mountjoy and other prisons in my capacity as a lecturer and criminal lawyer.  It is vital that public representatives visit prisons, particularly Mountjoy Prison in which the conditions are appalling.  It is worth seeing the cells and the conditions in which inmates are living.  There is very little by way of rehabilitation on offer to prisoners in Mountjoy or other prisons throughout the State.  The Connect rehabilitation programme which was in place for a period but has since been discontinued showed very positive outcomes for individual prisoners.  It worked at a level with prisoners who had difficulties with literacy, anger management, parenting skills and so on.  It operated at a different level from the education courses run by the Open University and so on, for which prisoners require a basic level of literacy.  Despite the financial crisis, the Minister should consider the provision of funding for some type of rehabilitation project within the prison system.  However, it is difficult to engage in that type of rehabilitation where prisoners are committed for short sentences, in which case alternatives to imprisonment are infinitely preferable.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reference to imprisonment as a sanction of last resort.  In January, just before the general election, my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, and I published a document on penal reform which proposed that this notion of prison as a sanction of last resort should be the guiding principle of penal policy.  We observed that the prison population had almost doubled in a decade, with an annual rate of increase of 10%.  We pointed to the cost of providing a prison space in Ireland &mdash; &euro;79,000 per annum in 2009, according to the Irish Prison Service &mdash; giving the State one of the most expensive prison systems in the world.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, has indicated that the cost of community service orders is in the order of 10% to 30% of the cost of a prison sentence.  According to our calculations, the average cost of a three-month prison sentence is &euro;18,000, while the average three-month community service order costs &euro;4,000.  Therefore, from a cost perspective, as well as from the point of view of engaging in the rehabilitation of individuals, community service orders are a better approach in dealing with minor, non-violent offences.</P>
        <P>The latest report of the UN Committee against Torture which was highly critical of some aspects of Irish penal policy recommended that a policy be adopted focusing on the development of alterative non-custodial sanctions, including the enactment of legislation providing that judges be required to consider community service as an alternative to custody.  The proposals before us are very much in line with the committee&rsquo;s recommendations.  Its recommendations on prison conditions include a proposal that the State eliminate, without delay, the practice of slopping out, a practice about which the Inspector of Prisons has been highly critical in a series of reports, as was his predecessor.  In December 2010, in response to a parliamentary question, the previous Minister indicated that 1,003 prisoners out of a total of 43,197 were required to slop out every day.  These prisoners have no access to in-cell sanitation and must eat in close proximity to their chamber pot.  Moreover, many prisoners are sharing a cell owing to overcrowding in the prison system.  It is an inhumane practice which should no longer be tolerated in any Irish prison.</P><Col N="933"/>
        <P>We have had useful debates in this House on the prison system and I hope they will inform the Minister&rsquo;s policy.  We spoke earlier about class and crime.  The majority of prisoners come from disadvantaged backgrounds and many have mental health difficulties, a huge issue which deserves greater investigation.  The issue was highlighted by the appalling murder of Gary Douche which the joint shadow report to the UN Committee against Torture went into in detail.  I am grateful to the Irish Penal Reform Trust and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties for its excellent report to the United Nations which outlined many of the problems within the penal system and elsewhere.  For a long time there has been a link between disadvantage and crime.  Research published in Trinity College Dublin in 1988, entitled Crime and Poverty in Ireland, was the first scientific attempts to examine this.  It used data from community health sources on disadvantage and coupled it with District Court records in the Dublin metropolitan district.  We found the vast majority of defendants before the District Court were from disadvantaged backgrounds and from the most disadvantaged or deprived areas in Dublin.  Even when controlling for the same offence, they were more likely to go to prison than persons from less disadvantaged backgrounds.  There are questions about the links between crime and disadvantage and crime and poverty.</P>
        <P>There are also questions about overuse of imprisonment and inconsistencies within our sentencing system.  The Minister talked about the uneven pattern of community service orders across the country and this is something the Bill will address.  There is excellent research by David Riordan in UCC on how community service orders are enforced across Ireland.  There is an uneven imposition.</P>
        <P>This Bill is welcome because it will reform the practice of imposing community service orders and will ensure, to a much greater extent, that imprisonment is genuinely a sanction of last resort.  As an indirect byproduct, it will address serious problems of overcrowding and prison conditions.  Ultimately, it is part of a more enlightened and more humane penal policy.  I hope some of the forthcoming legislation in the autumn will also be in line with this policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I welcome the Minister and the Bill.  In any debate on prisons, I think of the line from the film &ldquo;The Shawshank Redemption&rdquo;, where the governor of the prisoner stated that all the public wanted when it came to spending on prisons was more guards, more fences and higher walls.  At a time of extreme pressure on the public finances, it is interesting to consider the major issue of prison costs.  Prison is extremely expensive and the cost of a community service order is about 15% of a prison sentence.  The average community service order costs approximately &euro;4,000 compared with &euro;27,000 for a prison sentence.  It seems the Minister is motivated by good economic sense as well as good human sense and the two motivations dovetail.  This measure makes financial sense and in terms of human dignity and a proper approach to the reform of offenders and creating a more harmonious society we must examine prison as a last resort.</P>
        <P>Much has been said about the disconnect between the 85% of those receiving sentences of up to 12 months but when one considers the population serving sentences, only 15% are serving short sentences.  The Minister is correct to warn us off thinking this might be a panacea for the problem of overcrowding in prisons.  There has not been a tradition of a large prison population in this country, unlike the absurd situation in the United States where the prison population approaches 2.5 million people or 1% of the population.  We do have an issue in that our prison population has been rising and has doubled over the past decade.  Initiatives such as the Fines Act, which most people welcomed as a more balanced and humane approach in the determination and collection of fines, recognising that alternatives to imprisonment including community service were appropriate in the event of a failure to recover a fine or its value in seized goods.  It was ridiculous to think about putting people into prison for non-payment of fines, <Col N="934"/>especially when one considers the reality that those who do not pay fines are often those on lower incomes.  I welcome any Bill that builds on the approach that prison should be a last resort.  The idea that society will be made safer by putting more and more people into prison defies logic.</P>
        <P>As a society, we must scrutinise our motivation for putting individuals in prison.  Do we have a criminal justice system designed to punish or rehabilitate?  One can consider four functions of prison &mdash; to punish, to prevent crime for a temporary period while one is in prison, to deter others and to rehabilitate and reform people without losing faith in the capacity of society to change people for the better.  Generally, changing people starts with showing them respect.  That is why it is still relevant for us to consider the practice of slopping out, not just as some airy fairy human rights or civil rights concern but for the message it sends out when we treat people in this way and dehumanise people in our prison system.  How can we possibly be surprised that they do not emerge reformed and with a more healthy view of their place in society?  We must look seriously at the cause of rehabilitation.  It is not just a soft, liberal, brainless cause and it is for people of right, left and centre.</P>
        <P>If a person has committed a serious crime and represents a danger to others, it is right and just that they are incarcerated but when the court is of the opinion that the danger does not exist, a more creative approach is warranted.  We legislate to create effective deterrents to certain behaviours, as seen in the Criminal Justice Bill dealing with white collar crime today.  We must focus on the fact that, particularly for young people on short sentences, prisons are universities of crime.  People go in for relatively minor offences and come out affected by drugs and having learned the tricks of the trade from more hardened people in prison.  While the Minister did not refer to that in his speech, it is in the background when we consider the need to get away from prison as the primary model.  Any measure to avoid jailing individuals for comparatively minor offences at the discretion of the court is to be welcomed when set against the negative cost implications for incarceration in addition to the problems arising from drugs and the example people acquire during their time in prison.</P>
        <P>I have some suggestions relating to the projects undertaken by those with community service orders.  The Minister referred to a community service graffiti removal project.  He referred to south County Dublin rather than Dublin South because he did not want to give the impression that people on community service orders were taking down the Minister&rsquo;s election posters.  That is one instance of the significant number of community service projects involving environmental improvement programmes, such as graffiti removal, picking up litter and gardening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am tempted to say that the use of a mobile phone in the Parliament should be something that attracts a sanction such as a community service order from the relevant body but I will desist.  A greater sense of job satisfaction can be developed when something more than mere physical labour is involved and the Minister may consider an example from Britain, the Family Action in Rogerfield and Easterhouse, FARE, project in Glasgow.  In 1987, a few residents of Easterhouse, a socio-economically deprived area six miles east of Glasgow, took over an abandoned shop as a club for unemployed youngsters.  Over the following 21 years the scheme has relocated three times and built an increasingly secure and substantial funding stream.  Rather than asking offenders to paint walls and clean rubbish, is it better to invite them to invest their time in aiding community projects in a more meaningful and long-term manner that forms links with society and creates a sense of inclusion and emotional investment in the community in which they live?  I am aware that such involvement may not be suitable for all offenders but it should be considered.  The Minister mentioned partnerships formed with tidy towns groups and the partnership between the Probation Service and the Monaghan Tidy Towns committee to utilise persons in community services is a good example of what is possible.  This will require <Col N="935"/>resources and engagement with skilled personnel but it is the way to go.  If we are to honour human dignity, it cannot be a matter of keeping them out of prison by putting them doing some work.  Proper engagement with individuals&rsquo; needs and attitudes requires us to take an approach that examines their God-given gifts and see if there is some way they can be deployed.  That puts us on the road to reforming people because people sense they are being respected when someone is trying to identify their gifts and talents and use them.  It brings people more satisfaction.</P>
        
      
        <P Just="Left">In that context, I commend the comments of Senator Cullinane on restorative justice. I am aware there have been some projects in this area but it is an area that needs exploration.  Restorative justice, over and above community service, brings the person, where possible, into contact with those who have suffered as a result of their actions.  That puts one firmly on the road to rehabilitation.</P>
        <P>In returning to the fair project I mentioned the approach used in Scotland.  It is one in which voluntary bodies and volunteers have greater control over services and the individuals assigned to help out.  That approach, which seeks to support local community groups and valuable projects, merits greater consideration.  It is key to involve the community in any such partnership with the Probation Service.  We will get greater buy-in, and that will lead to more successful outcomes.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P Just="Left">I was intrigued by what the Minister said - I may have missed it in his off-script comments - about the low capacity utilisation identified by the value for money review.  If I am correct he stated that 33% of the potential for community service is taken up and he made the point that this comes from the fact that a very small number of courts are responsible for the majority of orders made.  The Minister gave various statistics indicating that approximately 29 out of 108 courts appointed accounted for about 80% of the total number of community service orders.  What is going wrong in that regard?  Is it that particular judges are reluctant to take it on?  Does that stem from right-wing views on community service in that they believe they should all be incarcerated and punished or is it that there is not a tradition of using it in that particular area?  I would welcome some clarity on that because the Minister introduced some stark statistics in that regard and they require some background from which we would all benefit and for which we would all be grateful.</P>
         <P Just="Left">Any programme we develop must tackle the major issues in the most socially deprived and disadvantaged areas in the country.  One of the characteristics of such areas is the lack of buy-in by the population into the society in which they live.  In large measure, people who do not feel part of the mainstream of Irish society believe they are always at a disadvantage and even though the State often invests an enormous amount of resources in those areas, the reality is often that everything is decided for the population, and the people have very little input into decisions such as the design of houses and estates and the provision of community facilities and services. If we are interested in reducing crime we would be better engaged in looking at the social phenomena behind the crime rather than thinking that by simply locking people up we will achieve results.  I hope that future community services projects will take creative approaches to involving offenders in the community in a meaningful way.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">I again congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill.  I hope it will yield positive fruit in terms of helping to reduce the amount of reoffending.  He mentioned that a significant number of people given short sentences subsequently reoffend. Therefore, it is clear he is trying to achieve many laudable objectives in terms of reducing the expenditure, the high expense dimension of prison.  He is seeking to take people out of the university of crime. I hope and believe he is also trying to honour human dignity in recognising that there is a category of people in our society whom prison does not serve well in terms of maximising their ability to <Col N="936"/>be reformed and to become more productive and positive members of society.  On that basis I commend the Bill to the House and thank the Minister for bringing it forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for bringing forward this legislation.  Many of the issues I wanted to raise have been mentioned but I will refer to one or two issues, one of which concerns my experience of dealing with young people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many years ago I had the privilege of being invited onto a committee on the north side of Cork city which was deciding what to do about the problem of young people dropping out of school.  Those young people were going down the criminal road where eventually they would end up in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and then prison in the long term.  One of the actions taken involved working with the local garda&iacute; and the setting up a retraining facility where we would have 50 people retraining at any one time, all of whom had dropped out of school.  That comes back to what Senator Cullinane said about taking action at an earlier stage.</P>
        <P>It was interesting that the large number of people we had retraining had major problems with literacy and numeracy.  We gave them a choice of courses to take up and in order to get them used to the idea of turning up every morning, each was given a clock-in card.  They had to clock in every morning and if they did not clock in on time, the allowance given to them at the end of the week was reduced accordingly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of years later we decided to research those people who had passed through the facility and it was interesting to find that the vast majority of them were in full-time work and had not become involved in crime.  That research work was done by a former member of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party who was brought on board to do it.  It gave us a clear indication that by working together we could steer people in the right direction rather than adopting the attitude of allowing the problem continue without taking decisive action.  We could get them back into the education system and give them a skill to allow them move on to jobs.  In addition to providing training we also got them out into the workplace, initially for two weeks at a time, and then brought them back into the training facility.  At a later stage we sent them back into the workplace for four weeks and eventually got them into full-time employment.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill because the community service area is the way forward.  Unfortunately, once people are sent to prison or to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution it takes them a long time to come out of those institutions.  The Bill is welcome in that regard.</P>
        <P>As someone who has practised in the District Court from time to time, although my role in the District Court was of a minor nature in that criminal law would not have been my main area, I was surprised by the small number of courts that use the community service order.  I welcome the provision in section 3, paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), which puts the obligation on the District Court judge to consider the proposition of the community service order where the sentence is likely to be 12 months or less.  If the sentence is more than 12 months the judge has the option of considering it also.  It is a welcome development and something that is long overdue.</P>
        <P>We must also consider how we can assist those in the prison system in terms of not getting involved in the crime scene soon after leaving prison.  In the mid-1990s there was a project in Cork where 20 people in prison were taken on an education programme while their partners, who were not in prison, joined an education programme of a different nature.  It was an attempt to get the message across about involving people in the education system.  It was interesting that of the 20 who did the programme, 12 went back to full-time education when they left prison.  In terms of the prison system we must encourage people and tell them there is a <Col N="937"/>different road available when they leave prison.  We must do everything possible to give them every opportunity to take that right road.</P>
        <P>Regarding the District Court and other courts, we must get the message across that many people who end up in the criminal system do not want to be in it and would do everything possible to get out of it but looking at the figures on the use of the community service order in the past, I am not sure whether our justice system is getting that message.  We must do everything possible in that regard.  We will be in government for the next five years and it is important that, by the end of that period, there will be a different attitude to dealing with this matter.  The prison population has continued to grow.</P>
        <P>My concern over the implementation of the legislation is based on the number of people who leave prison a long time before they have served their full sentences.  I understand allowances are made because of overcrowding in prisons.  Where offenders are given an option of six months in prison or completing a community service order, they realise they may be released within a short period if they choose prison and that they must make a greater commitment if they choose the order.  It is important that those who are sentenced to six or 12 months in prison on refusing a community service order serve their sentences in full.  While remission for good behaviour should continue, no prisoner should be released earlier than this would allow.  If they are released too early, the concept of community service orders falls asunder.  The legislation is welcome and deserves the full support of the House.  I am delighted that all groups and parties in the House are supporting it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is well worth spending money to make further resources available to the Probation Service.  Imprisonment has not worked and will not work and we should try to do everything possible to ensure the alternatives available through community service orders are chosen.  I thank the Minister for introducing this legislation.  I hope it will be implemented at a very early date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I very much welcome the legislation, which Members strongly support and wish to see implemented at the earliest opportunity.  We are all very much aware of the ludicrous circumstances in which young people who are given custodial sentences by the District Court of three, six or nine months &mdash; it is very often the same offenders week after week &mdash; are released onto the streets a few days later.  I was made aware of circumstances last week in which a young person sentenced to six months in Castlerea was asked the day after being sentenced if he could organise transport home.  He stated he had no way of getting back to Ballinasloe and I understand he was put on a train to Athlone, from where a taxi took him to Ballinasloe, at an enormous cost to the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill, if it achieves nothing else, will certainly save the State money.  It is progressive.  We want to divert offenders away from prison such that they will retain ties with family, friends and community through community service.  This benefits the community.  I very much welcome the fact that the Minister referred very positively to the fine work done during the bad flooding in Ballinasloe in 2009 by young offenders who were being rehabilitated at a local centre in the town.</P>
        <P>I invite the Minister to attend, in the coming weeks, the opening of Canal House, a fine facility in Ballinasloe that is doing amazing work with young offenders.  It has a very high success rate in ensuring young people do not reoffend.  The project involves a partnership between the Probation Service, the Department of Justice and Equality and the VEC.  Young people are being educated and, in many cases, given second-chance education.  They are also trained in skills in which they have a particular interest and they are treated extremely well.  Many of the young offenders come from seriously disadvantaged backgrounds.  In very many <Col N="938"/>cases, the education system has failed them badly.  They just did not fit in at the local secondary school.  They may have emerged from primary school with very poor literacy skills and certainly could not hack it in mainstream secondary schools.  Centres such as Canal House and Youthreach facilities are certainly giving the young people concerned a second opportunity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Minister for this legislation.  As the Judiciary is encouraged to implement it and use community service orders much more frequently than has been the case, there will be an enormous benefit for the community.  We must convince local communities that this legislation is the way to proceed.</P>
        <P>I agree with previous speakers who said many young offenders who serve custodial sentences later turn out to be much more serious offenders.  We could succeed if we issued community service orders to keep offenders in their communities and ensure they are involved in meaningful projects, such as the one in South County Dublin or the many fine community projects in every town and village.  The supervision of the schemes will be a key factor, as will attendance by those subject to the community service orders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The legislation presents a way forward and I commend the Minister for bringing it to fruition.  It is encouraging that all Members of the Seanad support it.  I commend the previous Minister for the work he did on framing it.  All of us involved in communities realise there is good in every young person provided he is given a fair chance.  All public representatives want to ensure young people who step out of line once or twice are given every opportunity and a chance to obtain an education and training.  I hope we will have a better and safer society as a result.  I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill to the House.  I am more than happy to support it.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank all the Senators who spoke.  It is a short but important Bill and support therefor is welcome.  I join those who praised the Probation Service.  A substantial amount of very good work is done by the service, which gets very little public acclaim for it.  Last autumn, prior to my coming into government, I had meetings with the head of the Probation Service to explore this issue and to ensure there was capacity within the service to extend the use of community service orders.  I was assured there was such capacity.</P>
        <P>Some Senators commented on the statistical information I gave regarding the courts.  All I can say about this is that it seems some judges are utilising the community service order scheme to a far greater extent than others.  At the end of the day, judges have discretion with regard to sentencing.  They have a constitutional right to exercise their discretion but the intent of the Bill is to ensure that before any judge considering imposing a sentence of less than 12 months does so, he or she first considers the appropriateness of community service.  To consider the appropriateness of community service, it will be necessary to ascertain whether the convicted person is willing to undertake such service and, more often than not, to have a report from the Probation Service.  I hope that where the probation service sets out that the individual concerned is appropriate for community service the community service option will be preferred over the imprisonment option unless the background circumstances of a conviction indicate that for the protection of the community the nature of the offence warrants a prison sentence.</P>
        <P>It is important to look at statistics in this regard.  When I came into office I had considerable concern that there had been an inadequate approach by previous Governments in addressing the shortage of prison spaces and ensuring that the integrity of our criminal justice system and the administration of justice was upheld.  I had particular concern about the number of prisoners on temporary release.  Some prisoners are on temporary release for very good reasons, and we <Col N="939"/>will always have some prisoners on temporary release, but there is a cohort of prisoners who are on temporary release, to whom Senator Mullins referred a few moments ago, for no reason other than a shortage of prison spaces.</P>
       <P>A particularly interesting statistic for Members of the House are the numbers on Friday, 22 July, when I looked at where we stood.  On that date, a total of 5,479 prisoners were in the system.  This does not mean they were in jail, it means they were in the system and prospectively should have been in prison.  The number on temporary release due to cell incapacity was 612.  These are not individuals who were entitled to remission; these are individuals who were released for no reason other than that we have a serious shortage of prison spaces.  As of 22 July 2011 we had what is known as &ldquo;bed capacity&rdquo; in our prisons of 4,510.  This means the entire prison infrastructure was able to provide sleeping accommodation for 4,510.  This is within a cell structure that, based on the perception of the Inspector of Prisons, should house less than 4,000 prisoners.  In some instances, there were two prisoners to a cell designed for only one prisoner and, in some instances, there were three to a cell.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have a problem in that our prisons are not capable of accommodating the number of prisoners who are being sentenced to prison terms.  There will be some change in this.  Additional places will become available in the not too distant future, for example in the Midlands prison.  We need to ensure that where people are sentenced to terms of imprisonment they truly serve those terms of imprisonment and that we do not have the type of situation described by Senator Mullins whereby someone spends a day or two in prison and then is simply released.  They are released usually because there is a perception by the prison governor that they do not pose a threat to the community and there is a need to create an extra space for another sentenced person for whom a period in prison is necessary in the public interest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am concerned that if those 612 individuals, to whom I referred as being on temporary release without reaching remission, had been sentenced to community service instead of a prison term, they would have not occupied a cell which would have been saving to the taxpayer; they would have paid back the community for the offence they committed at far less cost to the community and to its benefit; and we would be upholding the integrity of the criminal justice system.  It is very important that the Judiciary in exercising its sentencing discretion understands the limits of the capacities in our prisons and understands the alternative options that are available to imprisonment and utilises them in the interests of the community and in the interests of ensuring the integrity of the criminal justice system is upheld.</P>
        <P>I was interested in the contributions made by a number of Senators who spoke about the alternatives to imprisonment. There is a whole range of alternatives which we should use, some of which have started to be used and others are very much at an experimental stage.  A great deal more can be done in the area of restorative justice.  I am looking at developments of this nature in the Department.  There were some pilot schemes in this area and its usage could be greatly expanded.  There is the possibility of using a form of sentencing for certain types of prisoners that is used elsewhere, whereby the sentence is in effect that they are confined to their homes at night and there is electronic monitoring to ensure they comply with this.  If they are in employment or education it allows them to continue.</P>
        <P>I am also looking at another method of using the community service scheme where we have prisoners held in prison for some years who are of good behaviour and pose no threat to the community but have not yet reached the stage where based on the period of remission they are entitled to release.  We are looking at a pilot scheme of releasing some of these prisoners, subject to the condition and on agreement that they would do community service.  This evening, we have been speaking about community service as an alternative to imprisonment.  There may <Col N="940"/>be a role community service can play with regard to facilitating the release from prison of some individuals who pose no threat to a community and whose contribution by way of community service would be to the greater good of the community than their remaining in prison and, engaging in community service may be of benefit to them in refocusing them in the context of their release.</P>
        <P>I regret that Senator Cullinane has departed.  I appreciate that it has been a long day.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;although it is a good idea when one is walking to know whether one is walking to the left or right.  I am taken by people who are hung up on old-fashioned political caricatures and ideologies.  From my perspective, I always regarded Sinn F&eacute;in as significantly to the right in the context of some of the activities in which it engaged.  In the context of some of the political stances it still takes to this day I regard it as significantly to the right of politics in an international sense as well as in a domestic sense.  In the context of dealing with issues of this nature, what we need is to have a coherent and consistent approach to sentencing policy to deal with those who are convicted offenders and to approach matters on the basis of looking at all the various options available in the interests of the community, reducing the level of recidivism, and ensuring in so far as anyone can that those who leave prison have perhaps some opportunity of leading a life that does not involve re-offending.  It is my intention as we develop our criminal justice system that we take very substantial steps along this route.</P>
        <P>I was interested in Senator Mullins&rsquo;s reference to the project in Glasgow.  I have the view that we need to look at various types of community service and how we might facilitate people who have left prison getting employment experience as opposed to simply engaging in environmental works, and it could be interesting to give some consideration to the type of projects taking place in Glasgow.  It is a very interesting suggestion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take what Senator Colm Burke said extremely seriously.  One of the defects in our prison system is that because of the overcrowding and limited facilities we still do not provide sufficient education opportunities for people in our prisons, many of whom come from deprived communities and have limited education and basic literacy difficulties.  If they are going to have a real opportunity in life, these are issues we need to address.  As one Senator mentioned, although he was not supporting it, it is not about locking people up for a period, throwing away the key and then releasing them and expecting their world to change.  One of the difficulties is when those sentenced to terms of imprisonment have lived in deprived communities, or in communities, for example, where crime right be rife or there might be gangs, are released, they all too frequently find themselves back in the same environment and have little chance of getting away from a life of reoffending and imprisonment.  These are all issues to which we need to give careful consideration in the public interest and in the context of how we do things differently.</P><Col N="941"/>
        <P>I do not want to make exaggerated claims regarding this short Bill which I hope is a smart Bill.  I also hope, when enacted, it will be applied by the Judiciary in a manner that ensures if we review matters in a year, there will have been a substantial increase in the use of community service orders and those sentenced to imprisonment deserve to serve such terms.  There is not an awful lot to be gained by sentencing people to three or four weeks in prison and much more would be gained by sentencing such individuals to community service to the benefit of the community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Members for their contributions and support for the Bill.  Members of both Houses had constructive suggestions to make and I am optimistic about the changes we can make to the manner in which we deal with offenders on a basis that will receive support from all sides of both Houses and which will allow us, I hope, to look back in two or three years and say real change and a real change has been effected in the manner in which we deal with criminal justice issues.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline the process being utilised to ensure adequate accommodation in schools at primary and post-primary level in all parts of the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The forward planning section of the Department of Education and Skills has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels in the coming years.  School accommodation requirements throughout the country have been considered as part of this detailed study and the Department is considering options to meet the deficit of accommodation identified in areas of particular need as a top priority.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Turning to the specific query referred to by the Senator regarding the gaelscoil in Oranmore, County Galway, I can confirm that, following discussions with Galway County Council, a suitable site has been identified for this school and it is proposed to acquire this site for the purposes of developing a new school building.  However, the acquisition of this site is subject to outline planning permission being granted.  The Department lodged an application for outline planning permission with the local authority on 4 July.  The planning authority has eight weeks from that date to make its decision on the application.  The planning application included the results of a number of reports and studies regarding the site such as topographical surveys, a traffic management study and environmental surveys, including ecological, hydrological and visual impact assessment reports.  Pending the outcome of the planning process and the acquisition of the site, the progression of the accompanying building project will then be considered in the context of the capital budget available to the Department for school buildings generally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current position on the other gaelscoil is that the school authority submitted an application for large scale capital funding for an extension and refurbishment project.  The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band 2.2 rating.  Documents explaining the band rating system are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  Information in respect of the current school building programme, along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including this project, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The project criteria for a band 2.2 project are as follows: there is a deficit of mainstream accommodation; the deficit constitutes a substantial and significant proportion of the school&rsquo;s overall accommodation needs; and the condition of the existing accommodation is adequate.  For a 2.1 band rating to be applied to a project, the project would have to meet these criteria and, in addition, an extensive refurbishment of the existing accommodation would be required.  In the case of the gaelscoil in Loughrea, County Galway, the school&rsquo;s existing accommodation is in adequate condition but there is a deficit of accommodation and, therefore, a band 2.2 rating is the most appropriate.  It is open to the school authority to supply further information to the Department in support of its application, if it wishes to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All large-scale building projects, including this project, are progressed in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme and the available financial resources.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the <Col N="943"/>project at this time.  I again thank the Senator for the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position on both gaelscoileanna.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While I was not anxious to bring this social welfare case before the House, I have exhausted every available avenue to deal with a young lady&rsquo;s social welfare entitlement.  She is an Irish citizen who took up employment in the UK.  She had a young family and, as she was no longer able to work in the UK, she returned home in 2010.  She applied for what she felt was her social welfare entitlement, such as child benefit and family income supplement, even though she had links with the UK but was caught by the habitual residence clause, unfairly so.  Her children are being deprived of their social welfare entitlements also.  I know of similar cases where the social welfare entitlements were approved.</P>
        <P>The young lady in question has appealed the decision.  Will the Minister for Social Protection have this matter properly investigated even while the appeal is being heard by the Department?  The young lady has furnished all the relevant information and documents, including a P45 from the UK to show she left employment there.</P>
        <P>While her appeal is being heard, the Department has refused to give her an exceptional needs payment.  The appeals system is clogged up.  In 2007, some 14,000 appeals were made while this year the figure stands at 35,000.  An appeal takes between six and eight months to process.  I have spoken to the departmental staff involved who have been as helpful as they can be.  Due to the constraints they are under from a national level, they are still unable to pay out the exceptional needs payment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The young lady in question and her family are at breaking point.  She is expected to live on nothing.  Every time I speak to her she breaks down in tears because she cannot provide for <Col N="944"/>her children, while others who may not be Irish citizens are obtaining supplementary welfare allowance or the exceptional needs payment.</P>
        <P>This is a genuine case but because of the bureaucracy in the system the young lady in question is denied her right of an exceptional needs payment while her appeal is processed.  I hope some flexibility will be given to the local community welfare officers to pay out the exceptional needs payment for this lady while the appeal is being decided.  If that cannot be done, the appeal should be decided upon in the next six days.  The family in question cannot be expected to live on fresh air.  Fresh air will not provide for this lady&rsquo;s children, pay her rent and allow her, an Irish citizen, to live in her own town.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for the inability for the Minister for Social Protection to attend the House.</P>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on behalf of the Department of Social Protection by the community division of the Health Service Executive provides for the payment of weekly or monthly supplements to eligible people who are habitually resident in the State and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The rules that apply this year are the same that were prescribed and applied when the Senator&rsquo;s party was in government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is the safety net in the overall social welfare system in that it provides a basic income support payment to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Its main purpose is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. However, supplementary welfare allowance cannot at any time be viewed as a temporary or interim means of income support available independently of the habitual residence condition while an applicant awaits the outcome of either a decision or an appeal against a decision on a claim for a social welfare payment from the Department.</P>
        
        <P>Since 1 May 2004, all applicants, regardless of nationality, are required to be habitually resident in the State to qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, supplementary welfare allowance, one-parent family payment, child benefit, disability allowance, State pension non-contributory, carer&rsquo;s allowance, widow&rsquo;s non-contributory, guardian&rsquo;s non-contributory payment or blind pension.  No distinction is drawn in social welfare legislation on grounds of nationality.  The determination of a person&rsquo;s habitual residence is made in accordance with section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended.  Section 246(4) specifically directs the deciding officer to &ldquo;take into consideration all the circumstances of the cases&rdquo; including, in particular, the length and continuity of residence in Ireland or in any other particular country, the length and purpose of any absence from Ireland, the nature and pattern of employment, the applicant&rsquo;s main centre of interest and the future intentions of applicant as they appear from all the circumstances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Habitual residence may be lost where a person spends time away.  This may apply in the case of an Irish national who gains stable employment abroad, or a non-Irish national who returns to his or her own country or settles in a third country following a period of residence here.  In determining the main centre of interest in such cases account will be taken of the purpose of return such as the expiry of foreign residence permit; the record of employment or self-employment in another state; whether the applicant has maintained links with the previous residence and can be regarded as resuming his or her previous residence rather than starting a new period of residence; the applicant&rsquo;s stated intentions; and verified arrangements which have been made <Col N="945"/>in regard to returning on a long-term basis such as transfer of financial accounts and any other assets, termination of residence-based entitlements in the other country, or assistance from Safe Home or a similar programme to enable Irish emigrants to return permanently.  The length and continuity of the previous residence in the State is also taken into account.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE has advised that the person concerned was refused a supplementary welfare allowance on the grounds that she did not satisfy the habitual residence condition.  Information available to the HSE at the time of her application indicated the person concerned was on an incentivised career-break from her UK employer, she was still in receipt of income from that employment and benefited from UK personal tax and child dependant credits.  She was also in receipt of child benefit from the Department of Health and Social Security in the UK and in receipt of rental income from property owned, again in the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>In making its decision, the HSE concluded that this person&rsquo;s main centre of interest was in the UK and she was not considered to be habitually resident in the State.  The HSE has further advised that it has received no appeal against this decision.  I suggest the Senator clarifies this matter with the individual in question.  If no appeal has been received, clearly the matter has been concluded.  If an appeal has been received, the Minister has not been given the correct information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  However, an appeal was lodged because I have acknowledgments from the Department of Social Protection indicating the appeal is being processed.  The confusion may relate to the appeal for the supplementary welfare allowance.  The appeal which has been lodged is the appeal to the original decision by the Department of Social Protection to refuse social welfare payments.  The applicant has demonstrated in her appeal that she is no longer on a career break and has a P45 from her employer.  She is not in receipt of any employment benefit or any other kind of benefit from the UK in that regard and is no longer in receipt of her personal child dependant tax credit.  She has gone to extreme lengths to explain that to the Department.  There may be some confusion, but the response the Minister gave does not seem to be joined up in the context of the social welfare appeal and the appeal on the supplementary welfare side, which is being dealt with by the HSE.  What I ask is that the Minister talk to his colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, to see whether, in light of the information that has been available to the social welfare appeals office, a review could be made of the supplementary welfare decision.  Can that be done?</P>

However, as someone who has some knowledge in this area and who has written about the social welfare and supplementary welfare systems at length, it seems there is a significant difficulty in being of assistance in the matter.  The Senator raised the issue as to why the supplementary welfare allowance is being refused.  Clearly, there are two separate systems.  If this individual has made an appeal against the refusal of the application for social welfare, which is an application to the Department of Social Protection, that is one issue.  That appeal will be dealt with in the course of time.  There have been delays in the appeal system for a considerable period and they are due to the failure of the previous Administration to address the issue.  I hope we will have an opportunity to address the delays.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A separate appeals system operates with regard to supplementary welfare allowance.  Clearly, if the applicant&rsquo;s situation is different now from that believed to be the case by the HSE and if she is not in receipt of rental income from the UK, which is a significant matter mentioned in the response, she may qualify.  If she is in receipt of rental income, I expect she does not <Col N="946"/>qualify for supplementary welfare allowance.  However, if she is not in receipt of rental income and if she has established habitual residence in the State, the course of action she should take is to lodge an appeal with the HSE with regard to the refusal of supplementary welfare allowance, which is a separate matter.  Alternatively, she should reapply for supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
