      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The people of this country woke up this morning to read a most pessimistic overview by the Economic and Social Research Institute in its latest quarterly report.  One stark reality that is facing the nation, according to the report is that &ldquo;As long as Europe remains in crisis, there is little prospect of Ireland returning to a path of sustainable, export-led growth.&rdquo;  It is obvious that there is a failure of leadership at European level but the question that remains for this country and its citizens is what exactly Government policy is on the evolving euro crisis.  Try as I might I can find nothing other than a holding operation by the Government from the Taoiseach down.  Is it an active participant in the debate on the future of the euro or is it sitting back and being pliant because we have to receive money from the European Central Bank?  Is it succumbing to the, as it were, Merkozy form of European Government?  Are we to assert ourselves, despite our diminished sovereignty, as a country that has an opinion and a point of view?  What is making it all the more critical is that in the ESRI report question marks now surround Government policy on the achievement of its budgetary targets by 2015.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and other Ministers have repeatedly said that the austerity measures that have been imposed on the people are going to achieve prosperity in the short term by 2015, it is salutary that the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday put his hands up and admitted that the UK will not be able to reach its budgetary targets by 2015.  Our economies are similar but the UK is admittedly larger.  The question remains as to what exactly is Government policy in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our party leader, Deputy Martin, wrote to the Taoiseach three weeks ago seeking a meeting in order that a cross-party policy could be developed that would support the Government and help it in the debate and discussions on the evolving crisis.  The Taoiseach has declined the offer.  Once again, I ask the Leader to convey the request to the Taoiseach.  We are in a national crisis.  Therefore, we need to have a national response.  It is not sufficient to say, as some Ministers have been saying since the election, that they represent a national government; they do not.  They represent a portion of Government.  They represent a particular segment of the Irish people.  Therefore, it is important that there should be all-party consensus on the future that would strengthen the hand of the Government.</P>
        <P>There is a need for further clarity in light of the ESRI report, the other points I have made, and the leaks from Government that are scaring the living daylights out of people in terms of next week&rsquo;s budget.  The Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, must come to the House today to issue a statement to clarify exactly what Government policy is on the evolving euro crisis, to respond to much of what is in the ESRI report, which is dictated by what is happening in Europe, and to tell us whether the Government has a plan B in the event that the euro collapses.  Banks outside of the eurozone have already stated publicly, according to yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i>, that they are now activating a plan B in the event of a possible collapse of the euro.</P>
        <P>I wish to end on a positive note.  I am sure the Leader would agree that confirmation of Giovanni Trapattoni as the Irish soccer manager for the next two to three years has given a big boost to this country.  I am sure he would also agree with the patriotism shown by Denis O&rsquo;Brien&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure how relevant that is to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="957"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in once again contributing to Trapattoni&rsquo;s fee to ensure he would stay on.  I also compliment the FAI on the decision it has taken not to change the strip in advance of the Euro 2012 finals next summer, which will mean a considerable saving to parents who would have been in dread of shelling out more money for a new strip considering all of the budgetary measures that will be imposed on them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs come to the House today to issue a clarifying statement on the evolving euro crisis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted Senator Mooney ended on a positive note.  That was very welcome.  We all agree and wish our very best to the Irish team and Giovanni Trapattoni.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To respond to what the Senator said in terms of the gloomy news, certainly the ESRI report did make for gloomy news as it emphasised the serious nature of the difficulty at European level, beyond national boundaries.  The Senator sought greater clarity on Europe.  What is lacking in today&rsquo;s headlines was the result of the meeting of European finance Ministers last night which came up with what we all hope will offer a way forward through the crisis, namely, giving the IMF a more dominant role in terms of providing support for states in financial difficulty.  Those reports offer a more optimistic prognosis for the future than we see in the ESRI report.  Any debate we have must take account of that issue.  The Minister for Finance and other representatives were active in that regard.  The Senator referred to our similarity with Britain, but there is a significant difference in terms of our presence in the eurozone while Britain is outside it.  Any agreement we reach on a way forward must be in conjunction with eurozone partners.  That is very clear.  That is plan A and it is also plan B.</P>
        <P>I also wish to point out to Senator Mooney that yesterday&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting agreed the establishment of a Cabinet sub-committee on European engagement &mdash; an interdepartmental committee on which the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, will play a major role.  A formal mechanism has now been established to ensure a more interdepartmental approach to European engagement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek inter-party engagement, not an internal discussion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted also that Senator Mooney is seeking a cross-party approach to the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is nothing new.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be very helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach declined the offer three weeks ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik should be allowed to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There will be great support for the Senator&rsquo;s suggestion.  It would be helpful to have a debate on the Croke Park agreement in the new year.  Others have called for that.  However, any debate on the agreement must take account of what is happening elsewhere.  We see gloomy news today for those waking up in Britain with a day of action and a strike taking place.  The bulk of those covered by the Croke Park agreement are low paid public sector workers on salaries of &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 per year who have taken immense cuts and pain in recent years, yet we have not had anything like the type of unrest evident in Britain.  We have not had strikes.  We must take account of that in any debate on the Croke Park agreement.</P><Col N="958"/>
        <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, of a further cut to public pensions of more than &euro;100,000.  Although only approximately 250 people are affected and the saving to the Exchequer is not great, it is important in the interests of fairness that the Government is doing this, as so many lower paid people are taking a lot of hits.  I very much welcome it.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the report from yesterday&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting that an expert group is being established to implement the ABC judgment of the European Court of Human Rights on access to abortion, and that the group will report within six months.  That is extremely important.  It is a matter on which successive Governments have dragged their feet for many years but which the Government is committed to tackling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the House, in particular the members of the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges, on what has turned out to be an excellent and healthy debate and discussion at the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  I saw it yesterday.  The contributions, particularly by Professors Quinn and Kenny, were extraordinary.  It shows what the reform of the Seanad can do and the impact of its engagement with civil society.  I am disappointed by the lack of media interest but the integrity of the debate and the discussions we are having will have a cumulative effect.  We can look back on this time in the new year as one of achievement.</P>
        <P>The discussion with Dr. Mary Robinson was also moving.  The level of debate by Senators from all parties and Independent Members was extraordinary.  We should take inspiration from what Dr. Robinson has said, in trying to lead on particular issues that might not be central to the immediate concerns of citizens.  Being at the frontier of such debates and bearing witness is important.</P>
        <P>In that regard I take note of what this country&rsquo;s black leaders stated last Friday.  They had a debate in which they condemned and called upon the Government to debate and consider issues of racism in this country.  In October the Immigrant Council of Ireland issued an important report, Taking Racism Seriously, in which it looked at the experiences of migrants in terms of violence, harassment and anti-social behaviour in the Dublin area in particular, especially with public servants working in Dublin Bus and the Luas.  It contained an extraordinary number of stories, on which Senators could take a lead.  I ask the Leader to look at having a debate on racism, perhaps in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  This is an important subject on which the Seanad could take a lead.  Could the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House to respond to this important document?</P>
        <P>The report by the Immigrant Council of Ireland reveals the reluctance of victims of racist attacks and abuse to report their experience to the authorities.  An awareness campaign could advertise the available supports and services for victims of racism and advise on how to report an incident.  The Seanad is a perfect place to raise this awareness and provide leadership.  The report says experience of racism in the workplace is not easy to understand if one has not experienced racism.  For example, one bus driver who complained about racist abuse he experienced was told by his supervisors, &ldquo;We all get that.&rdquo;  There is a need for leadership on the issue of racism, discrimination and xenophobia from employers and for an understanding and sensitivity to the differences between bullying and racist bullying.  I ask the Leader to arrange this debate and that the Seanad continue the leadership it has already shown and will continue to show.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to arrange a general debate on economic and financial matters.  In the past, I criticised the previous Government for dithering.  We now have a Govern<Col N="959"/>ment that has unprecedented control over every single organ and lever of government and power, yet we have the same kind of dithering, which I find astonishing.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach indicated he would address the nation.  This would be welcome if we got clear vision from it.  Now I understand RTE does not know if this address is going ahead and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, does not seem to know if it is going ahead either.  This creates further confusion.  It shows a classic lack of leadership and vision which is replicated throughout Europe.</P>
        <P>We saw the extraordinary spectacle of Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy summoning the Prime Minister of Greece, the home of democracy &mdash;  if it is not a criminal office to use a classically derived word in the demeaned society in which we now live &mdash; imposing a lack of a referendum on the citizens of Greece and telling the Prime Minister he cannot consult his own people.  How is that for democracy?  They then imposed an unelected eurocrat.  After 14 years of the scandal of Mr. Berlusconi in Italy, which everyone tolerated, they now move in and get rid of someone who should have been got rid of and put in another unelected eurocrat.</P>
        <P>The system itself is corrupt and doomed.  When Members of this House were gloating at what they saw as the death of communism, I said they might, in their own lifetimes, find themselves attending the obsequies of capitalism.  I believe this is what is happening.  The market is not as it was understood in previous centuries.  It is skewed in favour of huge financial interests.  The ordinary person has no rights whatever and the entire system is completely corrupt.</P>
        <P>What is happening about the ratings agencies?  These malignant toadstools were spawned by the economic disaster for which they were principally and criminally responsible.  They have never been held to account.  They have fed upon this corruption and grown to the point where they are now rating not only companies but governments, and not just governments but the strongest and biggest economy in the world.  Who are these malignant mushrooms and what can be done about them?  I have been speaking about this for three or four years.  I would like to see something done about them.</P>
        <P>There is one future for this planet, if we take it seriously.  First, we must look at the underlying cause, which is perfectly simple.  When I did my intermediate certificate there were 3 billion people on this planet.  We have now passed the 7 billion figure.  That must have an effect on resources and on tensions between states and needs to be looked at.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am asking for a debate on this issue.  These are the most fundamental issues.  The tragedy is that Washington and the Vatican intervened in a most significant experiment in Nicaragua, where a government which was partly composed of Roman Catholic priests &mdash; idealistic people from the liberation theology movement &mdash; was trying to meld together elements of capitalism with incentives and the social conscience of decent good people.  That is the way we must go.  Otherwise we are banjaxed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad I now have no money whatever left.  I do not know where it will end up and I do not want to see it ending up in the hands of banks or irresponsible governments.  I ask for a strong, clear and radical debate on the whole question of the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am glad my colleague, Senator Bacik, has also asked for an open debate on the Croke Park agreement.  I agree with her that the agreement in its entirety needs to be looked at.  Many low-paid workers are part of the agreement as well as some who may need a clipping.</P><Col N="960"/>
        <P>Every day, phrases are used in this House and in the D&aacute;il to refer to the poorest and weakest in society and the less well-off.  Could the Leader arrange a debate that would identify who the poorest and weakest in society and the less well-off really are?  We are about to see a change in the people who will be classified under those headings.  We need an open debate on that.  That debate should include some of the representative bodies of the less well-off in society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Leader arrange a debate on the unfortunate withdrawal of funding from People with Disabilities in Ireland?  I protest at the decision by the Minister for Justice and Equality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter will be raised on the Adjournment tonight.  I am sure Senator Conway will share his time with the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact that a matter may or may not be raised on the Adjournment does not prevent it from being raised on the Order of Business.  The two are not in contradiction.  I ask the Leader of the House to consider having a debate in the House on the issue.  The Adjournment debate merely allows for one person to speak and a Minister to reply.  I want every Member to discuss this issue.</P>
        <P>Some 8,000 people are affiliated to People with Disabilities in Ireland.  There is an active membership in County Roscommon.  A local member, Mr. Michael Treacy, brought this matter to my attention.  Mr. James McClean is chairperson of the organisation, Mr. Malachi Foote is PRO and Mr. Morgan McKnight is chief executive.</P>
        <P>The word, &ldquo;equality&rdquo; should be removed from the title of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.  There is no equality if funding is removed from people with disabilities.  How can the Minister claim to be the Minister with responsibility for equality and withdraw funding from an organisation that represents the most deserving and disabled people in the country?  Some 8,000 people are affiliated to the organisation and they are in every town and village in Ireland.  This is outrageous.</P>
        <P>The Government can make decisions in this regard but Ministers should bear in mind the effect their decisions will have on the most disadvantaged people and those who deserve representation at this level.  This is a shameful decision and it should be reviewed.  We accept the need for cutbacks in this difficult time, but surely we should not hit the poorest people and those with the greatest difficulties and disabilities.  There must be another way of raising the funds needed by this organisation.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision and I ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Justice and, perhaps, Equality come to the House to defend his decision in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the new contract signed by Mr. Giovanni Trapattoni.  I believe he is being paid far too much.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss that matter on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>He is being paid far too much when one considers the sports facilities throughout the country which are struggling to provide services.  It is an outrage to see anyone being paid that kind of money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A contract between a private organisation and Mr. Trapattoni has nothing to do with the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="961"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I also call on the Leader to initiate an economic debate in this House.  I have spoken previously about having pre-budget debates and providing for a pre-budget consultation period within the Houses and firmly hope this will be considered prior to the introduction of the budget in 2012.  However, I would like to have a debate on the issue raised by Senator Paschal Mooney whom I hold in high regard.  He spoke about the ESRI report which is gloomy and very worrying.  It would be a good idea to invite members of the ESRI to the House for a debate and a mature, all-party discussion on the future of the economy and what is happening within Europe, as we should also debate the European crisis.  As a Parliament, we and the Government need to be robust in articulating our views on the situation in Europe.  It would be no harm if a transcript of the proceedings of that debate were forwarded to the Bundestag in order that it would be made aware of and have a comprehensive understanding of how this Parliament views our role.  I have concerns about the euro and sincerely hope it survives, as it is an important model.  As a small peripheral country, it is in our interests that it works.  I look forward to taking part in such an economic debate if the Leader decides to have one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>What happens next Monday and Tuesday will be critical as we attempt to regain control of our finances.  I was distraught to learn there were no plans to have a pre-budget debate in the House this week.  One would think, at a time when we are all trying to show the value of this Chamber to the public, that time for a pre-budget debate would be provided.  Furthermore, the decision by the Government benches not to facilitate such a debate marks a continuation of the old politics which blighted the Oireachtas for so many years and does not resemble the new politics promised post the general election.</P>
        <P>The latest ESRI report makes for bleak reading and makes it all the more important that we ensure the budgetary decisions made will be the correct ones.  Coming from a business perspective, I find it hard to believe the only debate that will take place in this Chamber will be held post the event when it will be virtually impossible to make any changes.  I use the word &ldquo;debate&rdquo; loosely with regard to the discussions that will unfold next week, as more than likely we will have one of our haranguing sessions or shouting matches, with the blame for our economic problems being kicked over and back.  Such a debate would serve nobody, except the knockers of the Seanad.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Sticking to the business theme, if we are to believe the leaks in the past couple of weeks, in the budget small businesses will be crucified.  Being a small business owner, I have been contacted by a number of businesses about the VAT regime and the supposed increase in the rate to 23%, about which fear and horror have been expressed.  Lest Senators be in any doubt, businesses will close as a result of the VAT increase, particularly those close to the Border.  The number on the live register could reach 500,000 in the course of next year.  We need to assess the effect a rise in the VAT rate will have on businesses which are already struggling to survive, not to mention the proposed changes to the sick pay arrangements which we discussed last week and which have been mooted to solve the problems of the public sector, with little consideration being given&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not having a debate on the matter now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I urge the Leader to revisit his decision not to allow time for a pre-budget discussion this week.  If he will not grant time for such a debate, will he, at least, try to structure the exchanges on the budget next week in a businesslike and productive manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Cathaoirleach to bear with me in mentioning briefly the tragic death of the Welsh soccer manager.  It goes without saying the death of this young man by suicide was shocking and horrific.  However, I feel extremely strongly about the media <Col N="962"/>reports of such tragedies.  It is critical we fully address this issue.  Many research studies draw a link between how a suicide is reported and copycat suicides.  In 2009 an updated media guideline on the reporting of cases of suicide and self-harm was launched.  It provides information for journalists on how such events should be reported.  For example, the guideline recommends disseminating contact information on support services to encourage persons at risk to seek help at an early stage.  Using yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers as an example, the majority of articles on the death of Gary Speed did not include contact details for support groups.  Of the eight papers reviewed in my office, <i>The Star</i> alone included details of Samaritans.</P>
        <P>The media guideline also discourages the highlighting of expressions of grief, yet most Irish newspapers yesterday carried a picture of a visibly distraught Shay Given in tears after the death of his close friend.  To quote the guideline: &ldquo;Research suggests that media portrayal can influence suicidal behaviour and this may result in suicide and-or an increase in the use of particular methods&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on the issue of suicide?  She can make these points during the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow me finish.  It is vital the media treat the issue of suicide as delicately as possible.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to raise two issues.  The comprehensive public expenditure review will only be published within two working days of the announcement of the budget. I echo what Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien said that this is what should inform our discussion rather than letting it be turned into a hectoring session.  The review will provide valuable information.  I understand the opposition to its publication comes from people in the permanent government rather than from the Cabinet.  If this vital document is available, it should be supplied to parliamentarians to allow them to have the structured debate for which Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien called.</P>
        <P>Reports today suggest VHI which is technically bankrupt is thinking of buying one of its rivals.  We need a competitive health insurance business, not one which is monopolistic.  The Leader has impressed on the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, the need to ensure the design and development of a health insurance business take place in a period less than the five years the Minister seems to think is appropriate.  We need it now and should not make the mistake of running along monopolistic lines.  Previous advice from VHI led to defeats for the Government in the Supreme Court and the European Court.  It is important we have a competitive health insurance business quickly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have put a lot of thought into whether it is worthwhile raising this issue and, against my better judgment, have come to the decision that it is.  In so doing I run the risk of giving an accomplished self-promoter even more publicity, but it is probably worth doing.  Yesterday I spoke about the publication by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs of a report highlighting the dangers and risks involved in using high potency cannabis grown in this country.  I asked the Leader if we could have a debate on the issue &mdash; a responsible debate was what I was seeking.  This morning, when I opened my newspaper, I found some rather foolish comments made by a Member of the other House who drew inferences and <Col N="963"/>conclusions from the report.  The comments of the Member of the other House seem to have been aimed at self-promotion rather than seeking a proper debate on the issue.  While the Leader has agreed to arrange a debate some time in the new year, I urge him to arrange it as a matter of urgency; it should take place sooner rather than later because in the absence of responsible and mature reflection on the issue, the airwaves will be dominated by irresponsible comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume Senators from all parties are concerned and worried about the latest forecasts from the ESRI which has forecast that next year the domestic economy will only grow at half the rate predicted by the Government, less than 1%.  The ESRI predicts that 35,000 more young people will emigrate, that 22,000 more people will lose their jobs and that we could and probably will take a hit on our exports because of a drop in consumer demand and problems in the American and European economies.  It also talks about the crisis in the eurozone.  While it is reasonably optimistic that the euro will survive, it is very concerned about the lack of leadership being shown in Europe.</P>
        <P>This goes to the heart of many of the discussions that have taken place in the House in recent weeks.  On six occasions I called for proper pre-budget debates.  I accept the bona fides of the Leader that he tried to get the Minister of State to come to the House this week.  We must do things differently next year.  A number of Senators from the Government parties spoke about wanting to see better governance and better ways of doing things.  This is a national crisis which needs a national response.  We will not have a national government or a government of unity but we must explore all of the options, proposals and ideas from all of the groups and parties and properly debate them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With a number of Senators from the Government benches, I attended the pre-budget launch of the medical research charities group this morning.  There are launches from these groups every day but we are not being given the opportunity in this House to debate them with the relevant Ministers.  Perhaps the Seanad Public Consultation Committee might give us an opportunity next year to bring in some of those groups.</P>
        <P>I implore the Leader to ensure we have proper discussions about these very important issues next year because an accusation was made about politicians in the past, with which I fully agree, that they were asleep at the wheel.  However, we cannot be accused of that if we are not given the opportunity to have proper discussions.  Those on the opposite side of the House cannot say they do not want shouting sessions and the Punch and Judy type politics they say they get from this side of the House if they do not give us an opportunity even to discuss proposals we are putting forward and want to debate.</P>
        <P>There is a real need for a culture change in this Seanad.  There have been positive changes and I commended the Leader on them yesterday.  They will make a difference to the workings of this House but there is still a long way to go if we are to have the kind of debate, scrutiny and oversight of which we need to be part and which this country needs at this point.</P>

	<P>I was made aware at the medical research charities group meeting, which we attended, that a position has become vacant in the Department of Health.  The position is that of assistant secretary with responsibility for medical research.  This is a very important position because, as we all know, medical research is very important and this country can become a world leader in this area.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health to clarify when this position will be filled?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I had the pleasure of attending the Seanad Public Consultation Committee and to listen to Professors Rose Anne Kenny and Gerard Quinn.  People in England and Ireland were traumatised over the weekend by the suicide of Gary Speed and I <Col N="964"/>suggest that rather than have the debate in the Seanad on the issue of suicide, which the Leader very kindly arranged, we discuss it in the consultation committee as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I spent a year in my office writing my document, What We Can Do About Suicide in the New Ireland.  Like many Senators who were shocked by the publication of the traumatic ways in which people die by suicide, I had to come to terms with the devastation suicide causes families, relations and society when writing this document.  This issue must be dealt with urgently.  In my document I said hanging was the most commonly used method of suicide for all age groups in the total population and that within the male population it accounted for 55%,rising to 69% among males aged 15 to 24.</P>
        <P>There are probably very few of us in this Chamber who do not know of somebody who has died by suicide.  It would be a great help to the people if they saw we were airing this issue.  Many people want to keep it under the radar, which is part of the problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is help available.  All of us can help people.  If one has empathy and emotional intelligence, sometimes one can help people who are going through very serious depression.  The parents of many who died by suicide told me that doctors told them their children would be all right and would get over it.  General practitioners are not trained to identify serious depression and are not up-to-date on the proper medication to prescribe for depression.</P>

I agree we should have a debate on the ESRI report which shows that the growth rate will decline somewhat as opposed to other forecasts.   To be honest, there is such a heavy legislative programme that it will be impossible to have such a debate, in particular in advance of next week&rsquo;s budget.  We are up against it.</P>

If the Leader could arrange it, I would like a debate on that issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonnCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Eamonn Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>This week was one of highs and lows for Irish sport.  The week of highs was referred to by Senator Paschal Mooney when he said that Mr. Trapattoni&rsquo;s contract had been extended for two years and for God only knows how many million euro.  It was a week of lows because the president of the Olympic Council of Ireland resigned from the Olympic task force which was asked to identify opportunities for Ireland to bring foreign teams here in preparation for the London Olympic Games which, in turn, would promote Ireland and Irish tourism internationally.  Perhaps he resigned because of the lack of facilities in Ireland for these teams or perhaps because he was unable to secure anywhere between &euro;50 million and &euro;300 million to put an Ireland house in London in which Ireland could promote tourism, culture and sport during the Olympic Games.</P>
        <P>Since I have become a Senator, I have been lobbied or asked by numerous people in the sports industry to be a voice in the House.  This week, in particular, I received numerous emails, letters and requests and I have been on the airwaves speaking about the below the belt bad <Col N="965"/>news that, with 21 hours notice, University College Dublin decided to dig trenches across the athletics facility in Belfield.  It was shameful.  The facilities in UCD are not just for athletes training for the Olympic Games or national champions.  The facilities are for the wider community in south County Dublin to work on their health.  I noticed signs there the other day stating the track was closed for health and safety reasons.</P>

	<P>Yes.  I am sure the people who recommended closing the track for health and safety reasons have probably never walked a lap of the track.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sadly, in a month or so we will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the GOAL mile at which many thousands of people have raised funds.  The UCD authorities have not given answers to the various representatives as to why they have closed the track.  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, to seek answers as to why the authorities closed the track and brought shame on the country in terms of our sports facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure Senators have read this morning&rsquo;s newspaper reports about the HSE withholding travel costs from staff.  I call on the Minister to intervene to determine whether this is legal.  Front line workers, for example, community carers and community nurses, will not be reimbursed for their travel expenses until at least two months after these expenses have been incurred.  Many home care workers who look after the elderly live from week to week and will not have enough money to put petrol in their cars if they are not given this subsistence expense.  They depend on it.  Given that we are nearing Christmas, I want the Minister to investigate whether the HSE&rsquo;s decision is legal.  Companies and local authorities must pay within 30 or 40 days.  The HSE has a duty of care to people working on the front line.  It is interesting that low-paid community carer workers and community nurses as opposed to highly paid administrative staff are being targeted.  If the HSE removed some of the duplication in administrative roles, it would have plenty of money to stay within budget while paying its front line staff.  The HSE&rsquo;s decision hits below the belt.  Will the Minister intervene?</P>
        <P>Senator Eamonn Coghlan referred to the president of the Olympic Council of Ireland resigning from the Olympic task force.  There might be two sides to the story, given that funding was not provided for a facility that the president sought.  I would also like the advocacy of the mingling of sport and drink in a pub-type system brought out into the open.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I read that the Taoiseach reiterated yesterday his intention to abolish the Seanad and that he has taken steps in that direction.  If the Seanad is abolished, we will only have ourselves to blame.  This year was a lost opportunity.  I call on the Leader to ensure that we earn our keep in the run up to the budget next year.  It is too late to do it this year.  We need to influence the drafting of the next budget before it is issued.  This House can perform better.  The Leader has done a wonderful job in improving the way we handle a number of issues.  Yesterday afternoon&rsquo;s consultation committee meeting was a good example of that.  If we are to earn our survival, it will only be by playing a useful role prior to budgetary decisions being made.</P>
        <P>I have been looking at Lithuania&rsquo;s figures.  Its economy fell farther than ours, but it has bounced back quickly.  Lithuania&rsquo;s GDP decreased by 14% in 2009 and has since increased by 6.6%.  Lithuania is the shining light for the small countries adversely affected by the economic turndown.  It reduced its corporate tax rate from 20% to 15% and invested in education.  Lithuania has done what we should have been doing.  We are doing it in some cases.  Let us examine other success stories before our budgetary decisions are made.  I urge the Leader to ensure we <Col N="966"/>do not let this chance slip by again.  Let us hold budget discussions well in advance of decisions so that we might influence the budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Quinn, I wish to raise the issue of the House&rsquo;s role.  One of my proposals was on EU legislation.  Yesterday, I highlighted the fact that the Commission has published its programme for 2012 and that there are 129 proposals for debate on its schedule.  There is no reason that the Seanad cannot debate some of these issues and influence the decisions being made at European level.  I reiterate my suggestion that two days per month be set aside to discuss EU matters.  In this way we can be part of the European debate instead of merely discussing issues post-implementation.</P>
        <P>I raised a matter at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  I have also raised it with the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  She is anxious that the issues relevant to Ireland and under discussion at Europe level also be debated in the Houses.  It would be a useful way to put information into the public domain.</P>
        <P>Senator White discussed suicide.  There is no comparison in how we have invested funding in and addressed the issue of road traffic accidents in the past ten years and the funding we have invested in suicide prevention services.  The House needs to debate how to proceed.  Councillor John McTernan in County Leitrim has voluntarily set up a structure for early intervention.  It is benefitting people in the area.  Structured developments of this type are necessary.  I call for a debate so that we might discuss the positive actions that we can and should take.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the main outline of Senator Norris&rsquo;s contribution and support his request for a debate on the economic situation.  However, that debate should take a different form than usual.  I recall a discussion with a young Argentinian some years ago.  He told me about the morning that his people woke up and realised that their bank savings had evaporated overnight.  I believed it was fantasy land and the stuff of nightmares.</P>
        <P>There is a fear that this nightmare has visited us.  In the past week, several people have asked me about the security of their bank savings.  They went a step further by asking about savings in the post office, which is State guaranteed, and whether there were any circumstances in which the State could renege on its guarantee.  We need enhanced communications with the public.  The information vacuum is being filled by celebrity economists who are only interested in personal TAM ratings.  I have great regard for the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, who comes across as an exceptionally decent person.  There is no reason for him not to go on television more than once.  The Taoiseach should appear on television from time to time to address issues like post office savings.</P>
        <P>The young Argentinian man told me that, once the savings had evaporated, any money people still had they kept at home.  During the week, three people asked me whether they should remove their money and hide it in biscuit tins under their beds.  This is the seriousness of the situation.  Millions of euro in deposits have left the banks.  Can the House imagine what will happen if we do not allay people&rsquo;s fears?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The debate must take a different shape.  The Leader knows as well as I do that information provided in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad never gets out properly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Eamonn Coghlan has left the Chamber, but I concur with him on the issue of the Belfield track.  As a student at UCD in the 1970s, I used that track regularly.  Many students use it.  Closing down any sports facility when there is no replacement for it is a retrograde step.  I endorse the Senator&rsquo;s call for the track to be maintained.</P>
        <P>The report on the review of sex abuse cases in the diocese of Raphoe between 1975 and 2010 was published this morning.  It leads indirectly to suicide, to which other Members referred.  Many members of the community of Donegal and the north west have been affected by this and driven to depression and, in many cases, suicide.  I know of cases where this has happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>I want to read one sentence that can highlight this severity of the issue.  The report states: &ldquo;Insufficient emphasis was placed on the needs of victims, often in the misguided attempt to protect the reputation of the Church.&rdquo;  That is one sentence that people can recognise as a major problem.  In the context of this report being issued at 10 a.m today, I ask that we discuss it further.  Along with the issue of suicide mentioned by Senator White, this is a matter that has affected many people in Donegal.  This happened between 1975 and 2010, a period of 35 years.  During the day there will be more reaction to this and, in the context of this report, I ask for a debate on this and the wider issue.</P>

I hope that in dealing with the many problems arising where there are different interest groups in society pointing to injustices to themselves, the Government does not forget there is a world outside Ireland, where people also face major challenges.  I was struck by a comment yesterday in <i>The Irish Times</i>, where the new Minister for Health in Libya, Dr. Fatima Hamroush, was interviewed.  She is a consultant ophthalmologist in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  I am sure everyone wishes her well in what will be a challenging position.  Among the calls from the international media and embassies wishing her well, it appears she got messages from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital to say that she could go to take up the post in Libya only if she found a locum to cover for her.  As I read that I wondered what we are coming to in this country.  </P>

It would be a worthwhile exercise and would do great service to this House.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Keane in her condemnation of the HSE for its attempts to withhold legitimate travel expenses from front line staff.  If the HSE has to withhold the travel expenses from anyone, it should be from the more senior and top-level management and executives throughout the country.  If the HSE carries out its proposal, the only people who will suffer are those depending on the call from the public health nurse or a home help.  The HSE should be ashamed of itself for contemplating this method of saving money coming to the end of the year.</P>
        <P>I have written to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, about the independent inquiry into the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme.

The family feels their relative&rsquo;s reputation has been impugned.  I ask the Leader to confirm with the Minister that this is the case.  If it does not happen, there will be further expense incurred by the State because a second inquiry will be called for.</P>

One of the bodies funding the country, the European Commission, is also stalling on this decision.  This project will allow people to advance.  I am in contact with people involved in the construction of wind farms.  Hundreds of billions of euros of work is lined up if the Commission responds with a one-line response to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I am not asking the Leader to request a response from the Minister, who is at his wits end trying to get a decision from the Commission.  With the consent of the Seanad, I ask for all-party agreement on a motion.  I expect a unanimous decision from the Commission to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that the REFIT programme can be agreed to as quickly as possible.

	<P>I have asked previously and I am asking again &mdash; this is not an invitation or a summons but something in between &mdash; that the Taoiseach, as head of the national Parliament, come and speak to one of the Houses of the Oireachtas about his plans on the future of the Constitution and this House.  I cannot understand how such a debate has not yet taken place.  In many ways, apart from the ongoing economic catastrophe, one could argue that, in terms of the purity of parliamentary democracy, this is the most serious question we have to address.  Many of us have strong feelings on the necessity of reforming both Houses.  As I have said before, the primary architects of our misfortune were not the Members of the Seanad, whose worst sin was the sin of omission, of being asleep at the till, while the primary architects sat in the other House, with the Ministers they appointed.  If we are to carry the country forward, there is a need for serious root and branch reform to look at the way we <Col N="970"/>represent ourselves in both Houses.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to urge the Taoiseach to come and discuss these issues with us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for this House to become more involved on a substantial basis in discussing European Union matters.  This issue has been raised a number of times in the House.  Will the Leader either provide a forum for debate on how we could do this or invite the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, to the House to discuss ways by which we could co-operate meaningfully?  In the context of all the observations made on the future of the Seanad, it is meaningful work in which we should engage.  If we are to get involved in such matters, they should not be paid lip service but dealt with on a concrete basis.</P>
        <P>Perhaps I might take the liberty to remind Members that the National Office for Suicide Prevention was invited by the cross-party mental health committee, of which I am a member, to provide training for Senators and Deputies and their staff in identifying persons who might be at risk of suicide or a psychological upset.  That training is being provided again tomorrow between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. and I understand there are still some places available on the course.</P>

	<P>As  mentioned, the ESRI report states the number in employment will fall by 22,000 next year, but this will be masked by the emigration of 40,000, in addition to the 35,000 expected to emigrate this year.  According to the CSO, there are 3,440 legally defined electoral divisions in the State.  The ESRI estimates that 12 people per electoral division will emigrate next year &mdash; almost an entire GAA team.  Using the same estimate, in a two year period at least 24 people in all of our local areas will emigrate.  When I met my old school principal earlier this week, we reflected on the people who had attended my school.  The large majority of those with whom I went to school have emigrated; every second one has emigrated to Australia and New Zealand.  This is unacceptable.  We should invite the Minster for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to come to the House to speak about unemployment and, more specifically, youth unemployment and how the Government expects to realise its objective of creating a knowledge economy when all of our skilled graduates are emigrating.  This is an incredibly important topic which we need to address as soon as possible.  We need to open dialogue because we cannot afford to lose any more people to Australia, New Zealand and Canada.  We need them to rebuild the economy.</P>

	<P>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail mentioned the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  Certainly, there is a lack of media interest in public consultation and this House.  This is an issue that will have to be addressed.  The Senator also asked for a debate on racism which can be arranged in the new year.</P>
        <P>Senator David Norris has informed the House that the European system is doomed.  I hope he is not correct.  He also called for a wider debate on the economy, as did Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  While a budgetary debate will take place next week, I agree that we need to have a more wide-ranging debate on the economy in the new year.</P>
        <P>Senator Tom Sheahan asked for a debate on the less well-off in society.  This issue could be included in the debate on the economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Terry Leyden called for a debate on funding for people with disabilities.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has made it perfectly clear that &euro;900,000 was spent on administration by the head office of the organisation concerned.  She has rightly said funding should be spent directly on providing services for people with disabilities.  Senator Martin Conway has sought a debate on the issue on the Adjournment.  He also called for a debate on the economy.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien expressed her dismay at the lack of a debate on pre-budget submissions.  As stated yesterday, the Minister for Finance is fully aware of all the pre-budget submissions made by parties and organisations and will take them into consideration when framing his budget.  As other Senators stated, I will agree &mdash; please God &mdash; to arrange a pre-budget debate next year, well in advance of the budget, to allow everybody an opportunity to have his or her say.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Catherine Noone, Mary White, R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen and Colm Burke, among others, called for a debate on the issue of suicide and raised the possibility of having it as the subject of discussion at the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  The committee will consider that <Col N="972"/>request.  Prior to the death of Gary Speed, I had arranged a debate on the issue and the Minister of State had confirmed that she would come to the House on 12 January to deal with it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Sean D. Barrett raised the matter of reports, with particular reference to VHI and Quinn Healthcare.  The Government is considering a range of issues on the future structure of the private health insurance market.  No decision has been made on the matter yet.  It is a complex area, as the Senator knows, and it requires careful consideration.  In the first instance, the State must take action to address the recent ruling of the European Court of Justice, which removed VHI&rsquo;s derogation from being authorised by the Financial Regulator.  The Government also wants to rebalance the spread of risks in the health insurance market because most of the older and sicker customers are with VHI.  This makes effective competition very difficult.  An option being considered is that the State would buy Quinn Healthcare, which is for sale, and merge it with VHI.  It would then be split into a number of companies with a more even risk profile.  The Government has made no decision on the matter yet and its main concern is to act upon the judgment of the European Court of Justice on VHI.  The Government is examining the issues urgently and will make a decision shortly.  The first priority is to ensure a well functioning health insurance market that provides choice at competitive prices for customers.</P>
        <P>Senator Gilroy raised the issue of the potency of cannabis grown in Ireland.  I will try to arrange a debate early in the new year on drug abuse.  Having Members of any House promoting drug abuse and the use of cannabis is not to be encouraged.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Cullinane and Coghlan, among others, asked about the ESRI report.  It is welcome that the ESRI is projecting a return to growth in the economy this year, with the first annual increase in GDP since 2007.  The ESRI is predicting stronger growth this year than most other economic commentators.  The institute is also forecasting that the economy will continue to expand in 2012 but now expects much weaker growth than it did previously.  This reflects the volatile European and international environment, and it expects growth of 0.9% next year, which is below other forecasts.  It also argues that the agreement reached at the end of October in Brussels is not an adequate solution and that the ECB must provide directly or indirectly the funds the Government needs to fully capitalise the banks and reduce Greek debt to a manageable level.  We might have a debate on the ESRI annual report in the new year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Neill asked about the vacancy in the Department of Health for an assistant secretary responsible for medical research.  We will ascertain the position with the Minister for Health on this subject.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Eamonn Coghlan asked about the resignation of the president of the Olympic Council from the committee dealing with the Olympics.  Several teams have committed to come to Ireland prior to the Olympics and the Minister is working hard to attract further teams to come here.  I will take up the matter regarding the athletics track in Belfield.  The Senator might raise the issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, who is waiting to come into the House to address Second Stage of a Bill after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Keane asked about the HSE not paying travel expenses to some staff.  All staff in the HSE should be paid on time.  It is not acceptable that staff are not paid on time and we urge the HSE to act swiftly and to pay the entitlements that staff are due in a timely manner.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn mentioned having a pre-budget debate.  We can look at this next year and have a debate well in advance of the budget.</P>
        <P>Senator Colm Burke asked about the scrutiny of EU directives and reports, a matter he has raised in this House previously.  I am informed the committees are dealing with all EU scrutiny matters.  I am favourably disposed to debating EU legislation but it will require more resources <Col N="973"/>to have such debates in the House.  We could hold such debates on Mondays or Fridays.  If we can arrange such debates we will.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Norris agree on the need for a debate on the economy and the outflow of funds.  The flow of funds out of the country has ceased since the Government acted on the banks and undertook to recapitalise them.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Harte called for a debate on the reports on the diocese of Raphoe.  There are reports today on six dioceses, Raphoe, Derry, Ardagh, Kilmore, Tuam and Dromore, and it is to be welcomed that the reports are to be published.  It is important for transparency, public confidence and to support much of the good work that has been done in the Catholic Church on child protection.  I hope all future reports by the dioceses will similarly be published.  The Minister and the Government will consider the reports once they are published.  Child protection is a serious issue for every organisation working with children.  It is important that organisations comply with child protection rules and that the public is vigilant in monitoring child protection standards and reporting concerns.  This is one of the key social priorities of the Government and I welcome the work already done by many organisations in Ireland working with children on enhanced protection.</P>
        <P>We join Senator Mullen in congratulating the new Minister for Health in Libya and wish her every success.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mullins asked about a debate on the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme and called for another matter to be addressed.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, will reply in due course to the Senator on that matter and I hope he will accede to the request.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh asked for a debate on the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.  We will arrange such a debate in the new year.  Unfortunately because of the amount of legislation that will be brought to the House in the coming weeks, it will be impossible to slot statements in anywhere.  We will deal with legislation all the way from now until Christmas.</P>
        <P>Senator D&rsquo;Arcy called for a worthwhile all-party motion and I will talk to him about it after we finish the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Crown asked about the future of the Seanad and the possibility of the Taoiseach coming into the House to discuss constitutional reform and the future of the House.  I will ask the Taoiseach about the matter but he is totally committed to having a referendum on the future of the Seanad.  He has made that perfectly clear for well over a year.</P>

She noted that the Suicide Prevention Office is providing training for Members of the House and staff.  If there are vacancies, people should seek that training, if they can possibly do so.</P>

	<P>The National Tourism Development (Amendment) Bill 2011 provides for an increase in the <Col N="976"/>level of capital funding which can be voted to the National Tourism Development Authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, for the purpose of supporting tourism product development.  Before moving on to the detail of the Bill, I acknowledge that contributors to the debate in the D&aacute;il all commented on the importance of the tourism sector.  The tourism and hospitality sector continues to be a major force in the economy, providing an estimated 180,000 jobs.  It brings revenues into every part of the country and provides job opportunities for people across a range of skill levels.  The estimate for expenditure in 2010 by overseas visitors, including carrier receipts, is approximately &euro;3.4 billion.  In addition, estimated spending on domestic tourism in 2010 was &euro;1.3 billion, making the total spending on tourism in the national economy in the region of &euro;4.7 billion.  In terms of tourism performance, after a number of very successful years of growth, Ireland saw a reduction in overseas visitors in the second half of 2008, which continued into 2009 and 2010.  Ireland was not unique in this regard as travel worldwide was affected by the global economic slowdown.</P>
        <P>During the D&aacute;il debate on the Bill, it was evident that Members were aware the tourism industry in Ireland has seen a welcome return to growth in 2011.  I am pleased to be able to advise Senators that based on the most recent figures available, this trend has continued, which is very good news.  For instance, in the first nine months of this year, visits from North America have increased by almost 11%.  Visits from Great Britain have increased by more than 7% when compared with the same period in 2010.  Notably, visits from other long-haul markets increased by 15% and visits from mainland European countries increased by more than 12%.  Clearly, comparisons with the first half of 2010 are distorted by the impact on travel of severe weather in the earlier part of the year, as well as the volcanic ash between March and May of last year.  However, the increase in overseas travel to Ireland is not solely due to the recovery of business lost due to the volcanic ash and weather issues of 2010.  In fact, numbers from North America and from other long-haul markets are almost back to 2008 levels.  Furthermore, Ireland is outperforming other European destinations in the key Great Britain market and is gaining market share.  The figures are only available for the United Kingdom as a whole but they show that growth in travel from the United Kingdom to the EU-15 countries during the first nine months of 2011 stood at 2%, as against a growth of 7% from Great Britain to Ireland.</P>
        <P>In addition, people appear to be holidaying at home in greater numbers this year and I commend them on their support for the domestic tourism industry.  As yet, there are no official figures for performance of the domestic market.  In that regard, F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s tourism barometer for September 2011 is of interest.  The barometer measures sentiment in the industry and according to the survey, 54% of hotels are reporting an increase in domestic volume.  The caravan and camping sectors also report healthy domestic visitor levels, as do the self-catering and hostel sectors.  These figures are heartening and the challenge will be to maintain this growth.  While excellent work is being done at present in promoting Ireland at home and abroad as a holiday destination, we must ensure the quality and competitiveness of the Irish tourism offering is continually improved and that the industry generates increased earnings and more jobs as part of the economic recovery.  The Government is playing its part through measures such as the VAT cut, reduced employers&rsquo; PRSI and the visa waiver scheme to support competitiveness, as well as key investments to upgrade Ireland&rsquo;s tourism products and attractions.</P>
        <P>The Bill under consideration today is a technical adjustment to existing legislation but is important in facilitating the continued support for capital investment in the tourism product.  The decision of the Minister for Finance earlier this year to reduce to 9% the level of VAT that applies to a range of labour-intensive tourism services provided much-needed support to tourism businesses.  The reduction was introduced until the end of 2013 but will be reviewed before the end of 2012.  I am pleased that the Restaurants Association and the Hotels Feder<Col N="977"/>ation strongly encouraged their members to pass on the VAT cut to their customers.  The Government also helped businesses to enhance their position in the international tourism marketplace by significantly reducing the cost of employing people by halving employers&rsquo; PRSI for those on modest wages.  The visa waiver scheme, perhaps the most radical change in Irish immigration policy or practice since the coming of the Single Market, shows that the Government is serious about doing everything it can to support the tourism sector.</P>
        <P>While the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, confirmed recently that the Government has decided to retain the &euro;3 travel tax, pending a further review next spring, a significant proportion of the revenues taken in from the travel tax is being used to support inbound tourism.  This support saw significant additional funding being used for co-operative marketing with airlines, airports, ferry companies and tour operators on inbound routes into Ireland.  It focused in particular on opportunities to enhance access from the British regions, the United States, Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.  Based upon the latest figures of overseas visitors it appears that these efforts are bearing fruit.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Government&rsquo;s support programme for capital investment in tourism product is provided through F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s tourism capital investment programme.  The programme has operated on the basis of three broad strands: first, the development of new attractions and the upgrade of existing visitor attractions; second, the development of tourism infrastructure, primarily through supporting local authorities to develop appropriate facilities for tourists, including walking and cycling routes, jetties and moorings, angling stands, access routes to areas of scenic interest, and signposting and orientation facilities in heritage and historic towns; and, third, the development of outdoor and other active pursuits such as water-sports, boat rental, equestrian, horse riding facilities and so on  In summary, the aim of the investment programme is to provide the necessary public infrastructure to help develop tourism as well as providing sustainable visitor attractions which match the expectations of the international visitor.</P>
        <P FLI="0">During the debate on this Bill in the D&aacute;il, Deputies referred to the many features that make Ireland attractive as a holiday destination &mdash; our scenery, beaches, historic towns and our people.  Many Deputies referred to their own areas, and I expect many Senators will do likewise, and to the many tourism attractions that exist throughout the length and breadth of the country.  They also discussed the efforts made by ordinary people through such excellent programmes as the Tidy Towns scheme to ensure their local areas continue to be beautiful places to live and to visit.  Many of these attractions and programmes have benefited from funding received by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and other State agencies.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Ireland has an excellent range of attractions.  It has an excellent tourism product but the Government, the industry and all citizens must continue to work together to ensure that this continues to be the case.  During the debate on the Bill in the D&aacute;il, Deputies outlined the scope for investment across the country for investment in gardens, historic sites and monuments, walks, cycling routes and projects to provide for those rainy days with which we are all familiar.  That is why I consider this Bill to be important legislation.  It will facilitate investment to ensure that tourism makes its contribution to economic recovery and provides much needed jobs across all regions and counties.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Naturally, as with most funding schemes, there are many more applicants than there is capital funding available and I am sure Senators, like their D&aacute;il colleagues, will be aware of many projects that might benefit from this funding.  Under the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003, responsibility for the management of tourism-related funding programmes has been devolved to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which considers applications for funding based on the tourism benefits that each proposal will provide.  To achieve the best use of public funding, it is crucially important that the limited funding is put towards the projects that will have the most effective <Col N="978"/>impact on tourism both in terms of increased visitor numbers and the enhancement of the visitor experience.  In this regard, the F&aacute;ilte Ireland executive undertakes a full appraisal process, including financial evaluations, legal and other due diligence of all applications made under the programme.  When the evaluation has been completed, the F&aacute;ilte Ireland executive brings the application before a capital investment appraisal group, which has been established to examine proposals and make recommendations on funding.  The group includes external experts with particular expertise in financial appraisal and economics, together with F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s chief executive and a representative of my Department.  Final approval of the appraisal group&rsquo;s recommendation is made by the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Authority.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the initial years of the programme from 2007 to 2008, F&aacute;ilte Ireland targeted infrastructure provision by local authorities such as walking and cycling routes, beach management works, access to angling waters and so on.  It also supported the historic towns initiative for walking routes in designated towns of historic merit.  A total of &euro;23 million was allocated to F&aacute;ilte Ireland in those years for these projects.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the following years, the focus expanded to include the provision of support for re-investment in major tourist visitor attractions and the development of facilities for visitor activities.  Notable projects that have been allocated or approved for grant aid to date include Dublinia, Waterford Viking Triangle, Slieve League Cliffs in Donegal, Athlone Castle, Mizen Head Bridge in west Cork, Mayo Greenway and King John&rsquo;s Castle in Limerick.  In total from 2009 to date, 45 projects have been approved for funding of just under &euro;76 million.  The level of outstanding commitments under the programme means that the current legislative limit on the funds advanced to F&aacute;ilte Ireland will no longer be sufficient.  This gives rise to the need for the Bill before the House which I will now outline in more detail.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The National Tourism Development Authority Act was passed in 2003 to dissolve Bord F&aacute;ilte &Eacute;ireann and CERT Limited and establish the National Tourism Development Authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Section 24(1) of that Act gives the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the power to advance, out of money provided by the Oireachtas, such sums as the Minister may determine.  Section 24(2) limits the amount of money that can be advanced by the Minister to F&aacute;ilte Ireland as capital expenditure on projects or enterprises to &euro;65 million.</P>
        <P>Since its establishment in 2003 to the end of 2010, a total of &euro;44.411million has been advanced to F&aacute;ilte Ireland in regard to capital expenditure on projects or enterprises.  This leaves a total of just &euro;20 million available to be advanced to F&aacute;ilte Ireland before amending legislation is required.  It is anticipated that expenditure in 2011 and 2012 is likely to exceed the existing cap and this necessitates an increase in the limit.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have agreed a new legislative cap of &euro;150 million, based on this year&rsquo;s allocation and possible future allocations.  The amount will meet the provisions in the Government&rsquo;s capital framework programme and allow F&aacute;ilte Ireland to incur the expenditure envisaged in that framework for tourism capital investment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am bringing forward this short Bill to make the necessary legislative change and I commend it to the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I have observed him to be a man of great energy and to have a very positive outlook.  Those are qualities which are eminently suitable for a person representing Ireland in the world of international tourism.</P><Col N="979"/>
        <P>We in Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Bill.  It is quite sensible.  The current cap is close to being exceeded and will be in the very near future.  The figure of &euro;150 million appears to be reasonably realistic and those of us on this side of the House have always supported infrastructural investment, particularly in tourism.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s figures are about right compared with the original estimate or cap for the Irish film Board of &euro;4 million which has now jumped to &euro;20 million, which is a realistic and logical figure.</P>
        <P>Investment in tourism capital infrastructure is important.  The tourism product development strategy 2007 to 2013 placed major emphasis on capital infrastructural works subject to an audit on all existing tourism products, events and activities.  The Irish tourism industry is at a critical point, as the Minister of State will appreciate.  We have had several years of decline, particularly in the year when we had the volcanic ash cloud, but the figures for July to September of this year are quite positive.  I was glad to hear the Minister of State say that trend appears to be continuing.  However, we cannot rest on our laurels because anecdotal evidence at least shows there are difficulties throughout the year in terms of the UK market despite the figures the Minister of State gave.  That is the anecdotal evidence I hear from people in the industry in County Kerry and that is worrying because UK visitors were always an important segment of our tourism market.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to see how we can achieve growth in tourism at a time of global recession.  That is the reason we welcome this Bill all the more because it indicates that the Government is moving in the right direction and will provide moneys for essential important products.</P>
        <P>Other concerns are Government-made.  Despite the improvement in the VAT regime for the tourism industry, I am concerned about the proposal to inflict the first four weeks of sick pay on employers.  This would have a serious negative impact on labour-intensive industries such as the hotel industry.  I can see it being a major problem if the Government proceeds with it.  It was shocking and sad to read in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers that Ashford Castle in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency had gone into receivership.  It is a flagship hotel which offers a great service and has outstanding staff.  If it is in trouble, will there be many more behind?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is a frequent visitor to Ashford Castle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
        <P>I will not repeat the Minister&rsquo;s figures, but the overseas spend is &euro;3.4 billion, while the domestic spend is &euro;1.3 billion.  Unlike other industries which tend to be Dublin centred, tourism is spread throughout the regions.  Remote areas such as those from which the Minister of State and I come can hold their own.  The overall comparison between the regions and Dublin favours the regions, which is no harm.  Dublin is a thriving tourism destination.  The same is true of other urban centres such as Galway and Kilkenny.</P>
        <P>Apart from mainstream employment, tourism provides many opportunities to engage in part-time employment which helps students to get through college and provides housewives with casual work.  A thriving industry also engenders a great spirit of community.  The Minister of State referred to the Tidy Towns competition, for which towns make an extra effort.  It engenders a welcoming spirit in a community, a very important element.</P>
        <P>I trawled through the D&aacute;il debate on the Bill which stretched to 50 full pages and every Deputy who spoke seemed to have a wish list for the Minister of State.  I do not think we will hold him as long in the Seanad.  However, being from County Kerry, I must mention one or two items, on which I am sure my colleague, Senator Tom Sheahan, will agree with me.  Kerry is the premier tourism destination.  However, we are concerned about inward access.  I mentioned the following matter to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, when he came to the House for a different debate.  Kerry Airport provides an essen<Col N="980"/>tial lifeline for tourism in the south-west region.  What would be equally important, if we could get it working, is the Cork to Swansea ferry which is in dry dock until next April.  I hope it will be able to ply for trade in the months from April to September.  However, it will need hands-on assistance from the Department.  I understand competition issues arise, but there must be a way around these in order that the Government can become involved in an essential service which underpins much tourism activity in the region.</P>
        <P>People in County Kerry have a confidence which comes from experience.  Not all, but 99% of tourism events and products in the county give back more than they receive and it is well worth investing in them.  They include events such as Listowel Writers&rsquo; Week which is not as big as the Rose of Tralee Festival, but it draws many people in a niche market to the county and the country.  We also have St. John&rsquo;s Art Centre and the Seancha&iacute; Centre.  Some were driven by the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, when he was a backbencher and they are all very successful.  There is no fear of the Department not receiving value for money if it was to invest in Kerry tourism products.  There are a couple of white elephants in the county which are probably symptomatic of the madness of the Celtic tiger years when we threw money at products which one could have seen at the time would never be feasible in the long run.</P>
        <P>In stating my support for the Bill and extra investment, I urge the Minister of State to be careful and investigate rigorously each application received to ensure a product is viable and to know the management structures and business plans of those behind it.  The Department should examine successful centres such as the Book of Kells centre, Br&uacute; Bor&uacute; in which my colleague, Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, is involved, Killarney House and Muckross House, in which Senator Paul Coghlan is involved.  These are all good templates.  However, for every good application there might another which does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
        <P>This is a good time to pursue capital projects because construction costs are much lower than they were and, God knows, labour is easy enough to find.  I regret the fact that the Government has cut the capital budget by &euro;750 million at a time when it will not help the Minister of State in his work and could cost up to 9,000 jobs.  The previous Government was prepared to make a cut of only of 50% of this amount.  At the time it was considered to be swingeing and I wonder whether we have gone too far now.  I hope not.</P>
        <P>The question is often asked: why would people come to Ireland?  Clearly, it is not for the weather.  They come here because of our people, attitude and friendliness.  It can be disconcerting at times for people to go into hotels, restaurants and bars and be served by foreign nationals, but the essential welcome of the Irish is still on offer in management and comes across in the spirit and ethos.</P>
        <P>Getting value for money is very important.  Recently, I read that bed night costs in Dublin hotels had decreased by 10% in the past 12 months and this is great.  However, it is appalling that when a rock star such as Bruce Springsteen comes to town or a major match takes place, the cost of bed and breakfast accommodation increases from &euro;65 to more than &euro;200.  There is absolutely no justification for this.</P>
        <P>There will be certain opportunities which I know the Minister of State will grasp.  The lead-up to the 1916 Rising commemoration has huge tourism potential.  Obviously, we will commemorate these important events with the solemnity and dignity they deserve, but we can lighten up a little.  In the United States Independence Day is celebrated on 4 July and it is a fun day.  We could turn commemorations into an opportunity to welcome home the Diaspora.  We must get the balance right between showing respect and making a holiday of the occasion.</P><Col N="981"/>
        <P Just="Left">I am disappointed by the resignation of Mr. Hickey from the group established to find a spin-off for Ireland from the London Olympics.  Will the Minister of State comment on this because the commentary so far in the media has been negative.  What is going on?  Surely there is huge potential.  The individual in question has been around for a long time and speaks his mind.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan referred to the matter on the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister of State for his efforts.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an teach seo ar&iacute;s.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ag d&eacute;anamh obair iontach ar son tionscal turas&oacute;ireachta na t&iacute;re.  The Minister of State has demonstrated a great appetite and enthusiasm in his portfolio and I wish him continued success.</P>
        <P>This is a short Bill but one which will encourage great debate.  We are living in times of great economic constraints and restraint.  The Bill relates to the very important industry of tourism and seeks to increase the level of funding for the National Tourism Development Authority, or F&aacute;ilte Ireland, from &euro;65 million to &euro;150 million for the purposes of supporting enterprises and projects to increase tourist traffic and the development of tourism facilities and services throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Tourism will play a significant part in our economic recovery in the coming years.  It is the single biggest industry in the world and it is our duty to ensure we continue to vigorously maintain and develop the enormous tourism potential of the island of Ireland.  We all have a duty and a part to play in this regard.</P>
        <P>In 2007, some 7.7 million visitors came to Ireland, while in 2010 this figure was reduced to approximately 5.5 million.  The Government has taken measures to address this through a reduction of VAT, reducing employers&rsquo; PRSI, and changes in the system of visa applications for people who want to visit our country.  These changes are most welcome and have helped to increase the number of visitors this year to Ireland.</P>
        <P>American and Continental visitor numbers have increased this year by 15% to 16% but visitor numbers from Great Britain, our nearest neighbour and our biggest market, have only increased by 8%.  We must identify the issues and reasons for this in the short term and review our marketing strategy at an early date.</P>
        <P>One major issue which needs to be addressed to promote growth in the tourism sector is the cost of holidaying in Ireland compared to holidaying in our European counterparts.  Many airlines offer low-cost flights to European cities, some for as little as &euro;20.  Meanwhile, many cross-country buses and trains are extremely expensive and costs need to be lowered for Ireland to compete in this part of the tourism market.  A one-way ticket from Galway to Dublin costs the customer on average &euro;34.50, which is nearly &euro;70 euro for a return ticket.  In addition, one has accommodation costs which are usually on average around &euro;100 per person per night.  This is compared to holiday deals in locations such as the Algarve, which costs &euro;239 for seven nights including accommodation.  This is an up-to-date example quoted to a constituent of mine only this week.  These prices are highly competitive and have the ability to draw tourists abroad instead of allowing them the choice to holiday in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Evidence from the F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tourism Facts 2010&rdquo; suggests that most of our travelling overseas tourists came from Britain and mainland Europe.  This is obviously due to cheap air fares and accessibility.  However, if we want to increase the number of people visiting Ireland we must do something about the price of our hotels and guesthouses, as Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan mentioned earlier.</P>
        <P>In addition to this, many tourist destinations around Ireland tend to increase their prices dramatically when there is an event on in their area.  According to the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 25 <Col N="982"/>November, a Dublin hotel, which shall remain nameless, doubled its room prices as soon as Bruce Springsteen announced a forthcoming concert.  It raised its room rates from &euro;119 to &euro;250 for the night of the concert at the RDS, which incidentally does not take place until 17 July next year.  Nonetheless the hotel has already advertised these prices.  Something must be done to tackle this issue and perhaps the regulation of hotel costs would help.  Our goal should be trying to get more tourists into Ireland rather than driving them away with high costs.  Why would somebody come to Ireland to see Bruce Springsteen in Dublin, if they can travel to Spain to see the same concert and not have the burden of outrageous accommodation prices?  Since the Celtic tiger when prices soared, Ireland has become known across the board as an expensive country.  We do not want to be seen as ripping tourists off, but offering them value for money and a memorable holiday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have no doubt &mdash; neither has the Minister of State &mdash; that throughout our beautiful country we have a tourism product that is second to none.  From Donegal to Cork, and from my own county of Louth to Kerry, all areas have a wide variety of tourist attractions, in abundance, to offer the most discerning visitor.  Tourism is a labour intensive industry with approximately 180,000 sustainable jobs, as the Minister of State said.  Our hotel and catering staff are highly trained and efficient.  A hotel employing from 80 to 100 people is invaluable to any local economy, so we must endeavour to maintain and protect these jobs.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>All our respective areas and regions have something special to offer visitors.  In this respect, I recognise the part played by tidy towns groups throughout the country.  We receive favourable remarks from visitors who like to see our towns kept in good condition.  I would hate to see what our towns and countryside would be like if not for the work of the tidy towns movement.  For more than 40 years, I have been involved in that movement and know that litter continues to be a black spot for visitors in many parts.  That is a reflection on our nation and our people as a whole.  Many of us have a part to play in being responsible and not littering the streets of towns and cities.  What a saving it would mean if we did not have to sweep up in many beauty spots that area being littered by ourselves.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me not to mention my own home county of Louth, which has a new brand name &ldquo;Land of legends and full of life&rdquo;.  In 2009, the Louth Economic Forum was established under the auspices of the Louth County Development Board.  This forum is chaired by an independent chairman, Mr. Pauric White, a former CEO of the IDA and Senator Mary White&rsquo;s husband.  The forum has an overall ten-point plan identifying ten specific areas within its work programme over the next three years.  Its vision is to capitalise on Louth&rsquo;s unique location as the hub for the Boyne Valley as well as the Cooley, Mournes and Slieve Gullian region, which are two of F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s top tourist development destinations.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, to the House once again.  It is great to have him back and I wish him continued success in his important work.  As the Minister of State said in his address, this technical Bill aims to increase the amount of money that can be allocated to F&aacute;ilte Ireland to provide more state-of-the-art tourism facilities and a corresponding infrastructure.  On the last occasion the Minister of State attended the House, I spoke about the unique tourism product we have in Ireland, which cannot be matched by any other country.  As we live here, we may be inclined to take what we have for granted, thus not appreciate what lies outside our own front door.  I lived abroad for a while and on returning home I began to appreciate exactly what kind of tourism product we have.</P>
        <P>I am sure not many visitors to the country would forget the approach when arriving.  I often recall the plane emerging from the clouds approaching Shannon Airport and seeing the fantas<Col N="983"/>tic patchwork landscape underneath.  I have not seen that type of landscape in any other country I have travelled to, and I have travelled to a few.</P>
        <P>Peru struck me in thinking about how proper tourism infrastructure can be a significant revenue generator for an economy.  I do not want to upset any Peruvians that might be in the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery &mdash; there might not be too many &mdash; but that country does not have much to offer except for its tourist product.  What it has to offer is not a patch on what we have here.  In the museum next door there are bog bodies and the Ardagh chalice, and one can go from there to the hills and lakes of Kerry, as was mentioned so eloquently by Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan.  The Burren is in Clare and there are writers and poets in Dublin, along with Glasnevin Cemetery and Croke Park.  Donegal has Slieve League as mentioned in the speech, and Louth is the land of legends, as noted by Senator Brennan.  There are certainly a couple of legends from Louth in this House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesHeffernan"><NameTxt>Senator James Heffernan</NameTxt>
	<P>In my constituency there is the mystical Lough Gur and Ballyhoura mountain bike trails.  There are also various festivals taking place in many towns and villages throughout the country.  I could go on but it is vital we use this resource as best we can, getting the best return from it, especially given our current economic position.  This summer I travelled a good deal of the country and I echo what previous speakers have said, particularly with regard to the VAT rate.  I know the hotel and restaurant federations have asked that the savings be passed to the customer but I am not sure if that is happening to a significant extent.  The issue should be considered again for enforcement purposes.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State for bringing this Bill before the House and although funding may not be readily available, this Bill will allow the Government, when the time comes, to invest in the tourism infrastructure.  I support the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the Minister of State in the House as he has the bubble of energy for tourism.  I know how strongly he feels about it.  I grew up with the tourism business and my father built Red Island holiday camp in 1947 and I spent 13 years in that business.  One message I would like the Minister of State to get across comes from the business I learned on that occasion.  It is that everything done at that time was aimed to get the customer to return.  At my father&rsquo;s holiday camp, the customer paid on the day of arrival and there were no further charges and the customer did not need to carry any more money.  Everything was included.  The only way to judge success was if the guest came up to my father at the end of the week and said he or she would return the following year.  We must convince everybody in Ireland that tourism is about taking the long-term approach and asking how to get people to say they will come back next year.</P>
        <P>I spent five years as chairman of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s festival in Dublin and during those years we managed to increase the festivities from one day to three, although that was Government policy and I do not take credit for it.  It is amazing how one can identify this festival; some Japanese have told me that if they had an event like St. Patrick&rsquo;s day, they would use it to such an extent that the whole world would know about.  We have it and we must ensure we use it.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State did not really touch on food tourism.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland indicated to me last year that it recognised that people on holidays spent approximately four or five hours each day at a table, and what they eat and drink plays a large part in their trip.  Some parts of the country are booming as a result of this, particularly Kinsale, Waterford and where I come from in Howth, which has so many restaurants, tapas bars and other places to eat.  This will provide encouragement.</P><Col N="984"/>
        <P>What is missing from the proposal is a strategic plan for tourism development.  There is no strategic plan currently and the last strategic plan was formulated in 2003.  The world has changed much since, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the recent capital spending programme, dealing with 2012 to 2016.  Tourism is set to receive &euro;81 million but that is a repackaging of previous commitments.  Some of the decisions and major projects, such as the Book of Kells visitor centre in Trinity College, the Viking triangle in Waterford, the great western green way in Mayo, King John&rsquo;s castle and the Limerick river side, as well as Derrynane House in Killarney, were dealt with a good while ago.  They are not new and I am a little sceptical of attempts to frame this as a new investment in tourism.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned that the planned investment in higher education for the sector has been put on hold indefinitely.  The Dublin Institute of Technology move to Grangegorman has been stalled and the planned development of a new hospitality, tourism and culinary arts building at the institute of technology in Tallaght has also been deferred.  I spoke recently to Mr. Raymond Keaney, the lecturer in tourism and hospitality in Tallaght.  A great job is being done in those areas but it is a step backwards not to invest in the sector.  Why does Ireland not have a world class hospitality and tourism infrastructure in higher education, or an Irish Cornell Hotel School equivalent?  The only place we have that is close is Ballymaloe, and I understand from Ms Darina Allen that people are queuing up in London for graduates from the Ballymaloe school.  They just walk into jobs because they are so highly regarded.  We need investment in the sector.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister of State to work on a new strategic plan for the future.  Australia developed a plan in 2009, addressing issues such as excellence in products and service delivery to ensure a high-value destination, measuring performance to track progress and support strategic priorities.  Investment would be facilitated along with regulatory reform to ensure the product remains competitive in the global market.  The market should note such plans and a strategy should be formulated by a much wider range of interest groups, including opinion leaders and advisory bodies.  There should be development from previous plans involving hospitality, tourism, retail, arts and culture, transport, food, heritage, environment, agriculture and the marine, technology and education.  Bodies involved should include chambers of commerce, local authorities, media, the ESRI and Forf&aacute;s.</P>
        <P>The Seanad would be the ideal venue to start a debate on a new strategic plan for tourism, and perhaps that is what we are having today.  We need to act now as international tourist arrivals worldwide are set to almost double from 952 million in 2010 to 1.8 billion within 18 years.  The EU is supporting initiatives for the tourism industry for the first time and we should not be left behind.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s view on developing a strategic plan in that regard.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State indicate how he is helping tourism businesses move to the digital age and find out the many possibilities available if they improve knowledge of information technology?  Will some of the funding mentioned by the Minister of State be diverted in this way?  There is a project entitled Digital Tourism Wales, which seeks to assist tourism businesses and supporting organisations in adapting new technology to meet visitor expectations and become more competitive in the market as a result.  For example, money will be available to help businesses in the web 2.0 current, and new applications, such as Google Places, can be used to make businesses more visible.  There is much we can learn from other countries by examining what they are doing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is an appropriate time to raise again the state of the National Archives.  They are part of the tourism business.  Not only do they hold much of our history but they present a great <Col N="985"/>opportunity in terms of people who come to this country to trace their roots, in particular from America and across the Atlantic.  The buildings are in a bad state.  I hope the Minister of State is examining solutions to the problem.  Options also arise with buildings under the remit of NAMA that might be appropriate to house this vital resource.  We cannot let it deteriorate further because of the many opportunities it presents.</P>
        <P>There are other things we can do.  I congratulate RTE which made a series of programme last year called &ldquo;Tracks and Trails&rdquo;.  It is doing it again this year.  The series focused on six areas last year and another six will be chosen this year.  I was involved in the programme on Howth.  I learned a great deal about Howth but I also learned how broadcasting such programmes encourages internal tourism.  It is only a half hour programme but I spoke to one man who had brought out a bus load of tourists just to walk the tracks and trails around Howth.  The group of 35 ate in a local restaurant &mdash; there is a great selection of restaurants here.  That was brought about by RTE sponsoring Mr. Jim Sherwin to produce the &ldquo;Tracks and Trails&rdquo; series.</P>
        <P>RTE also did a good job in Drogheda.  Senator Brennan referred to County Louth.  He tended to focus on north Louth rather than south Louth.  A man called Mr. Noel Toolan has put his heart and soul into reminding everyone that Drogheda is on the Boyne and it is the bedroom for the tourism business of the Boyne Valley.  It is a reminder that RTE, a State agency, is able to do something in its public service broadcasting mission and in the case of that series it is doing a very good job.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has his heart in the right place and the correct objectives.  Let us ensure we do not lose this opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and compliment him on the job he is doing.  As other Members have stated, his enthusiasm and energy is well noted in the tourism sector.</P>
        <P>The Bill is to be welcomed.  It shows that the Government intends that one of the cornerstones that will bring this country out of recession is tourism.  It is making provision for that, on which I compliment the Government, rather than doing it in a rushed manner, off the cuff.</P>
        <P>Senators referred to the disappointing number of visitors from Great Britain.  I spoke to a hotelier in my part of County Kerry recently and asked him how business was going during the year.  He said he had a very good year.  When I asked where the majority of tourists had come from, he said it was Great Britain.  I asked him how he had achieved that.  He replied that the hotel chain opened an office in Great Britain and it had its own ambassadors on the ground selling its hotels and County Kerry.  The endeavour was very successful.  I am a firm advocate of that type of ambassadorial approach rather than spending millions on television advertisements.  That approach does not work for me.  It would not entice me to go somewhere.  I am much more impressed when I meet someone who talks up an area and portrays its beauty and positive characteristics.</P>
        <P>I will not reveal outside the House that I never knew where Haggardstown was until Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy was elected to the House.  Not only do I know about Haggardstown now, I know about Sexton&rsquo;s in Haggardstown.  If we can take that approach abroad there is significant potential, especially in the UK which is just across the water.  One can get there in an hour.</P>

	<P>It would be a great achievement if we could introduce that model of having ambassadors on the ground selling this country and the positive things about it.  I urge the Minister of State to push that approach if he can.</P><Col N="986"/>
        <P>I am pleased about the assessment process for the tourism capital investment programme.  A capital investment appraisal group has been set up.  I am also pleased to see the checks and balances that have been put in place.  The issue has been raised several times recently as to whether we got value for money.  My colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan, referred to white elephants that exist not only in Kerry but throughout the country that were developed under tourism capital investment projects.  I welcome the appraisal group and the checks and balances that have been introduced between the group, the Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Between financial evaluations, due diligence and legal requirements the assessment of projects is well covered.</P>
        <P>I note that the capital investment programme includes beach management works.  On his next trip to Kerry the Minister of State must come to Rossbeigh where 3 acres of sand dunes have been washed away.  The community is not being allowed to reinstate them as it is being prevented from doing so by the local authority on the basis that nature is taking its course.  If nature has its way then a mile and a half of sand dunes will disappear.  I accept that ultimate responsibility probably lies with the Office of Public Works but the Minister of State must come and see what has happened given that capital investment programmes include beach management works.</P>
        <P>Kerry has had a good year in tourism.  There is no point in beating around the bush.  One could never please some people in the tourism sector.  We will take that with a pinch of salt.  One area however that is letting us down is conferences.  I spoke recently to the president of Killarney Chamber of Commerce, Thomas Randles, who is a hotelier.  He said there is great potential for conferences in south Kerry especially and the south of Ireland, but the one big problem is access from Cork to Kerry.  The N21, which has a bypass at Macroom, is a poor road.  He said that they have collected people who plan conferences from Cork Airport and by the time they get to Macroom they have made up their minds that they will not go to Kerry for the conference.  I encourage the Minister of State to do anything he can.  The N21 artery into the county is blocking further potential growth in tourism.  I commend the Minister of State.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  We agree with the terms of the Bill.  From experience we have all seen F&aacute;ilte Ireland and its predecessor, Bord F&aacute;ilte, make an exceptional contribution to the development of tourism here.  Likewise, Tourism Ireland, covering the whole island, is doing exactly the same.  Many would say tourism is the jewel in our crown because it has been so good to Ireland.  It has generated finance from visitors and through domestic spending.  We see an increase in domestic spending, particularly during the current recession when people are spending their holidays and money at home which keeps revenue within the State.</P>
        <P>Tourism is not a single entity or product.  It is made up of diverse and varied elements which make Ireland attractive as a tourist destination.  When we speak about sustaining and <Col N="987"/>developing the industry, we must remember the number of players involved.  We need to give all of them a voice, which is what we are doing today.  We are endeavouring to reflect this and echo what we are hearing on the ground.</P>
        <P>It was sad to see that our value for money rating had dropped from 62% to 28% in 2009.  However, we did not need a survey to show us this.  We felt it ourselves and knew that was the position.  We might not have been killing the goose that laid the golden eggs, but neither were we feeding it too well or looking after it.  We must continue to be cautious in this regard.  I know of a particular part of the country in which there is a car park at a tourist attraction.  If I park there for half an hour, I pay &euro;4.80.  Tourists are not as conscious of the price of large items &mdash; they pay hundreds of euro in getting here or on accommodation &mdash; but they are aware of a small element such as that car parking charge, which does not seem right.  That is what sticks with a visitor.  In the same way, discourtesy will strike a chord.  We travel abroad and know that is what we remember.  We notice if a waiter pulls away a plate too quickly or does not answer a question.  There are large and small issues.  At one time it was suggested visitors to Ireland should be allowed to travel free on public transport, which was tried.  However, a charge of &euro;4.80 for parking runs counter to the spirit of making the visitor feel welcome in small ways.  We probably need to keep our eye very carefully on this aspect.</P>
        <P>All Senators will speak about their own regions.  I will mention Shannon Airport.  When we lost the American flights to Shannon Airport, we undermined tourism in that entire region.  I come from Cashel which has the Rock of Cashel.  We can remember when the flow of visitors from Shannon Airport extended to the entire region.  We cannot go back to that time, but I will make a suggestion to the Minister of State.  Could F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland not engage in advance with tour operators?  The tour operators make the decisions for a major part of the business, usually 12 months or more in advance.  They often send their representatives to Dublin only.  Every time I ask a taxi driver how is the tourism doing, he or she tells me it is wonderful.  That tells me it must be good on the ground.  However, that is the case in Dublin all year round because there are so many activities outside the four peak months.</P>
        <P>We must be fair to the rest of Ireland.  In the case of my region, we took away the advantage of flights to Shannon Airport.  I accept that F&aacute;ilte Ireland cannot make tour operators visit a particular part of the country.  It is for ourselves to do this.  We must make tour operators aware that if they come to our area, they will find top-class hotel accommodation, attractions and good food, all of which are available, but tourists must be encouraged to come.  In that context, we would become much more competitive.</P>
        <P>I am a little worried that some hotels are becoming too competitive.  In the recession they are reducing prices simply to have cash-flow.  In such cases, banks are very often in the background and there is a danger that standards will be lowered.  I recently visited a hotel which was obviously in examinership or receivership.  No light was evident in the window.  When I walked in, I found that the lights in the lobby had been switched off.  My wife and I were the only two diners in the restaurant.  The person serving was also doing the cooking.  This had been a good hotel in its day.  If we are not careful, I can see standards dropping in the current price auction.  Many hoteliers have said they do not have a problem with the banks, are not in NAMA and are doing good business, but they cannot do it at the rates the bank hotels are charging.  That might seem a strange point to make in this debate, but I am looking at the long term.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Bed and breakfast establishments were excellent as part of the tourism product because they provided a different experience.  Now, they are finding the market <Col N="988"/>difficult because hotel prices have come down.  Could we not look after the bureaucracy by which bed and breakfast establishment owners must pay all of the increased charges to keep their establishments open?  Some 40% of bed and breakfast establishments must have closed in the last two years.  If they close, they will not reopen and we will need them in the future.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well.  I agree with Senator Feargal Quinn that the Minister of State is the bubbly and energetic person we need.  We have excellent infrastructure and officials.  It is clear that the Government is focused on sustaining what we have, in which regard I wish the Minister of State the best of luck.</P>

	<P>I join other speakers in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, who is a man of action.  There is no better man to get the tourism business moving.</P>
        <P>It is significant to see the Government is preparing for further investment in the tourism product.  We all welcome the significant increase in the numbers visiting the country this year, but we cannot afford to rest on our laurels.  As Senator Feargal Quinn said, it is all about attracting repeat business.  We all want to make sure those who visit Ireland have a good experience and come back.  I hope the Government will consider extending the VAT reduction beyond 2013, as it is having a significant impact.  In the majority of cases, hotels and restaurants are passing on the reduction to the customer.  The reduction in employer&rsquo;s PRSI has also resulted in a significant increase in visitor numbers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Everyone mentions his or her own region.  I agree with what Senator Labhras &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said about tourism numbers in Dublin.  We need to see that business spread to the regions.  In my own county of Galway, one of the most beautiful in the country, Galway city and Connemara do very well.  However, while parts of east Galway which I represent have wonderful attractions, we do not seem to be on F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s radar to the same extent as other parts of the county or country.  In Ballinasloe we have a fine marina in which the State invested significantly some years ago.  Ballinasloe is on the River Suck which runs into the River Shannon.  One can travel up the River Shannon through Shannonbridge to Ballinasloe.  However, we have a little problem and I hope the Minister of State will be able to help us.  There is a Bord na M&oacute;na bridge between Shannonbridge and Ballinasloe which, when water levels are high, prevents cruisers of a certain size coming up the river to Ballinasloe.  We need the Minister of State&rsquo;s help to get a number of organisations, including F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Bord na M&oacute;na and Waterways Ireland, together.  We also need some money.  A solution to the problem, without having to <Col N="989"/>dismantle the bridge, has been found, but it will cost a significant amount of money.  We need the Minister of State&rsquo;s help to resolve that issue in order that we can increase the number of tourists coming to east Galway, particularly Ballinasloe in which we also have fine conference centres.  If other parts of the country are not suitable for the holding of conferences, we have a fine new hotel in Ballinasloe that would be capable of handling large conferences.</P>
        <P>I salute the efforts of Tidy Towns organisations throughout the country, which help to make our countryside more beautiful.  However, these voluntary organisations and local authorities are stretched and could do with assistance.  I appeal to the Minister of State to talk to his Cabinet colleagues about increasing the numbers on the various schemes so that in the peak summer months people will be available to help with village enhancement, signage improvements, tidying and improving infrastructure for tourists.  There are innovative ways to do this without imposing additional costs on the State because many of these people would love to contribute if they got the opportunity.</P>
        <P>The 100th anniversary of significant historic events will take place in Ireland over the next decade.  I am sure the Minister of State is making plans to maximise tourist numbers in association with those events.  Hopefully, when we get tourists into Dublin to celebrate, we will activate plans to scatter those visitors to the regions and capitalise on the huge opportunities to increase the number of visitors and tourists.  I support what Senator Sheahan said with regard to television advertising versus people on the ground and the ambassadorial role that some hotels play in England.  That  is worthy of consideration.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State continued success and advise him to keep in touch with the Seanad as Members would like to have a regular opportunity to have some input in the plans he will put together.  When we put the collective wisdom of the House together, we can come up with some good and innovative ideas.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Mullins for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He attempted to join this House many years ago, but fortunately for his sake and that of officials, he was unsuccessful on that occasion.  The Seanad would never have been the same.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>If the country needs anything at this time, it needs jobs, hope and a feel-good factor.  Tourism can help provide all of these.  The Minister of State has responsibility for tourism and sport in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and tourism is the area which can produce jobs almost instantaneously with a little help and innovative thinking.  Notwithstanding the weather we have in Ireland, the majority of tourists come not for a suntan but for our sites, our culture, our history, our rivers and our lakes and we can encourage their numbers to increase in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State on their efforts to date, but we cannot rest on our laurels.  It is pleasing to learn that tourist numbers have increased, but we must be realistic.  There are problems that need to be addressed urgently.  We should not fool ourselves about Ireland being good value for tourism.  It may be slightly better value than it was, but much of the product is still overpriced.  Consumers, whether Irish or European, are now restricted to a limited budget and value for money is at the top of their agenda.  It is disappointing to see some hotels and restaurants continuing to charge way over the top.  Reference was made earlier to hotels which dramatically increase prices when concerts are on or for race weeks, etc.  The Minister of State should outlaw this practice.</P><Col N="990"/>
        <P>The Minister of State has often spoken about the Olympics and the possibility of spin-off tourism for Ireland.  I watched &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; last night which covered some of the debate in the other House on this subject.  It appears the statistics and figures with regard to this spin-off are disappointing.  I urge the Minister of State to keep up the efforts on the basis that there will be millions of people wandering around London during the Olympics.  We had hopes of some teams doing their training in Ireland, but if that is not successful, many of the visitors to the Olympics should be encouraged to come to Ireland through additional marketing.</P>
        <P>It is easy for me to spend the Government&rsquo;s money for it, but sometimes it is a question of spending money that otherwise would not have been spent.  People come to Ireland in their thousands on the ferries every year and bring great business here.  Would it be possible for these people to get some excise relief on fuel they buy for their vehicles while here?  If they did not come and spend their money here, this fuel would not have been purchased.  Would it be possible to provide an excise rebate scheme for people who bring their cars over on the ferries, a voucher or some other system that would not be abused?  This might be a way of encouraging people to bring their cars to Ireland.  I know that when the Cork-Swansea ferries stops its services at the end of the season, this causes major difficulties.  We need to consider what can be done in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  His energy and enthusiasm are always admirable.  In fact, people need to look out in Leinster House when he is approaching as he moves at such speed.</P>
        <P>My concern with regard to this Bill is whether there is anything else in it that is new.  Tourism is a business where revenues are down 31% from their peak, the number of tourists is down 24% and the number of jobs lost is 40,000.  The figure of 180,000 employed in the industry mentioned by the Minister of State once stood at 220,000.  The statements from the agencies show far too much complacency.  Irish tourism is in an emergency situation.  My concern with regard to the Bill is that it seeks an extra &euro;85 million.  Beginning with the words &ldquo;An Act to amend&rdquo;, in 85 words it looks for an extra &euro;85 million.  In a situation where we must borrow money from the IMF and others, we must ask if this is good value for money and why the tourism sector is failing so badly.</P>
        <P>Looking at the numbers provided by Oireachtas researchers, we see that when revenue was collapsing by 31% and numbers by 24%, the two agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, spent nearly &euro;500 million on themselves, 63% of which was on general operating expenses.  As a former director of Bord F&aacute;ilte, this strikes me as significant.  That organisation was tremendously obsessed with increasing its budget and engaging in PR on its own behalf and seemed to be divorced from the industry it was supposed to be serving.  I would be worried about any agency that was spending such a significant amount on operating expenses and suggest the Minister of State should consider getting a good slice of that money and investing it in projects to back up his proposals.</P>
        <P>I have also always had concerns with regard to marketing spend as approximately one third of the budget goes on that.  A question was asked as to why, if when somebody stays in a hotel and the hotel gets the money, there is an onus on the Government to spend a budget of more than &euro;150 million over three years marketing those people&rsquo;s products.  Does this produce a dependency culture in Irish tourism so that instead of putting money into the Exchequer where it is so badly needed, these organisations are always looking for grants?  As the Minister of State knows well, some of the marketing trips abroad attract adverse criticism.</P>
        <P>The Department needs to radicalise F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland as they have been too complacent in the face of what is, by any standards, a drastic decline in employment in the <Col N="991"/>sector.  They have a large budget which does not seem to be giving us any results and it is for that reason I have submitted an amendment to the Bill.  Given the record of these two bodies in spending a large amount of money, almost &euro;500 million in a three-year period, I am concerned that we could be throwing good money after bad since this spend has resulted in 31% less revenue in the sector.  These bodies must prove to the Department, to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and to the IMF that this is a useful way to spend the money and that the industry can revive.  Mistakes have been made and people have mentioned the NAMA hotels and that the National Convention Centre will involve an annual loss.  It is all right to mention it as a vital part of infrastructure, but it imposes a burden on the Exchequer.  It will be interesting to see what the loss will be.</P>
        <P>Everybody is concerned by whether tourists see Ireland as good value for money.  In 2000, some 23% did, but by 2009 this number was down to 3%.  The number of tourists who thought it was poor, fair or very poor value for money rose from 39% to 71%.  There is a lot that needs to happen in this regard and I admire the Minister of State&rsquo;s energy to make it happen.  There are a lot of complacent people in offices close to the Minister of State&rsquo;s which need a very big shake up.  That applies to this sector also.  It is okay to say the tourism industry has great potential, but it has performed abysmally since the middle part of the last decade.  Cranking it up again might require radical action and all the energy the Minister of State embodies.  Is that urgency matched in the industry, the Department and the promotional bodies?  They strike me as being in denial about the extent of the decline and do not exhibit the same energy as the Minister of State in seeking to reverse the decline.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire agus ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo, d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht at&aacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach.  T&aacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; turas&oacute;ireachta iontach t&aacute;bhachtach sa t&iacute;r seo le go dtiocfaimid chuig a ch&eacute;ile.</P>
        <P>While the skills and expertise of the Minister of State have been mentioned, the fact that he is also a singing Minister of State has not.  I agree with Senator Michael Mullins because the Minister of State seems to have expertise in dealing with bridges over troubled waters.  He might try to look, therefore, at the bridge in Ballinasloe as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>In the current economic climate the importance of tourism cannot be overstated.  As an indigenous economic sector, it is unique in that it has an impact on all areas of the economy, both rural and urban.  It is a very significant employer and requires minimal import content to produce its output.  The rationale for increased investment in the sector is particularly strong and to be supported.  T&aacute;imid ag tac&uacute; leis an mBille seo ar an mbun&uacute;s sin.</P>
        <P>The recent performance of the industry is encouraging.  However, for it to keep making a positive contribution to the economy, strategies will be necessary to make the right strategic choices in the coming period, a matter to which Senator Feargal Quinn alluded.  It is essential that a measured approach is taken when deciding on priorities.</P>
        <P>Since the 1990s when there was rapid growth, a number of indicators &mdash; the number of tourist visits and revenue generated &mdash; suggest the tourism sector has experienced a period of decline in recent years.  During the period 2005-10 the number of overseas visitors and holidaymakers to Ireland peaked in 2007 at 7.7 million and then declined year on year to 5.8 million in 2010.  The number of visitors from each of our three largest markets, Britain, mainland Europe and North America, has declined year on year since 2007, although the number of domestic trips actually increased in the same period.</P>
        <P>Tourism&rsquo;s contribution to the broader economy in terms of GNP has remained relatively stable at between 3.7% and 4%.  The industry&rsquo;s role in promoting balanced regional and rural development is extremely important.  As mentioned, the River Shannon, the east, the midlands, <Col N="992"/>the west and the north west, in particular, need to be included in an inclusive strategy to maximise their potential.</P>
        <P>Dialogue is necessary between the Minister of State and his Government colleagues because the provision of infrastructure is key.  If we do not provide infrastructure to make destinations accessible, particularly in the west, it goes without saying fewer people will travel to them.  From talking to people, the recent cutbacks in the capital expenditure programme were a sore disappointment to many involved in the tourism trade in the west.  The western rail corridor and the A5 road project which are essential to make the west, the north west in particular, more accessible have been long-fingered indefinitely.</P>
        <P>In addition, Galway Airport which serves tourist destinations in the west remains under threat of closure.  Some 85 of its flights are international and the region would lose &euro;19 million in tourist revenue if it were to close.  I hope the Minister of State will put pressure on his colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to reinstate the OPEX grants which were available to the airport to keep it viable.  The airport employs 180 people who contribute &euro;2 million to the local economy, not to mention the value of the airport to the area generally.</P>
        <P>Equally, in respect of the A5 road project, the Government has attempted to back out of its commitments under the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement to provide funding for this crucial project.  It is worth noting that Deputy Pearse Doherty&rsquo;s report, Awakening the West, states the number of overseas visitors to the area has declined by 30% since 1999.  In making the north west more attractive &mdash; it is one of our gems &mdash; we must make it more competitive in terms of infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The tourism industry continues to be a major employer, with the CSO and F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimating that those working in the tourism and hospitality sector make up somewhere between 7% and 10% of total employment.  The level has decreased in the past couple of years.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a technical one to facilitate F&aacute;ilte Ireland in continuing its business.  However, it should form the basis for a response to the tourism product development strategy produced by F&aacute;ilte Ireland which outlines that competitor destinations in northern Europe are investing substantial sums of public money in tourism.  In Norway, for example, the level of public investment in tourism has been running at &euro;43 million annually.  In Scotland the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency spends up to &pound;22 million annually on tourism.  This investment is in addition to the &pound;52 million provided by way of government grant support by the Visit Scotland agency.</P>
        <P>Visit Scotland is seeking to encourage the Scottish hospitality business to enhance its marketing campaigns.  This initiative aims to address the issue of capacity utilisation in the industry and is centred on increasing the occupancy rate rather than building more hotels.  Similar initiatives here would need to address the overcapacity issue, in particular outside Dublin.  This opportunity should be taken to involve in a meaningful way the sector and individual communities in the development of our tourism product.  Visit Scotland is seeking to encourage the hospitality industry to become involved in cross-selling to involve local businesses in promoting and developing a comprehensive tourism package.  Private businesses can promote themselves on the website, appear in literature such as pamphlets and receive access to information on training and skills to enhance the tourism experience.  This model should be further developed here to include the local community, including the community and voluntary sectors, as well as local businesses in a collective effort to develop and improve their tourism product.</P>
        <P>The Department and its agencies must look at how big ticket items can provide the nucleus of an improved product.  There is huge potential in every corner of the country for product <Col N="993"/>development.  Competitor countries are placing substantial public investment in tourism product innovation.  Examples include the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Eden project near Bristol.  These investments by municipalities and other public authorities provide iconic attractions which, in turn, offer compelling reasons to motivate visitors to choose a particular destination.  In a similar vein, individual major events which have a significant tourism impact have also received public investment in competitor countries.  The Edinburgh International Festival, for example, receives &pound;5 million of public funds annually and plays an important role in attracting visitors.  For Ireland, cultural tourism continues to hold huge potential.  In this regard, we must continue to support the likes of F&eacute;ile Eal&aacute;ion na Gaillimhe, etc.</P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I have great hopes for, and confidence in, him in terms of the passion he shows in this portfolio.  From monitoring his career so far, he strikes me as a man who does not operate within the box, but who is well capable of thinking outside it.  That is what is needed in the Department to help it to reach its potential and tourism to play its part in the renewal of the economy.  The set piece of a Minister being given a speech to read and being told that this is the policy will not work.  I know the Minister of State is the kind of person who can operate outside that context.</P>
        <P>We all support the Bill and the increased budget.  It could be greater, as tourism could provide the most results and quickest wins.  There are good initiatives and great people in F&aacute;ilte Ireland and in the other agencies, including a fellow county man, Mr. John Concannon, director of marketing at F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Mr. Paul Keely and so on.  They are doing excellent work.</P><Col N="994"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State will not mind me mentioning that the concept of The Gathering predates this Administration.  The spoils it will produce will be of assistance.  This morning, Senators and I attended a breakfast at the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland where a group with which I am involved, Team Sligo, was tapping into Sligo&rsquo;s Dublin-based diaspora in a tourism context.  The 90 people in the room represented 60 companies in Dublin, including some large international companies.  If 20 of those companies had their annual conferences in Sligo next year, it would have an impact on tourism in the area, be it mid-week or weekend.  Some of the people involved could be encouraged to return for a further weekend.  This is just on the domestic tourism side.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the commercial or tourism attach&eacute;s throughout our embassies are also promoting The Gathering concept, calling in members of the Irish Diaspora on the corporate tourism side and suggesting that 20% of their companies bring one of their annual events to Ireland, be it to Galway, Sligo, Dublin or wherever.  Under no circumstances should the National Convention Centre lose when one considers the kinds of events with which Irish people are involved internationally.  Through The Gathering concept, we could suggest that events be held in the centre.  There are many opportunities on the corporate side.  This will require thinking outside the box.  Governments and politicians have hampered many civil servants with regard to connecting boxes within Departments.  Remove the barriers, connect the boxes and get things moving.</P>
        <P>We need to spend a great deal of money on educational tourism, which presents a significant opportunity.  India and China have many millions of wealthy people who would like to travel but who do not know much about Ireland.  We need to tell them and put on free flights for them.  It might sound ridiculous in the extreme in a time of such austerity, but we should put aside a portion of our capital budget to pay for 50,000 seats from the Chinese and Indian markets.  According to a briefing document on this debate, eight to 12 jobs are created by every few million euro of capital expenditure.  For every &euro;1 million spent by tourists, 13 jobs are created, but this fact has not been mentioned in today&rsquo;s debate.</P>
        <P>India and China are developing markets.  While they have vast populations and a high proportion of their citizenry is poor, a large number of their people compared with our population are wealthy and willing to travel.  We need to make an effort in this regard.  People could visit Ireland to learn English or for other reasons.</P>
        <P>There will be 19 flights per week between Ireland and Abu Dhabi.  What are we doing in this context?  The Minister of State mentioned the visa waiver scheme, but it needs to be relaxed further so that we might encourage people to visit Ireland.  There is a great deal of wealth in Abu Dhabi and its people have a natural affiliation with Ireland, as they view us as being pro-family.  Arab nations are interested in families and in how Irish people go about their social and daily lives.  We need to tap into their interest.  This is not a niche that one will see in a tourism brochure or at a fair, but it is something that we must start doing.</P>
        <P>In terms of sports tourism, I was involved in the concept of bringing the World Rally Championship to Ireland.  I needed to jog alongside the then Minister, Mr. John O&rsquo;Donoghue, to try to get his attention.  The concept alone of Ireland bidding for the championship was laughable, much less winning  it, much less again holding it in County Sligo.  He would have hoovered it up for his constituency in County Kerry had he thought winning it was possible.  It was the best championship in the world at the time.  However, this was an issue for F&aacute;ilte Ireland and other bodies because rallying was not one of the chosen sports &mdash; the Volvo boat race, golf and so on &mdash; of the gin and tonic belts.</P>
        <P>In these times of austerity when one has no money, the currency is people.  Some 800 million people watched delayed coverage of the closing stages of the World Rally Championship at <Col N="995"/>Mullaghmore in County Sligo.  Instead of looking at Benbulben, those 800 million could have been looking at Slieve League or Croagh Patrick.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should pursue the ten most televised events in the world.  They are not the big ones or as large as one would believe.  Some 800 million people watch motor sport worldwide.  I am not particularly an aficionado of it, but I got involved and, as a result, we had successful events.  Unfortunately, we lost the championship due to personality issues, but it can be won again.  An annual Government investment of &euro;2 million could bring a round of the world championship to Ireland.  I want it for the north west, but let us consider the bigger picture.  Some 800 million people watched the delayed coverage of the final, but 50 million watched it live.  This was more people than watched the rugby world cup final.  It puts matters into perspective.</P>
        <P>I have confidence in the Minister of State.  He will be told that the boxes cannot be connected, that something cannot be done and that the money is not there.  For years, I watched him slaughter Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers.  Many times he was right to do so.  He should do the same to those who tell him this cannot be done and join the boxes.  <i>Carpe diem</i>.  The Minister of State can make the difference.</P>

	<P>I am grateful for the extra time and will be as brief as possible.  I welcome the Minister of State and compliment him on the fine job he has been doing in representing Ireland.  In particular, I am green with envy whenever I see him turning up at sporting events in various parts of the world.  I am unsure as to whether he will attend Kiev for tomorrow&rsquo;s draw, but it is unlikely.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope it will be a good draw for Ireland and that we will go to Poland rather than Ukraine.  I have nothing against Ukraine, but the past ten years have created a history and empathy between Ireland and Poland and we have similar culture and background.</P>
        <P>Once per month, I broadcast a programme for RTE called &ldquo;The Irish Abroad&rdquo;.  While wearing my broadcaster&rsquo;s hat last week, I interviewed a lady from the Irish Cultural Foundation, which is based in Poznan in western Poland.  She has also been a Tourism Ireland representative in recent years.  She is Polish and neither she nor her husband has Irish connections, but they started this initiative approximately ten years ago.  Her comments were interesting.  The Minister of State might be interested from a west of Ireland perspective.  Families&rsquo; visits to and from Ireland are statistically difficult to quantify, as they stay with family and friends rather than in hotels or other establishments.  According to the woman, though, the number of family visits is growing in two particular areas.  First, the pilgrimage market to, for example, Knock via its airport is becoming increasingly significant among Poles.  Second, the angling market is proving significant.  The lady in question is at the heart of the tourism industry and is promoting Ireland.  Perhaps the Minister of State might take this information on board and make further inquiries.  Like me, he has an interest in increasing the numbers visiting the west and north west, particularly given the region&rsquo;s angling.  Will he comment on the level of investment in that market?  He mentioned that onshore and lakeside facilities would be improved.</P>
        <P>Regarding the visa waiver programme, Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s comments on China were interesting.  Last week, newspapers reported the head of Brown Thomas in Ireland as saying that an increasing amount of its business in the past two years was from Chinese visitors.  Will <Col N="996"/>the Minister of State comment in this regard?  The visitors are buying high-end jewellery and high fashion.  Therefore, the Senator was right about them being wealthy.</P>
        <P>I understand that some 16 countries are involved in the visa waiver programme, which has been geared towards people who will attend the Olympics.  The Minister of State might clarify whether his Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are pursuing job creation initiatives that would encourage business people who would visit London regardless, to extend their visits to Ireland.  Deputy Kelleher, the former Minister of State with responsibility for trade, fought valiantly but unsuccessfully with the last Administration &mdash; I will make no apology for saying this &mdash; for the visa waiver programme that the current Government has since introduced.  He argued that a businessman visiting London with an interest in travelling to Ireland could not come to Dublin to investigate job opportunities or job creation initiatives.</P>
        <P>A businessman coming to London with an interest in coming to Ireland could not come to Dublin to examine job opportunities or job creation initiatives.  However, he could go to Newry, five or six miles from the Border, with no problem because his visa extended to the United Kingdom.  I know this is outside the brief of the Minister of State but I wonder if there are initiatives to encourage business people to come in and to extend their stay in Ireland with the possibility of job creation.</P>
        <P>In the context of the capital investment programme, I welcome the walking and cycling routes.  As a former chairman of F&aacute;ilte Ireland North West, it came to my attention that there are some 15 million people in the UK alone who subscribe to being walkers.  They wish to take part in walking holidays and they do so mainly in the Lake District.  This is a potentially huge number of people, and from the north west to Kerry in the south west we have the topography and geography suitable for an increase in the number of walking trails.  Perhaps the Minister of State can comment on that.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Will any national lottery money be provided under the capital investment programme?  I understand that the number of categories has been extended in recent months.  I am putting this idea to the Minister of State out of the blue.  Could any surplus in new categories be diverted to areas where there is a shortfall?  Every Minister is trying to get as much out of the central Exchequer.  The Slieve League proposal is wonderful and competes with the Cliffs of Moher.  Anyone who has an opportunity to go to west Donegal should go there.  Under the capital programme, the iconic attractions that are a priority for the north-west tourism region are Benbulben in Sligo and Glencar in Leitrim.  I know that a significant amount of money has been given to Leitrim County Council under the watch of the Minister of State for the development of the Glencar waterfall, which is synonymous with Yeats.  As chairman of Leitrim Tourism, I welcome these initiatives and want to let the Minister of State know that tourism is alive and well in Leitrim, as it is in other parts of the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made a note to personally congratulate the Minister of State because I knew he was under severe pressure from various other projects and from the Exchequer viewpoint.  I pay a personal compliment to the Minister of State for visiting my home town, Drumshanbo, in the company of my colleague, Councillor Enda McGloin, and also for the provision of &euro;268,000, which amounts to 80% of the cost of refurbishing and improving the swimming facilities, and providing more disabled access along with a range of refurbishment that will be central to enhancing the tourism product of Drumshanbo and mid-Leitrim.</P><Col N="997"/>
        <P>In the context of this Bill, the cap of &euro;150 million is a vote of confidence in the future of the tourism product in Ireland, notwithstanding the fact that some &euro;44 million has been invested in tourism since 2004.  The fact that this is being increased from &euro;60 million to &euro;150 million suggests a strong vote of confidence.  I pay a warm and personal tribute to Mr. Niall Gibbons, the CEO of Tourism Ireland.  I declare an interest in that I know him very well and, like the Minister of State, I worked with him through the years.  I also pay tribute to the team of Tourism Ireland, which is charged with encouraging more visitors to Ireland.  Tourism Ireland launched a new marketing initiative this week for 2012 and perhaps the Minister of State has a view on it.  The marketing initiative will double the number of visitors from key markets in Ireland.  I have complete confidence in the Minister of State and the continuing success he is bringing to his tourism brief.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me if I did not pay one last compliment.  Michael O&rsquo;Leary has injected a great boost to the west with the announcement of four new routes out of Knock Airport.  I wish Ryanair and Knock Airport the very best.</P>

     <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment all the Senators for the excellent debate.  I will make a commitment to return to the Seanad.  Since I came to office, one of the best debates I have had was the debate on sport in the Seanad.  What I really like is when people ask questions and when I can reply after two or three of them.  I will not be able to answer all questions posed today but the heart of every Senator is in the right place, just like the D&aacute;il.  Tourism is so important to every corner of this country.  It creates employment in corners of the country where there will not be multinationals or investment other than tourism.</P>
        <P>If the scenery and beauty in this country could be bought and sold, it would not be in Ireland.  It would be in China or America because they have the money.  We must work on the basis that we have something we want to sell to the rest of the world in order to bring people into this country.  Since I came into this job I have had the energy and will work with the agencies and my Department.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett is quite correct that we cannot do things as we did before.  We must be more motivated.  We do not have the funding we had for many years and we must make sure that the funding is targeted and spent in the right places.  We must all work harder, work differently and work smarter.</P>
        <P>We have four State agencies, Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Dublin Tourism and Shannon Development.  There are too many agencies, which everyone knows.  We are now reviewing the matter to see how we can streamline some of these agencies.  We must do that.</P>
        <P>The Acting Chairman, Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan, raised questions about access and marketing.  I am glad to see that the public service obligation has been renewed for Kerry Airport.  Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are working to keep the Cork-Swansea ferry line open.  The company is in difficulty and it is an important route of access into the country.  We are working with the company to keep it alive.</P>
        <P>Several speakers referred to the committee I chair and from which Mr. Pat Hickey has resigned.  I do not want to get into it and I will not make a big statement today.  I am only in the job eight months and since I came into office, we have had two meetings.  We held nine meetings in total and have one fixed for next month, although not because of the incident.  I thought we were all putting on the green jersey.  This is not a time to be bickering about whether we put money into hospitality in Britain.  Many Senators have been in the Irish Embassy, which is a hospitality house because we do not have the resources and the money.  If I had &euro;300,000 <Col N="998"/>and if the Minister for Finance had it he would be looking at special needs and hospitals.  We have the Irish Embassy and a good ambassador in London and Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will work together to be our hospitality house.  I wish Mr. Pat Hickey well and I thank him for his contribution.</P>
        <P>The previous Government set up a committee and we have done well out of it.  Irish business people who went to Britain for the Olympic Games have agreed projects worth &euro;500 million.  Regarding the tourism aspect, we have some funding established and we are looking for the private sector to help us to get further funding.  When the Olympic Games are under way, we will try to have a cultural event in this country for people who would normally go to London because London will be crowded and hotels will be very expensive.  We have what they are looking for and we will target that market.  We will have many festivals in Dublin, Kilkenny, Cork and Galway and we will entice people to come to the country.  That committee is working very hard and there has been serious economic benefit to the country.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry Brennan mentioned the cost of holidays, food and the cost of coming into the country.  That was the perception.  We must ensure our cost base is good and that our food and hotels are reasonably priced.  Recent French publications have stated that Irish food is of a very good quality and that the price structure has reduced.  That the French are publicising those issues in their books and magazines is good for Ireland.</P>

	<P>There is no doubt that Ireland provides good value in hotels.  That is good for the product, the market and the country.  However, there is a problem in regard to special events.  I have called in the Irish Hotels Federation in that regard.  Again we have to put on the green jersey.  I am not saying the hotels cannot increase their prices for special events.  They can, but those prices must be reasonable.  It is not good for the perception of the industry or the hotels that prices are increased for special events..  We had the same problem during the Europa Cup and during major events in the country in the past year.  To be fair to the hotels, many are under extreme pressure and are working within very tight margins.  That some are competing with NAMA hotels is causing a serious problem.  The family-run hotels work hard and their cost base is at a very low level.  They work hard at getting people into the country.</P>
        <P>Senator Feargal Quinn mentioned the strategic plan.  I am pleased to inform him that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is today launching with Tourism Ireland a new marketing plan with new ways of doing business.  I will come back to the House for a debate on tourism.  In regard to the new way of doing business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, e-commerce.  The Government is committed to e-commerce.  We have to do it that way.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a marvellous database for the entire world.  Since becoming Minister of State a number of people have approached me and people are thinking outside the box.  The problem is that it takes money to run some of the projects and we do not have that money.  Film crews want to make films on festivals and cultural events but the best we can offer them is whatever F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have in respect of scenery and beauty.  Whatever is available on their own files is made available to them.  We have a database showing that we have assisted companies, hotel operators and the industry itself.  We will have to do that better and smarter.  We have to do some things the old way but we also <Col N="999"/>have to do things in new ways.  The old ways cannot be forgotten.  What Senator Tom Sheahan said was correct that we cannot go to the market.</P>
        <P>Senator Paschal Mooney mentioned the problem of attending events.  As soon as one attends an event there is a freedom of information request.  That is the major problem and we must be careful.</P>

	<P>I even got a freedom of information request from a person in my constituency to find out where I had travelled.  I will make it clear on local and national radio and in this House today.  We decided when we assumed office, because of the economic situation, to target the four main areas that are good for Irish tourism: Britain, France, Germany and America.  The Minister decided to take responsibility for two countries while I would take responsibility for the other two.  We have done that.  I was in America and France while the Minister was in Britain twice and he was also in Germany.  We got results.  We targeted the tour operators and took some of them to Ireland, around the west coast, the east coast and so on to show them our product.  There is no better approach than going to the market, that is, the tour operators, those who will be selling the product abroad.  As I said in France, it is in its interest and it is in the Irish Government&rsquo;s interest.  It is in our interest to ensure the French see our product and can sell it to their people and that they know what they are selling.</P>

	<P>I will conclude.  I will come back again.  I thank Senators for their kind comments.  Tourism is important to the country.  The Government is committed to tourism.  Every time 35,000 tourists come to Ireland, a job is created.  The more people we can encourage to visit Ireland the more revenue will be generated.  We have the product, the people and the culture.  With all working together we can get back on the right road again and we must give people value for money.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 2</P>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, subsection (1), lines 8 and 9, to delete paragraph (<i>d</i>).</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister for what I hope will be a constructive dialogue and all my comments on the amendments will be in that spirit.  I thank the Minister for his contribution yesterday.</P>
        <P>This amendment would delete the line &ldquo;an offence under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997&rdquo;.  My concern, alluded to yesterday, stems from the fact that offences under that Act typically merit a &pound;1,200 fine or a term of imprisonment of 12 months.  As we noted <Col N="1000"/>yesterday, the Bill makes provision for a fine of &euro;500,000 and a term of imprisonment of three years.  This would be a relatively minor crime.  If it was considered any of the crimes under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 was being treated too leniently, I would support the Government, but it is strange that people can be treated with leniency until the person concerned is a bus driver or road freight operator.  It does not apply to other professions, including some which strike me as far more deserving of such fines, as the Minister noted yesterday.  Is there not a stage at which we can rank minor offences and remove them after a period?  I supported the Government on the abolition of the Thornton Hall project, but we could end up with an extremely harsh attitude towards people who committed relatively minor crimes before reforming.  They might just want to be a bus driver or the operator of a truck.  For society as a whole, there must be a point at which people do not carry that baggage further into their career.</P>
       <P Just="Left">I was wondering what evidence is available which suggests this provision is required, apart from pressures from the European Union.  It appears there is none.  I have read the Farrelly report and the Department was judged to have been right in giving a licence to a gentleman in County Louth to operate a truck.  Are there many examples of bus drivers and road freight operators who had a career of involvement in petty crime and became serious criminals after they had received a licence?</P>
        <P>On the pressure exerted by the European Union, 99% of our goods are moved by road.  Many regret the fact that the rail service has deteriorated so much.  Some 20 years ago rail freight would have accounted for 20% of the figure.  Of the goods moved by road, 72% are moved by hired haulage operators who developed following liberalisation in 1980s.  In the beginning there were 1,000 vehicles, there are now 25,000.  Those involved grew by being of good repute and having sound finances while being professionally competent.  They knocked on doors and were able to deliver goods better than the rail service or in-house transport fleets.  It is vital that we do not obstruct new entrants to the business in Ireland.  In that regard, the penalties are draconian as they elevate relatively minor offences to being major offences.</P>
        <P>On the pressure being exerted by the European Union, there is a degree of protectionism in countries which still have large rail and waterway systems.  There is a view that road haulage operations are inferior and run by the Mafia or gangsters from eastern Europe and that, therefore, they must be controlled.  In Ireland we are talking about small family firms which have served the economy well without a subsidy.  They have done a good job of persuading people where it counts, in the market.  We would need evidence of serious crimes meriting the kind of penalties mooted before we would support that.  The low scale of penalties in section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) offences would indicate that perhaps this is escalating unnecessarily into the bus drivers sector and road freight operators sector if it is the case that the crimes are relatively small and people have served the sentence.  As Mr. Farrelly indicates in his report, and as the courts have said, people have a constitutional right to make a living.  Driving a bus or truck is not exactly a threat to society if the offences are relatively small, as judged by the law, occurred a long time ago, and one has evidence of genuine regret to the Minister that the crime ever took place.  Criminalising people beyond the period of the sentence into their career choice afterwards is more likely to lead people back to prison &mdash; the university of crime &mdash; or to be dependent on social welfare.</P>
        <P>In the explanatory memorandum it is stated that the Bill has not been the subject of consultation as it primarily deals with existing provisions, but it would be interesting to hear the views of criminologists given that the courts have been hostile to attempts by previous Ministers to deny people licences.  Likewise, what are the views of the Department of Social Protection on banning people from careers in which they might otherwise be able to embark, make money <Col N="1001"/>and contribute to society and not be held back by relatively minor offences committed a long time ago?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>In general, I agree with Senator Barrett&rsquo;s comments on European attitudes to road haulage in particular.  It is very much the view of the core European countries in particular that for environmental and other reasons we should push freight off the road and back onto the railways and canals.  That is good policy and it would make sense that we would do that for many reasons, but it may not be a practical policy in this country where we have an undeveloped railway network which we cannot continue to afford to subsidise in the way we do now.  We are also an island nation and the policies we may need to apply to road haulage may be different in this country than in the European core.  Senator Barrett&rsquo;s general point in that regard is valid.</P>
        <P>With regard to the amendment which would remove the reference to the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 from the list of serious convictions or offences which must be notified to the Minister under section 2 in regard to good repute of applicants or licence holders, acceptance of the amendment would mean that I could no longer consider offences under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.  The Act contains offences such as assault, threats to kill, syringe attacks, poisoning, coercion, harassment, endangerment, false imprisonment and child abduction.  It is important that the Minister, or the body, in awarding a road transport licence should be aware whether the applicant has been convicted of child abduction, for example.  Unfortunately, it is the case that when human trafficking does occur, it very often occurs in the back of trucks.  The same applies, unfortunately, in many cases to child abduction.  That is the reason for the provision and why I would not like to see it removed.</P>
        <P>Let us always bear in mind when it comes to such provisions that it is about notification.  The person applying for a licence must notify the Minister of the offences.  It does not mean an automatic ban by any means.  The Minister just needs to take it into account.  If it is a minor offence that occurred a long time ago, I do not think any reasonable Minister would refuse a licence and I do not think the District Court would uphold such a decision.  The courts have consistently stood over the right of a person to earn a living.  However, in the case of child abduction, they probably would not.  They would probably agree with the Minister&rsquo;s view.  Perhaps when we carry out a thorough review of the legislation we might refine the offences a bit more and specifically mention such crimes as child abduction rather than the Act in question.  However, given the deadline which I am up against, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>

	<P>I look forward to our continuing dialogue.  The amendment was put forward with that intention.  Any measure the Minister would have in mind to make the provisions less draconian would be welcome.

I thank the Minister for his consideration.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, subsection (1), line 32, before &ldquo;the operator&rdquo; to insert the following:</P><Col N="1002"/>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;excluding politically motivated offences covered by the Good Friday Agreement and which predate the enactment of the agreement,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We intend to press the amendment.  We are hopeful that the Minister has had time to reflect on the serious issues we have raised in the context of the amendment.  They are important issues, not just for my party but for people who believe in human rights and the civil rights of all, including ex-prisoners and especially those who were prisoners as part of a conflict.  While there was much heat in the Second Stage debate that took place in the D&aacute;il, I hope the Minister will accept the seriousness of error in terms of the amendment.</P>
        <P>Under the Good Friday Agreement, which was signed off on by the Government of the State in 1998, which was supported by the vast majority across the island of Ireland, the State recognised the importance of measures to facilitate the reintegration of prisoners into the community by providing support both prior to and after release, including assistance directed towards availing of employment opportunities, retraining and-or re-skilling and further education.  That is very clear and explicit.  The Good Friday Agreement goes further because it places an obligation on the State to ensure there is proper reintegration of prisoners who were part of a conflict and who were released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, which many of them have done.</P>
        <P>I gave a number of examples yesterday of where many former prisoners achieved doctorates in prison in a range of areas.  Many of them are leaders in their communities.  In my own area some former prisoners are members of GAA and soccer clubs, taxi drivers, teachers and lecturers.  Two Deputies who contributed to the debate in the D&aacute;il would not be able to hold a licence under the current proposals.  The Minister is shaking his head because he says that it is then up to the courts.  The point is that what he is doing in refusing to accept the amendment is refusing to accept that political prisoners are just that and that they should be exempt from the provisions of the Bill.  That is what we are calling for.</P>
        <P>In the St. Andrews Agreement which progressed the peace process and brought about the renewal of power sharing, it states that the Government will work with business, trade unions and ex-prisoner groups to produce guidance for employers which will reduce barriers to employment and enhance reintegration of former prisoners.  That was agreed by two sovereign governments, the British Government and the Irish Government, and by all of the parties to the agreement, including the Minister&rsquo;s party.  A working group established under the Agreement to focus on the issues arising for prisoners stated that conflict related convictions of politically motivated ex-prisoners or their membership of any organisation should not generally be taken into account in accessing employment facilities, goods or services, provided that the act to which the conviction relates or the membership predates the Agreement.  That is what we state in the amendment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These are internationally recognised agreements to which all parties in the House were party.  What is stated in them is clear.  However, the Government is disregarding what was agreed and erecting barriers to ex-prisoners from all backgrounds to secure employment.  Former political prisoners have found it difficult to secure a place in their communities, North or South.  Many have, but others have not.  As the Agreement states, there is an onus on the State to guarantee that every opportunity is taken to ensure proper reintegration of all former political prisoners from different traditions, both North and South, back into the community.  It is part of the healing process and the process of conflict resolution which I hope all parties in the House support.  Many people outside this House support it.  Despite the conditions of the Good Friday Agreement, the Hillsborough Agreement and the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement, with the guidelines published subsequently, political prisoners continue to suffer discrimination.  Obstacles continue <Col N="1003"/>to be erected in the way of their search for employment or business opportunities.  The Bill neglects the plight of these ex-prisoners.  It puts in place rules which would make it difficult for them to obtain a road transport operator licence or work in a licence holder&rsquo;s business.  There are thousands of former political prisoners in the State, the vast majority of whom are pillars of our society.  A small number of people are part of those micro-groups in the State.  Former political prisoners have been in the vanguard of defending the peace process.  We all know the role they played in making sure, not only that the peace was built but that it was kept and maintained.  They are pillars of society.</P>
        <P>I mentioned that two Deputies who spoke in favour of this amendment in the D&aacute;il are former political prisoners.  Certain Labour Party Deputies who are in government were associated with an armed group, and some of their associates would be affected by the Bill and by the refusal of the Minister to accept the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  There are also many former political prisoners outside the Houses.  Many have obtained further education qualifications and include in their number doctors of every subject one can imagine.  They are respected in their current fields of activity and have helped to build and keep the peace.</P>
        <P>The State has failed to comply with its end of the bargain, in terms of respecting the political context of their imprisonment.  The Government must uphold its side of the bargain with all prisoners, many of whom have taken risks for peace and have built that peace.  These are people who were sentenced in Diplock courts in Northern Ireland and in non-jury courts in this State.  That should be borne in mind when the Minister considers this amendment.</P>
        <P>It is 13 years since the Good Friday Agreement was signed and five years since the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement was signed.  I was interested to hear some of what the Minister said in his response to my contribution on Second Stage.  He introduced red herrings which have nothing to do with the points we are making.  This may have been because of the Minister&rsquo;s very narrow political view of this issue, of the world, of this State, of the conflict and of former prisoners, all of which he is entitled to have.  However, as Minister he needs to act in the national interest, for the public good and in line with the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement and the Hillsborough Agreement, which are international agreements.  The Minister has a responsibility to do that.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about convicted criminals, despite the fact that he knows they are political prisoners.  He said confession comes before absolution.  I could say torture comes before confession.  Many ex-prisoners were tortured in Long Kesh, which led to some of those convictions, of which I am sure the Minister is aware.  Perhaps he is not aware of much of what happened and the reasons many people ended up as prisoners in the first place.</P>
        <P>This is an important issue for us.  We cannot and will not stand over a situation where a Minister with a very narrow view of the world can play games with people&rsquo;s lives and livelihood, as the Minister is doing.</P>
        <P>These people have served their sentences.  It is extreme to prevent people who were part of a conflict in a conflict resolution process, who were released under international agreements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have already cited the State&rsquo;s obligations, which the Minister should live up to.  The measure runs contrary to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.</P><Col N="1004"/>
        <P>I will listen to the Minister&rsquo;s response.  I was unable to hear his response to the debate on Second Stage.  I had to attend a meeting but I read the transcript of the debate and the transcript of his response to the views expressed by Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies in the D&aacute;il.

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is right to say there was much heat in the D&aacute;il on this issue last week.  I do not propose to rehearse those arguments.  I will deal with the amendment on its merits and not on any other basis.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the Senator seems not to understand the Bill.  It requires that someone who has been convicted of one of these offences notify the Minister that he or she has such a conviction.  Having a conviction does not ban a person from having a licence.  If either of the Deputies to which the Senator refers wishes to apply for a road haulage or passenger transport licence, there is no reason they would not get one.  They merely have to register the fact that they have been convicted of these crimes.  If they wish to do so, they may give the additional information in the licence application that they were released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Minister is merely obliged to take the matter into consideration.  There is no automatic ban on anyone holding a licence.</P><Col N="1005"/>
        <P>The Good Friday Agreement was signed by the Government and passed by the people by referendum in 1998.  The agreement provides for early release, under licence, of convicted criminals.  It does not provide for an amnesty or for convictions to be expunged.  It does not say the convictions are spent.  It provides for the early release of convicted criminals under licence.  That is the fact.  It is not my personal agenda or opinion.  It is the law and an international agreement, as the Senator has said.</P>
        <P>The Senator used the term &ldquo;political prisoners&rdquo; and accused me of having a personal agenda.  It may be the Senator&rsquo;s view that these crimes were politically motivated, and he is entitled to that view.  It may be his view that these people were political prisoners.  He is entitled to that view.  However, there is a different situation here.  The Irish courts, constituted under the Constitution, have said these people are convicted criminals.  They have been convicted of crimes by our courts under the terms of our Constitution.  I can not change that.  It is a fact.  These people are convicted criminals.  It is the Senator&rsquo;s view that they are not criminals, that they are political prisoners and that what they did was politically motivated.  He is entitled to that opinion.  However, the fact is that, under our laws and our Constitution, they are convicted criminals.  That has not changed and the Good Friday Agreement does not change it either.  It provides for early release under licence if they behave themselves.  Those are the basic facts.</P>
        <P>It is not my proposal to amend the Bill to treat them any differently from other people who have been convicted of similar crimes.  When they apply for a licence they may admit to the fact that they had been convicted of these crimes.  If they wish to give an explanation as to why they committed the crimes they may do so.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact is that the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement and the Hillsborough Agreement recognised that these individuals were political prisoners who were in prison serving time for politically motivated actions.  I agree they were released on licence, but it was recognised that they were political prisoners.  The Minister is being disingenuous when he says the passing of this Bill will not prevent former political prisoners from being able to get a licence.  It gives the Minister the power to make that decision.  What we are saying is very clear, that there should be a clear differentiation between people who were involved in criminal offences and people who were convicted of politically motivated <Col N="1006"/>offences and released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  We cannot have it both ways.  The Minister cannot say he supports the Good Friday Agreement and that he upholds the spirit of that agreement.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>To return to the point I made earlier, the words of the Good Friday Agreement refer to &ldquo;the importance of measures to facilitate the reintegration of prisoners into the community by providing support both prior to and after release, including assistance directed towards availing of employment opportunities, retraining and/or re-skilling, and further education&rdquo;.  That is what the agreement states.  How is it okay to be a former prisoner and drive a taxi, be a teacher, a doctor, a nurse or anything else but not be permitted to have a licence to operate in the road haulage industry?  Why is this Minister the only Minister who is preventing former political prisoners from taking up employment?  He wonders then why we think this is some politically motivated agenda on his part.</P>
        <P>I see this as a simple amendment which could be accepted.  We can disagree about the terminology used with regard to former prisoners.  The Minister can use the word &ldquo;convict&rdquo; or the words Margaret Thatcher used.  He can sit comfortably with those words.  That is fine as he is entitled to his opinion.  However, he can accept this amendment and, in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, differentiate between those criminals who were convicted of offences and people who were convicted of politically motivated offences.  There is a difference and it is enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement.  It is also enshrined in the agreement that the Government has a legal responsibility to ensure that political prisoners are reintegrated back into society.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not good enough that the Minister can wave his power over the heads of former prisoners and say that if he thinks it is okay, he will give them the licence.  We are talking about a point of principle and that is the reason we will press the amendment and put it to a vote.  I hope that people in this House who voted for the Good Friday Agreement will vote for this amendment.  A vote against this amendment is a vote against the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>My party supported this amendment in the D&aacute;il and will support it here for the reasons I will outline.  That said, I read the report of the D&aacute;il debate and found its tone and content most regrettable.  I would caution people to tone down the rhetoric on this issue.  We all have ownership of the Good Friday Agreement, which was negotiated by a former leader of my party and others who had the courage to take it on and to include and introduce the paramilitaries at the time.  They were brought into the political system and we welcomed them to it.  It is good they are part of it.</P>
        <P>However, we must remember that there are many people with sensitivities who voted for the Good Friday Agreement but who still suffer a loss as a result of the activities of the paramilitaries on all sides.  I speak as someone whose family had a long friendship with the family of the late Jerry McCabe.  When I spoke here on Second Stage, I indicated to the Minister that I felt there should be a forgiveness element and an acceptance of rehabilitation across the board, without reference to any agreement and wherever somebody had offended and was guilty of a serious crime.  Some of the people to whom Senator Cullinane has referred were guilty of the most heinous crimes.  All people who have committed a crime must get the opportunity for rehabilitation and to return to the workforce.  It is on that general basis and in that spirit that my party supports the amendment.  I caution Senators to tone down the rhetoric as many people are still hurting.</P>

	<P>I hope we will get the restraint people have called for.  In my professional capacity I used both the Green black taxis in Belfast and the Orange black taxis on the other side and was very impressed by the prisoners who, on release, operated that service.  I wrote on this for a professional journal in London in the Institute of Economic Affairs.  The service provided by the taxi service was a 24-hour service at 90 second frequency.  I wish far more expensive public transport systems to the taxpayer could emulate that service.  Let us not carry on with the grudges for too long.  The former prisoners have a proven record of being really good at running urban public transport and I am sure they could bring that expertise to other areas.</P>
        <P>The previous First Minister, Reverend Ian Paisley, spent some time in jail, as did the current First Minister, Peter Robinson.  If we looked at the founding fathers of this State, we would find the same to be true with regard to former Members.  People must be given the opportunity to get on with their lives.  In my professional capacity I found the former prisoners I met were good, both those on the Shankill Road and in west Belfast, and the work they were doing impressed a UK audience.  Let us open up the possibilities to these important developments.  As I said on the earlier amendment, people must be allowed to leave their past behind when they want.  Having to go to court and take on the Minister in order to get a licence is far different from someone deciding he is good at the business and setting himself up without having to tell anybody what he was doing previously.  I support colleagues on this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe the Minister has a personal agenda in regard to this.  When the Bill was being drafted, the Minister could not have foreseen that we would be discussing the Good Friday Agreement and republican prisoners and so on and that is where the issue has arisen, because once the Bill is drafted, there is difficulty in changing it.  I was at a meeting last Saturday in the North and there was a very representative group of people around the table, chamber of commerce people and regeneration committee people, etc.  I was sitting beside a Sinn F&eacute;in Minister and sitting across from me was the local police commander.  The Minister, who spent 14 years in jail, said something which to my mind sums up the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.  She said to the police commander that there was a time when she would not have been sitting there with him because he would have been arresting her.  She pointed out that in fact he had arrested her on one occasion but that what had come out of the peace process was that they had all agreed to work together.  There is no doubt that there are many hurting and that some people will hurt till they go to their graves.  We will not even be aware of many of those hurting because it is so serious, but as we know, that is what comes from conflict.  We know that is what comes out of conflict.  We need only go back to Terence MacSwiney, Thomas Ashe and all the great figures in Irish history who spent time in prison.  We can say at a given time that they were different.  In the 1950s when we had troubles in the North of Ireland, people lost their jobs.  They lost their jobs as teachers in the vocational schools, in the ESB and in State bodies.  When they came out and those troubles stopped, all those people got their jobs back.  It was the spirit of it rather than legislation that was required.</P>
        <P>If this Bill was being drafted again and if we had considered this issue, it is possible we would have had different wording.  We could argue forever about the definition of a political prisoner.  I just read a book on the subject by people who were political prisoners in different periods of <Col N="1008"/>Irish history.  The conflict and the debate was always there.  One side, in particular the British side, said these people were common criminals.  We could go on forever with this debate.  We will not come to a conclusion because we all hold different political views.</P>
        <P>The Good Friday Agreement was one of the greatest things to happen on this island for many decades and people are still basking in the sunshine of that agreement.  The political prisoners who returned to the community wanted, as the eminent Senator made quite clear, to get on with their lives as we all do.  The victims want to get on with their lives as well.</P>
        <P>Even though it has arisen in a Road Transport Bill, it is a bigger issue.  It is just that the underlying message that goes with it is a pity.  I heard the Minister speak and I do not believe there will be a change.  It is a pity we cannot get that change.  If we could have had consensus, we would endorse what the voters, North and South, did in the Good Friday Agreement.  It was the first time since 1919 that we had an all-island vote.  We would say to them that we are prepared to bury our differences.  There is an issue here which needs to be addressed.  We do not need rhetoric or the passion that went with that politics.  We are now thinking of a new Ireland and in that context, I would like the Minister to reflect on what has been said.  It is not a reflection on him because he is an honourable Minister and I do not believe for a moment that he has a personal agenda.  However, the issue has a connotation and will have an echo on the broader issue of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not going to speak on this amendment but I must reply to some of the points made.  Members are missing the point.  The Minister pointed out that this does not disqualify anybody from getting a licence.  That is the main issue.  It gives the Minister the right to say whether he will issue a licence to these people.  That is the point of this legislation.  It is not about the Good Friday Agreement and politically motivated offences.  The Minister makes the call.  The legislation does not disqualify anybody from holding a licence.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane said the Minister was very narrow-minded.  The Minister is not narrow-minded.  He has brought a good Bill to the House which we must pass before 4 December because of an EU directive.  It is very unfair for Senator Cullinane to call the Minister narrow-minded.  Does the Senator consider the murder of  Garda Jerry McCabe and Ms Jean McConville political offences?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>This is about notification.  The provision in the legislation does not ban anyone from having a road haulage licence or a passenger transport licence.  It requires people to inform the Minister when they fill in their application form that they have  been convicted of certain crimes in the past.  The opportunity is there for them to explain that those crimes were committed in a particular context, perhaps before the enactment of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
        <P>If I make any decisions on a matter such as this, I will take that into account.  I see no reason to consider somebody who applies for a passenger transport licence or a road haulage licence and who committed a crime prior to the Good Friday Agreement but who has moved on since then and has not committed any further crimes not to be of good repute and to refuse a licence.  The provisions in the legislation are not new.  They are the <i>status quo</i> and are not something I have put into this legislation.  I have no personal agenda in this regard.</P><Col N="1009"/>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; was quite right that when we were going through this Bill, which unfortunately is emergency legislation because we are up against a deadline, we did not anticipate this issue arising at all.  I assure Members, although they may not believe it, that there is no personal agenda here at all.  We keep going back to the Good Friday Agreement which must be the guiding principle and light in this.  The Good Friday Agreement provides for early release under licence.  It does not expunge convictions and say these crimes were not crimes and did not happen.  It just provides for early release.  That is what we all signed up to in the referendum.  Had the Good Friday Agreement provided for release without condition or said that these crimes were not crimes or these convictions are now expunged, would it have passed with the majority it did, in particular North of the Border where a very large number of Protestants voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;?  I wonder whether they would have voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in such large numbers if it had provided for an amnesty for those prisoners.</P>
        <P>That is why the former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, and others, in their wisdom, did not agree to that request for an amnesty and have not done so to date.  In current circumstances, an amnesty might move us backwards and I will come to that in a second.</P>
        <P>If there is a new agreement to follow up on the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement and the Hillsborough Agreement, that is fine but it has not happened yet.  There is no agreement in favour of an amnesty in this State nor is there a consensus in favour of one.  If new legislation is brought in to provide for an amnesty or to consider these convictions to be spent, then so be it but the Road Transport Bill is not the place in which to do that.  If we are to decide to provide an amnesty or for these convictions to be spent, we need to have a proper debate about that and not have it in the context of a Road Transport Bill.  It is inappropriate to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been a great deal of talk about political prisoners and criticisms of individuals, including me, talking about the political prisoners and other people.  With the exception of Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan, nobody mentioned the victims up to now and there are still many victims who are hurting very much.  Many of them have not been able to move on in the same way as perhaps some of the political prisoners who have done very well since.  They have not been able to move to the point of forgiveness.</P>
        <P>Before one can forgive something, there must be apologies and acceptance that crimes were committed.  Even if they were politically motivated, they were still wrong.  Many people have been involved in struggles from Mr. John Hume to Mr. Austin Curry to Mahatma Gandhi.  Their political motivation was very strong but it did not drive them to violence and require them to blow up children in shopping centres.  Their political motivation was different and they chose a different course of action.  Before the victims can move on, there needs to be an acceptance that political motivation is not a justification for the offences committed.  I am glad the word &ldquo;offences&rdquo; was used because at least it is progress.</P>

	<P>I acknowledge that the start of the Minister&rsquo;s last contribution was a step forward because he said he did not see any reason somebody released under licence under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and where their offences predated the agreement, could not hold a licence.  As he knows, we made a different point.  As a principle, that category of prisoner should be excluded from the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.  It should not be the Minister&rsquo;s prerogative to make the decision.  I accept his comments and he went some of the way towards addressing our concerns before turning to discuss other issues, including victims.  While I agree that there are victims on all sides, his other points were made in an attempt to incite Sinn F&eacute;in Members.  Many former political prisoners saw their family members and comrades <Col N="1010"/>die.  Conflict resolution is not easy.  I am and always will be sympathetic towards the plight of victims on all sides.  Healing is being discussed in a broader sense and should not be debated in the context of this Bill under which political prisoners can be excluded from holding a licence if the Minister so wishes.  However, he mentioned that he could not see a reason for this.  If so, why can he not accept the amendment?  He was referring to a larger issue.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am loath to answer a hypothetical question.  The legislation concerns someone who fills in an application form for a licence to be a haulier or passenger transport operator.  On that application form the person concerned is required to provide various pieces of information on, for example, financial standing, establishment in the State and whether he or she is held in good repute.  The Minister or, more accurately, officials acting with the Minister&rsquo;s authority must make a decision on the application based on this information.  Any reasonable Minister or official adjudicating on such an application would take into account the pre-Good Friday Agreement context in which a crime was committed.  If the person concerned has since been of good repute, financial standing and so on, a refusal would be unlikely.  However, I cannot answer for definite or on behalf of future Ministers.</P>
        <P>Ignoring the heat and leaving aside the history lessons in which we have engaged, there may be a case for offering an amnesty in due course.  We could pass legislation or reach an agreement on expunging convictions via an amnesty, but the Road Transport Bill 2011 does not provide the context in which to do so.  The issue requires a more detailed debate and further confidence-building measures on the part of those seeking an amnesty.  Despite the fact that the conflict ended some time ago, these measures have not yet been forthcoming.  That is probably the best way to proceed.  Until that happens, however, the Good Friday Agreement stands.  Under the agreement, these are considered convictions and early release on licence is provided for.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 8, subsection (2) (<i>b</i>), line 12, after &ldquo;offences&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;and the time elapsed since the convictions and the maximum fine or term of imprisonment with respect of each offence&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This section deals with a number of factors which the Minister will take into account when considering an offence:</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) the nature of the offence,</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) whether the conviction is one of a number of convictions for the same or different offences,</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>c</i>) any penalty or sentence suffered on foot of the conviction,</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>d</i>) any disqualification or forfeiture imposed on foot of the conviction, and</P><Col N="1013"/>
        <P LI="1">(<i>e</i>) whether or not the offence was committed in the course of, or connected with, a road transport business[.]</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister may consider that the effect of my amendment is implied, that is, the time that has elapsed, for example, where a person is 42 years of age now and he was 16 when the offence was committed.  I seek to make provision for that scenario.  The Minister has provided for the actual penalty but the maximum penalty gives an indication of how society as a whole and this House thought of the offence in terms of its seriousness.  Given that it is, for example, only an X offence and he did it Y years ago, I would hope they would be considerations the Minister would bear in mind in exercising his functions under this section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the time elapsed, this section does not require an amendment as it is taken into account as part of the consideration process of any convictions notified or discovered.  Serious convictions and others are already provided for in the regulations, such as road safety issues or tachographs.  Elapsed time will not necessarily mean that a conviction will be disregarded as it depends on the nature of the conviction and the context of a road haulage or passenger transport business.  An example would be convictions for sexual offences and the person wishing to be a passenger operator or driver.  In regard to the maximum fine or term, the Bill already provides sufficiently in section 4(2)(<i>c</i>) for any penalty or sentence suffered on foot of the conviction.  It is a matter for the courts to determine the penalty bearing in mind all circumstances of the case.  The other elements of subsection (2) give sufficient scope to the Minister to make a determination on the implications of a serious conviction for good repute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister in his earlier comment referred to people who had moved on.  I was hoping that people who had moved on would be facilitated so I think we can move on.  The Minister has facilitated the third moving on in respect of that section.  I accept what the Minister has said and I withdraw the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The point raised by Senator Barrett is an important one.  If a person had been convicted many years ago, I think the Minister said that would be taken into account anyway.  Am I correct in saying that if a person committed an offence, say, 40 years ago and the Minister refused him, that he would not be able to take a judicial review on the grounds that the Minister did not consider the length of time?  That would not be a ground for him to appeal to the High Court against an adverse consideration or decision of the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope I am not incorrect on this but if so I will correspond with the Senator.  I understand that if the conviction was 40 years ago the Minister is already empowered to take that into account in the issuing of a licence.  Nothing prevents a person from appealing to the District Court or seeking a judicial review subsequently.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 5</P>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 8, lines 40 to 42, to delete subsection (3).</P><Col N="1014"/>
        <P FLI="0">Section 5(3) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">A decision to suspend or withdraw a licensing document has effect pending an appeal under this section unless the judge of the District Court before whom the appeal is brought directs otherwise.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There should be a chance for the person to mount a defence.  In transport, if the licence is withdrawn, that is the end of the income source for the person who is in the transport business.  Therefore, it is somewhat draconian to suspend the penalty pending the appeal.  While I have not got legal training, it has arisen in some of the other issues which have been referred to obliquely here that priests, against whom allegations are made, are suspended.  It is a development that was not in the original formulation of the Bill which is the reason my next amendment seeks to keep section 6 of the Road Transport Act 1986.  To suspend a person&rsquo;s livelihood, pending his appeal, is a very strong penalty.  This is a business where one has to be with one&rsquo;s customers.  They will find somebody else very quickly if one is suspended, even if one is subsequently exonerated in court.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>While this is a difficult issue, I can understand where the Senator is coming from.  Where this takes effect is if a person has a new conviction.  It is not something that would be done arbitrarily.  If a person who already has a licence is convicted of human trafficking, a serious sexual offence, murder or money laundering, the Minister is then empowered to withdraw or suspend the licence right away.  If the amendment, as proposed by the Senator, was accepted by me, that would allow that person to appeal to the District Court and, effectively, retain the licence for months while the appeal is being held.  In a different circumstance I could accept the amendment on the basis that one wants to give a person the right of appeal to the District Court any time a licence is suspended.  People have the right to a stay on the withdrawal of the licence in such circumstances, but this will arise in different circumstances where someone has been convicted of one of these serious offences.  That is when the licence will be withdrawn or suspended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there any way what the Minister says could be incorporated in the Bill, that it is on conviction that the licence is withdrawn?  Is that the import of his message?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the legal provision is that the withdrawal or suspension occurs on conviction but that the District Court, even in these circumstances, could still allow a stay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>If that had been included in the wording of the Bill, I would not have tabled the amendment, but that is the way we evolve.  The Minister&rsquo;s remarks were most useful.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 9, line 7, to delete subsection (6) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(6) Where the Minister has not decided on an application within three months the applicant may within 21 days of the expiry of that period appeal to the District Court seeking a decision on the application.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1015"/>
        <P FLI="0">Senator James Heffernan informed me yesterday that the period of 21 days was included in the legislation, but I want to be sure.  Perhaps through an oversight I could not find the relevant section.  I am concerned to ensure Ministers reply quickly because there has been experience of long delays; Mr. Justice Brian McMahon remarked in the Swords Express case that the delay had been so long, the favoured applicants, Dublin Bus and CIE, gained an advantage over the other applicant, Swords Express.  If we are imposing duties on members of the general public involved in the transport business to be swift in their response to the Minister, Ministers should also respond quickly.  If the provision is already included in the Bill and I have missed it through an oversight, I will be glad to accept this, but I would like an undertaking that the Department will respond quickly to applications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for spending so much time in going through the Bill and tabling amendments.  I am sorry I am in the position of having to put through legislation so quickly because it does not allow me to accept amendments that might be accepted on Committee Stage in the normal process.  That speaks to the Senator&rsquo;s comments yesterday about why we should not bring forward legislation so late in this way.</P>
        <P>This amendment is not required because the EU regulations have direct effect.  When they come into force on 4 December, they will have direct effect and require member states to decide on applications within three months under Article 11.4 of EU Regulations 1071/2009.  The average length of time taken to decide on a licence is two weeks, but from 4 December there will be a legal requirement to decide on applications within three months.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 9, subsection (3), lines 38 and 39, to delete &ldquo;Minister and where&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Minister.  Where&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There is a mistake in how we submitted this amendment in the typed version and I hope it did not cause confusion.  I do not know if it renders it void.  We were seeking to delete the line&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator outline the mistake?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Our mistake is that the Bill reads &ldquo;Minister and where&rdquo; and we are seeking to substitute this phrase with &ldquo;Minister.  Where&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; is redundant and the word &ldquo;where&rdquo; should be capitalised on line 38 in order that the sentence would read &ldquo;Where an operator&rsquo;s licence is withdrawn or suspended, the operator shall...&rdquo;.  The wording to be deleted is &ldquo;an operator&rsquo;s licence is the property of the Minister&rdquo;.  We apologise for our clumsiness.</P>
        <P>I table the amendment because we do not know, in fact, if the operator&rsquo;s licence is the property of the Minister.  Haulage, taxi and pub licences are sold.  I appreciate they become the property of the Minister on conviction, but normally there is a market.  This is to clear up the matter lest we cause consternation and people now think haulage licences cannot be sold.  They have a resale value.  They are of interest to economists in that if a licence had a very high value, it meant the Minister was restricting competition too much in order that people paid a super-<Col N="1016"/>normal price for the licence to make super-normal profits.  We have always been interested in the sale of licences but thought they were the property of the persons whose names were on them rather than the Minister.  If there is confusion, we start the sentence with the phrase, &ldquo;Where the operator&rsquo;s licence is withdrawn or suspended&rdquo;, in other words, it becomes the Minister&rsquo;s property as a result of some offence believed to have been committed, but <i>ab initio</i> the licence belongs to the person who holds it.  There has traditionally been a market in licences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue raised is slightly different from that raised in the amendments.  The licence belongs to the Minister, as the legislation states; it is issued to an operator and cannot be sold or transferred.  It can happen that the business to which it is attached will be sold or transferred.  Legally, however, the licence remains the property of the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amendment is not necessary.  The Bill states an operator&rsquo;s licence is the property of the Minister and where an operator&rsquo;s licence is withdrawn or suspended, the operator shall, on request in writing from the Minister, return it to the Minister.  The Senator proposes to include the words, &ldquo;an operator&rsquo;s licence is the property of the Minister.&rdquo; and in a separate sentence, &ldquo;Where an operator&rsquo;s licence is withdrawn or suspended, the operator shall, upon request in writing, return the licence to the Minister.&rdquo;  I do not see the amendment as being necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>If the current practice is allowed to continue, whereby a person can sell a business with haulage licences thrown in for good measure, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, subsection (2), line 20, after &ldquo;licence&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;or that the vehicle has been hired from the holder of an operator&rsquo;s licence&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to deal with the road passenger side.  There has been a custom where a business is doing well and a person needs extra capacity, to lease or hire.  In the passenger business they are called auxiliaries, a strange use of the word, given the history of auxiliaries in Ireland.  As our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues have left, they cannot enlighten us.</P>
        <P>We see buses around the country displaying a sign indicating they are &ldquo;on hire&rdquo;.  It is a private sector service that leases vehicles at times when extra capacity is needed.</P>
        <P>The section refers to the vehicle being for the time being &ldquo;authorised&rdquo; on the operator&rsquo;s licence.  There has been a provision in the bus business to hire in capacity at times of peak demand and those vehicles would not be on the operator&rsquo;s licence, because they would be extra vehicles and hired from somebody else.  However, practice has been that where the route is doing well, auxiliary services are brought in so that the vehicle gets home on time.  I do not know what legal provision is made for auxiliary services in other contexts or how they came to be termed such, but they exist and are important, particularly for CIE companies which bring <Col N="1017"/>in significant capacity at times of peak demand.  They are not their vehicles nor are they on their licences, but they are a significant and necessary part of bus business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As far as I understand it, the amendment would allow an operator to hire a vehicle from another operator and to operate it as part of his or her transport business, even while the vehicle in question was still authorised on another operator&rsquo;s licence.  We are concerned that the amendment would create a loophole in the law, thereby creating legal uncertainty about who should be prosecuted if such a vehicle was involved in an accident or if the vehicle was in breach of safety or other rules.  Currently, if an operator hires a vehicle from another operator, the vehicle must be insured in the name of the new operator and authorised on his or her licence.  There is no need to have the vehicle registered or taxed again.  The hire agreement is sufficient for the Department to show the standing of the vehicle.  The vehicle is simultaneously removed from the licence of the first operator.  This ensures legal certainty in order that enforcement officers can know that any vehicle being operated by a licensed operator will be authorised on that operator&rsquo;s licence only.  All the licensing documentation will be in that operator&rsquo;s name only.</P>
        <P>If an operator was allowed to hire a vehicle from another licensed operator, but was not then required to have that vehicle authorised on his or her own licence, this would create considerable enforcement difficulties as well as potential liability difficulties in the case of accidents.  The Department is not aware of either the haulage or passenger sectors having looked for this provision.  Certainly, where operators hire vehicles from each other, the transfer of one licence to another in the Department typically takes one or two days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s explanation.  I just want to ensure an anomaly is not created whereby CIE would be entitled to have auxiliary services between, for example, Dublin and Galway, but its private sector competitors would not, because those vehicles would not be on their licence.  I would be obliged if the Minister could clarify that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question with regard to a vehicle that has been hired from the holder of an operator&rsquo;s licence for use in the agricultural area, such as tractors that draw grain or where a plant operator must tow a JCB or a HI-MAC on a low loader.  What is the position in that regard?  Do these people need licences to travel on the public road?  Will the Minister clarify that, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to Senator Barrett&rsquo;s query, if a vehicle is hired or leased without a driver, it must be authorised on the operator&rsquo;s licence.  However, if the vehicle is hired with a driver, which happens commonly with CIE and with school buses, that is considered to be sub-contracting, which is allowed.  In that case, the vehicle remains on the licence of the operator who owns the vehicle.  In the other circumstances there is a hire agreement.</P>
        <P>I will need to consult my officials on Senator O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s question.  I understand that it depends on a number of factors, including the speed of the vehicle, the load and so on.  Vehicles of people who operate services for hire and reward require a licence, but others do not.  It is a grey area and there are exemptions in some cases.  I will not go through the list of exemptions now.  In general, if the goods are being carried for hire or reward, the operator must have a licence.  If the goods are not those of the operator and if he is being paid to carry them and they are being carried as part of a contract with somebody, a licence is required.  For example, if somebody is carrying goods on a low loader for somebody and receiving payment for that, a licence is required.  However, there is a proposal for a permit system for some vehicles.  There <Col N="1018"/>is a large number of exemptions in and around agriculture and farming and if the Senator has specifics on which he wants more detail, we can come back to him on those.</P>

        <P FLI="0">These are important documents which affect people&rsquo;s livelihood and they are offered &ldquo;without proof of the signature of the person purporting to sign the certificate or that he or she was an officer of the Minister&rdquo;.  Is there larger proof that the documents are authentic, were properly signed and the person was an officer of the Minister.  This seems a strange exemption in a matter where we have paid so much attention to the importance of ensuring everything is correct with regard to access to the profession.  It seems strange to me that one does not have to validate the signature or prove the person was an officer of the Minister.  Why are the exemptions in this regard in the legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Amendment No. 8 would require that any certificate issued by the Department certifying that a particular operator was or was not licensed on a particular date would have to be accompanied by actual proof of the signature of the person in the Department who signed it.  Subsection (3) uses the standard wording for the provision in these kinds of certificates and legislation generally.  These certificates are typically only provided by the Department to the Garda or the RSA when they are prosecuting somebody for operating without a licence.  The certificate would state that on a particular date, the date the garda stopped the operator at a road side check, the person in question did or did not have a licence.  The certificate is signed by the official dealing with the certificate.  If the certificate states that the operator did not have a licence, it is then presented to the court as evidence.  The certificate is taken at face value by the courts since the current legislation providing for them states: &ldquo;The certificate shall, without proof of the signature of the person purporting to sign the certificate, be evidence of the matter certified by the certificate.&rdquo;  The amendment would require proof of the signature to be presented to the court.  This could involve the official having to travel to the court every time any such certificate was presented.  Such a provision would be very unusual and would make enforcement very difficult.  In addition, it would be extremely time-consuming and inefficient.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The point of this amendment is that the Bill makes it an offence for the customer, bringing draconian penalties of &euro;500,000 and imprisonment for three years.  If I get a person to bring my milk to the creamery why should I merit that degree of penalty?  I do not know whether it is normal for customers who engage in transactions in good faith to be thus treated.  If somebody calls to one&rsquo;s door and says he would like to do some haulage on one&rsquo;s behalf, as the customer one becomes liable for an extremely large fine and a lengthy prison sentence.  All that was being done was sending milk to the creamery, nothing more heinous was taking place.  The imposition of a penalty is on the customer rather than on the person engaging in the illegal act.  That and its extent makes this a very heavy penalty for people who act in good faith in trying to conduct their business at the most competitive prices they can get.</P>

	<P>The maximum fine is &euro;500,000.  I cannot see anybody being fined that amount.  The current penalty for this offence is only &euro;1,905 which is very low considering the savings that can be made by a person using unscrupulous or illegal operators.  The intention of this provision is not to catch people out but to allow us to prosecute customers who willingly and knowingly hire illegal operators.  This is a significant problem in the road haulageindustry at present and the industry has lobbied for a change, taking the view, probably rightly, that customers who knowingly hire an unlicensed operator are damaging legitimate business and are complicit in many ways in the offence, though tax evasion and, in some cases,evasion of safety regulations.  This measure will only be employed if a person knowinglyhires an unlicensed operator.  It is not designed to catch people out who make an honestmistake nor does it require the average person or business to check that the person hired is licensed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
        <P LI="1">22. Carriage of passengers by undertakings engaged in the occupation of road transport using vehicles with a speed not exceeding 40 km/h in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 1071/2009.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment refers to a formulation contained in an EU document which does not apply to undertakings engaged in the occupation of road transport operators using vehicles with a speed not exceeding 40km/h.  This did not feature in the Bill as presented to the House.  I believe it would have certain attractions in rural areas, perhaps also in urban areas.  If the EU allows this exemption it gives us scope to have competition in a field where many would say it is needed.  It is referred to in the summary on page 2 of the very helpful document provided by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  I submit this for the Minister&rsquo;s consideration as it was contained in the EU regulation and did not feature in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is correct that EU regulations governing this area allow member states to exempt types of slow vehicles from the licensing requirements.  As I understand it, the central amendment would only apply to passenger vehicles that travel at speeds under 40km/h and the Senator&rsquo;s amendment would exempt them from the licensing process.</P>
        <P>I have two issues with this.  First, it has never arisen; nobody has ever applied for a licence for a vehicle with such a low operating speed and I am not sure anybody would want to travel in a vehicle that could travel only at speeds under 40km/h.  Even in rural areas people need to get around more quickly than that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>What about jarveys in Killarney?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>Do the vehicles jarveys drive count as passenger vehicles?  That is a good question.  It would not be a good idea to allow vehicles that travel at speeds under 40km/h to be exempt.  From a competition point of view it would be unfair.  One would be saying that this entire class of vehicle that can travel very slowly does not need a licence but that anybody who has a modern bus or coach or mini-bus must apply for a licence.  One would create a category of slow vehicles which could be operated without a licence and this would be unfair to the existing industry.</P>
        <P>In addition, other issues apply.  If we state that a person must be licensed to drive a bus because we do not want to give a bus licence to a person who has been convicted of kidnapping, for example, and we do not believe that person should be allowed to drive children around in a bus, we cannot then say it is all right if the vehicle moves slowly.  I do not see the logic of that.</P>

	<P>The Schedule is yet to be agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make a point to the Minister before getting into Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, on the Schedule.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Schedule, I ask the Minister to give an undertaking that agricultural vehicles, vehicles involved in plant hire haulage and so on be given exemptions.  I ask the Minister to consider this on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I must take that request under advisement.  I cannot really give such an undertaking because I seek a well regulated, competitive road haulage industry.  One cannot put in place all these licensing criteria, regulations, safety requirements and requirements of good repute and state that while they apply to hauliers, if one uses agricultural vehicles it does not matter and one can do whatever one wishes without a licence.  That would not be fair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The majority of those concerned would have single vehicle operations.  It is not as though fleets of agricultural vehicles would go on the road drawing material and I note not much construction is going on at present.  It pertains to self-operators and so on and I acknowledge that certain exemptions exist.  However, the Minister should consider this because people are not aware one requires a transport licence to, for example, haul grain for hire or even in respect of plant hire and of JCBs, HYMACs or things like that.  This knowledge is not in the public domain.  People always have considered that agricultural vehicles were exempt.  People thought they were exempt if they were hauling animals to the factory or the local mart in a cattle trailer if they did it for hire.  However, under this legislation, it appears as though this is not the case.  If one takes something for hire, that means one is not exempt and one therefore needs a haulage licence.  This matter must be clarified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of exceptions.  For example, there are exemptions if one is operating on one&rsquo;s own account.  Moreover, there are exemptions for a wide range of things, encompassing everything from mail to corpses to milk and various other items.  However, it would not be appropriate to have a blanket exemption for agricultural vehicles.  It would be really unfair to the haulage industry to insist that it must jump through all these hoops, namely, to have a licence, be of good repute, be established in the State and have a good financial standing but then tell someone who uses a tractor or other agricultural vehicle that none of these standards apply.</P>
        <P>I will give the matter some consideration.  The RSA already has done some work in this regard.  For example, European regulations allow exemptions for vehicles that travel at less than 40 km/h.  Some work is being done by the RSA on allowing an exemption for such vehicles if they are not going to use the motorway.  While someone operating within his or her own immediate area and who is not going onto the motorway, etc., could have an exemption, there are potential problems and potential downsides in this regard.  One obvious downside is that most modern agricultural vehicles now can travel at speeds greater than 40 km/h.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s points.  As he stated, the majority of agricultural vehicles, especially those which would be involved in hire work, travel at more than 50km/h.  While the Minister has stated he cannot make exceptions in respect of this legislation, he should give consideration to this issue in the context of the more comprehensive transport Bill he intends to bring through the Oireachtas next year.  In addition, I ask them to put into the public <Col N="1022"/>domain the present exemptions to make people aware of them.  His Department could outline, through advertisements or similar means, what is exempt from the requirement to have a haulage licence, particularly in respect of the agricultural and plant hire sectors.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to the House.  It is a shame that we must deal with issues such as this.  No one has articulated the seriousness of the matter in recent weeks more than my good friend, Senator Whelan.  Others may have articulated it, but only in the privacy of parliamentary party rooms.  Throughout the Houses, I do not doubt that Labour Party and Fine Gael backbenchers share my view.  The only question is what, if anything, will be done about it.  I fully understand that the responsibility of the Government is to make difficult decisions and the people understand that austerity is necessary at this time, but which of us or our families, people who are lucky enough to have jobs, would not gladly pay a little bit more for the care and relative security of the elderly and the young, the most vulnerable in society?</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il made difficult, unpopular decisions.  When on the opposite side of the House, I was no less robust in condemning any wrong that was done.  As Senator Whelan correctly pointed out, wrong is being done in this instance.  The elderly, the young and the vulnerable are the most important people in our society.  Fianna F&aacute;il knows all about the medical card debacle.  It was not my proudest day wearing the Fianna F&aacute;il jersey.  On that day, the elderly stood outside and told us it should not happen.  With the benefit of hindsight, I can say that they were right.</P>
        <P>The people focusing on this action are not able to congregate outside Leinster House or in the church on Clarendon Street to have a go at the Minister of the day.  They depend on us, the Senators opposite, the Minister of State and the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, to say that this action is wrong.  There is a crisis in the health service and a financial problem, but let us use our minds and efforts to find resources elsewhere.  Could other budgets be shaved back, other plans be tempered or other ambitions postponed for a little while in the interests of the care of our elderly?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have read about many people in recent days.  For example, Ms &Aacute;ine Campbell&rsquo;s 70 year old father is unable to speak following several strokes.  According to media reports by Ms Marese McDonagh, he engages enthusiastically with his daughter when she comes to visit.  At the mention of, in the Minister&rsquo;s words, the rationalisation of community hospitals, he can only close his eyes in disgust.  People are crying themselves to sleep in the constituency of Deputy Fleming, Senator Whelan and others from County Laois.  They do not deserve to be singled out.  I look at the amendment from the Government and I see that decisions have been taken on Abbeyleix, Shaen and Brittas, which have gone, but no further decisions have been taken.  Will it take the protestations of Senator Whelan and others to save hospitals throughout the country?  Why should they be scapegoated?  Another inexcusable problem with the Government on autopilot is the communication by use of leaks in the <i>Irish Daily Mail</i>.  I read that various hospitals are set to close and lose beds.  St John&rsquo;s Hospital in Sligo and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital in Carrick-on-Shannon in the constituency from which Senator Henry and I come are set to experience bed closures.  One wonders what happened to the manifesto which claimed that the devil and all would be delivered for the people.  Like so many plans, another U-turn has been <Col N="1024"/>done on this.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, told us he would take control of the health service, fire the HSE board and manage it.  It looks like headless chickens running around, closing hospitals, leaking details and floating ideas.  They thought they would see what people thought if they closed Laois because there are not too many people there, Senator Whelan would not bother and Deputy Fleming was in Fianna F&aacute;il.  They just do not care.  When Fianna F&aacute;il did wrong, it was told by the elderly people in Kildare Street and at Clarendon Street church that it was getting it wrong.  However, the sick, the elderly and the incapacitated are unable to tell the Government that it is getting it wrong.  Just because the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, thinks the low-hanging fruit has already been picked, does not mean he should focus on the most vulnerable in society.</P>
        <P>This year we will borrow &euro;750 million to live up to our responsibility in foreign aid.  That is honourable and we all support policy that invests in our international responsibilities.  Various interest groups, such as Age Action Ireland, have pointed out that moving elderly people over the age of 80 and taking them away from their families means that hundreds of people are going to die, to quote &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; yesterday evening.  Is it not possible to postpone &euro;50 million to &euro;100 million of the &euro;750 million in foreign aid for a year or two to assist with the survival of elderly people in this country?  It is not a matter of being against foreign aid investment.  Of course, we are in favour of it but I wonder how much it will cost.  The amendment refers to a cost of up to &euro;1 billion, which is a classic case of wording backing up the argument.  We are told that it will cost &euro;600 million to bring the beds up to the standard demanded by HIQA.  The Government is giving away &euro;750 million in foreign aid this year.  Is it possible to postpone this for a number of years, even though it is honourable?  This is my point of view and I am giving an example of other areas that could be examined.  I am not saying that they must or they should but there are a number of voted expenditure areas and if &euro;600 million must be found to prevent elderly people in this country dying, that is my responsibility and that is what my tax euro are for.  Of course I want to help the people in receipt of foreign aid, more so than we do at present, but if people here are dying then we have a responsibility to them first and foremost.  The responsibility of Government and of our very existence in these Houses is to the people.  As we all pander to our European masters, there is a better way to care for the elderly than to put them out of what is effectively their home.</P>
	<P>How many more will there be?  The communications strategy on this matter is an unmitigated disaster.  A list was leaked to the <i>Irish Daily Mail</i> on 24 November.  In fairness to Senator John Whelan, he outlined the situation.  I understand because I know what it is like when difficult decisions are taken but this is the worst I have seen.  This motion should highlight the fact that this measure should be reversed pending a national strategy.  What is the health plan?  The pre-election commitment was for Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s centre of excellence.  We also had promises about care for the elderly and increased expenditure year on year.  On the previous day, the Minister for Health said he was taking control of the health service and was responsible, but in recent days he has referred to the HSE, HIQA and the moratorium.  The moratorium is too blunt an instrument, as is closing hospitals.  The amendment to the motion suggests that the average cost is in the region of &euro;1,250 per bed, but according to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the sum is between &euro;900 and &euro;1,200.  If costs are the issue, this is what should be dealt with.  If my business is losing money because costs are too high, I can bring down costs or I can close the door.  The Government has opted to close the door but I suggest they put a little thought into it and bring down costs.  Other areas of expenditure may need to be shaved back to help the people of Laois, Shaen, Abbeyleix and Brittas.  The Government should not make <Col N="1025"/>decent, hard-working public representatives like Senator John Whelan the scapegoat to save all the other hospitals.  That is what the Government is doing.</P>

Our spokesperson, Senator Marc MacSharry, has outlined earlier objections to this measure.  I have a number of additional objections that the Minister should hear.  I welcome the Minister to the House and I have the utmost regard for him and the work he does.  I have a fundamental objection to the Minister for Health overseeing policy with regard to public nursing homes because of his and his colleagues&rsquo; involvement in the private nursing home sector.  This man should not be overseeing the nursing home bed closures when he is so closely aligned to the private nursing home sector.  When the National Treatment Purchase Fund was asked to seek reductions in private nursing home costs, it sought reductions of &euro;5 per week but the HSE was instructed not to seek any savings in public nursing home bed costs.  The Minister sacked the previous HSE board and appointed his own people.  Why did this happen?  It was to ensure that public nursing home costs are seen as proportionately higher than private nursing home costs.  Why is that?  Then when you are looking for money the public sector says it should be put into the private sector.  How can we have a situation where the Minister for Health is presiding over this policy and is so closely aligned with the private nursing home sector?  He should step back from this area because he has a conflict of interest.  I have no difficulty in saying that.  There are 842 beds for elderly, sick and infirm people as in Senator John Whelan&rsquo;s constituency.</P>

He should not even preside over these decisions, he should step back and allow the Minister of State who does not have a conflict of interest deal with it.  I ask the Minister of State to check the instructions the Health Service Executive gave the National Treatment Purchase Fund not to seek any reduction in public nursing home bed costs in order that it could show them as disproportionately higher than the private sector.  This is creeping privatisation of the health service which was exactly what I said prior to the election when Fine Gael trumpeted this Dutch model.  This Dutch model will mean that people in the State will pay thousands of euro more for less services.  Even in the most difficult times if we cannot look after our elderly, the people who have built the State, but throw them out of their homes, as has happened in Abbeyleix, Shaen, and Brittas and 40 other homes, the Government should be ashamed of itself.</P>

As we speak on the motion, vulnerable elderly people and their families in counties Laois, Louth, Galway, Donegal, Cork, Tipperary and Cavan are being cared for in community settings, run by the HSE, in comfort &mdash; as they should be &mdash; but not in peace and tranquility.  This is happening because they do not know where they will be after Christmas.  That is not good enough.</P>
        <P>In regard to Lisdarn nursing unit for the elderly in Cavan town, about which there is a rumour of closure, there are 44 patients who are in desperate need of information from the Minister and the Department as to where their future lies.  The reason for tabling this motion is to get clarity in respect of the future for these vulnerable people.  I received a letter from Ms Margaret Basmajian and Ms Eileen Flynn &mdash; two ladies who have visited the unit for the elderly in Cavan town for the past 25 years.</P>

	<P>We are not hiding behind anyone, we are dealing with the reality and the real world.  We are talking about the elderly being asked to leave nursing homes, of course that is a very difficult decision for people who have been in a nursing home for a considerable period.  It is important it is approached in the proper way.  It is also important there is help available to them if a nursing home is not in a position to meet the standards required and that there is adequate care.  No one is going to be denied nursing home care under the package about which we are talking.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking for support for the amendment; it is a constructive proposal that offers the right way to deal with this matter.</P>
        <P>It is also about long-term planning.  There are 550,000 people over 65 years.  By 2021, there will be more than 750,000 and by 2031, more than 1 million.  The first time there was long-term planning for the provision of elder care was when the fair deal system was introduced.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to move forward and plan for 2020 and 2030.  We have a Minister and Ministers of State who will take the difficult decisions to ensure we will cater for those in need of nursing home care and those who will need it in the long term.  I hope, therefore, that Senators will support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it as a given that everyone in the House shares a concern for the elderly; it is not the prerogative of one side or another, it shared by the Minister, the staff and the Civil Service advisers.  We all care about the elderly.</P>
        <P>We must do something practical.  It is a pity we must face this difficult issue immediately after having had some of the first public consultations on the care of the elderly in our community.  There is a certain irony in this, as there is in the fact that I was one of the first to raise this issue on the Independent benches when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government with reference to the Bethany Home in Carlow.  Precisely the same issues were involved and it made me suspicious.  The rights of the elderly were not respected.  They have a legal entitlement to be consulted and agree, but this did not happen, rather they were evicted and taken away by ambulance.  We all know that with elderly people, in particular, such a move can prove fatal; it is highly dangerous.  Even for younger people, moving home is a time when heart attacks occur and there are other distressing physical symptoms.  For an elderly person, such a move, particularly in traumatic circumstances, can prove fatal.</P>
        <P>I am suspicious of HIQA.  The home in Carlow was rudimentary.  I watched the programme on television last night and it was perfectly obvious that the standards referred to were far off into the future.  We are closing institutions on the basis of hypothetical standards of perfection we will probably not be able to reach anywhere because of the disastrous financial position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, we should not try &mdash; is that what the Senator is saying?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We should try to provide the best possible accommodation for the elderly in whatever circumstances we can and that does not always mean closing buildings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what we are doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I notice the amendment contains loose language such as &ldquo;approximately 25% of residential stock is over 120 years old&rdquo;.  Really.  What a shock.  I live in a house that is over 200 years old, but it is perfectly sound.  This is the sort of crass argument one gets from bureaucracy, that a house has a certain lifetime.  No, it does not, not if it is properly maintained, and some of these places have been properly maintained.  Yes, additional facilities may be required as a counsel of perfection, but is it worth the trauma inflicted on those affected?</P><Col N="1031"/>
        <P>We talk about upgrading existing stock, at a cost of up to &euro;1 billion.  This has just been dreamed up, it is not a real figure.  If it was, it would be something like &euro;750,556.17, not &ldquo;approximately&rdquo; &euro;1 billion.  This is a scare tactic.</P>
        <P>I do not foresee great agreement and would vote with my colleagues on this side of the House, but, unfortunately, I will not be able to be here.  Given that they have used words such as &ldquo;condemn the disgraceful closure&rdquo;, &ldquo;disgraceful&rdquo; and &ldquo;shameful&rdquo;, it does not look as if there is much prospect of a meeting of minds.  However, I look forward to being a situation where we can move forward together to improve matters.</P>
        <P>I know some of the hospitals mentioned.  I had an elderly relative, a most genteel elderly lady from Portlaoise, although that is not what she called the town.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>She was in Queen&rsquo;s County.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, her address was Beechfield, Maryborough, Queen&rsquo;s County.  I did not want to say it because I did not want to offend the Senator&rsquo;s republican sensibilities because she is such a good friend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>We are a broad church.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>My elderly relative was very well treated in the hospital.  She had Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and I cannot speak highly enough about those who looked after her.  I have seen the situation in Abbeyleix and heard elderly people say it is their home.  It is their home and they will find their social connections destroyed.  The Minister will be sympathetic on a case I raised with Senator Tom Sheahan in which the same thing is happening on Valentia Island.  It has cost the Exchequer and is daft.  People are being split up and placed in three different locations on the mainland, 100 km apart.  I personally witnessed &mdash; I rarely get involved in hospital issues &mdash; people visiting individuals who did not receive any visitors.  It is the most wonderful community.  That is what I consider to be Irish values and what I like to see.  If the equipment is not up to date or some of the paint flakes, so bloody what?  If the residents believe it is good enough for them, who are we to quarrel with them?</P>
        <P>On foreign aid, I understand Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s point, but I would not take anything from the figure for foreign aid.  It would be mean-minded of us to do so because it is expressed as a percentage; therefore, it falls automatically as our income falls.  When we ask who our neighbour is, it is not just the person who lives next door who shares our opinions, it is also the person who is most vulnerable.  The most vulnerable and susceptible to debt &mdash; young people &mdash; are those who are being helped by foreign aid.</P>
        <P>A salient point was made by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien about a conflict of interest.  That is a most serious matter.  If there is a conflict of interest &mdash; it seems from what the Senator said that there clearly is &mdash; the Minister has investments in private nursing homes and is administering a nursing home scheme, it is a very serious matter which needs to be clarified.  Perhaps there is an explanation and he has legally distanced himself, but it represents a very unfortunate incident.  This has been highlighted properly by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I have no doubt whatsoever about her commitment to the care of the elderly and the provision of public long-stay beds.  I am glad we are not going to personalise the debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I congratulate Senator Marc Mac Sharry and his wife, Marie, on the recent birth of their daughter, Isobelle.</P>
        <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to voice my concern for the senior citizens of my community.  I am grateful to speak out not on behalf of the Government but on behalf of the <Col N="1032"/>elderly and infirm in my locality to ensure they get a fair deal.  I am thinking of people such as Catherine Kelly from Cullahill who is 93; Richard Phelan from Raheen who is 99 and will celebrate his 100th birthday in two weeks in Abbeleix hospital; Brigid O&rsquo;Neill, a feisty 92 year old from Spink; and Jack Chester, an old friend of mine from Portlaoise who is 89.  When I speak in defence of these people, they and their families know my form and that I am not trying to use them to score cheap political points or turn their plight into a political football.  I remind the House that it was not me who was booed and jeered on the platform in Abbeyleix but those who tried to turn the event into a cheap political stunt to score political points.</P>
        <P>We do not need, nor will I listen much longer to, more sarcastic sermons from the Fianna F&aacute;il benches.  I do not need their crocodile tears for the elderly.</P>

        <P>The problems for Abbeyleix and Shaen hospitals and many other community nursing homes around the country, as in Edenderry and St. Vincent&rsquo;s in Mountmellick, did not start today or yesterday, or in the past six months.

When it comes to lies, the public has decided who the past masters are.  I am not talking about fibs and venial sins; when it comes to lies, let us consider the original sin of all lies &mdash; the &ldquo;mortaller&rdquo;, as it were &mdash; that the IMF is not in the country.

	<P>He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Just a short note on my return from my weekly visit to St Brigid&rsquo;s Hospital, Shaen, Portlaoise for Mass and Pastoral care.  I know that your Government administration has inherited a huge burden after the careless and irresponsible years of the outgoing group.  Unfortunately, your job involves very difficult decisions.</P>

	<P>Fr. Kelly also wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">We cannot solve the problems created by greed by such punishment of those with such special needs.  I was not surprised at all today to be greeted by tears and confusion.  I only presume that you are badly advised and wrongly encouraged to make such a decision.  The costings of this decision cannot be measured in finance [alone].  I speak sincerely for those with no voice and now no home.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder what Senator John Whelan would say if this policy were being pursued by the former Minister for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney, and it were stated on the register of interests that she had an interest in private nursing homes?  I demand <Col N="1035"/>that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, ask herself that question because she is an honourable person.  Her Labour Party colleagues are not too happy.</P>
        <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> states Mr. Tadhg Daly, chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland, which represents private nursing home operators, estimates there are up to 2,000 empty beds in the private sector.  Mr. Daly says his &ldquo;members have the expertise and capacity to accommodate many of those who will be displaced if public facilities close&rdquo;.  The two relevant paragraphs in yesterday&rsquo;s article should be of the utmost concern to all people in all parties who value the provision of a public health service.</P>
        <P>Senator John Whelan has announced the closures in County Laois are under active review.  In last Sunday&rsquo;s <i>Sunday Independent</i> he implied there would be war, or that the Government could expect a revolt.  He stated, &ldquo;This will make the medical card for the over 70s row pale into insignificance.&rdquo;  Despite this, his example of a revolt is to come into the Seanad to note the decision to close Abbeyleix and Shaen hospitals.  Will he go back to his constituents and say he noted the closures?  Is that the battle he is fighting?  Is that the revolt about which he is talking?  Let us fight, be straight and bring the conversations which I know are taking place in the Labour Party parliamentary rooms onto the floor of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  Let us fight and let us be straight.  The conversations being held in the Labour Party parliamentary party should be aired on the floor of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad because some of us value a public health service.  The objective of co-location was to open up public beds in public hospitals.</P>

	<P>This country supposedly invested too many resources in the sector and the Government is now saying it is unaffordable and the private sector can do it cheaper.  That is its reasoning.  We spent not wisely but too well.  Senator Whelan will have to say more to his people than merely note a decision of the Government.  He will have to indicate whether he values the public provision of long-term care for the elderly or prefers to pass the responsibility to private operators.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Even though HIQA found that Ardee and Cottage Hospital in Drogheda were up to standard and that one was a centre of excellence, the Government is scaremongering with the claim that they cannot cope because only the private sector can do the job properly.  That is wrong.  We need a public sector and a public health service.  It is time the Labour Party stood up for that public health service rather than going along with the privateers in Fine Gael.  Fianna F&aacute;il has always believed in a public health service.</P>

	<P>All the scaremongering on this issue in the budget has come via leaks by Ministers to their favourite journalists and daily newspapers.  People wake up every morning to find out what is happening in the budget through leaks to the media.  Is that the platform on which Fine Gael and the Labour Party Members were elected?  Did they promise to govern by leaks?  They promised transparency and a new way of governing.  It is far worse than the old way and shame on them for it.  Let us protect the elderly.  I urge Senator Whelan to vote with us rather than merely note the decision.</P>

	<P Just="Left">All of us have mothers but some of us are less fortunate in that our mothers are no longer with us.  My mother died a number of years ago and I am sure other Members have had the same experience.  We are speaking about vulnerable people in society but just because they are vulnerable does not mean they do not listen to debates like this one.  I am not certain that they read the <i>Daily Mail.</i></P>

	<P>That is irrelevant.  We can have a reasonable debate about how we care for the elderly in our communities, how we finance care for the 4.9% of our elderly population who end up in nursing homes and what level of care they should expect to receive.  Sometimes they need care over a significant number of years before they die.  I am not partisan <Col N="1037"/>in this debate.  Senator Norris was correct to state that everyone is worried about this issue.  The last thing that should happen in the debate is a personalised political attack.</P>

	<P>I am not saying who is responsible.  I am merely making the point that it should not happen.  We should not be stoking fears among people according to where they live because these places are their homes.  They live in these nursing homes for up to 20 years.  However, we cannot ignore the responsibility to maintain certain standards.  If something happened to a vulnerable individual because of a lack of standards, Members on both sides of the House would be asking why something was not done earlier.</P>

	<P>We have to be careful with the language we use.  I am referring to both sides of the House.  People listen to what we have to say.  Senator Mary White has a lot to say on these matters because she has an interest in them.  I remind Members of the old adage that fear sells newspapers.</P>

My responsibility is to ensure these people receive excellent services but in some cases these services are not excellent.</P>

The majority of our community-based, publicly funded nursing homes or continuing care homes &mdash; I am not certain of the correct term &mdash; needs upgrading and refurbishment.  We will not be able to maintain some of them because of the moratorium.  Others will be able to provide excellent care within the community or are convenient for visitors.  Caring for our elderly population is not just about a good environment in terms of structure or care.  It is a question of interconnections between these aspects.  People need to feel comfortable, secure and well cared for within their communities but we also need to set standards.</P>

Not alone does it protect the people who receive the care in those institutions, but it also protects us as society.  I agree with the Senator that the lack of communications in this case was appalling.  It was inappropriate for people to find out through the media or the rumour mill.  The people who are central to all this &mdash; the people who deliver the care, the families of the people in there and the people themselves who have the capacity to listen and make decisions &mdash; should have been involved in this process before anything came out in public.  We are working on that.</P>
        <P>I have the script of the official speech which contains all of what I am saying.  As I said in this House a number of weeks ago, sometimes we forget about our own value and that we, as public representatives, can give the people, who chose us to represent them, access to those who make decisions.  The decisions on the nursing homes were made by the HSE.  The decisions are decisions of the HSE, not the Minister.  Following a meeting in Leinster House with a delegation, including Senator Whelan, concerned about the planned closures in Abbeyleix and Shaen, the Minister gave an assurance that he would investigate the matters raised at the meeting.  He also undertook to visit Abbeyleix after the budget.  This is not empty gesturing.</P>

I equally keep saying that if that is the case then those of us who get elected need to act differently.  In these times we all need to act differently.  We are making decisions over which we do not have complete control and we are making them in a multiplicity of circumstances.

This is an issue on which there is cross-party support in order to get the best in terms of care, access, bed provision, and best practice in how we care for older people and the types of facilities we make available for older people.</P><Col N="1039"/>

Obviously it creates fear when people hear of the potential of 40 community nursing units closing.  While I agree with the Minister of State on HIQA independently reviewing some of these facilities, I can give her the example of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital in Waterford, where in 2008 the 19-bed St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward was closed.  The local Labour, Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and Independent representatives were unanimous that the closure of that ward was wrong.  At the time a commitment was given by the HSE, the then Government and all the then Opposition parties &mdash; including Fine Gael and Labour &mdash; to build a new 50-bed community nursing unit on the grounds of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital.  I raised this with the Minister for Health at a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  His reply was that the executive of the HSE at the time of the closure of St. Brigid&rsquo;s ward indicated that it would examine the provision of a new 50-bed community nursing unit on the grounds of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital.  He also stated such a construction project would require capital funding and the HSE must prioritise all capital infrastructure projects nationally within its overall capital funding allocation.</P>
        <P>I accept we are in difficult times and that all funding must be subject to the availability of money.  We all accept that we must find the money somewhere.  The difficulty for people in Waterford and people in other areas where units or wards may close with beds taken out of the system is that promises were made and commitments were given before the general election.  I do not need to rehearse all those promises, but I say that as a statement of fact.  That is what upsets people and results in the tabling of motions such as the one before us.  While we do not need to be combative about the matter, we should certainly put on the record the facts, promises given and commitments made, and then ask what is happening now.</P>
        <P>Under the heading of health capital developments, the programme for Government committed to prioritise step-down and long-term facilities, and community care facilities such as day centres for older people.  I accept the bona fides of the Minister of State, who has come to this House a number of times.  I accept she has a very difficult job with many pressures.</P>
        <P>We had a discussion in this House last week during which Members form all sides were complimentary of a new process initiated by the Leader of the House &mdash; a petitions committee to listen to people.  Representatives of advocate groups for older people appeared before the committee, including two experts one of whom works for the United Nations on new binding protocols to establish fundamental rights for older people.  One of those fundamental rights must be the right to proper care.  I regard this issue as bigger than simply community nursing units.  First of all we need to ensure people are cared for in the home.  We can all give examples of people, whose home help hours have been cut, making it more difficult.  I could give the Minister of State countless examples of older people in Waterford Regional Hospital working with the hospital&rsquo;s geriatric liaison nurse in an attempt to get them into private nursing homes or St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital but no places are available because the ward was closed resulting in a shortage of beds.  That puts more pressure on the acute services.  This is about having a proper joined-up approach between the acute services and care for the elderly.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment refers to a price difference between public and private bed provision.  Are we comparing like with like?  Are we comparing community nursing units with, for example, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital, which is a geriatric care hospital and provides more than simply nursing home care as would happen, for example, in a private nursing home.  If that is the case it is like comparing apples and oranges.  There is a world of difference between the service provided in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital and that provided in a private nursing home.</P><Col N="1040"/>
        <P Just="Left">The public service recruitment embargo forces many public facilities to employ agency staff and is driving up their costs.  This is happening not alone in our community nursing units but in our hospitals.  The reason given by the HSE for the proposed closure of a ward, which decision was subsequently reversed, in a community hospital in Dungarvan was the cost of agency staff.  These issues need to be dealt with.  In some instances extra funding is not an issue.  What is required is better management in terms of addressing problems.  I acknowledge the Minister has undertaken to review these issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My grandfather, who died at the age of 99 years, was a patient in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital where he received tremendous care.  While he expected to be in the hospital for a few weeks he remained there for approximately four years, during which time he received tremendous treatment.  Were he alive &mdash; I am sure this is true of many people in nursing homes listening to this debate &mdash; he would not be happy.  These people want us to discuss the real issues and do the right thing.  There have been many headlines in newspapers about the possible closure of particular hospitals.  I do not want to get into the argument around alternatives but I could give the Minister of State some alternatives of where money could be found, including by way of extra revenue on higher earners and wealth, which money could be invested in ensuring our older people are looked after.  These are issues about which I am concerned.  It is hoped the Minister of State will take them on board and will address in her response some of the points made in my contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  She is becoming a regular visitor here.  The Minister&rsquo;s words of caution in terms of overly politicising the debate on the elderly are well founded.  They are a particularly vulnerable group in society.  While there are many other vulnerable groups of people in society older people do not have the economic freedom to make the choices they would like to make.  We have a responsibility to ensure that the messages we send out are clear and thoughtful.</P>
        <P>I support the Government&rsquo;s amendment which is prudent and well put together.  I am a proponent of community facilities for the elderly.  In my view, one of the best facilities for older people is in my parish of Ennistymon, County Clare.  There are numerous similar facilities throughout the country which provide older people with an opportunity to remain in their communities while attending day-care centres Monday to Friday to have their primary health care needs dealt with.  Much of this is the result of a great deal of local fund raising and a partnership between the HSE, hospital management and communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister might consider putting in place a formal structure in respect of partnerships within communities where able volunteers are available and fund raising is possible, be it in respect of providing assistance or support, hairdressing, beauty clinics and so on.  Many people in part-time work or unemployed are willing to work and engage with older people.  There is a strong argument to be made for the putting in place of a formal structure to bring together with existing services people who are willing to help. I suggest that those wishing to see this type of operation in action should visit the three units in County Clare, particularly the one in Ennistymon which has worked well and is providing support for a couple of thousand older people in their homes.  These facilities also provide respite care for older people being cared for in the home.  We are now entering the Christmas season and there will be many parties and so on.  It is not all bad.  I believe an opportunity exists for other facilities in other parts of the country to replicate what is being done in Ennistymon.</P><Col N="1041"/>
        <P>We are living in extremely difficult economic times and must ensure we get the best value for money.  This means making difficult decisions.  I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, is not afraid to make those difficult decisions when they are the right ones.  There are many facilities which are too old and in respect of which retrofitting is not an option and, as such, alternative arrangements will have to be made.  However, the scaremongering that is taking place in this pre-budget period is most unhelpful and is causing enormous frustration.  As I have stated before, next year the Government might consider holding a series of pre-budget discussions on health, education and so on so that the budget speech is only summing up what has been decided and debated extensively in Parliament.  That system works in other European countries.  We should consider commencing that process in September and finalising it in December as opposed to commencing this process with a budget speech in the first week of December, followed by the taking of the Finance Bill.   Everything needs to be examined.  What has been happening during the past three or four weeks is not good politics.  It should not happen because it creates all sorts of speculation that is completely unhelpful.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State on the job she is doing.  I have no doubt that in five years time care of the elderly will be better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>It was interesting to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.  We had an informative academic event in this House yesterday in terms of the Tilda study and the rights of older people.  This is reality.  What we are talking about today is older people&rsquo;s human rights.</P>
        <P>The Government recently announced the closure of St. Brigid&rsquo;s nursing home, Brittas, a public nursing home in South County Dublin.  The home has 80 residents, the majority of these classed as high dependency and suffering from dementia and other physical ailments.  Closure of this home is being fought by the residents and their families and relatives.  This decision has received universal criticism.</P>
        <P>Two main issues arise in relation to the closure of this home.  I will first address why the closure should not proceed and, second, the lack of suitable provision for the residents upon closure of the nursing home.</P>
        <P Just="Left">St. Brigid&rsquo;s nursing home, Brittas, should not be closed.  It is one of a diminishing number of public homes dedicated to providing residential care to the elderly.  The decision to close the unit has been based on a misinterpretation of the HIQA report.  While the inspection, which was undertaken in December 2009, found a number of areas which needed considerable improvement, the majority of these were structural.  These issues can be resolved with extra funding.  This will bring the building up to a suitable standard.  The Minister of State stated in her contribution that the main problem with nursing homes is the age of the buildings.</P>
        <P>St. Brigid&rsquo;s was constructed in 1935 as a tuberculosis hospital and was modified in 1959 into short-term emergency housing for elderly people.  Nowhere in HIQA&rsquo;s report is it recommended that the facility be closed.  The decision to close this facility is an ill-informed one.  The trauma which this will cause for residents has clearly not been considered by the Minister.  It is another prime example of our elderly being pushed aside and not given proper consideration and respect they deserve.  Older people are marginalised in our society.  The elderly people residing in St. Brigid&rsquo;s have no desire to leave what has become their home.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, is effectively evicting vulnerable, ill, elderly people from their homes.  These residential care units are their homes.</P>
        <P>Under Article 45 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, the directives of social policy state the Ministers and Government shall endeavour to give special protection to the elderly and infirm in society.  The residents of St. Brigid&rsquo;s in south County Dublin are both elderly and infirm and require <Col N="1042"/>the Minister to vindicate their rights, not to forcibly evict them from their home with little notice and without consideration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second issue with which I wish to deal is the lack of alternative facilities.  If the Minister continues with his plans to close St. Brigid&rsquo;s, there will be a serious lack of alternative places to which its residents can go.  The Minister has stated the majority of them will be transferred to a new purpose-built unit in Inchicore, which was referred to in the Minister of State&rsquo;s script.  However, as that script noted, this facility would only be able to accommodate a maximum of 50 people.  This would leave 30 residents without definite alternative accommodation, while the best the Minister can say is they will be transferred to other facilities in Dublin or the Leinster region.  Clearly, this is an unsatisfactory position.  A spokesperson for Tallaght Hospital has stated the closure will result in some of the residents being transferred there.  This will test a hospital at which, as Members are aware, resources already are very stretched.  The Minister of State is aware that people who are transferred to a general hospital will not get the special care they receive at present at St. Brigid&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I emphasise the Minister&rsquo;s decision to close St. Brigid&rsquo;s is a short-sighted attack on the dignity of older people who cannot afford private medical care.  The Minister has done nothing to ensure the protection of the rights of the elderly in that facility.  Instead, he is trampling over the human rights of both current and future residents by not ensuring that adequate alternative measures are put in place prior to this closure.  I recommend that the Minister should put a stop to his plans to close this facility and instead should designate enough funds to repair it and bring it up to a reasonable and acceptable standard.  I appeal for these residents to be left in their own homes.</P>

	<P>One must learn from such situations.  I agree that many discussions take place at parliamentary party meetings.  I am sure such discussions took place in Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s parliamentary party meetings when it was in government.  Naturally, in such meetings one tries to achieve what one can, for the elderly in this case or for the electorate at large.  While no decisions have been made regarding the closures of any of the aforementioned community nursing homes at this stage, I agree on the need for consultation with the necessary stakeholders before any decisions are made.  These stakeholders include Nursing Homes Ireland, the HSE, the Department of Health and the Minister, as well as patients&rsquo; representatives.</P>
        <P>I refer to a point made previously by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien to the effect there are 2,000 private nursing home beds across the country and the policy is to send all these patients into the private sector.  I disagree with this suggestion because Senator Whelan and I were on a conference call at 9 a.m. this morning with Mr. Tadhg Daly of Nursing Homes Ireland.  The point he made was he would be greatly concerned were 20 nursing homes to be closed down overnight and pressure thereby placed on his association&rsquo;s members, because they would be unable to cope with it.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na daoine at&aacute; ag &eacute;isteacht sa bhaile ar an Idirl&iacute;on.  I have been made aware that people in homes are listening to this debate.  The closure of care homes has already commenced.  It is clear the HSE has a policy of retreat from the care of older people and is cutting a swathe through the State&rsquo;s care facilities for older people.  The latest victim of the HSE axe is St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital in Athy, with the closure of 24 beds, following on the closure of 26 beds in the hospital in 2009.  As we have heard, in the past month we have seen the closure of the 32 bed facility in Abbeyleix, 28 respite beds in Thurles and Roscrea in County Tipperary and 30 beds in Shaen, County Laois, with 89 patients displaced through the closure of St. Brigid&rsquo;s home in Crooksling, County Dublin.  In the cases of Abbeyleix and St. Brigid&rsquo;s home, the HSE had carried out extensive works on the facilities but then closed them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, are presiding over the closure of Abbeyleix and Shaen hospitals and I understand only 200 nursing home beds remain in County Laois.  This is, undoubtedly, the outworking of a policy of retreat from the care of older people by the HSE.  Older people are being abandoned to the private sector under the flawed so-called fair deal scheme and the lack of public nursing home beds has caused difficulties for other patients seeking a bed in the system.</P>
        <P>The HSE and the Minister should call a halt to the closures.  Failure to do so will mean he and his Government colleagues are following an unspoken policy of ending direct care of older people in the public health system.  Unfortunately, the Minister and the HSE are in denial.  HIQA is repeatedly cited with regard to the closures, but it has not recommended the closure of any of these hospitals.  The people of Abbeyleix have shown their opposition to the closure.  I hope other communities will do the same and encourage them to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am particularly troubled by two specific cases, one of which concerns St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospital in Ballinasloe which is also a psychiatric hospital.  I understand from my colleague, Councillor Dermot Connolly, that St. Luke&rsquo;s Ward which has 15 beds is to become a six bed psychiatric intensive care unit.  This will mean the loss of nine beds and the remaining six beds are likely <Col N="1047"/>to be occupied for the forthcoming period.  Another psychiatric ward, St. Dymphna&rsquo;s, may be expected to absorb admissions, which is of concern.  While this would create difficulties and affect patient care, it would be far worse if the HSE were to close this ward also.  There is fear about this in the region and I ask the Minister of State to shed light on the matter.</P>
        <P>It is of concern that the HSE shows such little respect for psychiatric patients and the staff who work with them.  It is a labour-intensive form of treatment and cutbacks are felt very severely, particularly to staff numbers.  Staff are not being recruited in the HSE West region.  I spoke to a staff member earlier today and was told there were once 370 medical staff but 100 front-line medical staff had been lost.  Many nurses have left and no one has filled these positions.  It is a small hospital and its status as a psychiatric hospital must be considered in this regard.  This severely affects the ability of staff to carry out pre-discharge programmes, which means either discharge is delayed which further blocks up beds or treatment suffers.</P>
        <P>As I stated, the recruitment embargo is a blunt and crude instrument which does not work on paper and certainly does not work in reality.  If the Minister of State is to take anything from this debate, I ask that it be that the embargo is not working and people are suffering as a result.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Admissions are also being hit.  It is understood some of the work will be transferred to UCHG.  It is expected that the unit will not be maintained and is to be downgraded.  However, surely the fact that some psychiatric admissions are referred from UCHG and Roscommon County Hospital to Ballinasloe is a sign that patient care will suffer, perhaps grievously.  Will the Minister of State offer me, the patients, their families and staff reassurance that such a foolhardy exercise will not be undertaken?</P>
        <P>The second case of concern to me involves St. Francis Home in Galway.  As of September, the number on the active patient list for University College Hospital, Galway was 7,816.  The word &ldquo;active&rdquo; is used which begs the question as to what other waiting lists there are.  Many of these individuals had a waiting time of 22 months.  This is a scandalous figure while beds and wards remain empty.  Figures in local newspapers state more than 100 beds are empty.</P>
        <P>On foot of questions raised by Councillor Catherine Connolly, it was revealed that 1,337 people in Galway city and county had been assessed under the fair deal scheme from its inception to 30 September 2011.  However, she was also informed that no one had been assessed in Galway under the scheme since last June.  Significantly, of those assessed, 63 had charges registered against their homes.  Furthermore, 92 of those assessed qualified for assistance under the scheme but are still awaiting placement because of the mess the scheme is in and empty beds in public nursing homes.  For example, St. Francis Home has had empty beds since the councillor&rsquo;s time on the forum in 2006 and is accepting no admissions.  Of the 92 people assessed and waiting, 46 are in UCHG or Merlin Park Hospital occupying acute beds when they should be in nursing homes.  However, the HSE West region under national direction is closing St. Francis Home which had a capacity of 38 beds, with only 19 now occupied.  There are empty beds in practically every other public nursing home in the HSE area.</P>
         <P>At the same meeting, it was clearly confirmed that agency staff cost &euro;24.029 million in the nine months to September, which represents an increase on the figure for the previous year.  Of this, approximately &euro;12 million was spent on medical staff, &euro;4.6 million on nursing staff, &euro;2.4 million on paramedics and &euro;4.8 million on others.  It was admitted by the Minister on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; that agency staff cost more than directly employing nurses and doctors.  We must remember the figure quoted does not cover the &euro;9 million given to run private companies such as that in Inverin, County Galway.  Councillor Connolly was informed the breakdown of the <Col N="1048"/>&euro;9 million paid to the individual companies contained commercially sensitive information.  However, every euro in the public sector is scrutinised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is singing a very different tune from the one he sang in May 2010 when he stated it flew in the face of evolved government policy that 33 beds to be closed were in a five day ward.  These are the beds used to treat day cases and deal with short-stay procedures.</P>

She should read the Regling and Watson report which states Government policy exacerbated the banking crisis and that 70% of the problem was caused by the Government.  We should put this issue to bed.</P>
        <P>The HSE went out of control under the previous Government.  Its costs went out of control under Fianna F&aacute;il as it went from having a few dozen senior executive positions to a few hundred, while standards dropped in hospitals as the investment by the previous Government made in them reduced.  I could continue in this vein, but I do not have two hours to speak about it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have a copy of a press release which states cuts to school budgets would mean teachers and other staff losing jobs.  A letter outlining hard times was sent by the Department to school board governors last week.  The release also states a reduction in funding would be unprecedented and present a significant challenge.  This was not stated by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  It was stated by John O&rsquo;Dowd, the Sinn F&eacute;in Minister in Northern Ireland.  Sinn F&eacute;in changes its tune when it crosses the Border.  When I cross the Border, I sing the same tune.</P>

	<P Just="Left">All my siblings and I were born in Lifford Community Hospital.  The Minister of State is familiar with Lifford.  The hospital has 20 beds and, because of my personal attachment to it, I would be devastated if it was closed.  Some of my family passed away in it.  If it is closed, I hope patients will be transferred to as good a facility or better.  I ask the Minister of State to talk to local GPs who have a big influence in the community.  They can bring people along and advise the Department if this is a good move because they have their fingers on the pulse of the community.  In Lifford there is a very good medical practice with five GPs.  As the Minister of State knows, the hospital is located on the Lifford side of the bridge from Strabane.  On many occasions it had to be evacuated because people decided to place a bomb 200 m from it.  I lived there at a time when the hospital was evacuated and the windows were blown in.  Some said this was done in the cause of Irish freedom, but we know it was not.  People died while crossing that bridge owing to the actions of certain individuals who, thank God, have gone away.  The hospital was almost blown apart in several explosions, for which no one ever apologised.  People should not tell us today how we should look after our nursing homes when scant regard was paid to patients.  I remember patients being wheeled out and taken to people&rsquo;s homes in Lifford to protect them from an organisation I will not name, but we all know which one it is.</P>

My own late, lamented mother was 86 years of age and in perfect health until a short time before she went into hospital.  I am not casting aspersions, reflecting on the medical care provided or doing anything of that nature.  In my experience, however, there is an attitude and a culture that seems to suggest that once a person has passed a certain age, there is only one way for him or her to go, that perhaps we should not be spending the time, expertise, technology or money on elderly people.  I am not suggesting this is widespread, but I am talking about my own personal experience and that of my neighbours who are elderly.  On a number of occasions they had to get a second or third opinion because the medical advice given was, &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s not much we can do about this.  Maybe she&rsquo;ll have to suffer with it and take a few tablets.&rdquo;  I am not singling out parties, but the Labour Party has always projected itself as being the party of great compassion.</P>

All Ministers must address the deficit in the public finances by seeking efficiencies and savings and working out how best to use a small pot of money.

The amendment to the motion &ldquo;notes&rdquo; that, aside from St. Francis in Galway, Abbeyleix, Shaen in Laois and Crooksling, Dublin, no decisions have been taken regarding the future of any other facility.  That tells me these facilities are gone.   While I appreciate that there may be some debate in Government about other institutions, these are gone.  With the greatest respect to a much more learned man than I on health issues, the word is &ldquo;condemn&rdquo; in instances like this.  The word has always been &ldquo;condemn&rdquo; when wrong things are done.  Show me the savings.  How many staff will be redeployed, what is the monetary value of the savings in closing Abbeyleix?  Senator Norris was correct that the amendment makes the cost of these institutions a notional figure of up to &euro;1 billion.  The HSE expects to save &euro;600 million.  Show me the facts.  If we close X number of hospitals in these places and another number of beds, it will save Y amount of money.  I sat on the Government side and had to defend difficult decisions and I can do that as well as anyone and better than most, but this is ridiculous.</P>
        <P>The medium of communication to the elderly and most vulnerable, not those who can march, but those who are bed bound and wheelchair bound, amputees who depend on others to speak for them, is the public representative.  They depend on us to speak for them.  They are the people who were told that their institutions will close.  Show me the plan that will outline the money that will be saved, the decisions that must be taken in the interests of care of the elderly and I will vote with the Government.  Where will the money come from?  The Senator Harte argument that Fianna F&aacute;il blew the boom will not work anymore.  Bear in mind that the Government will put it all together next Tuesday.  The Goverment will frame the budget.</P>

Deputy Michael Noonan suggested that he would find &euro;200 million before the end of the day, or &euro;600 million within the week to refurbish the nursing homes to care for our elderly people.  If necessary, I will be happy to pay more tax for the relative care of our elderly and the vulnerable.  The money will come from tax.  I will condemn any Government, including the one I participated in, if I see it doing what is wrong.  This is wrong.  It is not a question of personalising it.  Senator Whelan is a friend whose commitment and bona fides I do not doubt.  I know he has worked night and day on this.  This is wrong.  If one person votes against, it may not amount to much, as Senator Kelly said, a single protest in Roscommon in the context of something that was done wrong.  However, if a group of Senators do this, there will not be hell to pay.  Nobody will lose the Whip.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This matter relates to the acute coronary syndrome programme and I have a map for the information of the House.  I spoke on Monday to a cardiologist in Letterkenny General Hospital and he asked me to raise the matter.  The programme was launched in April and looks to roll out facilities for coronary procedures.  With the publication of the programme, every county has been identified except for Donegal, and the cardiologist asked why the HSE would leave out one county from the programme.  For any health authority to initiate a programme for the country and leave out one county is beyond me.</P>
        <P>When the cardiologist asked for clarification, the answer he got from a member of the HSE was that Derry might be able to look after Donegal.  The health system in Derry will look after its own people, and if Donegal sought support from Derry, the county would rely on the Northern Ireland health service.  There is nothing wrong with that service but Donegal would lose control.  I know from personal experience that the county has its share of coronary incidents, although according to the cardiologist there are fewer heart attacks and more inter<Col N="1055"/>ventions if a problem is picked up at an earlier stage.  The facilities in Letterkenny are capable of stent insertions and angiograms but there is no support for angioplasty.  The expertise exists and funds are being raised with this in mind.</P>
        <P>The health service and professionals in Letterkenny are perplexed as to why Donegal is not involved in this programme.  It might be the usual case that Donegal is forgotten but this time it is identified as being forgotten on the map.  The cardiologist and cardiac unit in Letterkenny are well regarded in Donegal and are dealing with as many cases as the professionals in other areas of the country.  Nevertheless, if somebody needs a stent that person must go to Galway, Dublin or beyond.  The HSE has suggested that the Northern Ireland health service could look after coronary patients in Donegal.  I would not say it is a disgrace but it is a position that Donegal people should not be put into.  Coronary care has become one of the areas of medicine that is developing.  It has developed from bypass operations to stent insertion to early intervention for coronary issues.  We must extend the funding and recognition for the acute coronary syndrome programme, which was promoted earlier in the year to include Donegal.  Someone in the Health Service Executive has decided that Donegal does not exist when it comes to coronary care.  To be facetious, reading the document would give one a heart attack.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Departments of Health </TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising the matter on the Adjournment.  In June 2010, Changing Cardiovascular Health: Cardiovascular Health Policy 2010-2019, was launched.  This policy established a framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, which seeks to ensure an integrated and quality assured approach in their management, to reduce the burden of these conditions.  The policy proposes that cardiac and stroke services be reconfigured on a network basis at hospital and emergency care level.  Each network will provide specialist services by a blend of hospitals designated as local-general and regional-comprehensive centres.  An improved ambulance service will ensure that 80% of patients will be brought directly to the appropriate centre for initial treatment within the accepted critical timeframe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Central to the network concept is the principle that every hospital delivers a range of cardiovascular services either on site or in formal partnership with others.  Acute and national specialty services will be provided in a smaller number of comprehensive centres to ensure the high volume, 24-7 throughput that is required to support rapid, responsive and accessible quality care.  Non-acute and outpatient services are core aspects of cardiac care.  They will be provided at local and regional levels.  The HSE&rsquo;s national acute coronary syndrome programme was designed to rationalise and streamline treatment of all patients with varying forms of acute coronary syndrome, and to develop standardised pre-hospital protocols for response, triage, treatment and transport of patients with these syndromes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From the outset it was accepted that because of the geographical spread not all patients would receive identical treatment but that they would all be again treated according to a national protocol depending on symptoms and location.  It is recognised internationally that STEMIs, that is, ST elevation and myocardial infarction, or full blown heart attacks, are best treated in a primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PPCI, centre where the patient can be taken to a cardiac catheter laboratory and the blocked vessel opened.  A PPCI centre is a major cardiology centre that has as minimum two cardiac catheter laboratories &mdash; I am sure I am saying that wrong &mdash; at least five interventional cardiologists and 24-7 on-call staff, including medics, nursing, technical and radiography.  Given current resources these centres are being placed in Galway, Dublin and Cork.  Centres with existing cardiac catheter laboratories such as Limerick and Waterford should be able to deal with &ldquo;walk-in&rdquo; STEMIs and depending on staffing and expertise possibly deliver a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., five day week treatment for STEMIs.  Out of hours, the ambulance service, being trained to make an early diagnosis of STEMI, will <Col N="1056"/>transfer STEMI patients to a primary PCI centre that is on call 24-7.  The accepted maximum transfer time of a STEMI patient to a PPCI centre is 90 minutes.  If the ambulance service cannot deliver within this time then the patient should receive either out-of-hospital thrombolysis, clot-breaking drugs, or be taken to the nearest emergency department where this treatment can be administered.  Following that, the patient should then be transported to a PPCI centre.  It is accepted that the majority of the patients in the north west are outside the 90 minute transfer time to a PPCI centre in either Galway or Dublin.  The small number of patients presenting there with STEMIs therefore should have thrombolysis and following that be transferred for intervention in a PPCI centre.  The national protocol will ensure that this occurs in a timely and efficient manner.  The most important development in this area in the north west would be the opening of a fixed cardiac catheter laboratory in either Sligo or Letterkenny which would allow diagnostic angiography of patients with stable angina or angiography in non-STEMI and unstable patients to be carried out.  This would greatly reduce the burden on the ambulance service in transferring these patients out of the area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Furthermore, with the development of on-site interventional cardiology expertise, it would be possible to provide on-site treatment of non-STEMI patients and walk-in STEMI patients to be dealt with on a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., five days per week basis.  The acute coronary syndrome programme and the HSE are reviewing innovative proposals in this area and, again, the development of a fixed cardiac catheter laboratory in the north west would greatly improve diagnosis and appropriate management of patients with coronary artery disease in the area.  As in the case of all emergency or urgent care, speedy access to appropriate services is key to successful implementation of the cardiovascular health policy.  The HSE is already working to develop further the provision of rapid, effective pre-hospital emergency ambulance services, including trained paramedics; emergency medical technicians &mdash; advanced, or EMTAs, who can treat patients immediately at the site of an incident.  This includes giving thrombolysis clot-busting drugs to patients who have suffered a heart attack.  Possible co-operation between cardiology facilities in Northern Ireland and the north west are being explored, which simply makes the point the Senator made in the first place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State touched on the problem.  The solution is a fixed cardiac catheter laboratory, or cath lab.  According to the experts in Letterkenny, they have the funding.  They fund-raised for the laboratory and they can get the equipment.  What they need is the go-ahead from the HSE.  They have the expertise and they have two cardiologists who can carry out the stenting procedures.  A mobile angiograph unit comes every Thursday to Letterkenny to do that job but the insertion of stents must be carried out in either Galway or Dublin which involves an ambulance service and post-op and pre-op facilities, as I experienced myself.  I ask the Minister to try to get the cath lab set up in Letterkenny.  It will not cost the HSE any money because the funding has been raised by charities for the unit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The type of co-operation between fund-raising which is the voluntary element of it and the HSE is something we will have to take into account.  I agree with all the arguments the Senator made in his initial contribution.  I will most definitely take them to the Minister for Health when I speak to him tomorrow.  We need to work together to ensure that the service, which can be a life-saver, will be provided.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to lay out the Government&rsquo;s position on investment in employment and enterprise in the Gaeltacht through &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>I understand the challenges and obstacles facing &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in this difficult economic climate.  Undoubtedly, the national and world economic crisis is creating difficulties for companies in the Gaeltacht and this, in turn, is having a negative impact on employment in the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has a capital budget of around &euro;13 million this year to help create and sustain employment in the Gaeltacht. That capital budget comprises &euro;6 million from the Exchequer and &euro;7 million from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta&rsquo;s own resources.  It is worth noting that the last Government reduced &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta&rsquo;s capital allocation from the Exchequer from &euro;27 million in 2006 to &euro;18 million in 2010 and imposed another, even more significant, reduction to &euro;6 million in 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Decisions regarding funding for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta from the Exchequer in 2012 and thereafter will be made on foot of the decisions arising from the comprehensive review of expenditure being undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the <Col N="1058"/>context of the Estimates process.  It is important to recognise the work being carried out by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s in creating and sustaining employment in the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2010, more than 7,000 people were employed full time in client companies of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s.  While that is a reduction on previous years, the creation of 704 new jobs in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s client companies in 2010 is a sign of hope for the future.  Employment figures from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta show its client companies which are involved in the export market performed well, which is consistent with the national trend.  In addition to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta&rsquo;s own support programmes, aspects of the jobs initiative announced by the Government this year will also benefit the activities of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
        <P>The results of various studies show the positive impact &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has on economic, social and cultural outputs in the Gaeltacht.  For example, the annual business survey of economic impact carried out by Forf&aacute;s in 2010 showed that sales from client companies of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta were worth around &euro;750 million and that &euro;354 million of those sales were associated with the export market.  The survey also demonstrated that 41% of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta&rsquo;s client companies are involved in research and development activities.  Other studies carried out by Indecon for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in 2010 support these results.  For example, the productivity of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta&rsquo;s client companies is worth around &euro;1.5 billion to the Gaeltacht when direct and indirect outputs are taken into account.  These client companies support more than 7,000 full-time jobs in the Gaeltacht and that figure rises to 14,000 when indirect outputs are taken into consideration.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta client companies contribute more than &euro;312 million to Ireland&rsquo;s gross domestic product and &euro;42 million is provided to the Exchequer in direct tax payments by client companies of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  A joint investment programme between &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the Arts Council has created 475 jobs in the arts sector in the Gaeltacht, generating added value of about &euro;25 million for the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>As stated in the programme for Government, the Government is committed to supporting the 20-year strategy for the Irish language and to implementing the achievable goals contained therein.  I am delighted the Cabinet committee on the Irish language and the Gaeltacht has been re-established by the Government under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach.  Following discussions by the Cabinet committee, the Government made the following specific policy decisions on 31 May 2011 with regard to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will be responsible for the implementation of the strategy in the Gaeltacht and the <i>status quo</i> shall remain with regard to the current functions of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in general, including its enterprise functions.  This will be subject to statutory provision being made to enable the Minister of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to direct &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to focus its limited resources towards particular enterprise sectors and subject to the development of a mechanism to enable &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to co-operate with other enterprise agencies, particularly in the case of significant Gaeltacht projects with high potential.</P>
        <P>These Government decisions will be given statutory effect, as appropriate, under the Gaeltacht Bill.  The draft heads of the Gaeltacht Bill have been drafted by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and are due to be presented to Government shortly.  The Bill is expected to be published in 2012, in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme.</P>
        <P>It is also worth noting that a high-level working group dealing with enterprise investment in the Gaeltacht has been established between the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. This high-level working group of senior officials is working on developing a mechanism to enable &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na <Col N="1059"/>Gaeltachta to co-operate with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA with regard to significant Gaeltacht projects with high potential.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The policy decisions made by the Government in the case of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta clearly indicate that the Government is committed to the development of the Gaeltacht and to attracting enterprise investment in order to create and sustain employment in the Gaeltacht.  It is also clear that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will continue to play a central role in the development of the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>Despite the current economic crisis, the Government will undoubtedly make every effort to ensure adequate provision by the Exchequer for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in the future to enable it to carry out its functions effectively with regard to the development of the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Again, I thank the Senator.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The question I asked was does the Minister intend getting extra money to invest in employment in the Gaeltacht.  I extrapolate from the very wordy answer given by the Minister of State that the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The &Uacute;dar&aacute;s budget for last year was &euro;6 million and the budget for this year is &euro;6 million.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where did the magic &euro;7 million from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta&rsquo;s own funds come from?  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s has been saying it has not had the money.  I question the figure quoted by the Minister of State.  I also question the sincerity of her answer.  Every other decision being made by the Government would contradict what the Minister of State has said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The facts are within the answer.  When &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta seeks Government funding, whether from this, the previous or the next Government, it must produce accounts.  We must accept that the facts are as presented in the answer.</P>
        <P>The innovation of having &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the IDA and all other enterprise agencies working together must have a benefit.  At a time when we do not have any additional money, that sort of co-operation is important.  There is substantial investment and substantial assets within the Gaeltacht which support many people who, in turn, support families.  Making that continue and expand is what the Government needs to be about.  We do not have additional money but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I wish to share a minute of my time with Senator Mulcahy.  Given that Senator Leyden was so exercised on this topic this morning on the Order of Business, I would have given him a minute also.  However, regrettably he is not here to hear the Minister of State.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister of State knows, People with Disabilities in Ireland, PwDI, is the body that nominated me to contest the Seanad elections and I was very happy to receive that nomination.  I understand funding has been completely withdrawn from the PwDI <Col N="1060"/>organisation.  This organisation came into being as a result of the recommendations of the commission for the status of people with disabilities and provided a consultancy role and engaged in projects.  I have three key questions for the Minister of State, who is doing a good job in terms of disability and has grasped the nettle, something that did not happen until now.</P>
        <P>Why was the funding withdrawn given that this was a national organisation with networks in practically every county?  I suspect I know the reason for it, but I would like to hear the details.  More importantly, did the Minister of State consider amalgamating PwDI with another organisation?  There is a proliferation of organisations within the disability industry, but perhaps there was a role for PwDI to engage with other organisations on an amalgamated basis to provide a one-stop shop for advocacy for people with disabilities.  Had that been considered, the cost base might have been significantly reduced.  Will the Minister of State explain the thinking in that regard?</P>
        <P>What structures does the Minister of State now propose to put in place to ensure that the end-user has a representational voice where it matters, within Government?  It was a key recommendation of the commission for the status of people with disabilities that there would be a forum where the end-user&rsquo;s voice would be heard.  I have no doubt the Minister of State has some ideas in this regard and we will work with her on those.  I would like to hear those ideas here.  Something has been removed and it must be replaced.  My colleague has expertise in this area and I will give way to him now to make his points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  I support the sentiments expressed by my colleague.  We have many members of the PwDI organisation in Clare and in my town of Shannon and my primary concern is for them and that they should be communicated with on the issue of other consultative groups through which they can now feed their opinions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A few months back, the Minister of State was in the House taking part in a discussion on a value for money report on disability organisations.  I presume this is part of that audit.  When will she be able to provide us with a report on the full audit of the organisations?  I would welcome that in the House, as would those of us who have a major role in the disability sector.  It is important that wherever funding is withdrawn from organisations, the income and expenditure accounts of those organisations are placed on the record so that people can form an opinion as to why the organisations in question had to be examined and the issues dealt with.  People might find then that many of the administration and management costs of these organisations are, to make an understatement, a bit on the excessive side.</P>
        <P>In this case, I am concerned for the members of the PwDI and suggest that information should be provided to them as to how they can now make their input.  I would like to have some information in this regard for the locality in Clare where there are proactive members.  They have obviously been taken aback by the removal of the structure they had.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I acknowledge the incredible network of people around the country that has been involved with PwDI.  These people were very anxious to be part of a voluntary movement that gave a voice to people with disabilities.  It is important when a decision like this is taken that the facts are given.  That is why I am here tonight.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senators for giving me this opportunity to explain the reasons it is necessary to cease funding to PwDI from 2012 and to elaborate on the alternative proposals that have been introduced that will ensure the voice and perspective of people with disabilities will continue to be heard in a more focused and cost effective way.  People with Disabilities in Ireland Lim<Col N="1061"/>ited, PwDl, was set up in 2000.  It is the successor organisation to the Irish Council of People with Disabilities and the Department of Justice and Equality is its sole funding source.  It has a staff of eight in its headquarters in Dublin, two of whom are seconded from the Department of Justice and Equality.  Staff under the CEO range from CO to HEO level.  There are 21 regional networks around the country, with one in most counties, except for Kilkenny, Dublin, Longford, and Wicklow.  The Cavan network started up very recently.  The regional networks are made up from volunteers and have at least ten members in each. They are funded from PwDI headquarters on projects they complete for people with disabilities</P>
        <P>There are a number of NGOs in the disability sector.  However, due to initiatives since 2000, in particular, the new disability advocacy service being funded by the Department of Social Protection since January 2011, there is a huge overlap with the advocacy service provided by PwDI.  The overheads to run this organisation were using up the majority of the allocation.  The headquarters had administration costs relating to rental, light, heat and salaries, including board expenses.  The networks have their own administration costs too, including travel and subsistence.  I gave my approval in late September 2011 for officials in the Department to carry out a review of expenditure relating to PwDI to ascertain whether people with disabilities were getting value for money from the PwDI allocation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The first thing that is striking is that the organisation has been unable to spend its allocation in recent years.  In 2010 PwDI was allocated a budget of &euro;1,465,000.  The total request for drawdown of that fund was only &euro;895,290.  This is only 61% of the allocation.  In 2011 the allocation was cut by 39% to &euro;900,000 and towards the end of September 2011, the total drawdown of that fund is only &euro;577,104 or 64%.  It is unlikely that the organisation would have been able to spend the remaining &euro;332,896 or 36% by the end of the year.  The review showed that in 2010, headquarters allocated 28% of the budget to the networks, leaving &euro;650,436 or 72% to be spent on headquarters.  It is very striking how this &euro;650,436 was spent.  The bulk of the money, &euro;540,906 or 83% was spent on overheads.  A further &euro;51,106 or 8% was spent on travel and subsistence, including board expenses.  This left only &euro;58,424 or 9% to be spent on projects for people with disabilities.  When we compare 2011 with 2010, we can see that the percentages being spent on travel and subsistence, 9%, and overheads, 89%, are up on last year.  The figure for overheads could have been much worse only for the fact that they were reduced by 10% due to the CEO getting rent abatement in 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is really striking is the percentage spent directly on projects for people with disabilities, which is 2% or &euro;5,952.  This means that 98% of all the money spent by headquarters was spent on overheads and travel and subsistence, including board fees.</P>
        
        <P>Looking at the total amount spent by the networks directly on projects for people with disabilities, in 2010 the figure was &euro;81,523 against its total allocation of &euro;231,761.  The percentage spent directly on projects for people with disabilities was just 35%.  In the same period, the total amount spent on travel and subsistence by the networks was &euro;66,718, or 29% of the total spend.  The total amount spent on overheads was &euro;83,519, or 36% of the total spend.  This means that for every &euro;100 of Exchequer funding spent in 2010, the networks spent &euro;65 on overheads and travel and subsistence.</P>
        <P>The trend in 2011 shows a slight improvement on that in 2010.  This is down to a rigorous implementation of governance procedures by the Department and the headquarters of People with Disabilities Ireland and a small reduction in overheads due to the implementation this year of some of the recommendations made in previous value for money reports.  However, the percentage of the total spend on projects for people with disabilities is still only 43%, with 57% going on overheads and travel and subsistence.  It is unlikely that People with Disabilities <Col N="1062"/>Ireland will spend all of its allocation this year since it had only spent 64% of its allocation to the end of September.  This means that for every &euro;100 of Exchequer funding spent in 2011, the networks spent &euro;57 on overheads, travel and subsistence.</P>
        <P>Looking at the figures for 2010 and comparing them with those in for 2011, the following statistics come to light.  Some networks have not spent any of their allocations in either year.  One could assume that these networks are not active in reality.  Five networks, although they have spent nothing on projects in 2011, have spent all of their allocations on either overheads or travel and subsistence or both.  There are only five networks which have spent more on projects in 2011 than on overheads and travel and subsistence combined.  Some 14 networks have spent the greater part of their allocations on items other than projects.  Two networks have spent 100% of their allocations on travel and subsistence, while one has spent its entire allocation on overheads.  Only two networks have spent more than 80% on projects.</P>
        <P>To complete the review, People with Disabilities Ireland was asked for a document showing how it would spend its budget for next year, assuming it was allocated the same amount as in 2011, that is, &euro;900,000.  The conclusion that can be drawn from this document is that it is almost impossible for the organisation to reduce its overheads by any further significant amount.  I know that the chief executive officer was instrumental in achieving cost reductions in as many areas as possible in the past two years, including on premises, insurance, audit accountancy, legal, etc., but one reaches a point where further reductions cannot be achieved.</P>
        <P>Working on the basis that People with Disabilities Ireland would spend all of its allocation in 2012, which given its history is unlikely, it proposed in its submission to give the networks &euro;302,000, or 33% of the total spend.  This means that headquarters plans to spend 67% on overheads, including on premises, staff wages and travel and subsistence.  We know from the 2010 full year statistics that the networks spend approximately 35% of their allocations on projects for people with disabilities.  This would amount to a figure of approximately &euro;105,700.  Therefore, one can conclude that People with Disabilities Ireland proposes that for every &euro;100 spent by the networks in 2012, only &euro;35 will go on projects for people with disabilities and the percentage is going down.</P>
        <P>Taking into consideration the overheads of headquarters, the proposed percentage figure for spending on projects by People with Disabilities Ireland as an organisation in 2012 is 11.7%.  This means that People with Disabilities Ireland proposes that for every &euro;100 of Exchequer funding spent in 2012, only &euro;11 will be spent on projects for people with disabilities.  This figure is slightly down from actual spend for the full year in 2010 when &euro;15 out of every &euro;100 was spent on projects for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>It can be seen that the money being spent directly on projects for people with disabilities has been decreasing steadily in recent years.  When the total allocation over the three years is taken into consideration against the money spent in 2010-11 or proposed to be spent in 2012, the percentage spend on projects for people with disabilities averages at around 9% to 10%.</P>
        <P>Since the Department of Justice and Equality is the sole funder of People with Disabilities Ireland, it is expected that it will have to cease operations in 2012.  There will be redundancy implications for six of the staff working in head office.  From the analysis given, it is obvious that this waste of Exchequer funds cannot be allowed to continue.  It has been decided that funding to People with Disabilities Ireland must cease at the end of 2011.  I thank the members of People with Disabilities Ireland and the staff for their efforts during the years, but in common with all aspects of Government spending, everything must be examined with a view to preserving in so far as possible front-line services.</P><Col N="1063"/>
        <P>It is my wish to ensure people with disabilities benefit directly from any moneys allocated to the sector.  With this in mind, I am overseeing the finalisation of a major value for money and policy review of disability services in the Department of Health to ensure existing funds allocated for people with disabilities is spent to best effect.</P>
        <P>I am also interested in hearing what people with disabilities have to say on issues affecting them.  I have just set up and I am personally chairing a new national disability strategy implementation group to develop and progress the strategy.  We had our first meeting today and it was most interesting.  For the first time ever, people with disabilities told us what they wanted and how they wished their lives to progress.  The new group will include representatives from a number of disability stakeholder organisations and also a number of people with disabilities who will be able to bring their lived experience directly to bear on this very important work.  This will ensure the voice and perspective of people with disabilities will continue to be heard in a more focused and cost effective way.</P>
        <P>The new disability advocacy service, being funded by the Department of Social Protection since January, provides trained advocates who bring about positive change for people with disabilities in supporting them to access social welfare, housing and improved living conditions.  They help people to reintegrate into the community on leaving a residential institution and link them with local support services.  They also have a policy remit in that they have a policy formulation function in this area.</P>
        <P>The Government must ensure that in 2012 and continuing thereafter funding will be allocated for the maximum provision of services for people with disabilities, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.  No Minister likes to withdraw funding entirely from any organisation, but it is incumbent on us all to ensure that where we spend substantial sums of money, people with disabilities benefit directly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her very comprehensive reply which included detailed facts and figures.  It is very difficult to argue with facts and figures. The reason I tabled this matter for discussion on the Adjournment was to elicit them.  The &euro;900,000 should remain within the disability sector, but obviously it should be spent properly to ensure the end-user benefits.  There are probably another 100 organisations which could, to say the least, do with a value for money review.  What are the Minister of State&rsquo;s plans for the money?  Will it be returned to the public purse or will it be redirected towards another organisation or organisations to help end-users?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Public moneys are not in the gift of anyone who has been elected.  The money has been given back to the Department of Justice and Equality, but I am in discussions with it about putting in place a framework to allow people with disabilities, locally, regionally and nationally, to have their voices heard.  I am not certain how we will do this, but we have one or two proposals to consider.  Genio, the organisation to which I keep referring, has proposed putting in place a mechanism to allow people&rsquo;s voices to be heard locally and regionally before being transmitted into the national arena.  According to Genio, this specific operation can be done for only a little money.  For People with Disabilities Ireland it is not just a question of listening to the end user or the person with a disability.  Rather, small projects in an area are meant to enhance the lives of people with a disability, for example, information campaigns, campaigns to remove the stigma of disability, sports, ramps, etc.  This requirement is best served by local authorities.  The city and county managers sit on the new national disability strategy group and will play a pivotal role.</P><Col N="1064"/>
        <P>Hearing the voice of people with a disability will require a different type of vehicle.  We must examine the aspects of the current model, be it partnerships, local authorities&rsquo; disability officers or so forth.  We are involved in a process of determining how to engage that voice, as it can be done more effectively.</P>
