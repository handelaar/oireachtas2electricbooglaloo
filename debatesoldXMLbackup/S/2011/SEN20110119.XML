	<P>I have received notice from Senator Jim Walsh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a statement on the recent murder of many Christians in Nigeria, Pakistan, Iraq and Egypt and, in particular, to support proposals made by Italy on the need for the European Union to articulate its strong views on these matters, including cutting off European Union aid to countries which fail to protect their Christian minorities.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on her plans to address growing mental health issues.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to clarify the policy decision to withdraw the PSO on the Derry to Dublin route.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give approval to Donegal County Council to seek tenders for the Dungloe and Glenties sewerage scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Walsh, Buttimer and Keaveney and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Climate Change Response Bill 2010 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed), to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and adjourn at 1.30 p.m., if not previously concluded, on which spokespersons may speak for 15 minutes and all other Senators for ten minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the <Col N="174"/>House; No. 2, Road Traffic Bill 2011 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second and Subsequent Stages, to be taken at 2.30 p.m., on Second Stage of which spokespersons may speak for ten minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time, by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon at the conclusion of Second Stage for closing comments; and No. 33, Private Members&rsquo; motion No. 18 re Government initiatives to support export-led growth.  The business of the House shall be interrupted between 1.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Now that the farce we have seen in the past week is over, it is time to get back to business.  The Minister for Finance is considered by many to be an eloquent speaker.  However, instead of sounding silver-tongued in the past 24 hours, to many Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers, he seems to speak with a fork tongue.  Rather than play silly buggers with Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers the Minister must continue to come to the House and let us know what is going on in our economy.  We are now in a very serious crisis but it seems this Government has forgotten where its priorities should lie.</P>
        <P>Is it possible to invite the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to the House?  In six weeks&rsquo; time there will be no inpatient mental health services in County Wexford.  The Minister promised alternative day hospitals and community psychiatric teams for the county but none has been delivered in the way she promised last September.  In spite of all the concerns raised about the those services mental health services are not being upgraded throughout the country in the way expected, as promised by this Government.  I ask that the Minister for Health and Children be invited to the House to explain why she has failed so completely in her commitments and promises to the most vulnerable people in our society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Regarding mental health, in response to a private Members&rsquo; debate yesterday on the part of the main Opposition party the Minister made a statement in the D&aacute;il to the effect that VHI could save 10% of its costs.  This is the most significant statement in some time concerning savings that could be made for people.  The increases in VHI costs, to which we referred last week, need to be addressed.  If the Minister knows of ways in which there might be a reduction of 10% it would be greatly useful and practical to have a debate in the House on the subject.  I do not refer to the kind of debate in which the House would have a go at the Minister but to one in which the Minister would have an opportunity to outline the ways in which such a reduction could be implemented, to which Senators could respond and develop.  It is very important and relevant because from next month people will receive increased bills from VHI.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding the meeting today between the leaders of both parties in government might the House be given a precise outline of the legislation which both parties intend to have passed?  This is crucial.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That was given last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I see Senator Boyle smiling.  I ask this in all seriousness.  The efficient way to do business is to conclude matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Seanad knows my views on that matter.  Rather than hearing how long the legislative programme will be and what will be added to it let us hear everything on the list today.  For example, will the political relationship with the Green Party survive?  We have not heard the Fianna F&aacute;il position.  Apart from economic and financial Bills are there <Col N="175"/>other matters about which we do not know?  We need to know the cut-off point in terms of legislation so we may know where we are going.  We can work the timing out for ourselves and rush or slow down matters as we wish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That information was given last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure the Leader&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coghlan was given that information last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will comment further on that later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure the Leader that wherever two Senators are there also am I.  The fact that I was not present does not mean I did not follow the information provided.  If it had been clear last week there would not be a meeting this morning in order to sort out certain points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to know exactly what will be discussed.  The other side of the House is very defensive.  I do not say this in a critical manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris should not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the Leader has referred repeatedly to the actions of a Member&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a point of order and perfectly legitimate.  I ask the Cathaoirleach to rebuke the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not a point of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach usually does so.  This is extremely important.  It is a matter of the Standing Orders of this House which the Cathaoirleach should implement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole is putting a question to the Leader who will reply to it.  He has interjected to say that he outlined the matter last week.  I did not see anything wrong in that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about more than that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Leader knew more last week than the Taoiseach or the other party leader that would be an important point for this House to be aware of.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We would still have no hope.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>What we need to know is whether the Leader told the Taoiseach and the leader of the Green Party what we are all going to be doing for the next two months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the previous speakers.  Following the farce of the past few days and the result last night of the internal vote within the Fianna F&aacute;il Party it is essential we know the date of the general election and the legislative programme the Government intends to see carried out within its remaining term of office.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole noted, leaving us in <Col N="176"/>the dark about this and not providing clarity is not only an inefficient way to do business but is undemocratic.  To leave people in this uncertain position is to treat them with contempt.  We do not know whether the Government will continue for three, four, six or eight weeks &mdash; there are now references to April and May.  We need to know this.  Members are hearing this point across the doorsteps when we canvas, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and throughout the city and the country.  We are hearing from the people of their desire for stability and certainty and, above all else, their desire to get this Government out.  Therefore, I call on the Leader to give the House an indication of when the election is likely to happen and what is the legislative programme for the remainder of the term.  We know there is a meeting taking place between the coalition partners so if he cannot give us that indication today can he at least tell the House when he will be able to provide it?  Might he be able to tell us tomorrow, after the result of today&rsquo;s discussion?  We saw the Leader last night on television, standing directly behind the Government Chief Whip on the plinth, in a position of great prominence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not too worried who was standing behind whom on television.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I saw that too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am simply making the point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Questions to the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>There were many Offaly people there too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;given the Leader&rsquo;s influence, I would expect him to be in a position to tell the House, at least tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Give him a chance and he will reply in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be grateful if there were a specific reply because it is undemocratic to leave us in this state of uncertainty.  It is also very bad for the economy.  International investors are slow to invest in Irish business at this point without knowing when this Government is likely to go to the people or when the next government is likely to take office.  We need certainty.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader also clarify a matter I raised last week, namely, why the Bill to prohibit female genital mutilation is not contained for publication in the legislative programme?  I understand it is imminently ready for publication and should be published this week.  As the Leader is aware, that date is some months after the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, had promised publication.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Leader for a debate in the House and for the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to say what she intends to do about the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of A, B and C in December.  It is essential that legislation be passed to give effect to that decision.  I want to hear from the Minister about this.  We need a debate with her as to what she intends to do as thousands of women travel abroad for medical terminations they should be able to obtain in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree there is a need for greater certainty but the setting of an election date remains the constitutional prerogative of the Taoiseach.  Regarding the business of this House and, by extension, the other House, the Green Party does not believe an election should be held later than during March.  We do not see an election happening in April, May or June.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="177"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for that information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>We believe the business of both Houses should be ordered accordingly and that the last business of this Oireachtas should be the passing in this House of the Finance Bill.  Our hope is that a more detailed legislative programme can be agreed in the interim.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader may have meant well last week when he responded to my question on the remainder of the legislative programme but clearly his response was not comprehensive because it did not list, for example, the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I note Second Stage of that Bill is to be heard in the other House tomorrow.  We will not call that an error.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a big plus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  However, as other speakers noted a meeting is taking place today between the Taoiseach and the leader of the Green Party.  The Leader should give the House a proper comprehensive update tomorrow because last week he did not have the right information regarding legislative priorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Twomey mentioned the need for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to come to the House and update Members as to how we might surmount the cost to the economy of the interest rate set by the EU-IMF&rsquo;s so-called bailout by achieving a reduction in that rate, if possible.  It appears that little or no progress was made on this matter at the recent meeting the Minister attended in Brussels.  Perhaps the Leader might arrange a very early debate on that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all aware of the significant developments that have taken place in information technology.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on information technology with a specific focus on the significant benefits that certain IT mechanisms can give the commuter.  We have seen some of these benefits on Luas and DART services, with information provided that is very important.  If a commuter has information on the running of Luas and DART services, especially timing and arrival of vehicles, it would be a very important step.</P>
        <P>Included in such a debate should be an issue that has been on the schedule for a considerable period, the roll-out of real-time information for Dublin Bus commuters.  Enormous benefit arises from the automatic vehicle identification location units which were meant to have been rolled out some time ago.  There is also great benefit for the car commuter arising from traffic messages on displays and information panels.  There is also a gamut of other associated matters related to information technology, such as integrated and single ticketing and so forth.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on these developments as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Leader about the following topic on a couple of occasions.  May we have a debate on domestic violence and could briefing documentation be circulated on the procedures and supports currently in place that are associated with domestic violence?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday I sent my best wishes to Senator Ross and it would be very discourteous of me not to send my very best wishes to Senator Bacik, a colleague on the university panel, and to Senator Alex White.  I wish them well in the upcoming election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the rest of us?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would wish the Senator well but I do not believe he has declared for the election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I have declared.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="178"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Then I send my beneficence to all the Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be questions to the Leader.  We are not into good wishes to anyone standing for election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Leader agree that we are very honoured that the Irish chief of the human rights agency in Gaza, UNRWA, Mr. John Ging, has taken up a very important post with the United Nations in the US?  This man has done us an extraordinary honour in his courageous and dignified work in a very difficult position in Gaza.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Speaking about courage and dignity, I have watched with great interest the leadership contest that has gone on.  It would be no harm for us to have a debate on civility in politics as this was an example of the way the process should play out.  I am not commenting on the personalities but the process was done with considerable dignity, with a discussion of the leadership while dealing with issues and treating the respective parties with courtesy.  I speak as someone who remembers very clearly the Haughey heaves when the atmosphere was extremely different.  A number of the people from Fianna F&aacute;il who spoke during this period kept indicating that this is a new kind politics and they were trying to deal with reality.  I hope and believe they were, and I would like to believe this would be extended throughout the body politic. It is very important that whatever our differences of view, we should treat each other with respect.  Only if politicians treat each other with respect and conduct campaigns in a dignified way will we regain the respect of the public which, unfortunately, we have lost.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Human rights and the United Nations are very strange bedfellows.  I hope anyone joining the organisation will chart a genuine human rights formula for the UN.  Any organisation like the UN that speaks with duplicity and out of one side of its mouth purporting to promote human rights while from the other side seeking the killing of the unborn definitely brings its credibility into question and disrepute.</P>
        <P>Is the Leader prepared to indicate when Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s Bill will be restored to the Order Paper?  It is an excellent Bill and it is essential it is passed without further delay.  Many people in my constituency have been caught badly by main contractors going into liquidation or receivership and, as a consequence, their business, livelihood and employees have been left high and dry.  I commend Senator Quinn on this essential legislation which should be passed without further delay.</P>
        <P>I have raised previously the issue of legal fees in tribunals.  I am sure other Members will join me in my dismay at reading the amount of money that the Curtin case has cost.  There is a report of &euro;1.9 million having been spent, with the case about to be adjudicated upon, but I am told a further &euro;2 million has already been paid on the case.  It is shameful that someone can contest a position and ultimately resign, leaving the taxpayer to pick up the bill while the person picks up a pension.  That is the kind of abuse of privilege we should not allow.</P>
        <P>I urge Members and people working in the public service to be very slow to take cases to the High Court or Supreme Court which are run at the expense of taxpayers and which may not be well founded.  Legal people will give advice on cases and often it is in their interest rather than ours.  I put that note of caution, particularly for the day that is in it.</P>

	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers now know what it is like to be misled by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, as he did on the leadership of Fianna F&aacute;il.  They should not be surprised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>That is what I want to hear.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>They should hardly be surprised because the Minister misled his own Cabinet colleagues on the EU-IMF bailout and had them making a fool of themselves on national television, denying there was any talk of a bailout.  I am thinking of the Ministers, Deputies Dermot Ahern and Noel Dempsey, in particular.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be a question to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has misled the whole country on the economy since taking office over two years ago.  He has misled us on turning the corner, bank bonuses, subordinated debt holders and on the EU-IMF bailout.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is irrelevant.  The Senator is making a political speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should make a statement on the following matter.  There were reports last week that the ECB had urged the Government to take emergency measures and bring forward the budget for 2011.  A member of the bank stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Markets waited and waited and since they saw no policy reactions they started to lose confidence in the course of the summer.  There was a downgrade in August but there was no policy reaction, no announcement that a tough budget was in preparation and no announcement of the measures.  The loss of confidence also affected the banking system and this created a spiral which led to the crisis and in the end, a request for financial assistance.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Portugal has been able to avoid the EU-IMF bailout but Ireland did not because the Minister did not act as he was urged to by the ECB.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is made.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader for an update on the request I made last week and again this week, a request that was also made by my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, for the Minister for Finance to come to the House to answer questions on the Quinn Insurance group with headquarters in Cavan.  The group also has employees in Navan, Blanchardstown and Enniskillen.  As I outlined yesterday, I attended a meeting last Friday evening organised by Cavan Chamber of Commerce.  It was a very interesting and well attended meeting and there <Col N="180"/>it became quite clear that for nine months Anglo Irish Bank and representatives of the Quinn family have been engaged in consultations.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>A proposal submitted to the administrators on 10 December has not been considered.  It would result in Quinn Insurance remaining in Irish ownership, its 1,200 employees remaining in employment and the wider Quinn Group remaining profitable and sustaining 5,500 jobs, many thousands of which are in County Cavan, where I live, and neighbouring counties.  It would also result in the State regaining the &euro;2.8 billion it is owed by the Quinn family.  Having been worked on for nine months with representatives of the Quinn family and Anglo Irish Bank, why is this proposal not being considered?  Who is preventing it from being considered?  I urgently request that the Leader call the Minister for Finance to the House in order that we can obtain answers to these questions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Like me, Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in will be aware of the closure in recent weeks of two iconic businesses, Zhivago music and the Cellar Bar, which have traded in the heart of Galway city for more than 40 years.  These companies benefited from some of the greatest footfall available to businesses in this country.  They were not fledgling businesses with inexperienced owners at the helm.  On the contrary, they were operated by astute, experienced and hard working people.  However, they were wholly dependent on discretionary spending.  As was evident a couple of weeks ago in the case of Celtic Bookmakers, discretionary spending has virtually ceased because people are paralysed by fear and hopelessness.  For the past ten days, while businesses have continued to go to the wall, we have endured the unedifying sideshow of a battle to determine who gets to stand on the bridge of the <i>Titanic</i> as it slowly sinks without trace.  The owners of such businesses and their employees must feel betrayed by the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am about to ask several questions which I hope the Leader will take seriously.  Does he see what is happening in the business world?  Does he agree that a change of Government is required if any type of business recovery is to commence?  I am heartened by the commitment given by Senator Boyle that the election will take place in March.  It is a commitment to which I will hold him.</P>
        <P>Several weeks ago, in a radio interview, Mr. Peter Bacon predicted that the growth rate this year would be 0% and that the country would experience significant job losses.  That prediction appears ambitious.  For the sake of citizens and businesses, let us have an election soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator Cannon on one point, namely, that Zhivago music and the Cellar Bar in Galway city are iconic businesses.  Galway is not an exception as small business across Ireland are under major pressure.  It is very sad to see iconic businesses close down, especially those which have been in operation for many years.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on administrative reform which, unlike political reform, is an issue the House does not frequently discuss.  I note that a previous speaker called for a debate on information technology, an area in which Ireland has some of the best professionals in the world.  I come from an IT background and I am aware that many Irish companies produce world class software for foreign governments.  The systems in place here, however, are not up to the same standards, as much of the software produced in this country is for other governments.  Form filling and endlessly providing the same information for various bodies create a significant overhead for businesses.  A streamlined approach is required.  It is preposterous to hear that <Col N="181"/>taxing child benefit is not possible because systems are not compatible or computers cannot talk to each other.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>We must upgrade our administrative systems.  In doing so we would provide jobs and make life easier for small and large businesses and the system of government.</P>
        <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the need to be clear about what will be our programme until the end of this Seanad.  We need to be as efficient as possible and achieve the maximum amount by the time the Seanad finishes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Leader, in the light of Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s remarks and specifically the statement made by the Minister for Health and Children in the other House yesterday that her advisers had produced a report showing VHI could secure savings in the payments it made to hospitals, to invite the Minister to come before the House to discuss a motion calling on VHI to postpone its proposed increases in premiums.  It is appalling and wrong that ordinary people will face increases of 45% in their VHI premiums in six weeks.  Until yesterday, the Minister had been strangely quiet on the issue of the proposed increases.  The House should debate the matter and ensure action is taken.  For this reason, I call on the Leader to bring the Minister before the House to discuss the report produced by her advisers and seek a postponement of the proposed increases in VHI premiums.  He should accept the amendment and avoid a division on the issue.</P>
        <P>Last night we saw how close the Leader was to the Taoiseach.  I call on him to ensure we are given a date for the general election.  This morning Senator Boyle indicated he wanted the election to be held at the end of March.  On the other hand, his Green Party colleague, Deputy Gogarty, tweeted that he wanted it to be held on 11 March.  Let us leave politics to one side.  The people are punch drunk as a result of cuts, low morale and a lack of leadership and communication by the Government.  They want a change in direction.  Does the Leader agree such a change will only be achieved through a general election and the formation of a new Government to lead the country and its citizens towards recovery?  It is time we had a plan for recovery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Every so often we hear a positive tone in our debate.  No one suggests the country is not experiencing the difficulties that have been alluded to and for many these problems are devastating.  One only needs to consider the large number who are unemployed. I presume many Members receive queries from people who want to participate in training schemes, community work and so forth.  Recently there has been a new focus on these matters as a result of Departments assuming responsibility for aspects of the work previously done by F&Aacute;S.  There is also a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is available in this regard.  Some very good schemes are available, including programmes directed at different age groups and people with different specialities, experience and requirements.  It would be helpful, therefore, if the Leader were to invite the Minister for Social Protection to come before the House to discuss these schemes.  Many of the potential sponsors of individuals participating in schemes are not aware of the guidelines for the schemes in question.  During the years communities have come to depend on community employment schemes and many wish to participate in the excellent social schemes and programmes available.  Most schemes have waiting lists and participants are required to leave after a number of years.  Such limitations do not apply to the community social programmes which offer full-time positions.  Many do not appear to be aware of these schemes.  It would be helpful, therefore, if Senators had an opportunity to <Col N="182"/>discuss them with the Minister for several hours.  I hope the Leader will consider inviting him to the House for this purpose.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Walsh&rsquo;s call on the Leader to do everything possible to ensure the Construction Contracts Bill is squeezed into our work programme.  While the Bill is not large, it has major implications.  I am not aware of anyone who does not want it passed.  I am concerned it may fall by the wayside.</P>
        <P>It was interesting to meet a man a couple of years ago who was in the wind energy business.  He had stopped investing in Ireland and was now investing in Texas.  He went to Texas looking for permission for his wind farm.  He asked how long it would take to get permission for a number of windmills.  He was told that he could come back on Wednesday and he would have permission.  It took one week.  This week I read figures that relate to Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in&rsquo;s comments on administrative difficulties.  Some 300 applications for wind farms have been made since 2007.  Not one has been granted permission and no indication has been given on when the decision will be made.  This is a &euro;17 billion investment that is being tied up with red tape.  I cannot believe it.  It seems outrageous when other countries can do it.  That man decided he will invest in the US rather than in Ireland for that reason.</P>
        <P>On that basis, I congratulate the Cathaoirleach and the Oireachtas Committees on Procedure and Privileges following the recent publication of an Oireachtas document detailing savings.  Following decisions of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and the Committees on Procedure and Privileges of both Houses a number of instances of red tape removal and savings are listed.  The savings amount to over &euro;1 million.  The daily editions of the Official Report of debates in both Houses and the committees will be produced in electronic format only.  Well done.  D&aacute;il questions and replies will be published in electronic format only.  Printers in Leinster House will be configured to print automatically on both sides of the paper unless requested otherwise.  Staff and printing costs are to be saved by moving to a system of paperless committees during 2011.  Congratulations are due to the Committees on Procedure and Privileges of both Houses for the opportunity to save money and save what seems to be a major amount of waste.  I still have a hang-up.  We receive the Order Paper in an envelope in our pigeonholes every day.  I do not know why we need an envelope.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator Quinn in his call for the Construction Contracts Bill to be brought before the House before the Seanad breaks.  I acknowledge the work done by Senator Quinn in progressing the Bill which is vital to the construction hardware sector in the country.  I hope the Bill will be brought before the House.</P>
        <P>I refer to the proposed cross-Border radiotherapy unit for Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry.  On Thursday evening and Friday morning we learned that the Northern Ireland Executive and the Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety in the North indicated they could <Col N="183"/>not proceed with the project because sufficient funds were not available to run this centre when constructed in 2015.  The Irish Government has invested huge amounts of time, energy, effort and resources in terms of money to set up the capital end of the project and the running costs when constructed in 2015.  The centre has received the approval and the financial commitment of the Irish Government.  However, the business plan or model has not been approved by Stormont Executive.  I am saddened by the lack of commitment from the Stormont Executive to this vital radiotherapy unit that will service the north west with a population of 300,000 people.</P>
        <P>A political party claims to represent people on both sides of the Border.  That party blames the British Government for this.  When things are going well in the North, Sinn F&eacute;in claims credit.  When things are not going so well, Sinn F&eacute;in distances itself from the decision and blames the British Government.  That party cannot continue to talk out of both sides of its mouth.  It is holding a public meeting in Derry on Monday night but any community group in the country can do so.  If Sinn F&eacute;in is in a power-sharing Executive in the North, how can it distance itself from the decision of the Executive and the lack of commitment shown by the Executive?  It is time Sinn F&eacute;in talked straight with the Irish electorate on both sides of the Border and stopped talking out of both sides of its mouth.  I would like to see the Minister for Health and Children in this Chamber before the session is finished.  This is a matter of major significance to the people in the north west.  The Minister for Health and Children should come into the Chamber next week if possible.  I have been in communication with her and the Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety in the North.  The decision taken not to continue with this project is a sin and cannot be allowed to happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I formally second the amendment proposed by Senator Buttimer.  I support the proposition made by Senator Wilson that the Minister for Finance attends the House because this matter concerns his brief and taxpayers&rsquo; money.  The Minister has direct responsibility and has the power to alter matters.  He should address the fears, some of which may be groundless.  Groundless or not, there are real fears and doubts surrounding the Quinn Group jobs in Cavan.  Ambiguity surrounds the Anglo Irish Bank-Quinn Group proposal but the major priority is jobs.  We want the question addressed and the Minister for Finance should come to the House.</P>
        <P>On the same day, the Minister for Finance could make a statement in this House on the issue raised by Senator Regan.  Although it was covered by the media, its gravity was missed because of the internal party issues in Fianna F&aacute;il.  Senior ECB personnel impressed upon the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach in the middle of last year that bringing forward the budget and a public commitment to a stringent budget could head off problems for Ireland.  This is beyond negligence when one thinks of the interest rates that ensued and the implications for the people when they look at the universal social charge in their pay packets.  This is a case of sleeping on the job.  This happened on the watch of the Minister of Finance and we need him to make a statement in this House on why he did not address the issues raised by the ECB in the middle of last year.  He should also address the jobs issue at the Quinn Group.</P>

Looking back on what was achieved, where we are today, and where we were under previous Administrations during downturns in the 1970s and 1980s, 5.7% is pretty high but is nothing like 17.7% when other parties were in office during downturns.</P>

        <P>I should have mentioned to the House last week that there might be one, two or three more Bills for our consideration before the finance Bill is finalised in the House.  It is welcome that the Bill Senator Coghlan mentioned was published and is now being taken in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I welcome the wonderful announcement made by Intel last week of the investment of a further &euro;500 million in Ireland, leading to the creation of 850 jobs in construction and 200 long-term high-end jobs at its plant in Leixlip.  What Intel has achieved and what we are achieving in Ireland is a dream come true.  It could be considered we are talking about a race to the bottom in talking about the negatives, but this is a shining example of one of the most successful multinational companies in the world restating its commitment to Ireland, possibly for the next ten, 15 or 20 years.  It behoves us in this House to welcome this magnificent announcement and acknowledge how uplifting it will be for all those young people who will get jobs in Leixlip.</P>
        <P>Senators Twomey, O&rsquo;Toole and Buttimer called on the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to discuss the proposed increases in VHI premiums.  I agree with them that the proposed increase of 45% in certain premiums is unacceptable, particularly given the state of the economy.  I ask Senators who have a good deal of experience in this field such as Senator Twomey to talk to me after the Order of Business to see how we can assist the Minister in the matter.  Senator Twomey and other colleagues have considerable expertise and experience which could be of great assistance to the Minister.  Having asked her to come to the House to deal with the issue, I fully support everything that has been said by colleagues about the proposed increases by VHI.</P>
        <P>Senators Callely and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in raised the matter of information technology and placed the focus on upgrading systems.  Senator Callely spoke about the benefits of using such systems for Luas and DART services and referred to the provision of real-time information for Dublin <Col N="185"/>Bus services.  The traffic radio service available each morning as motorists travel into town is also of great assistance.  I congratulate all those who assist to monitor traffic flows in the city centre.  I will pass on the views of the Senators to the Minister.</P>
        <P>As I outlined yesterday, the number of debates and the taking of statements prior to the general election will be much reduced.  As Members will note, there are six Bills for our consideration this week, with two to be taken each sitting day.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely called for a debate on domestic violence.  I will have no difficulty in allocating time for such a debate, if it is possible to do so.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris and Walsh extended congratulations to that wonderful Irishman, Mr. John Ging, on his appointment to a position at the United Nations.  I heard him being interviewed on radio this morning and fully support the Senators in extending congratulations and wishing him well.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris congratulated the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party for the dignified way it conducted its affairs yesterday.  I can only say it was very uplifting.  The way forward is to conduct our business in a dignified way.  In the end we will all come out stronger, as happened when Fine Gael had its difficulties.  I have no doubt the same will happen with Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>

        <P>Senator Walsh raised the matter of the legal fees in the Curtin case which are in excess of &euro;3 million.  It is difficult to understand the logic behind it.  As the Senator said, something should be done about the matter as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>Senator Wilson has once again requested the Minister for Finance to come to the House to discuss the Quinn Group, a matter also raised by Senator Reilly.  As I said to Senator Wilson yesterday, it must be addressed seriously.  The proposals made should be examined.  The commitment of the Quinn Group to the midlands, particularly the north midlands, has been outstanding to say the least.  Its level of investment in the area is unbelievable.  Its commitment to pay the &euro;2.8 billion owed to the State must be considered a serious offer from such a reputable group.  I fully support it in that regard.  I will consider if time can be allocated next week for statements to be made with the Minister present.</P>
        <P>Senator Cannon outlined the difficulties facing the Zhivago music store and its sister company in Galway.  I know the personnel involved and that they have made a tremendous contribution to the industry during the years.  RTE Radio, Radio 1 in particular, could examine why, as Louis Walsh said, it is one of the few stations in the world that does not support Irish artists.  I wish the Carroll family well in its endeavours and hope it can continue in business, as it has been the backbone of the industry in the western region.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; called on the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to come to the House to discuss the matter of jobs, training, upskilling and community social programmes.  We must ascertain the up-to-date position from the Minister for any person who is unemployed and wants to upskill or be retrained.  I will have no difficulty in arranging such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn outlined that an investment sum of &euro;17 billion in wind farm applications was available to Ireland.  It was alarming to hear the Senator say they were not being processed.  I will make inquiries in the Minister&rsquo;s office later today to see how I can progress the matter.  The current position is completely unacceptable.</P><Col N="186"/>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill again called on the Northern Assembly to participate with the Irish Government in a specified project.  He outlined that the Irish Government had given a commitment to provide capital funding for the development of a unit at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, the expected cost of which was &pound;25.5 million.  The proposed unit was due to be completed by 2015.  The Minister for Health and Children has agreed, in principle, to provide a capital contribution towards the cost of the development and to make funding available for the provision of services for patients in County Donegal.  She has advised the Senator that it is estimated that approximately one third of the patients in the new centre will come from County Donegal.  In the draft business case for the project it is estimated that approximately 400 people from the county will require radiotherapy in 2015.  This is a wonderful proposal and the commitment of the Irish Government has been second to none.  I will certainly make inquiries to see how we can help the people of County Donegal following the Senator&rsquo;s intervention on the Order of Business this morning.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, who was present for the start of my contribution last Thursday.  He will have heard me say the Labour Party welcomes the Bill.  For obvious reasons, my party believes climate change presents the biggest international challenge facing humanity in the 21st century.  It is easy to lose sight of this when we are going through our own economic crisis.  As we know, man-made emissions are the main cause of climate change and we believe climate change legislation is essential to tackle this urgent problem.  There is all-party consensus on the need for such legislation, although there may be differences of view on this Bill.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has a strong policy on climate change and introduced the first Bill in this regard in the D&aacute;il.  As a university Senator, I introduced in October 2007 the first climate change Bill in the Oireachtas.  The Labour Party is the true green party and has a true record on environmental issues.</P>

	<P>The Green Party need have no fear because the Labour Party is in favour of introducing a climate change Bill when in government.  Therefore, there is no need to extend the dying days of this failed regime any further.</P>

	<P>We will do our own thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need to delay in order to introduce a watered-down climate change Bill of this nature.  The Minister of State and Green Party Senators should note there is no need to delay the essential general election any further.</P>
        <P>I said on the last occasion that we would support the Bill, albeit with criticisms.  One of our key criticisms concerns the unconscionable delay of the Government in introducing it.  We support the Bill, despite our criticism that it is weaker than the Bill introduced by Deputy McManus and weaker than the recommendations made by the the Joint Committee on Climate Change.</P>
        <P>On the issue of delay, had the Bill been introduced sooner, there would have been more time to engage in transparent consultation and achieve a buy-in by key stakeholders.  Fine Gael has also raised this point.  I agree with it to the extent that it is a real shame that the Government did not take the opportunity to engage more meaningfully with groups such as the IFA.  I met representatives of the IFA, as have many Senators.  The IFA has informed me that it is very concerned about the lack of consultation.  I understand its representatives met the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, on 21 December, just two days before the Bill was published.  We all know the consultation period is not due to end until after the debates on the Bill have taken place, that is, the end of January.  It is most unfortunate, therefore, that there was not more time at an earlier stage to engage in open consultation.  At the same time, the delay in introducing the legislation has meant there have been backroom negotiations to dilute the provisions of the Bill and make it weaker than the commitment given in the programme for Government.  I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response on the effect of the delay.</P>
        <P>The IFA has genuine concerns about the lack of support for those farmers who are seeking to diversify into renewables and the production of bio-fuels.  If the Government is serious about tackling emissions in the agriculture sector, it needs to offer support.  Such support is sorely lacking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not happy with the Labour Party position either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Having criticised the delay, I make it clear we do not want to delay the Bill any further.  It would have been better not to introduce it in the dying days of the Government, but it is better than nothing.  It is a little like the civil partnership legislation which we <Col N="189"/>supported having introduced our own model.  We did, however, point to the flaws in that what was proposed did not amount to equality, in the way marriage would have done.</P>
        <P>I want to focus on the weaknesses and flaws we have identified in the Bill and make comparisons with previous legislation such as the Labour Party Bill and the recommendations of the joint committee.  A key issue concerns the targets set in the Bill which have been the subject of controversy.  Both the IFA and IBEC have suggested the targets are more ambitious than those set by the European Union.  I am grateful to Friends of the Earth for providing an analysis.  It is both coherent and detailed and ultimately shows that the targets set are no greater than those set by the European Union, but that comparing the two is like comparing apples and oranges because different measures are used.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The real controversy has been about the targets set for 2020.  The Minister of State needs to nail this.  I listened carefully to what he had to say about the targets set and there is still a lack of clarity.  Ireland&rsquo;s EU and Climate Change Response Bill targets for 2020 are difficult to compare for four reasons.  First, the baselines are different.  The Bill&rsquo;s reduction target for 2020 relates to the 2008 baseline whereas our EU reduction target relates to a 2005 baseline.  Second, the scope of the emissions covered differs in that the Bill&rsquo;s targets cover 100% of emissions whereas Ireland&rsquo;s EU reduction targets only cover the non-emissions trading system, ETS, sector.  Third, there is confusion about the 2.5% per year reduction.  The way this measure is framed in the Bill is unfortunate, but everyone agrees on it being a compounded reduction. Therefore, each 2.5% decrease will be a reduction on the previous year&rsquo;s.  Emissions in 2020 need to be 26.2%, not 28% or 30%, lower than they were in 2008.  Fourth, the Bill and the EU treat carbon sinks differently.  The Bill&rsquo;s target is for net emissions, those being, gross emissions less emissions removed by the growth of carbon sinks.  Ireland&rsquo;s EU 2020 target is for gross emissions, although we understand this may change.  It has been stated that even the EU target may increase to 30%.  We believe it is reasonable for the Government to set targets in this legislation that are the same as the current EU target without trying to predict what the latter will become.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill&rsquo;s targets for 2030 and 2050 are at the lower end of the scale, for example, 80% from the 1990 baseline by 2050.  Developed countries have an obligation to reduce by 80% as a minimum.  The range is 80% to 95% relative to 1990.  The longer term figures are less ambitious than the maximum reductions required.</P>
        <P>A part of the controversy about what the targets mean is that the first target has been set for 2020.  The Bill needs more interim targets.  The Labour Bill used a five-year target mechanism, which places more pressure on a Government.  Whatever Government takes office later this spring or this year will not be bound by any particular target under this Bill other than the 2.5% annual reduction, given that no other targets prior to the 2020 target have been set.  This makes abiding by targets less pressing on an incoming Government.  We will table an amendment on the need for five-year targets.</P>
        <P>That the Bill does not refer to carbon budgets is a weakness.  The Government stated it would be committed to five-year carbon budgets as the best way to manage the transition of which the Minister of State spoke.  The Government recognises this idea in an economic context, given the four year plan.  According to the Minister of State, carbon budgets are too narrow a mechanism and he favours a compliance-based approach.  We know where principles-based and light touch regulation got us in the financial services sector.  The Bill should contain a better method of regulation.  It is strange that carbon budgets have not been included in this legislation, given their inclusion in the programme for Government.  Does this signify a change in the Green Party&rsquo;s view on carbon budgets?</P><Col N="190"/>
        <P Just="Left">Timing is an issue.  Section 5 refers to the national climate change strategy as having a seven-year cycle.  According to the Minister of State, this is to allow it to fit within the cycle of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  This is not sufficient reason.  It would be better to set a climate change strategy within five-year periods for interim targets.  The Labour Party Bill contained this proposal as a more sensible and effective way of meeting interim targets.</P>
        <P>Last week, I raised the question of the expert advisory body under section 9.  It is key that the independence of any such body be guaranteed.  That the advisory body was originally to have been a commission is interesting.  The language has changed subtly and amounts to a downgrading of status.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State could explain why it is no longer being referred to as a commission, given that &ldquo;commission&rdquo; was the word used in previous documents.</P>
        <P>The expert advisory body will publish reports.  Section 9(3) states: &ldquo;The Expert Advisory Body shall, subject to the consent of the Government, publish an annual report in such manner as the Government determines.&rdquo;  This provision poses a difficulty in that it suggests that reports will be open to ministerial veto.  This problematic measure will undermine the body&rsquo;s independence and should be amended.  The Minister of State skipped quickly over these words.  In Britain, the equivalent provision calls for the reports to be given to a Minister, but the commission itself can decide when to publish.  This is an important point.  How could one get hold of an unpublished report?  Would it be subject to freedom of information requests?</P>
        <P>Regarding flaws, I will refer to the non-justiciable clause in section 3(2).  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment to the effect he will consider an amendment.  Such a clause is unusual, given that the matter is one for the courts.</P>
        <P>We welcome the Bill in principle, but we have reservations about its timing and content.  Given the cross-party support for tackling climate change legislatively and the fact that stakeholders could have bought into a particular Bill, it is a shame that this Bill was not introduced sooner.  I have criticised the Green Party throughout, but Fianna F&aacute;il needs to tell us its policy on climate change.  I am disappointed it will not bite the bullet and make a strong statement of support for the Bill in this or the Lower House.  If Fianna F&aacute;il is serious about tackling climate change, it must sign up to this Bill.</P>

Will a Bill introduced by current Members in the dying days of this Government tie the hands of future Governments, irrespective of their shade?

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If we are going to go further than our European colleagues we will have serious problems with regard to our future competitiveness.  As I said before Senator Bacik&rsquo;s intervention, there is world hunger and we are entitled to make a contribution towards its alleviation.  Should we tie people&rsquo;s hands and prevent them from producing more food in this country?  The most productive part of our economy consists of the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries when it comes to providing national income and dealing with the problems of the economy.  Neither of those sectors should be hindered from expanding if they can compete in world markets but this is exactly what will happen.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In tandem with the Climate Change Response Bill I want to see initiatives to allow people reduce their carbon emissions.  These measures cannot be brought into play without financial assistance.  I refer to assistance with energy-related projects which would reduce the carbon emissions generated by the agricultural sector but farmers are not in a financial position to take them on.  Despite the fact that the payback would be quite fast the financial institutions will not back them.  This means a loss on the double in that it will mean a loss of future income from farmers, other than from direct production and it will result in more unnecessary emissions.  Technology is available which could change the face of agriculture but people do not have the money to invest in it and neither can they get the money.  I refer to biodigesters and other systems which can create electricity for the national grid and help to replace fossil fuels and this is only the tip of the technology which could transform agriculture.  I am informed that if one had the resources to avail of all the agricultural sector technology, one could nearly become carbon neutral.  However, the money is not there and I question, therefore, the need to introduce a Climate Change Response Bill without making available to the sector the necessary investment to allow it become self-financing.  This is our problem.  We are going down the wrong road if a proper investment programme is not provided in tandem with this Bill.</P>
        <P>I refer to the horrific results of climate change seen around the globe in recent times, the recent flooding in Australia and in other parts of the world.  However, even though we all acknowledge the effects of climate change, we should not attempt to penalise people in this country who are reasonably compliant.  I think we are more compliant than some of our competitors in world markets.  We cannot have a climate change Bill to the level as proposed without having some form of support alongside in order to reduce our carbon footprint, in particular, in the agriculture sector.</P>
        <P>I do not approve of targets being set for a period of 30 or 40 years thence.  Nobody knows what changes in requirements will happen in Ireland, Europe and throughout the world.  In an era of food shortages, it is not right to tie the hands of food producers.</P>
        <P>We must ensure this Bill takes into consideration all its knock-on effects.  The carbon credits for land being set into afforestation must go directly to agriculture and nowhere else.  Every saving made in a sector should be left in that sector.  If sufficient finance is made available in tandem with this Bill to pay for the technology that will prevent emissions, this will make for a good result in lowering carbon emissions.  However, without such financial support the Bill will not work in the long term.  It will disadvantage future generations, whether in rural Ireland or working in the pharmaceutical sector.</P><Col N="193"/>
        <P Just="Left">If green technology was implemented, the country would significantly lower its carbon emissions.  There are new methods for waste disposal which obviate the need for big incinerators.  I believe some of the smaller systems are equally environmentally friendly.  We must consider all the various alternative methods for dealing with waste and pollutants, otherwise considerable damage will be incurred.  I refer to alternatives to fossil fuels for use in the road haulage industry.  I wonder if we are creating a tsunami of legislation without putting in place the necessary mechanisms to prevent this tsunami consuming the nation.  The Bill will have a detrimental effect on the entire agricultural industry and the pharmaceutical and all other industries.  Every industry creates emissions and is a pollutant, whether it is caused by product being transported from factories or other factors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appeal to the Minister to look again at the Bill before Second Stage is finalised.  The review body will report at the end of this month and the Bill should be put on the shelf until that report is published and there is time to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P Just="Left">The House should have a full debate on all the areas covered by the Bill, not alone the consequences of climate change but the need to consider the new technologies.  Such a discussion would result in a very constructive Bill which would have the approval of all.  If agreement across the board is achieved, the Bill will be a success.  Members need to know the future effects of the Bill.  Anyone who suggests that Second Stage should be concluded prior to us being provided with all the information is not being realistic.  I make no secret of the fact that I will reserve my position on the Bill until I know what can be done to turn it into better legislation which will deliver a better gain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  While accepting the need to address climate change and reduce emissions, my party has reservations about this Bill.  We are concerned it will tie our hands in ways that exceed the all-party recommendations of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  We should be hesitant in this regard.  We have tabled an amendment which would not give the Bill a second reading because all-party consensus has not been reached on a greenhouse gas emission reduction strategy.  We need to consult stakeholders properly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand the reservations that Senator Ellis expressed about business and agriculture.  We must be careful not to interfere with food production in this country, which is a growing sector.  I remind Senators of the success of Kerry Group, Glanbia and Donegal Foods.  If enacted, the Bill could curtail the activities of these important job sustaining companies.  We must not shoot ourselves in the foot.  I respect the well meaning people who are behind the Bill.  I do not think they necessarily want to do damage.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ellis spoke about technology and he may be more conversant with this area than I am but we must not rush ahead of EU targets or limit our negotiating <Col N="194"/>position down the line.  Agriculture, business and competitiveness should be at the forefront of our minds as we proceed in this matter.  The targets set out in the Bill are higher than those of our EU partners.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We will discuss the details of that issue on Committee Stage.  As a businessman, Senator Dearey will appreciate that this is a small and open economy.  The last thing we want is to unnecessarily tie our hands in advance of negotiations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill does not do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an opinion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I respect the Senator&rsquo;s views and look forward to hearing further from him.  We want all-party agreement on this subject.  That was the reason for the establishment of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  The Government has published the Bill without consultation and appears to be rushing it through the Oireachtas.  I hope there will be time to consider it adequately on an all-party basis.  Such an approach should be the <i>sine qua non</i> if the national interest is to be served.  We want to delay the passage of this legislation until such time as an all-party approach is agreed because it will impose lasting obligations on future Governments of every hue.</P>
        <P>We are concerned that the short-term targets, which exceed EU and other national agreements, will have significant cost implications for our economy.  Without a binding international agreement, competitor economies will scale up their industries to take advantage of our stringent targets for reducing emissions.  I am not an expert on this matter but I understand that proceeding along the lines laid down in the Bill could have the effect of reducing the national herd by 40%.  Ireland has clean grasslands and we are good producers.  If change can be introduced at the margins by way of technology, let us do so but we should not hinder the growth of the herd or tie the hands of our great producers.  If we ended up importing meat, we would increase our carbon footprint because of transport considerations.</P>
        <P>I do not want us to weaken or limit our negotiating position in any way.  The Bill does not propose any policy or initiative to reduce carbon emissions.  We would seek changes in order that it reflects our policies as set out in the NewERA document.  The Bill requires full and careful consideration.  It would set out in law three non-binding targets.  Greenhouse emissions would have to be reduced by an average of 2.5% per annum until 2020, 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050 compared with 1990 emissions.  I respectively suggest we are running ahead of ourselves with these targets.  They will have no impact on other legally binding targets such as the Kyoto Protocol and the EU 2020 targets.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government would be required to produce a national climate change plan which would set out detailed measures on reducing emissions.  An expert body would be established to advise the Government on functions under the Bill, including national mitigation and adaptation plans, sectoral plans and annual transition statements.  The Bill would place an obligation on public bodies to act in accordance with national climate change plans and off-shoot mitigation and adaptation strategies.</P>
        <P>Three inescapable facts must be faced when considering the issue of targets.  First, we rely on expensive IMF and EU emergency funds to run our State.  Little progress appears to have been made in this regard but I hope there will be mitigation at some point.  Second, we have to reduce the deficit to agreed levels by 2014.  The only way to achieve this goal is by growing <Col N="195"/>the economy because tax increases and public spending cuts alone will not make the full adjustment.  Third, if we are to increase growth we will need to become more cost competitive and make Ireland a better place to do business and create jobs.  Weakening our cost competitiveness in the period to 2014 would set back economic recovery.</P>
        <P>Without an action plan to match these targets, we do not know what effect they will have on an economy which is struggling to grow.  While exports continue to increase, we must be careful to nurture further growth.  The fact that section 3 states there will be no consequences for not meeting these targets means even the Government does not take the Bill seriously.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When it comes to the key issues and key reservations, which relate to agriculture and business, we are deeply concerned about the negative affect this will have on the economy.  We cannot increase costs when trying to grow and encourage more job creation.  This could raise energy prices and threaten agriculture, and I have spoken about the national herd.  We want to make progress and do the right thing but in trying to do so, we cannot lose sight of what is at stake.  It comes down to business and agriculture.</P>
        <P>Why not have proper consultation with the stakeholders, which has not happened?  I do not believe that is how the Minister means to proceed.  That is not his normal way.  I hesitate to say it but I do not know what has possessed some people.  Can we get back to basics and get all-party agreement?  There was all-party agreement at the committee.  Is that not right?  Recommendations were agreed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad that at last this debate is taking place.  The process to bring key legislation in the 2007 programme for Government has been too long.  That is an important point to raise when people talk about lack of consultation.  This legislation was mentioned then and has been part of that consultation process.  I refer to the history of climate change since the Kyoto summit of 1990 and the deal struck by the then Government.  Ireland got an increase in its carbon emissions over that period but failed even to meet that target.  That is part of the reason we are at this point, the reason there is a particular need for this legislation and why I am so disappointed Fine Gael has put forward this blocking mechanism in terms of where it wants to see this legislation proceed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I welcome the support of the Labour Party, I am particularly struck by how it thinks it can bring about stronger legislation in government given that it has a diametrically opposed view to Fine Gael.  I also acknowledge that it is very curious that there are more speakers on the Government side on Government legislation.  I suspect more of a negative tone than we <Col N="196"/>have seen towards any other legislation in the history of the Government.  That saddens me and I hope the Second Stage and the Committee Stage debates will put aside much of the ignorance on this issue.  I use the word &ldquo;ignorance&rdquo; very advisedly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Boyle should have a little respect for other people&rsquo;s opinion.  He can be fairly ignorant at times.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator Boyle to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Part of our difficulty has been a failure to acknowledge the seriousness of the issue.  The word &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; has been used today by a stakeholder about my party&rsquo;s position and the introduction of this legislation.  It would be irresponsible not to introduce this legislation and it would be reckless not to proceed in a targeted way not only in terms of what we need to do in the short term but in the medium term and the long term.  That is the whole point of climate change legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to address some of the concerns among stakeholders.  This is enabling legislation.  It lays down targets and what it makes judicable are the plans which lead towards meeting those targets on a regular basis.  It is different from legislation in other jurisdictions.  It refers to an average approach to meeting those targets but at the end of the day, the targets must bemet.</P>
        <P>Even in the limited debate we have had so far on this issue, there is huge divergence of opinion about whether the targets are sufficient, whether they are excessive or whether somehow they are deficient in terms of where we need to be.  Some of my colleagues on the Government side are saying they go too far, as does Fine Gael.  The Labour Party is saying they do not go far enough.  The reality is that in tonnage terms, they are no greater than what we have already committed to internationally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Why then do we need the legislation if we have already committed to it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We need the legislation to enshrine in law the principle of a targeted approach to this issue given our experience of how we dealt with our international commitments in the past, how we made an utter failure of our Kyoto Protocol commitments, how we must meet the process now in place and how we anticipate moving in the future.</P>
        <P>What I find particularly disappointing is the economic argument being raised.  There is nothing in this legislation that achieves anything the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association, in particular, is saying about agriculture.  Some of the commentators who talk about a reduction of 40% of the national herd are using absurd arguments about what the target is and how one can translate that into a particular sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that the one way to meet this target, and largely through the agriculture sector, is a 40% reduction.  That is absurd.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The idea that somehow the economic basis of deferring or putting off the commitment in regard to climate change legislation is the Food Harvest 2020 report is something with which I fundamentally disagree.  The Green Party has had a huge input into that report.  It enshrines in agriculture policies much of what we believe in.  Where we need to go in developing Irish agriculture is not in terms of quantity.  We will not be the food basket for the world.  Where we need to go is in terms of food quality.  As a result of the environment we have, we can enhance and improve through legislation of this type.</P>
        <P>When people talk about stakeholders entering into discussions and agreements about how we progress these policy areas, I hope people have that particular vision rather than take the type of knee-jerk response we have had to date.</P>
        <P>The response of IBEC is equally disappointing.  It seems to be a million miles away from its counterpart in the United Kingdom, the Confederation of British Industry, which looks on the existence of climate change legislation and the creation of a low carbon economy as an economic opportunity.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;outlines the economic benefit and the potential market for a low carbon economy globally.  In a number of years&rsquo; time, it will be worth &pound;4 trillion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>The same model has nuclear energy.  Senator Boyle is not addressing that fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Some &pound;4 trillion is &pound;4,000 billion.  If one adds another 20% to that, one gets the euro equivalent of &euro;5 trillion.  That is the opportunity a country like Ireland could dip into.</P>
        <P>I heard previous speakers talk about the pharmaceutical industry and the effect that a Bill such as this will have but it ignores the fact that this legislation is about the non-traded sector.  We already have a mechanism in place where the largest industries creating most of the carbon are being dealt with.  This is a targeted and planned approach to deal with the rest of industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope that at the end of this Second Stage debate people inform themselves, do not take a knee-jerk reaction, find out what the benefit of this is, not talk about point scoring and talk <Col N="198"/>about how this is an advantage to this country and is necessary for it not only in terms of environmental obligations but in terms of Ireland as a country, economy and a society benefiting from this legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I emphasise this because most of the convincing I have to do on behalf of my party is not so much of those opposite but those behind me.  This is very unfortunate because this is Government legislation that has been approved by the Cabinet and, at the end of the day, these arguments must hold sway.  I am not convinced a new Government, if one comes about in a number of months, would fare any better with either the vested interests or the contradictions between political parties.</P>
        <P>Spain is exporting wind energy to France.  It is unusual that Spain has managed to outstrip Ireland given our natural advantage in wind technologies.  We have considerable catching up to do and find ourselves in a less than ideal position even though we have done remarkable work in renewable energy in the past three years alone.  However, because of the obstructionist attitude of many in the political establishment since the Kyoto conference and the failure of successive governments to build upon the Kyoto initiative, we find ourselves in a disadvantaged economic as well as environmental position.  Everyone in this House should think about that.  It is not so much about the obligations the Bill will impose for the next ten, 20 or 40 years, but that we must think in that timeframe.  We also need to think about the implications of not having had this legislation for the past ten to 20 years, which represented a major missed opportunity.  Ireland could have been in Denmark&rsquo;s position not only in the production of energy but also in the production for export of the associated hardware and technology.  We still have opportunities in wave and tidal power, but we have had to play considerable catch up in wind energy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In terms of how the targets are met, and this is where many of the stakeholders have unnecessary fears, it is an either-or approach.  While there is the 2.5% figure and the figures for 2020 and beyond, it is not a straight-line approach for each sector or in each year and there is flexibility in carbon reduction.  It would have to be accepted as a success of the Government that the first carbon reductions have been achieved under the Government.  We will achieve those mainly in the energy area.  Our continued reliance on fossil fuels and the inefficient way we produce and use energy are the most obvious starting points in bringing us in line with where we need to be with a targeted approach.  The agriculture sector has a role to play in this.  There may have been some sectors where the success has been lower than we would have hoped, including in the area of bio-fuel energy.  In the micro-generation area, however, I can see the agriculture sector being a net contributor and a net beneficiary in how the climate change strategy is developed in coming years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would hope the stakeholders would think in this way.  The country should grasp the issue of climate change not only in terms of obligations but also in terms of the benefit for the country and for individual sectors in the economy.  It is so disappointing and dispiriting to hear some of the arguments being made today.  There has been an attempt to mislead and to regard the Bill as something to be opposed for opposition&rsquo;s sake.  I have heard some stakeholders use the word &ldquo;ideology&rdquo;. There is no ideology on climate change.  There is climate change.  It is a scientific fact and something to which we as a species have contributed.  It is something that we, if it is not too late, have the only opportunity to try to remedy, and because of that responsibility we should take it more seriously than to engage in the petty squabbling and ignorant debate which has destroyed this theme, not just since our participation in government but for the past 20 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I entered politics in 1991 as a councillor on Cork City Council, as did the Minister of State in Dublin.  Then we were enthused by what was happening in the Rio de Janeiro summit of <Col N="199"/>1992 and the final taking of responsibility by the human race, world governments and individual citizens.  It is now 18 years since that conference and I am still hearing the same arguments by people who have not taken the trouble to inform themselves and know there are no alternatives in this regard.  During the Committee and Report Stages in this House I ask Members to inform themselves better because to remain ignorant will ensure that as a planet the biggest threat to us as a species and all who inhabit the Earth will become worse as a result.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I love to hear Senator Boyle, his enthusiasm, belief and confidence that he knows what he is talking about.  When he says the country will benefit from this legislation, I know he does so from the heart.</P>
        <P>My first experience of this area was in 1990 when visiting Chile.  I went to the Atacama Desert and learned about Easter Island.  If anyone doubts what we can do to ourselves, Easter Island represents a microcosm.  It had a civilisation that was considerably ahead of many other parts of the world, but its people did not understand and ruined it themselves to such an extent that the population from 1500 or 1600 had reduced to approximately 100 people when it was visited again in 1900.  It was not climate change from outside that did it, but the way its own civilisation behaved because the people just did not understand.  The person who cut down the last tree did not realise he had finished its civilisation when he did so.  We are in danger of doing something similar if we do not take steps.  I understand, therefore, the enthusiasm of Senator Boyle and others, including the Minister of State, in saying that we cannot stand back and do nothing.</P>
        <P>The Bill is being debated in the Seanad before all stakeholders have had an opportunity to comment on it.  Given that the closing date for comments is at the end of this month and even though the Minister has taken more than a year to prepare the legislation, he has not engaged properly with stakeholders and has not adequately taken into account the relevant research that has been conducted by State agencies, including the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency and Teagasc.  We need to ensure we take into account everything that should be done.  Senator Boyle has said it is enabling legislation, but if it is not revisited, it could have an extremely detrimental economic effect on the country at the very time we need to grow and get on the road to recovery.  It will have an enormous impact on energy, industry, agriculture and transport among others.</P>
        <P>On the Order of Business I mentioned figures I had seen last week.  I was impressed on meeting an investor in wind energy approximately a year ago.  He had decided not to invest in Ireland after all and had gone to Texas.  He described how he had not been able to get anything moving in Ireland.  His application had not been processed and he had not been able to get anything off the ground.  He took the concept to Texas and applied to develop a wind farm.  He asked the authorities there how long it would take for him to get permission and was told to return in a week&rsquo;s time.  When he returned the following Wednesday, he was granted permission.  That needs to be taken into account.  I do not know how it works and what problems might exist there when compared with us.  I was jolted by the figures released last week indicating that &euro;17 billion in investment is ready to go into wind energy in this country.  There have been 300 applications since 2007, but there has not been a single confirmation of when, or even if, these applications will be processed.  The Green Party has been in power during the three intervening years.  How can this happen?  I do not understand it, although I know the detail.  Mr. Tom Twohig of Element Energy was quoted in the newspapers last week as saying a large part of the problem was lack of communication between the numerous Departments involved in the process.  As for the need for legislation and to do something about climate change, as a start we should ensure what is already in line will be processed.</P><Col N="200"/>
        <P>I am greatly concerned about the greenhouse gas targets set from 2020 onwards.  They are so stringent they will most probably result in far higher compliance costs for Ireland than for any other EU member state.  We must not forget this country already has an obligation to meet a carbon emissions reduction target for 2020 that is double the EU average.  As the EU targets were set before the financial crisis occurred and Ireland was one of its wealthiest nations, we ended up with some of the highest targets in the European Union.  Some eastern European countries which will be competing with us for valuable manufacturing jobs will have to do little or nothing about reducing their emissions and may even be allowed to increase them.  As a result many jobs might go to such competitor countries.  This is even before the larger targets set in the Climate Change Response Bill are implemented.  Surely the fact that our situation has changed beyond all recognition in recent months means that our carbon emissions reduction targets should be radically re-evaluated.  As Senator Boyle noted, perhaps this legislation will enable that to happen.</P>
        <P>It is believed also that the Bill could impose an additional spend of at least &euro;400 million per annum on abatement measures which would undoubtedly seriously damage the competitiveness of the economy.  IBEC has pointed out that the Bill may also introduce double regulation for Irish installations which are already subject to the European Union&rsquo;s emissions trading scheme.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">This could well deter future investment in the manufacturing industries that are key to creating jobs and leading our economic recovery  The Government is signalling much higher environmental penalties than anywhere else in western Europe.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">In the longer term the target set for 2050 is even greater than our total abatement figure.  IBEC states an emissions reduction of 80% across the economy would require us to make significant cuts in the size of our beef and dairy herds.  Teagasc research shows that a 30% reduction in carbon output would reduce the cattle population by almost 40%.  It is estimated that each 1% cut in emissions from the beef herd will cost &euro;30 million.  Going further, one could argue the cuts in Ireland will not actually deliver any carbon savings in global terms.  That is an interesting point because the demand would simply be met by farmers in other exporting countries.  Are we simply going to damage our own indigenous industries and allow other countries to fill the supply gap?  Can the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, say which he considers to be the priority &mdash; tackling climate change or protecting the strengths of the economy?  He has heard me speak on this issue before.  I realise we must do something about climate change and ensure we take steps in this regard, but there are other priorities that must be taken into account.  Might the Climate Change Response Bill actually increase international greenhouse gas emissions?  Sustainable milk and beef production in Ireland would be replaced by less carbon efficient food production in deforested Amazonian  lands in South America.</P>
        <P>I would like to know how the Bill fits in with the Government&rsquo;s targeted &euro;4 billion increase in exports in the next ten years as identified in the Food Harvest strategy for the agrifood sector.  Why is the Bill not taking on board the expected massive increase in food demand described by the United Nations which expects demand to rise by 70% in the next 40 years?  Is the Government taking this figure into account?  In addition, it could be argued the Bill is based on flawed and incomplete science because the accounting method used takes no account of carbon sinks in grasslands, forestry and the production of renewable crops.</P>
        <P>The Bill will have a big impact on the already hard-pressed taxpayer.  In 2008 the ESRI estimated that meeting the previous less stringent targets would prove very expensive.  These new and much greater targets will foist even more costs on the ordinary citizen.  The ESRI has yet to figure out how to estimate the cost involved.</P><Col N="201"/>
        <P>There is much more to say.  The Minister of State will have heard me make points about the change in thinking in other countries.  When the French established that the carbon tax to be introduced would make them uncompetitive, they decided they would drop it until other countries had also introduced such a tax.  They juggled the issue, taking both factors into account, and did not declare one should have a preference.  The Green Party in Britain took an anti-nuclear power stance, but it has now swung round and states it is in favour of nuclear power, believing it to be a safe source of energy that does not involve the use of fossil fuels and to be one that is capable of solving a great number of problems.</P>
        <P>The Bill is moving in the right direction, but at this stage it is the wrong one to introduce, unless many amendments are made to it.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe.</P>
        <P>I oppose the passage of the Climate Change Response Bill at this stage because I am convinced the targets set for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are excessive and will damage the competitiveness of Irish agriculture and the entire agrifood sector.  Sufficient thought has not been applied to how the provisions of the Bill will affect farming and rural communities.  This is a highly technical and complex Bill which has been published in a hurry and is being rushed through the Seanad before we have time to understand exactly what it is committing the country to undertake by 2020.  Before the Bill can be progressed, there must be a period of consultation in order to get feedback from all stakeholders, with the information gathered being made available.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is now widely accepted that the world&rsquo;s population is increasing and the demand for food is growing.  Any proposed reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from farming must be considered in a worldwide context.  Emissions from Irish agriculture fell by 8% between 1990 and 2008, almost twice the target agreed in the Kyoto Protocol that directed that emissions were to be reduced by 5% between 1990 and 2012.  Any policy that reduces agricultural activities in countries such as Ireland which has a high production rate and a low carbon footprint at a time of increased demand for food and renewable energy sources is likely to be counterproductive in reducing greenhouse gas emissions on a worldwide basis.  Any proposed reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from farming must be considered in a worldwide context.  In this country 26% of overall greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture compared with an EU average of 9%.  As agriculture is crucial for the future well-being of the economy, it is important we do not introduce excessive targets that will reduce our competitiveness and hinder ability to grow the sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Teagasc director, Professor Gerry Boyle, at a conference on climate change presented results from a recent Food and Agriculture Organisation report indicating that Ireland&rsquo;s grass-based dairy system has one of the lowest carbon footprints in the world.  In a further study carried out by Trinity College and Teagasc, the current proposed reduction in greenhouse gas emissions was predicted to result in losses to beef farmers to a total of &euro;180 million per annum.  The processing sector would see a further loss of &euro;570 million per annum.</P>
        <P>These cuts will impact not only on the farming community but on all those living in country towns who are employed in beef factories.  Agricultural production in the form of Irish food and drink has been a significant contributor to the excellent performance of Irish exports in the past year.  The recently published Food Harvest 2020 report indicated that Irish agrifood, fisheries and forestry would play a crucial role in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery by increasing exports to &euro;12 billion by 2020.  It is vital the right environment is created to allow agriculture to grow and develop to achieve the targets set out in the report.</P><Col N="202"/>
        <P Just="Left">Food Harvest 2020 targets will be achieved by setting realistic goals for the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to meet Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations.  The targets set in the Climate Change Response Bill exceed our existing EU obligations and national commitments.  There must be international agreement allowing for the inclusion of carbon sinks in EU and international carbon accounting before we bring in the Bill before the House today.  This would give farmers credit for their contribution to the environment and reduce the overall carbon loading on the sector.  This process should be negotiated and agreed before the provisions of the Bill are accepted.  I recommend that the Bill be rejected today and deferred for a period to allow for further consultation with the stakeholders in the agrifood sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  The subject of climate change ten or 15 years ago was easily framed as a kind of radicalist and environmentalist issue, which is no longer the case.  I give credit where it is due to the Green Party for bringing climate change right to the heart of political debate in this country.  While the importance of the subject may have dawned on us at some point, the existence of the Green Party in politics has made us think long and hard about the impact climate change may have on future generations.</P>
        <P>My party and I understand the responsibility we share to hand on the Earth intact and unspoiled to our children and grandchildren.  That ambition can run alongside another ambition of mine that when my child and his peers leave college in ten years, they will enter an Ireland that will offer the opportunity to make a life for themselves in the communities, towns and villages in which they were born.  Those two ambitions are not mutually exclusive and I welcome the general thrust of what the Green Party is trying to achieve.  I am almost in a position to side with it but there are elements which concern me deeply.</P>
        <P>Senator Mark Dearey, who was here a few minutes ago, has left the Chamber.  In his other life he is a creator of jobs in his home in Dundalk.  Is there another way of getting to where we all want to go without having to rush through this Bill, which is what we are doing today and will do over the coming weeks, and without first examining the impact it will have on job creation and agriculture in this country?</P>
        <P>Many groups, including the Irish Farmers Association and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, have expressed serious reservations about the impact of this legislation.  It is important for legislators to take on board such reservations now, engage with the groups and address their genuine fears.  This is not the way to go about it.  The consultative process that has been put in place has not even concluded and before it has, we seem to think it proper to begin introducing this legislation.  We are certainly putting the cart before the horse.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>When independent and scientific bodies like Teagasc express serious reservations about the likely impact of this legislation on farming, one must question it.  The point was made by Senators O&rsquo;Brien, Quinn, Coffey and others that placing these kinds of restrictions on agricultural production may lead to an increase in global carbon output.  Ireland and New Zealand have been shown in the past ten years to be the two most environmentally friendly food production models in the world.  If we restrict the ability of Irish farming to grow and increase the production of what is a high quality and low carbon product, international demand will continue to grow for food and production may move to other locations that simply have no intention of restricting carbon output and are not even in a position at this time to begin putting forward the kind of legislation we are suggesting.</P>
     
        <P Just="Left">The Irish Farmers Association has proposed four reasonable amendments to the Bill.  It argues first that the provisions of the legislation must not exceed Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations.  It requests that agriculture be given direct credit for current and future carbon offsets generated by forestry, bio-energy, permanent grassland and other land uses up to 2020.  Further, <Col N="203"/>the IFA argues the Bill must not restrict the growth targets set out in Food Harvest 2020, the most visionary and far-reaching document produced in the lifetime of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for that remark.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not have a problem giving credit where it is due.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposals in the Bill run counter to the ambitions set out in Food Harvest 2020.  The legislation must recognise Ireland&rsquo;s role in meeting increasing global food demand in an environmentally sustainable manner and guard against the negative global consequences of carbon leakage in other regions.</P>
        <P>The economist, Dr. Colm McCarthy, recently wrote an interesting article about the legislation in the <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal</i> in which he stated the policy proposed needs to be assessed critically from two perspectives.  First, we must assess the extent to which Ireland can usefully contribute to emissions containment.  We have a responsibility in this regard and, as a nation, we are more than willing to live up to this responsibility.  The second perspective, which is equally important, is how this can be achieved at a minimum cost to the farming sector and the potential for job creation.</P>
        <P>If we are to approach this issue in a balanced and measured manner, we must acknowledge that if one small country such as Ireland outperforms other countries in emissions reduction, the global impact is tiny and could be offset by serious indiscipline elsewhere.  Dr. McCarthy concluded that in recent years the monthly increase in emissions from China has been approximately equal to Ireland&rsquo;s total annual emissions.  If Ireland were simply to shut down the economy, including agriculture and job creation efforts, tomorrow, China would make up for our annual emissions saving within one month.  This demonstrates how irrelevant our input into global carbon reduction could be, although I accept the importance of setting an example and being seen to play our part in carbon reduction efforts.  Nevertheless, a degree of perspective is necessary in order that we accept that our willingness to reduce carbon emissions will have a tiny global impact.  The Government appears to be about to commit to achieve emissions reduction over and above our international obligations.  This would be fairly pointless in a global context.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a part to play in reducing global carbon emissions.  We have led the way in introducing many other ground-breaking laws, including the smoking ban.  The ban was brave and excellent legislation introduced by a Fianna F&aacute;il Party Minister in the face of massive pressure not to proceed with it.  Many other countries in the European Union and elsewhere have followed the example Ireland set on smoking.</P>
        <P>Although we have a responsibility to lead the way, in doing so we should not impose avoidable costs on an already weak economy.  The Government will be out of office in ten weeks.  This is a strange statement to make as it is unprecedented in this State to be certain that a Government will change.  Given that this is the case, why is the legislation being rushed?  Green Party Deputies, both in Opposition and government, have made statements on rushed legislation.  In 2006, for instance, Deputy Cuffe, speaking on the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill while on the Opposition benches, stated that rushed legislation is bound to be flawed.  In July 2009, while Minister of State, the Deputy stated that passing legislation as profound as the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill in a mere seven sitting days did not do the House any service.  He added that scrutiny is a key role of Parliament and argued that the full implications of the legislation needed to be teased out and ventilated.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, spoke on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill from the Opposition benches in June 2005 when he stated that rushed legislation was always bad legislation.  I ask Senators from the Green Party to take on board their own advice because this is rushed legislation which needs to be teased out.</P><Col N="204"/>
        <P>The Bill before us should form part of a new programme for Government.  All relevant stakeholders should be engaged in drawing up new legislation which makes the aspiration of playing our part in reducing global carbon emissions compatible with the aspiration of setting Ireland back on the road to economic recovery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Alexandra White.  Members of the Opposition are to be congratulated on the fantastic contortions they are doing on the Bill.  We have heard, for instance, that the legislation has been rushed.  Extensive work and consultation has taken place on the Bill for the past year and a half and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was consistently consulted on it.  Considerable effort has been made in producing this legislation.  It is, for example, extraordinary and unprecedented for the House to have three sessions for a Second Stage debate, as is the case with this Bill.</P>
        <P>There is a magnificent level of interest in the Bill on this side, although it is a pity that some on the Government side have spoken against it and some on the Opposition side have spoken in favour of it.  That, however, is the nature of politics.</P>
        <P>Some of the Senators opposite managed another wonderful contortion when they suggested a consensus is required on this legislation similar to that achieved among members of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security when they produced a climate change Bill.  They should note that the targets set by the joint committee were higher than those set in the Bill before us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>The joint committee had strategies to achieve its targets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Having said that, the final target of 80% by 2050 is consistent in both Bills and will be achieved.</P>
        <P>I have a background in business and systems analysis, an area in which targets are always set.  It is extraordinary to hear targets discussed in what appears to be an uneducated manner.  One cannot achieve a target without first setting it.  If one is trying to achieve something, it is vital first to have a target.  This does not mean one is bound by the target and it is clear targets may be changed if it is necessary to do so.  Future Governments will change the targets in the Bill.  One need only consider the various finance Bills that have come before the House.  How many of our financial projections and targets have been achieved recently?  While I do not know if the targets laid down in the legislation will be achieved, I hope they will be exceeded.</P>
        <P>If we trash the Bill, we will miss a major economic opportunity.  Various international figures, including the United Nations Secretary General and President Obama, speak about a green new deal.  The green new deal is an opportunity to address both of the world&rsquo;s major problems, namely, its current economic difficulties and the problem of climate change.  On the latter issue, I have asked people many times which part of the American Continent is on the same line of latitude as Ireland.  Most people believe that if one were to follow a line of latitude from Ireland to North America one would arrive in New York.  In fact, one would arrive in Labrador, an area of permafrost with little agriculture.  I would not like Ireland to end up having a similar climate.  The climate change models put forward in the 1990s, which are now coming to pass, showed there would be an extreme reduction in the temperatures of the northern hemisphere as a result of the pressure of the melting polar ice caps and the pressure on the North Atlantic current.  I was sitting in temperatures of -10&deg;C in Galway while others sat in temperatures of -18&deg;C.  This is unprecedented.  Climate change is happening before our eyes.  Either we take it seriously or we do not.  If we are to take it seriously, the way forward is to become a world leader.</P><Col N="205"/>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the agriculture sector.  Various enzymes are being developed to allow cows to emit less methane.  We have a fantastic pharmaceutical industry and a fantastic agriculture industry.  Why not combine the two to ensure we can become world leaders in enzymes that will ensure less pollution from cows?  We can produce and export those enzymes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What about anaerobic digestion?  I spoke about red tape.  The number of Departments involved in anaerobic digestion is extraordinary.  In Germany, 30% of renewable energy is produced through biogas.  While it is not quite possible to do that in Ireland, we produce zero biogas.  We can make a lot of money out of this if we examine it properly and we can reduce pollution.  People quite often miss the point when they talk about climate change and the Kyoto Protocol.  Some people are talking about the right to pollute.  People do not have the right to pollute in a way that leaves the world in a worse state.  We should not allow our children to inherit a world less habitable than the world we have.  In the past it has been destroyed for the sake of a few quid in the short term.</P>
        <P>A Senator referred to Easter Island.  I do not want Ireland to lose its agricultural potential.  I do not want Ireland to lose its potential as an inhabitable, decent and green country.  I want to see Ireland as a better place that is leading the way in the world, not a country prepared to allow a few vested interests to pollute more than others and make a few quid out of it.  That mentality is regrettable.</P>
        <P>I have talked to the IFA, as have many members of the Green Party.  The IFA does not want to pollute and has no interest in it.  It wants to work with us to achieve the targets.  Targets have been outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe, to the IFA but they can be changed if necessary.  It is not all about the IFA targets.  We have a great opportunity to reduce our emissions through bringing in renewable energy quickly.  The number of wind farms in Ireland is not high enough.  We need to think big in the area of renewable energy and non-polluting energy.  All of these matters can be put together in order that we have a better and world-leading economy that will drive out of the recession with the green new deal.  I give credit to Fine Gael&rsquo;s NewERA document.  I wonder whether it contradicts what some are saying in this Chamber.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is time to stop the contortions.  The reality is we need the Climate Change Response Bill.  We need to play our part in the world.  This is not just about little Ireland; this is about the world.  We do not exist independently of the rest of the world.  People can say China pollutes but that country is working very hard to reduce its carbon emissions.  I do not want Ireland to lag behind China.  We should be a first world economy and country that is proud to step up as a nation of the first world.  I do not like to see what is going on economically and would not like to see what would happen were we not to take on board the green new deal, the opportunities presented by it, and the opportunities presented for a food island in the Food Harvest 2020 document in tandem with the climate change targets, which are possible if we put our brains to it.  We have plenty brains in this country, as Senators will agree.  We can achieve the targets.  They are there to be achieved and if they are not achieved, we are failures, but we are not tied by the targets.  The targets for various sectors of our economy do exactly what it says on the tin.  These are targets we must aim for and this is the correct way to do business.  The targets have been diluted by the Cabinet from the consensus position of the committee.  I would prefer to see the committee&rsquo;s targets in the Bill and if Fine Gael wants to return the targets to the consensus of the committee, I will support it.  Similarly, if Fianna F&aacute;il sees sense and decides to increase the targets, that would be great.  We can achieve the targets in a way other Senators referred to, by using our brains and introducing electric cars, wind power and ensuring agriculture is sustainable and maximises profits.  We <Col N="206"/>must ensure we do not rely on pollution by oil, which is running out.  There is not an endless supply of oil in the world and price is increasing enormously.  I do not want to see farmers having to rely solely on oil-based agriculture, which is what is happening.  It will be highly detrimental to the future of farming.</P>
        <P>I worked in the agriculture sector for many years.  I worked with companies such as Virginia Milk Products in Cavan.  That company makes enormous environmental efforts and has managed to reduce emissions.  It produces the cream for Bailey&rsquo;s Irish Cream and does a fantastic job.  That is the sort of agriculture I want to see in this country.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mary White, has examined ethanol production in the Irish sugar beet sector and would like to see bio-fuels introduced.  We must be inventive.  The key challenge facing us is to ensure we have a better economy by meeting the targets.  The two are possible together.  Perhaps Barack Obama, Ban Ki-moon and hundreds of other world leaders are wrong but I do not believe they are.  This country should step up to the first world plate and pass the Climate Change Response Bill.  If a number of small tweaks have to be made, so be it.  We can do that and it needs to be done gently and slowly but before the end of this Government.  If not, it will represent a major missed opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mary White, to the House.  She is a great person for coming to the House and I am sure she will take on board the comments of Senators and bring them back to the Minister.  Everyone is in agreement that there must be a climate change Bill.  However, many important issues could be dealt with and discussed before such dramatic legislation is introduced.  Senator Coffey pointed out that there is no plan.  There should be a plan and the climate to bring about change regardless of legislation.  There should be a realistic plan to achieve targets with buy-in from stakeholders such as the agri-sector and the business sector.  What has the Government done?  It is negligent in setting targets and bringing forward plans.  Smart metering is not being rolled out.  Our waste management plan is a shambles.  There is no such plan in this country and if there is, I would like to hear about it.  Where are we in respect of connection to the national grid?  What is the position in regard to foreshore licences?  I refer in particular to offshore wind and wave energy generation.  These are the most important issues that should be dealt with before we introduce legislation such as this.  They should be addressed before rushing this legislation through the Houses without having spoken to the stakeholders involved who have a major input to make in the framing of this legislation.  As a speaker said, in terms of food harvest targets, it is estimated there will be &euro;4 billion earned from extra exports by 2020.  This will result in a 12% rise in emissions in the agriculture sector and at best only a 4% reduction in emissions that can be achieved in that sector.  If this country is to survive, it will be heavily dependent on the agricultural sector and the agribusiness sector for growth, on the processing sector and on added value in agricultural products.</P>
        <P>Milk quotas will be lost by 2015.  The agricultural sector is a big culprit in terms of emissions purely as a result of the size of our national herd.  Teagasc has estimated that a decrease of 84% in our suckler cow herd would be required to fulfil the requirements proposed and to comply with the targets that have been set.  Senator &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in said he was surprised by the number of speakers whose seats are located behind his who want to speak on this Bill.  Is that any wonder?  Those speakers are not present now but they want to contribute to this debate because of the alarming statistics involved.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I heard a debate on the energy sector on the radio yesterday.  The Government can assist the agricultural sector and the agribusiness sector to put in place alternative energy projects.  One such alternative is solar energy.  I am not referring to solar panels but to a solar energy installation that can be put on the roofs of large buildings from which electricity can be generated.  It could be put on the roof of a co-operative, for example.  Another alternative is the capturing of methane gas from slurry pits and processing plants.  Such projects would assist the agricultural sector and agribusiness sector.  The Government needs to be proactive in terms of giving applicants who develop such electricity generation projects a proper tariff.  It may be expensive to do that, on the one hand, but it would deal with a certain problem, on the other.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government seems to be railroading the Bill through the Houses because it has not yet met the stakeholders involved.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>They have had no real input into the framing of this legislation.  Senator Coffey proposed, by way of a reasoned amendment, that we should endeavour to get all-party agreement on this important legislation by bringing all the stakeholders on board and formulating a plan we could all support and with which we could move forward.</P>
        <P>I agree with what Senator Ellis said about dealing with targets estimated by Teagasc for the year 2050.  That is a ridiculous notion.  It could be compared with thinking back to 1970 and trying to set targets then for 2011.  I do not believe there were even diesel cars in 1970.  If the number of changes that occurred in the past 40 years were to occur in the next 40, it would be pointless to try to set targets that far in advance.  I agree with Senator Ellis on that point.   We are way above the targets the EU has set for us for 2020.</P>
        <P>I attended one or two meetings of the scrutiny committee in Brussels some years ago where we met many of the Commissioners.  They outlined the 2020 targets to us and they were fairly severe.  The targets that have been set are severe.  Our economy was booming at the time those targets were set, something to which Senator Quinn alluded at the time.  The Minister should note that we were also a growing population but are growing populations taken into account in those targets?  We have been told our population has increased by a fairly large percentage.  Our population has grown enormously in recent years but that has not been taken into account.  Extra people mean there will be extra electricity demand, extra demand for food and so forth.  I firmly believe we must go back to the drawing board.  We need to set some targets but we must consult all the stakeholders.  The agricultural and business sectors have a huge role to play in that regard.</P><Col N="208"/>
        <P>I wish to read from the Annual Competitiveness Report 2008, which was commissioned by the Government.  Under the heading &ldquo;Balancing Affordable Renewables Targets with International Competitiveness&rdquo;, the report states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Ireland is working towards its EU target of producing 15 percent of its electricity needs from renewable sources by 2010, which will improve the diversity of the fuel mix and our carbon performance.  While the marginal cost of wind and other renewables is low or negligible, meeting the 2020 target of 40 percent will require substantial investment in the electricity grid and back-up power generation.  From a competitiveness perspective, the NCC sees no first-mover advantage to Ireland in going beyond our already ambitious EU climate change targets.  While the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is currently assessing the costs of implementing this target, the NCC cautions that the implementation of more burdensome targets should not proceed in the absence of a finalised cost assessment.  In conjunction with the three percent per annum reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> levels also set by the Government, this would result in a cumulative reduction in greenhouse gases in excess of those mandated by the EU.  The combination of these policies has important cost implications for businesses and all consumers of energy in Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is probably in the traded area but this also applies to the non-traded area.  I ask the Minister that contact be made with all those sectors.

	<P>I have many concerns about the Bill but I also must acknowledge that the concept of the legislation is going in the right direction.  I am deeply concerned that there has been insufficient consultation prior to the publication of the Bill before the Seanad.  It is similar to the case of the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill over which I lost the Whip.  The points I made in the House on that occasion were subsequently addressed in the D&aacute;il and brought back to this House for our agreement.  I made the point that I could not, on principle, agree to something that will be amended in the D&aacute;il and not amended in this House.  I took issue with that on a point of principle.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Until such time as the broad farming community and the broad vision in rural Ireland come to accept this Bill in some form or another by negotiation or consultation, there will be severe difficulties.  Some people are disingenuous in that they say they support the Bill but at our party group meeting yesterday more than six or almost half of the Senators in the Seanad group who turned up expressed grave concern about it.  As the Bill stands, I would find it difficult, if not impossible, to support it.  Its tenor is correct but we must look at the overall picture of food provision and exporting.  I have been outspoken in my support of the fishing industry. Castletownbere is the biggest whitefish port in Ireland and 75% of whitefish landed there is shipped in huge refrigerated juggernauts all the way across Europe to Spain.  When I go to a shop in Schull or Bantry and ask for bream, I am told it is imported from Cypress and we import fish from Iceland and Indonesia.</P>
        <P>I will continue this argument next week.  I have become a grandfather in recent months and am deeply concerned about climate change.</P>

    <Title>Road Traffic Bill 2011: Second Stage</Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill, following its enactment, will allow for the early introduction of significant provisions in road traffic legislation to support and reinforce the existing drink driving enforcement regime.   Its provisions will further communicate the message that drink driving will not be tolerated.  Drivers who, in the opinion of the Garda, have consumed intoxicating liquor and are involved in collisions where injury is caused will be required to undertake preliminary breath tests following the enactment of the Bill.</P>
        <P>This is the seventh major legislative initiative taken on traffic law in the past decade.  The legislative progression during that time has seen the introduction of the fixed charge and penalty points systems, a new structure of speed limits based on metric values, the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints, the establishment of the Road Safety Authority, the introduction of the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications between this country and the United Kingdom and, most recently, the roll-out of a network of privately operated safety cameras.  This year will also see the introduction of lower blood alcohol concentration, BAC, levels for drivers and preliminary impairment testing by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for drug driving enforcement.  Ongoing initiatives such as the introduction of safety cameras have had a significant and positive influence on road user culture.  It is fair to say our roads have, without question, become increasingly safe for all users in the past decade.</P>
        <P>Since 2001 Ireland has seen a rapid improvement in road safety, with the number of fatalities down by 41%, following the implementation of a comprehensive set of road safety measures, some of which I have outlined.  The number of road deaths per 1 million of the population was halved from 107 in 2001 to 54 in 2009.  That downward trend continued in 2010.  Despite the significant gains in recent years, however, it remains unacceptable that so many still die on our roads.  It has never been more important for all of us to ensure complacency does not set in.  The Bill will help us to keep people safe on our roads.</P>
        <P>I will turn to the specific provisions contained in the Bill.  My commitment to endorsing mandatory breath testing at collision sites where injury is caused is again being represented in the Bill.  I want the necessary legislation in place as quickly as possible in order that no driver can avoid being tested for alcohol intoxication where serious road collisions occur.  The legislation will also serve a dual purpose by sending a strong message to all drivers who still contemplate drink driving.</P>
        <P>The Bill allows for the bringing forward of consolidated provisions relating to the obligation to provide a preliminary breath specimen that are planned for commencement later this year under the Road Traffic Act 2010.  Senators will be aware that new evidential breath testing instruments will be necessary to measure the lower BAC levels provided for in the 2010 Act.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is well advanced in procuring the new evidential breath testing equipment for detecting and measuring the lower BAC levels.  Once equipment has been selected, a significant amount of testing will be required before the instruments can be put to use.  A detailed training programme for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the use of the instruments <Col N="210"/>will also be undertaken.  It is estimated that the testing and training programme will be complete and instruments distributed to Garda stations in the autumn.</P>
        <P>Section 9 of the 2010 Act provides for the mandatory breath testing of a driver who, in the opinion of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, has consumed intoxicating liquor or been involved in a road traffic collision that has resulted in an injury.  Section 14 of the Act which is linked with section 9 provides for the mandatory testing of a driver of a vehicle involved in a road traffic collision where the driver is injured and removed to hospital.  It provides that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall test that driver in the hospital unless, following consultation with a doctor treating the driver, such testing would be prejudicial to the person&rsquo;s health.  There is a close interrelationship between sections 9 and 14 and the provisions in the Act for lower BAC levels.  I have been advised that because of this link it will not be possible to commence sections 9 and 14, either in part or in their entirety, until the new evidential breath testing apparatus of which I spoke is in use.  I would prefer if the mandatory testing provisions were introduced earlier than this.  However, this was the strong view expressed when we discussed the 2010 Act.  Therefore, the Bill provides for the amendment of existing legislation, namely, sections 12 and 15 of the 1994 Act, to reflect the provisions contained in sections 9 and 14 of the 2010 Act, thereby providing for the early introduction of these provisions.  The Bill also provides for the amendment of section 4 of the 2006 Act, dealing with mandatory alcohol testing, to reflect the amended provisions in section 12 of the 1994 Act as a result of section 2 of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I have been asked to explain why there is no provision to test drivers involved in all road traffic collisions.  I have explained the reason before but it bears restating.  In many instances, collisions result in material damage to vehicles only, are generally minor in nature and settled by the drivers concerned.  Sending garda&iacute; to each such collision would be a bad use of Garda time and resources that could be used for other road safety and security issues.</P>
        <P>The issue of mandatory testing of drivers at collision sites was the subject of much debate during the passage of the Road Traffic Act 2010.  During that process it was acknowledged that road traffic legislation, particularly the provisions relating to intoxicated driving, was one of the most challenged in the courts.  This necessitates that the drafting process for any new legislation must also focus on making the provisions as robust as possible.  Consequently, I am acutely aware of the need to strike a balance between the practicalities of the mandatory testing provision and the need for any change to be consistent with existing intoxicated driving legislation.</P>
        <P>While drafting the 2010 Act and debating it in this House a concerted effort was made to consolidate all intoxicated driving legislation in a cohesive format that would be robust enough to withstand future challenges.  In this context, it was important that the mandatory provision was knitted into the fabric of this legislation.  I sought legal advice on the relevant drafting of the Bill before us, given the association with so many other vital provisions in the Road Traffic Acts.  I did not want an oversight in providing for mandatory testing to undermine the entire testing regime and undo all what we were trying to achieve together.</P>
        <P>Owing to this detailed examination of the likely impact on other provisions and following the advice of the Attorney General, sections 2 and 3 of the Bill also recognise the powers of arrest conferred by law on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the interaction between these provisions and the requirement for the preliminary breath-testing of drivers.  This necessary and explicit clarification will avoid any possible undermining of the provisions when introducing mandatory testing.  It will also need to be reflected in the related intoxication provisions of the 2010 Act.  As Senators are aware, it is intended to commence all of the intoxicated driving provisions of the 2010 Act later this year.  Accordingly, it is my intention to amend sections 9 and 14 of the <Col N="211"/>2010 Act in a new road traffic (No. 2) Bill 2011 to be drafted soon.  This will ensure all of the necessary initiatives will come on stream together.</P>
        <P>The key determinant of road safety performance is the behaviour of road users.  Consequently, the primary focus of our road safety strategy is to influence that behaviour positively.  This can be achieved through various initiatives across a range of areas, including the enactment and enforcement of laws that promote good road user behaviour.  Such laws must also be underpinned and supported by the application of fines, prison sentences and driving disqualifications, as well as the necessary technological resources.  The Bill is yet another element of that overall programme and will undoubtedly build on the achievements of recent years.  It will help to deliver additional improvements in the manner in which all drivers interact with the road system.</P>
        <P>Senators will make worthwhile suggestions for other road safety initiatives for inclusion in the Bill.  While these may or may not fall within the parameters I have set for this legislation, I am particularly anxious to secure the passage of this short Bill as quickly as possible to allow for the early introduction of the provisions contained therein.  However, all suggestions Senators might make will be afforded consideration within my Department with a view to their inclusion, where appropriate, in the next road traffic Bill to be introducedd later this year, on which work has already commenced.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators in advance for their co-operation in facilitating the taking of the Bill and, I hope, its speedy passage through the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  My party is supportive of the Bill which it wants to see pass through the House as quickly as possible and then the D&aacute;il before being implemented.  As the Minister acknowledged, improving road safety and assessing the progress made to date are priorities that are genuinely shared by both sides of the House.  The issues the Bill seeks to deal with were recognised by my party when legislation was introduced last June.  I welcome the introduction of such legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to focus on a number of areas, in respect of which clarification and answers from the Minister would be appreciated before we proceed to take Committee and Remaining Stages.  We support the overall thrust of the Bill and the policy underlying it.  When the Road Traffic Bill 2010 was before the Seanad, we had detailed discussions on its elements and how it could be improved.  In the interests of saving time, I do not propose to rehearse all of the points made, but I will refer to five issues, some of which were touched on during our previous discussion and are pertinent to the Bill.</P>
        <P>We discussed the issue of drivers caught driving while under the influence of drugs.  The Minister answered that he did not want to progress the matter through legislation because there was no clear policy in place on what instruments could be used to detect the presence of drugs and how the Garda would respond to such cases.  Has any progress been made since?  Unfortunately, it is become frequent for drivers to drive with drugs in their bloodstream and the issue must be addressed.  I understand, however, why such a provision is not contained in the Bill, given the Minister&rsquo;s eagerness to have it passed through the Houses in the time remaining to us, but what work has been done to that end and does he expect the issue to be addressed in a future road traffic Bill?</P>
        <P>I wish to raise a minor point about the vehicles covered by the Bill.  Since the Minister stated road traffic legislation was often contested in court, clarifying the definition of &ldquo;a vehicle&rdquo; might prove worthwhile.  The Bill and the original Act use the same definition, namely, a mechanically propelled vehicle.  Given the use of electric cars and electrically powered vehicles, is the Minister confident that they will be covered by the definition?  I am sure they will be.</P><Col N="212"/>
        <P>The Minister referred to oversight.  He stated, &ldquo;I did not want an oversight in providing for mandatory testing to undermine the entire testing regime and undo all what we were trying to achieve together.&rdquo;  I am confused as to what is the oversight and I ask the Minister to clarify it and to explain how he believes it would play a role in slowing down implementation of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I refer to the statutory instruments necessary to ensure implementation of the Bill.  Due to the desperate cutbacks in spending across all Departments, the funding is not in place for many projects.  I ask the Minister to confirm his confidence that the Estimates for his Department will be able to fund the proper and comprehensive roll-out of these statutory instruments and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have sufficient training and the back-up of sufficient statutory instruments.  It is worthwhile raising this point because yesterday the new Garda Commissioner stated that the level of funding available to him to deal with organised crime has been halved compared to the allocation for last year and what he was expecting this year.  It is important, therefore, to clarify whether the Minister is confident that the funding will be in place to ensure the proper roll-out of both the training and the statutory instruments.</P>
        <P>I refer to subsections (6) and (7) of section 2 of the Bill which introduce a discretion for a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to whether he or she is of the opinion that the testing of a participant in a collision or some other event would be prejudicial to the health of the person.  I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s thinking as to how &ldquo;prejudicial to the health of the person&rdquo; will be defined.  Could it be taken to mean that a person&rsquo;s life might be in danger, that his or her quality of life might be threatened, or does it mean with regard to how the person feels when the incident has taken place?  Such a phrase, in my view, will be contested in the courts.  It also gives a degree of discretion to the Garda member making the decision.  I ask the Minister to confirm the thinking behind that section of the Bill and how it can be determined that such a test is prejudicial to the health of the person.</P>
        <P>I will be proposing an amendment on Committee Stage and I will speak in detail on it.  My amendment proposes making clear to the participant in the incident that if he or she fails to comply with the instructions of a garda, he or she will be guilty of committing an offence.  My amendment seeks to probe what is the interaction between the garda and whether we can do everything possible to ensure the person is clear about the directions of the garda and that he or she understands the garda is protected by the full weight of the law and has the ability to sanction that person if he or she does not comply with the instructions.  I would appreciate a response from the Minister when he speaks at the conclusion of Second Stage.  I wish to be constructive, to understand the thinking behind the Bill, to ensure it is passed promptly and that it will stand up in court if challenged.  Progress has been made in reducing the number of fatalities and accidents on the roads.  We all want to see this continue.  The Fine Gael Party is pleased to see this loophole being filled and we look forward to the implementation of the legislation as a further tool in helping reduce the number of people killed on the roads.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Donohoe, we all welcome this legislation.  I ask the Minister to clarify some points.  The discretion for the initial testing of a person involved in a collision will lie with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, unless a person has been seriously injured.  Who will determine the seriousness of the injury?  What training will be provided to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  I am acting as the devil&rsquo;s advocate in this matter because I foresee it being challenged as to whether the garda was able to determine if a person should be tested.  Nobody wants to see people allowed to drink and drive or to drive under the influence of drugs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s commitment to endorsing mandatory breath testing at collision sites where injury is caused is again being presented in the Bill and nobody will have a problem with that.  However, I want the necessary legislation in place as quickly as possible in order that no driver <Col N="213"/>can avoid being tested for alcohol intoxication in the case of serious collisions.  The reference to alcohol, without reference to drugs, needs to be amended.  Drugs and alcohol should both be relevant as the use of drugs is now as much of a problem as alcohol with regard to driving offences.  In most cases a blood test will be carried out in hospital so it should be quite simple to determine whether drugs are present.</P>
        <P>I compliment road users and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the obvious improvements in statistics for road deaths.  I know this is no consolation to families who lose family members in road accidents but genuine accidents will always happen, no matter how we try to avoid them.  However, we cannot accept accidents in which contributory negligence such as the involvement of drink, drugs or excess speed, is involved.  We need to improve the system of training for young drivers, even at secondary school level and to make them aware that once they sit behind the wheel of a car, they are in command of a lethal weapon which is very dangerous.  If they do not know how to use such a weapon it is as dangerous as a gun or a knife.  Nobody wants to condone driving under the influence of drink or drugs but the omission of a reference to drugs will mean there is a loophole in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister.  I acknowledge the improvements in road traffic legislation set out by the Minister.  The achievements are measurable and have been delivered on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the amendment of existing legislation to permit the early introduction of mandatory alcohol testing of drivers of mechanically propelled vehicles in certain circumstances and the Labour Party welcomes the Bill.  The Bill provides for mandatory testing at crash sites.  The fast-tracking of these provisions is very important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with the Minister that a long debate was held on the need for such testing during the passage of the Road Traffic Act 2010.  I do not think, therefore, it is necessary to go overthat ground again today. I will play my part in speeding up the legislative process in thisHouse.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        
        <P>The Minister conceded some ground on this issue during the debate on the 2010 Act, when he proposed an amendment providing that such testing shall be mandatory.  As he appears to have diluted his position with this Bill, my party will table several amendments on Committee Stage to restore the previous measures.  We share the concerns expressed by certain action groups, representatives of which are in the Visitors Gallery, that for the first time in Irish drink driving legislation a garda shall not ask for a breath sample if he or she believes it would be dangerous to the driver&rsquo;s health.  Why is this necessary given that the Bill does not state how the driver is to be tested?  The section needs to be tidied up somewhat but I am interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>
        <P>In regard to cases where a driver has not been involved in a collision and, therefore, a hospital procedure does not apply, section 2(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Bill dilutes the provisions of the 2010 Act by substituting the provision that a garda shall test with the provision that the test will be carried out unless it is prejudicial to the health of the driver.  How can the garda form such an opinion in the absence of advice from a doctor?</P>
        <P>While I welcome the Bill, amendments are needed if we are to achieve the agreement previously reached by all sides of the House and conceded by the Minister during passage of the 2010 Act.  We can discuss in greater detail our proposals for and concerns about the Bill on Committee Stage.  I concur with Senator Ellis in regard to testing for narcotics and I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesCarrollFF"><NameTxt>Senator James Carroll</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Minister well in his pending retirement.  He was a superb public representative for my neighbouring county of Meath.  I have had several arguments <Col N="214"/>about him but I continue to consider him as one of the most idealistic members of the Cabinet.  He has retained his idealism and fire after 14 years in office and if I can do the same I will be a happy man.</P>
        <P>My comments on the Road Traffic Bill 2011 will focus on three areas, namely, why it is being introduced, the changes it will deliver and the benefits it will bring.  The general reason for the Bill is to amend existing legislation to allow for the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing of drivers in advance of the coming into force of the provisions contained in the Road Traffic Act 2010.  Given that the Minister outlined the basis for the Bill in detail, there is little for me to add in that regard.</P>
        <P>While Ireland has one of the best records in the EU for reducing the number of road deaths, 2010 was truly a black year for horrific accidents.  Several people were killed over Christmas in the Minister&rsquo;s own county.  It is never a good time to lose one&rsquo;s family members but Christmas is an especially difficult period for this to happen.  Since the Minister was appointed to his current office, the number of road deaths has decreased.  The figure for 2009 was 238, which represents a decrease from a high of 279 in 2008.  The figures were stark for the years prior to the Minister&rsquo;s appointment.  He took a lot of abuse from members of Fianna F&aacute;il for his tough stance on legislation but by sticking to what he believed was right he delivered change.  The best change that we can hope for is that more people are alive than would have been the case under the previous legal regime.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan expressed concern that the Bill may not go far enough.  The Labour Party has submitted several amendments which I look forward to debating.  The Minister outlined the reason for the measures introduced in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I come from an area alongside the old N1 in County Louth, which was one of the worst places in Ireland for road traffic fatalities.  The road outside the Monasterboice Inn, which is at the bottom of the lane on which I lived, was the site of some of the worst accidents ever seen on Irish roads.  A variety of accidents took place including one in which a large number of people were killed.  Every road traffic accident that could be prevented is a tragedy and that is why it is critical we pass this Bill swiftly.  We must also implement the legislative changes contained in the Road Traffic Act 2010 at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>Nobody likes to see legislation or targets being delayed because of a lack of equipment.  We all want the equipment yesterday and that is always the case in regard to measures aimed at saving lives.  Equipment to test breath samples will not be available until September 2011.  Evidential breath testing machines will be needed to measure alcohol levels in drivers&rsquo;breath.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill introduces mandatory breath testing at sites of accidents, which is very important.  I had the misfortune of being involved in a minor road traffic accident in 2010.  It was the first time I had ever been involved in an accident and it was a shock to the system.  I did not know what to do.  An hour after the accident I called a garda, who asked me whether I had contacted anybody earlier.  When I told him I had not done so he pointed out that the other party to the accident could easily blame me for causing it.  I learned an important life lesson from that conversation.  Mandatory testing is important because every public representative will have dealt with cases where the people involved in accidents changed their stories.</P>
        <P>The consequences of having alcohol in one&rsquo;s system are potentially immense.  If one takes a drop of alcohol, one should not get behind the wheel.  People fear that the limit cannot be reduced to zero but that is a target I would like to reach.  Some might say this is a generational attitude.  My peers and I who are in our twenties would never dream of drinking and driving because it is stupid.  When I was younger, I was a passenger in cars driven by individuals who <Col N="215"/>had consumed a few pints.  We thought that was a normal practice at the time but thankfully that culture has been broken.  As more young people get behind the wheel, they realise the importance of never even dreaming about touching a drop of alcohol.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis and others have raised the issue of drug driving.  The Minister has addressed this issue on a number of occasions.  Some young people who would never get behind the wheel if they consumed alcohol believe they are capable of driving after smoking cannabis or taking other drugs.  That one can drive after taking a small amount of drugs is another myth that needs to be punctured.  It might be an idea to get some role models to highlight this, whether sports people or otherwise.  Many people mentioned the new road traffic legislation to me over Christmas and the advertisements.  When one goes on-line to listen to radio, one sees road safety advertisements.  Many people feel very awkward when they see these advertisements in which people who have been in accidents talk about them.  It hits people between the eyes that this is what happens when one takes one&rsquo;s eye off the road or if one is silly enough to get behind the wheel when one is intoxicated or under the influence of drugs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill introduces mandatory alcohol testing, which is necessary.  I look forward to the 2010 legislation coming into effect in September 2011 and to further road traffic Bills which are more strict than this one.  That is critically important to save lives.  I commend the Bill and look forward to discussing the further Stages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I am sure this Bill has all-party support because it is very hard to find anybody who is opposed to it.  The Minister has grabbed hold of challenges in the past and I remember well when he introduced the plastic bag tax.  He listened carefully to those of us with problems and took them on board.  As a result, the plastic bag tax has been hugely successful.  I am sure the same will apply to his efforts in regard to road safety.</P>
        <P>There was a very bad accident very close to Mosney in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency and I believe in Senator Carroll&rsquo;s area in, I think, 1963.  Five people were killed, three of whom had been in school with me.  I remember the following week going out to get a new thing called a &ldquo;seat belt&rdquo;.  It was not compulsory at the time.  I remember saying to everyone I met that I would never drive without a seat belt.  I would have felt a right fool if I had an accident and was not wearing it.  The same applies to alcohol, about which Senator Carroll spoke.  It is interesting that young people nowadays, in particular our families, are astounded if anybody had a glass of something and drives.</P>
        <P>I remember some years ago a good friend of mine came to our home and we went to a restaurant close to where we live.  He telephoned me the following day &mdash; I thought to thank me &mdash; to remind me that I had a few glasses of wine and drove home.  This was perhaps 20 years ago.  I said it was a short distance but he said he thought I was most unwise.  He was a real friend &mdash; somebody who said he was saving my life and drawing attention to something which is quite common now in that we just know that one does not drink and drive.  However, in those days, we did not always think that.</P>
        <P>We have all talked about the human cost but I was surprised to read the cost of road safety.  The figure in regard to fatal and road injury collisions for 2008 is &euro;1.2 billion.  I do not know how accurate that is or where the Minister got that figure.  However, it is nothing compared to the human cost.  We must remember the massive progress we have made when it comes to road safety.  There has been a 41% reduction in road deaths, in particular, from 107 to 54 per 1 million inhabitants between 2001 and now.  It makes sense that the legislation gives garda&iacute; the power to test all drivers involved in a crash where somebody has been killed or injured for alcohol.</P><Col N="216"/>
        <P>Could we come up with more ideas to improve road safety in other ways?  Could every car have a mandatory warning triangle?  A warning triangle was provided with my car but I gather they are not mandatory.  They should be placed on the road if a car has broken down.  They would make the road safer and would give motorists some warning of an obstacle ahead.  During the recent bad weather a number of cars were abandoned by the side of the road.  It is interesting to read that in some parts of Europe legislation requires that snow chains are provided with cars.  I hope we do not need them despite the weather we had a few weeks ago.  Many of the cars abandoned by the side of the road during the snow were obscured and a warning triangle would have helped motorists to avoid a crash.</P>
        <P>A triangle is already compulsory in many European countries, including France and Germany, and perhaps the Minister will indicate whether it is here.  It could be a mandatory item sold with new cars or it could be mandatory to have one from 2012.  The cost would be approximately &euro;5 or &euro;10 but it would be much less if the car manufacturers supplied them.</P>
        <P>In some countries, every car must have a small standardised first aid kit.  I am not sure if that is compulsory here.  It is a requirement in Germany and Spain and it has the effect of helping to limit the effects of serious injury or worse and it would be of relatively little cost.  I have seen first aid kits in Europe for &euro;10 or &euro;15, although the cost in Ireland would be much more expensive.</P>
        <P>In some countries, including Spain, France and Belgium, one must wear a reflective vest if one&rsquo;s car breaks down and one must get out of it.  It is obviously very dangerous to get out of a car on a motorway and there have been cases of people being run over after their car has broken down.  It would be helpful for people to have reflective vests and whether it should be compulsory is worthy of consideration.  In many European countries carrying a fire extinguisher in case of engine fire is strongly recommended.  I am not sure if it is compulsory here but if it is not, it should be.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to drivers&rsquo; eyesight and how that could contribute to accidents.  Eyesight usually markedly declines as a person gets older.  If a person passes an eyesight test at 18 years of age, I do not think there is a requirement for a further test until one is 70 years of age.  Senator Mary White might be able to tell me if that is correct.  I am not sure that is ideal.  There was a letter in a newspaper recently written by somebody over the age of 70 who complained that they had to get a licence every two years, that it cost them money and that the only photograph they can get cost them &euro;10.  I would not be surprised if Senator Mary White spoke about that.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White raised the problem of tourists over 70 years of age renting a car previously.  I know it has nothing to do with this Bill but it is a challenge in regard to efforts to promote road safety if rental car firms place stipulations on people over 70 years of age.  I am over 70 years of age and I feel quite capable of driving a car.  I would not like to be told I was too old to rent a car and I hope it does not happen.</P>
        <P>Making it compulsory to carry a warning triangle and first aid kit could make a significant contribution to road safety.  There is much talk from the Road Safety Authority about getting the message across but what about implementing something practical and straightforward which would have the effect of putting road safety in people&rsquo;s minds?  I do not believe people would object if they were legally required to carry a first aid kit and I believe there would be support for that.</P>
        <P>I support the Bill which strives to improve road safety.  The suggestions I outlined could have a big impact on improving road safety.  I would like some or all of these proposals to be discussed or implemented in the near future.  I know the Minister listens to all suggestions and <Col N="217"/>has implemented many changes.  This one is worthy of support.  I would not be surprised if the Minister got support for everything he proposes here as well as for additional measures.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister and commend him on this initiative and the initiatives he brought before us previously.  In a radio interview after he had announced his intention to retire, the Minister was asked what his legacy would be.  He said a considerable number of people were alive as a result of legislation he had helped to bring through the Houses.  That is an extremely important legacy and being able to say it is something of which he can rightly feel very proud.</P>
        <P>No one seems to disagree with the Bill.  It is great to take part in a debate in which there is no disagreement on either side of the House.</P>
        <P>I listened carefully to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s contribution and having had the experience of driving elsewhere in Europe, the Minister might take notice of what he was saying about the use of the red triangle and the high visibility vest.  However, we should probably stop short of requiring the use of cold weather tyres which I hope is not necessary here yet, but with climate change, one never knows.  Whether it is in amendments to this or another Bill, any measure that will improve safety is crucial.</P>
        <P>I have often been out during the evening &mdash; as one tends to be in politics &mdash; and people might say there is no issue with having one drink.  However, it is important that public representatives practice what they preach and I encourage the Minister to do likewise.  If one is driving home, the safe level of alcohol is zero.  I am not remotely interested in narcotic drugs, but there are many who are and their use is prevalent in our society.  Aside from the fact that they are illegal, the safe level of drugs is zero.  Given that it is a privilege to drive a car, not a right, anyone who causes a serious traffic accident because he or she has taken various substances or been irresponsible in any way should never drive again.  A person being killed in an accident is not a risk worth taking just to allow someone to get around quickly and be cavalier about it.  The attitude to road safety is far too casual.</P>
        <P>As a Green Party member, I obviously advocate that trains are safer than cars.  It is important to put this issue at the top of the agenda.  A single road death in a year is unacceptable; the levels in the past were outrageous.  One of the primary reasons the roads are considerably safer is the building of motorways, for which I give credit to Fianna F&aacute;il.  Motorways are safer than winding roads with narrow bends.</P>
        <P>The vehicle roadworthiness tests introduced in recent years represent a very important addition in terms of road safety.  No one likes the idea of having speed limits, but the reality is that having them makes driving safer.  The law on speeding is the one that is most frequently broken and the limits are not enforced to any great extent.  In Galway we have had debates on the issue that speed limits should be appropriate to the road.  They are often not taken seriously, particularly on a dual carriageway with a speed limit of 50 km/h and when just up the road there is a boreen with a speed limit of 80 km/h or, in the recent past, 100 km/h, which makes absolutely no sense.  The Bill is a good one.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on introducing this most important Bill.  In his entire political career he has been innovative, entrepreneurial and different in his activities as Minister and I wish him the best of luck in his new career.</P><Col N="218"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill provides for the early introduction of mandatory alcohol testing at the scene of all road accidents and collisions where someone is injured.  Alcohol Action Ireland, the national charity for alcohol-related issues, with which I work on the issue of suicide, is appealing to every Member of the Seanad to save lives on the roads and support upcoming legislation which will allow for the early introduction of mandatory alcohol testing of all drivers involved in road collisions where someone is injured.  Alcohol Action Ireland director, Ms Fiona Ryan, said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Nine out of ten surviving drivers in fatal crashes are not tested for alcohol.  The passing of the new Bill will allow for the mandatory testing of drivers involved in such collisions to be commenced immediately.</P>
        <P LI="1">In 2006, the Government introduced random breath testing and in each succeeding year, the number of deaths on our roads fell.  We now urge the Government to implement mandatory alcohol testing without delay.</P>
        <P LI="1">Alcohol, even in small amounts, can and does impact on driving.  This decision should be an easy one to make &mdash; voting in favour of this legislation is a vote to save lives.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Unlike the Leader, I am not a pioneer, but from my studies of preventing suicide and self-harm alcohol presents a more serious problem than the recession.  I make that bold statement based on my experience.  The economy will gather pace and improve &mdash; it is improving already &mdash; but we need to have a national conversation about the abuse of alcohol in our society.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn has referred to the archaic legislation that provides that people aged 63 years cannot get a ten-year licence without first getting a doctor&rsquo;s certificate to prove fitness to drive.  All of the international evidence indicates that older people are safer drivers.  I attended a seminar at Tallaght hospital on the issue.  Older people know when their eyesight may be becoming a problem.  Requiring people to go to the doctor to get a certificate can deter older people from applying for a driving licence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and join other Senators in wishing him well in his forthcoming retirement in the not too distant future.  He has had a long and distinguished career in the D&aacute;il and was always well on top of his brief when he came to this House.  I have no doubt he is well on top of this legislation.  Of course, we all support legislation that will save lives.</P>
        <P>The difference in cars between when I was a young fellow which is not today or yesterday and today is unbelievable.  The smallest car now is probably bigger than the biggest car at the time when a good sized car was a Ford Prefect.  When one looks back on such old cars, they were very small.  I presume they looked big when I was a gas&uacute;r, but they look very small now compared with the smallest cars.  Cars are now much better made and can travel much faster, which is the danger.  Speed has always been a significant factor.  I agree with Senator Quinn on the need to wear high visibility vests and have a red triangle when one&rsquo;s car breaks down, particularly on a motorway.  When one pulls over on a motorway or any of the main routes, cars pass by at an unbelievable speed.  I believe there was a fatality in Longford in the past few years when somebody pulled into the hard shoulder &mdash; it was not a motorway or dual carriageway &mdash; and a car ran into them.  I agree with Senator Quinn in that regard.  I stated before and it remains my view there should not be any unmarked Garda cars.  All should be well marked and garda&iacute; should be out in the face of the public.  Even when one is driving on the opposite side of a motorway to where a Garda car is parked one will take note of it and check oneself.</P><Col N="219"/>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and any legislation that has the intention of saving lives.  I have a question for the Minister of State.  Section 2 applies to &ldquo;a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place who, in the opinion of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ... has consumed intoxicating liquor&rdquo;.  Heretofore there was random breath testing under which provision a Garda superintendent or similarly established person in a Garda barracks could make an order that the random breath test must take place within certain areas, on specific routes or at certain places and times as were laid down.  Under the proposed provision it would seem that a Garda could stop a person on the road and if he or she thinks that person has consumed alcohol, he or she could do a breath test there and then.  That is my reading of that part of the Bill.  It would mean that random breath testing would become redundant.  The Minister of State might explain this.</P>
        <P>Another aspect of the Bill concerns the designated doctor or nurse.  When garda&iacute; go to a hospital the Bill states they must work with a designated doctor or nurse.  Heretofore a blood sample was taken from the driver who looked for his or her doctor to come to the hospital or he or she might use a doctor on call.  When garda&iacute; go into a hospital, will they ask who is in charge?  Will they state they want a doctor and, if a person has been involved in an accident and admitted to the hospital, that they want a specific nurse or doctor to take a sample?  Who gives that power to the designated doctor or nurse?  We have seen hold-ups in accident and emergency departments during which a patient may be detained for up to three hours.  In a different section of the Bill there is a requirement to hold for an hour the person from whom a sample must be taken at the side of the road.  Does that requirement of an hour also apply within the hospital in that the sample must be taken by the designated doctor or nurse within an hour?  Might it be taken the following day or does any time limit apply to the blood or urine sample taken within the hospital such as applies to the sample taken at the side of the road?</P>
        <P>That is all I have to say.  I hope the Minister will clarify those points either now or on Committee Stage.  Otherwise, like my colleague, Senator Donohoe, I welcome the legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta &Aacute;ine Brady.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, stated that no driver can avoid being tested for alcohol intoxication when serious road collisions occur.  If we start from that point, this Bill is welcome.  As Oireachtas legislators, in tandem with local authorities, the Garda and motorists, we must ensure we support every initiative and all legislation that will eliminate the risk of lives being lost on our roads.  We live in an era where there is polydrug use among a wide section of society and within communities which is causing difficulty.  The Minister referred to this point in regard to preliminary impairment testing by the Garda for drug driving enforcement.</P>
        <P>It is time the country had a serious discussion on the use and consumption of alcohol.  It is important we do this in a non-hysterical, sensible and mature fashion and that we listen to the debate, arrive at a conclusion and work on its implementation.  I use that terminology deliberately because it is my view we are a nation which uses alcohol unwisely.  We have a difficulty with it and need to address the issue.  It has manifested itself in many different ways but especially regarding road safety.  The random breath test is important, as are the powers to be given to the Garda, which are welcome.  The introduction of mandatory alcohol testing must be supported.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that we are becoming somewhat complacent.  We believe the arrival of speed vans on different roads throughout the country will deter motorists from speeding.  I would very much like to see the use of garda&iacute; on non-national and secondary roads which have a speed limit that is not being observed by some people.  One sees little or no Garda activity on these roads.  I draw an analogy with the speed limit on the Cork-Dublin motorway, namely, <Col N="220"/>120 km/h from Watergrasshill to the outskirts of the old Naas dual carriageway.  There are very few accidents on that road.   People generally drive safely and adhere to the speed limit.  One might also take, for example, the Ballincollig bypass in Cork which extends from Bishopstown to just beyond Ovens.  It, too, has a speed limit of 120 km/h and few if any accidents .  People adhere to the speed limit or stay close to it.  Nevertheless there is a preponderance of Garda speed checks on this road which makes no sense.  We need to concentrate on the minor roads where people speed in excess of the limits of 80 km/h or 100 km/h in areas adjacent to hospitals or schools in rural areas.  On occasions in certain towns and parts of the country I have seen people who do not adhere to the speed limit as they approach schools on main roads at the edges of towns or drive in areas with particular difficulties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is welcome that we have lowered the number unfortunately killed on the roads.  It took a long time to arrive at that and a great deal of investment and time on the part of the Government to listen to the families of those who died and to the Opposition.  As legislators, we must ensure drink driving can never be condoned in any shape or form.  There is a very powerful vested lobby group in this country which is well able to speak for itself.  It is important we work collectively rather than divided to eliminate the dangers on our roads.  In his remarks the Minister spoke about the medical bureau of road safety.  It is critical for the equipment to technically measure blood alcohol content to be manufactured and purchased in this country in as much as is possible.  The Garda Commissioner spoke yesterday about reduced budgets and if it is possible I hope the equipment to be used for breath testing will be sourced within the country in order to provide jobs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister of State to inform the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, that we must consider the issue of drug use and people driving under the influence of drugs.  It is a problem and garda&iacute; have given anecdotal evidence.  We must embark on an education programme in our schools and among our adult population.  The Bill is welcome and I hope it will have the desired effect.  I thank the Minister of State for listening to the contributions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill and I hope it has a safe passage through the House.  We have come a long way on road safety in seven years.  I remember in 2003 when I was appointed chairman of the committee dealing with enterprise, trade and small business, which carried out an investigation on insurance.  Part of this dealt with road safety, as at the time deaths on our roads amounted to approximately 450 per year, with thousands of people maimed for life; such events were completely unacceptable.</P>
        <P>The deliberations of the committee I chaired at that time took in meetings with senior civil servants in the Departments involved with justice, transport and education, and I asked for their assistance.  There were three gentlemen who were magnificent, along with their Departments, in their contribution.  The Ministers of the day gave assistance to the committee on the interim recommendations made each year between 2004 and 2007.  We brought in representatives of insurance companies as well as others involved in the insurance industry, asking them about doing business in Ireland.  The most senior underwriter in Ireland at that time stated in evidence that Ireland was not a safe place in which to do business, which was an alarming statement we had to take at face value.  Returning to the committee within three months they said they urgently required four Bills to be passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, and the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Bertie Ahern, gave approval for that under the various Ministers in the three Departments I outlined.</P>
        <P>The Personal Injuries Assessment Board was set up and it has been of significant assistance to those who are unfortunate enough to have accidents.  It has helped to speed up claim processes.  The Civil Liability and Courts Act forces those who make a claim to give a sworn <Col N="221"/>affidavit to that effect and the penalty points system was also set up, which overnight transformed respect for the law and put fear back into it.</P>
        <P>Health and safety at work was also tackled because the construction business, which had 300,000 employed in it, did not have regulations that were strict enough.  That led to fatalities on various sites but that position has improved enormously in the intervening years.  The dedicated traffic corps of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the time amounted to 525 garda&iacute; but I am pleased to be able to report to the House that it now has a full complement of 1,250 garda&iacute; doing terrific work right across the country.  That was a recommendation from our committee.</P>
        <P>The son of one of my cousins was involved in a very serious accident three nights ago.  The victim is 19 years old and he had an operation lasting six and half hours yesterday.  He is very seriously injured because he was not wearing a seat belt at the time of his accident.  We all remember when we got our first cars and there were many hidden dangers because nobody thought an accident could occur.</P>
        <P>The committee conducted research in Tennessee, an area which has seen a successful programme to enhance respect for the law.  One idea coming from this was to link ignition of a car to the fastening of a safety belt.  From the manufacturers of cars we understand this small piece of technology only costs &euro;40, and if that is the case I strongly suggest to the Minister of State and her officials that this idea be considered in Ireland.  We were the leaders in the world in banning smoking in certain public places and with such a young population &mdash; 50% of the people are under 40 &mdash; we could encourage manufacturers to implement the idea for the sake of &euro;40.  For the life of me I do not know why insurance companies do not insist on this as it could save thousands of lives.</P>
        <P>I welcome the mandatory alcohol testing legislation.  The committee of which I was a member strongly recommended that there would be random testing for substance or drug abuse as well as alcohol abuse.  I know accidents are not planned but just happen.  All we can do as legislators is assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and everybody involved in the emergency services to try to help those who are using our roads daily to have more respect and fear for the law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Before responding I thank Senators for taking the necessary time to consider the provisions of this very important Bill.  As always this House provides an excellent forum for examining the provisions of legislation and the space to have an informed debate on all kinds of issues, including the vital provisions of road traffic legislation.</P>
        <P>The Road Traffic Bill 2011 will allow for the early introduction of mandatory preliminary breath testing for drivers who, in the opinion of garda&iacute;, have consumed alcohol or for drivers who are involved in road traffic collisions where injury is caused to another person who requires medical assistance.  As already mentioned, the latter provision will only apply where there are no overriding medical considerations in respect of the driver.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provisions contained in the Bill will cast a wider net over the circumstances in which drivers can be breathalysed but will provide a useful gauge for determining the extent of the role that alcohol plays in causing road collisions.  I should be clear that the purpose of extending these breath-testing powers is not to obtain an increased number of convictions; in fact we would expect them to become more effective as a deterrent measure, with this success being measured against decreasing detection rates.  The ultimate aim of these measures is to have a direct impact on the number of road deaths and injuries in future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first of the mandatory alcohol testing provisions were introduced by the Government in 2006.  The number of people killed on the roads since has declined and the success of mandatory provisions can be attributed in part to a robust system of detection and scientific analysis.  This <Col N="222"/>is essential to maintain the public perception that there is a real risk of being detected and prosecuted and it is an integral part of the effectiveness of the deterrent.</P>
        <P>During 2009, 529,037 breath tests were carried out under mandatory alcohol testing.  The number reflects the commitment of the Garda to get behind new initiatives and this has produced dividends.  Our achievements in recent years were recognised last year by the European Transport Safety Council with the presentation of a road safety performance index award to Ireland.  Ireland has seen a reduction of nearly 50% in road deaths since 2000.  In a European context, nearly 35,000 people were killed in road collisions in 2009.  On an annual basis, approximately 1.7 million people are recorded as injured, with 300,000 or 18% recorded as serious injuries.  Such statistics show that road deaths represent only the tip of the iceberg.  Many people suffer lifelong injuries and trauma as a result of collisions.  It is difficult to absorb these figures fully as the extent of their impact on road travel is so ingrained in our way of life that we have become complacent to its inherent dangers.  It is vital, therefore, that we keep pace with innovations in road safety and drive forward legislation that will help us reduce these dangers.  The Bill will help influence driver behaviour and send out a clear message that irresponsible choices will not be tolerated.</P>
        <P>It is illegal to drive while under the influence of drugs.  Enforcement of the law on drug driving is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When a member of the Garda suspects that a motorist is driving under the influence of any intoxicant, he or she may arrest the driver.  However, unlike alcohol, there is no legal limit for drugs.  The influence of drugs on driving behaviour is an issue of increasing concern.  Unfortunately, the process of identifying the presence of drugs is more complex than for alcohol.  The current road safety strategy provides for reviewing the legislation and appropriate enforcement options on this issue.  It also provides for the development of testing of impaired drivers based on the incidence of drink or drug driving or both.  As many Senators will be aware, the 2010 Road Traffic Act provides for such preliminary impairment testing.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety, in association with the school of medicine at University College Dublin, is responsible for the provision of this training to garda&iacute;.  It is hoped to commence such training in 2011.</P>
        <P>On roadside drug testing, there is no feasible basis to date in Ireland or Europe for the introduction of a preliminary roadside test for drugs as testing devices are still in the prototype stage.  While some progress is being made in research at European level, as yet nothing has been finalised.  We must be careful about jumping the gun on this issue.  If a device appears to be operating effectively in one region of the world, it does not automatically mean the same device will be appropriate for another region.  A number of disparate variables are involved, including climactic conditions.  If there were any doubt about the reliability of such apparatus, it could undermine the entire system in terms of prosecutions and road safety enforcement generally.  Any proposals around the development of roadside drug testing will need to have certainty embedded in the process from detection to conviction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the matters raised by Senator Burke, mandatory alcohol testing at checkpoints will continue to operate.  The provisions in the Bill are additional to those relating to such checkpoints.  The Garda consults doctors treating patients in hospital.  Legislation provides that testing for alcohol will take place within three hours of the driver being stopped or detected.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe referred to the definition of a vehicle.  Section 71 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 amends previous definitions provided for in the principal Act.  The Minister is satisfied that the definition includes an electric vehicle.  He also assures the Senator that funding is in place this year for the procurement of evidential breath testing instruments.</P><Col N="223"/>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed amendment to delete subsection (6) of section 2 will make it mandatory that a person who, in the opinion of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, has consumed intoxicating liquor to provide a preliminary breath specimen, even where such a demand may be prejudicial to the person&rsquo;s health.  The amendment also provides that where a doctor or other medical personnel attending the scene of the event where injury is caused advises that such a requirement would be prejudicial to the person&rsquo;s health, a garda may require a medical practitioner to take a sample of blood or require the person to give a sample of urine.</P>
        <P>Where a garda forms the opinion that for medical reasons a person cannot provide a preliminary breath specimen, the health of the person in question must not be jeopardised.  Examples such as acute asthma attacks, panic attacks or losing consciousness clearly illustrate circumstances where it would not be possible for a person to comply with a breath test.</P>

	<P>On a point of order, I sought clarification on whether the subsection (1) referred to in the lines proposed to be deleted by amendment No. 5<i>a</i> is the same subsection (1) referred to in subsection (3).  Is that the case?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I refer to the fact that a garda shall not ask the driver who, in the opinion of the garda, is over the limit to give a breath sample if he or she believes it would be dangerous to the driver&rsquo;s health.  Why is it necessary to provide for this?  The Bill does not state how a driver is to be tested.  According to the 2010 Act, a garda shall conduct the test, but now we have a changed situation where the garda shall test, unless it would be prejudicial to the health of the driver.  Section 2(6) suggests it is the garda who will form this opinion without the advice of a doctor.  How is a garda suitably qualified to form this opinion without the advice of a doctor?  No provision is made for the testing of a driver in a case where the use of a breathalyser would be prejudicial to his or her health.  Even if it was based on a doctor&rsquo;s opinion that a person should not be breathalysed, we must come up with a means of testing for the presence of alcohol.  Amendment No. 3<i>b</i> would provide a fallback provision where a breath test cannot be undertaken.  It would allow for an alternative method of testing for the presence of alcohol.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Ryan.  I referred to this issue in my contribution on Second Stage.  Why does section 2(6) make it clear that the provision to which Senator Ryan refers applies only to a person to whom subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) applies?  The next section applies to someone affected by subsection (1)(<i>d</i>).  What about a person who commits an offence under section 2(1)(<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>)?  If the garda suspects a person has committed an offence under section 2(1)(<i>c</i>), does the garda have discretion to decide whether he or she will test the person concerned because it may be prejudicial to his or her health?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am inclined to support Senator Ryan&rsquo;s amendment.  Section 2(7) of the Bill states: &ldquo;A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall not make a requirement ... if, in the opinion of the member ... such requirement would be prejudicial to the health of the person&rdquo;. <Col N="225"/> That puts a new obligation on the garda where he or she believes a person he or she stopped has been consuming alcohol.  Up until now, a garda has been able to say he or she is obliged to test a person, but now we are giving him or her a new responsibility.  The accused person can put pressure on the garda who will be unable to say he or she is obliged to test by law.  I understand Senator Ryan&rsquo;s point and wonder is it necessary to do what we are doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When a garda forms the opinion that, for medical reasons, a person cannot provide the preliminary breath specimen, the health of the person concerned cannot be jeopardised.  I provided the example of an acute asthma attack, a panic attack or where a person loses consciousness.  There are circumstances where it is not possible for a person to comply with a requirement to participate in a breath test.  The difference between paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) is that it is discretionary, whereas paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>d</i>) apply to someone who commits an offence such as breaking a traffic light.  When a garda forms such an opinion, a person can be arrested and a blood or urine sample can be obtained at the Garda station.  It is a matter for the person concerned to satisfy the court in any subsequent prosecution regarding the circumstances surrounding non-compliance with the requirements.  Once rebutted, a charge cannot proceed.</P>
        <P>The taking of a blood sample from or the provision of a specimen of urine by a person at the roadside is neither practical nor desirable.  The proposed amendment to section 3, to delete subsection (4), would make it mandatory for a person in hospital to either permit a designated doctor to take a specimen of blood or to provide the doctor with a specimen of urine, irrespective of the person&rsquo;s medical condition and consequential ability to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provisions in sections 2(6) and 3(4) are included to protect the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the person on whom the requirement is imposed.  I, therefore, ask the Senators to withdraw their proposed amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has not dealt with the point raised.  She has the response of the Minister for Transport.  Is a garda qualified to decide that giving a breath sample would be prejudicial to the health of an individual?  Where is the evidence to suggest this is the case?  It will be open to a garda to form an opinion based on mood.  If he or she considers providing a breath sample would be prejudicial to the health of an individual, can the person concerned be arrested?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The garda must form the opinion that, for medical reasons, the person cannot provide a breath specimen.  Where the person concerned has committed an offence under paragraph (<i>a</i>) or (<i>d</i>)&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The garda must assume an offence has taken place and that there is a reason to breathalyse the individual concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>If the person concerned has broken traffic lights, the garda might suspect he or she is under the influence of alcohol.  This can be contrasted with the discretionary on-the-spot breath test carried out by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on people randomly selected.  If a garda considers a person cannot provide a breath specimen for medical reasons, the person concerned can be arrested and taken to give a blood or urine sample.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>If a person has had an asthma attack, it would be prejudicial to his or her health to carry out a breath test.  At that point, a garda can take the person concerned to a doctor or hospital to have a sample of blood or urine provided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is nothing specified in the section about an incident such as a person having an asthmatic attack.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>A garda would surely be able to have an opinion as to whether a person was genuinely having a health issue.  Would a garda not be able to make a call on whether a person was having a health issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason we tabled this amendment is that we do not believe a garda is competent to make that call in all cases.</P>

	<P>A garda could bring the person to a doctor or a hospital.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, to delete lines 43 to 46 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall, upon making a requirement under this section, inform the person of whom the requirement is made, in clear language, that if he or she fails to comply with the requirement he or she shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The Minister made the point in his Second Stage speech that this section was about influencing behaviour and ensuring people know what is expected of them.  This is new legislation and the purpose of this amendment is clarify the position.  If a collision occurs and a garda issues a direction to the person involved to do something for him or her, does the garda need to make clear that if the person does not obey he or she will be breaking the law and the garda has the ability to sanction the person?  If I compare the language in the Bill to the legislation dealing with public order and the regulation of begging that is going through the D&aacute;il, a garda who asks a person to move on must make it clear that if the person does not do so, the person will be breaking the law and liable to sanction.  I am not sure in this legislation whether a garda is required to make it clear to a person who has been involved in a collision or an event on the road that if they do not do what is asked of him or her, the person will be breaking the law and, therefore, subject to arrest or sanction by the garda.  The objective of this amendment is that a garda would be compelled to tell a person involved in the collision that if he or she does not do what is required of him or her, the person will be breaking the law and therefore subject to sanction under the law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The Office of the Attorney General included the provision at sections 2(10) and 3(9) specifically to address possible challenges and prosecutions for an offence, for example, under sections 49(1) and 50(1) of the principal Act where the requirement to provide a preliminary breath specimen is not required.  Those particular sections provide for the offences of driving or attempting to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place or being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place with intent to drive or attempt to drive the vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle.  In such circumstances an intoxicant includes alcohol, drugs and any combination of drugs or of drugs and alcohol.</P>
        <P>Subsections (10) and (9) of sections 2 and 3, respectively, clearly provide that in such proceedings it will not be a defence to show that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not make a requirement in regard to a preliminary breath specimen.  The Minister does not propose to delete the provision.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, sections 2(3) and 3(2) provide for the offence of refusal or failure to provide a preliminary breath specimen and where such an offence has taken place, needless to say the person is advised accordingly of having done so by the member.</P>
        <P>Deleting the wording suggested by the Senator&rsquo;s amendment would weaken considerably the provisions of the Bill.  The substitute wording proposed addresses a different issue, that of the garda informing the person of the offence.  To provide in legislation as to how that information is conveyed to the accused not only unnecessary but could also have significant consequences <Col N="228"/>for many other provisions in the Road Traffic Acts.  I therefore ask the Senator to withdraw the proposed amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is the latter part of the Minister of State&rsquo;s response that is of interest to me.  I will give an example to illustrate the point I want to make and the Minister of State can help me understand how this would work.  When a garda performs an alcohol test on a person involved in a collision or suspected of having consumed intoxicating liquor, will the garda make it clear to the person that if he or she does not perform the test, he or she will be breaking the law?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I had a breath test quite recently and a garda does that as a matter of course and that will continue to be done.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">To restate what the Minister of State said, when a garda asks a person to perform that test, the garda will tell the person that if he or she does not perform it, he or she will be breaking the law and that will be an offence.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The section provides for the insertion of a new section 12 in the principal Act and sets out criteria in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>d</i>), inclusive, to be met for the Bill to apply to a person.  Is a person required to meet all the criteria set out in those paragraphs for the Bill to apply to him or her or can the person be required to meet only one of the criteria?  Paragraph (<i>c</i>) states &ldquo;is or has been, with the vehicle, involved in a collision&rdquo;.  That would appear to be quite a generous definition that would allow a garda to ensure almost anyone who has been involved in a collision would be subject to the powers of this Bill.  Is a person required to meet all criteria in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>d</i>), inclusive, to be subject to the powers of this Bill or is he or she required to meet only one of the criteria?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>A person would have to meet any one of the four.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Any one of the four.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the wording of the Bill makes it clear that a person is required to meet only one of those four criteria?  That is a question for her to consider before the Bill moves forward.  I have seen it laid out in other legislation that a person is required to meet only one of the criteria set out.  If the Government is satisfied with the wording as set out that the section is not open to challenge, that is fine, but I thought this was a question worth raising.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I understand Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s point.  He asks if a person must meet all four criteria.  The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; occurs after paragraph (<i>c</i>) but does not occur after paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).  Section 2 refers to a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and who in the opinion of the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &ldquo;(<i>a</i>) has <Col N="229"/>consumed intoxicating liquor, (<i>b</i>) is committing or has committed an offence under the <i>Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2011, </i>(<i>c</i>) is or has been, with the vehicle, involved in a collision, or&rdquo;.  It seems it would solve the problem if the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; was inserted after paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).  It may not be needed but it would address Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a grammatical issue and we are satisfied that it is covered and that paragraph (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) or (<i>d</i>) means paragraph (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>) or (<i>d</i>).</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not satisfied.  Senator Donohoe has a point.  It could be argued that someone would have to do at least three of the four.  Perhaps my grammar is lacking.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When we did the original Bill, we were told that every section would be challenged in the future because of the regularity of challenges to such legislation in the courts.  These are not just points of grammar.  We want to ensure the Bill is as robust as possible.  Senator Quinn has picked up on an important point, namely, the presence of the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; in paragraph (<i>c</i>).  If the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is required in paragraph (<i>c</i>), why is it not required in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>)?  It would give the Bill full applicability to anyone who might be involved in a collision.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Could we have an amendment on Report Stage to insert the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; after paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>)?  That would solve my problem and that of Senator Donohoe.</P>

	<P Just="Left">With respect, there is a difference between going into a restaurant and ordering a cup of tea and putting together legislation that will be challenged.  This is an eminently fair point and the Minister of State&rsquo;s response that she is satisfied is not good enough.  The question still stands.  If the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is present in paragraph (<i>c</i>), why is it not present in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>)?</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>

We will table an amendment on Report Stage to insert the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; after paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) and then I will be satisfied that no one will challenge the legislation on that basis.</P>

On Report Stage, each amendment must be seconded.  Amendment No. 1, in the names of Senators Quinn and Donohoe, arises from Committee proceedings.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related and may be discussed together, by agreement.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, line 15, after &ldquo;liquor,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Someone other than the Minister for Transport was present when Senator Donohoe pointed out how every Road Traffic Act was challenged.  It seems to be challenged whenever someone can find a tiny loophole in it.  As drafted, section 2 sounds grammatically correct.  It reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">This section applies to a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place who, in the opinion of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na--</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) has consumed intoxicating liquor,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) is committing or has committed an offence under the <i>Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2011</i>,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) is or has been, with the vehicle, involved in a collision, or</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is essential to include the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; after paragraph (<i>b</i>), although I am unsure about whether it should be inserted after paragraph (<i>a</i>).  If it must be included once, it should be included after paragraph (<i>b</i>).  I will listen to the argument about whether it is needed after paragraph <Col N="231"/>(<i>a</i>).  I am convinced the provision included in this section will be challenged.  I do not want someone to claim he or she did not commit all four acts and, therefore, is not guilty.  It is essential that the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is included after paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) to make the provision foolproof, tight, robust and enforceable, which the Minister is anxious should be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I welcome the Minister back to the House and thank Senator Quinn for his proposal regarding the point we raised on Committee Stage.  The House had time to examine the Road Traffic Bill 2009 during the adjournment, in particular, the definition applied to the number of events in which a garda should become involved and the format of section 8.  At one stage it read:</P>
        <P LI="1">is of opinion that a person in charge of a vehicle in a public place--</P>
        <P LI="2">(i) has consumed intoxicating liquor,</P>
        <P LI="2">(ii) is or has been, with the vehicle, involved in a collision, or</P>
        <P LI="2">(iii) is committing or has committed an offence under the <i>Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2009</i>,</P>
        <P LI="1">the member may require,</P>
        <P LI="1">or</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the definition of &ldquo;incident&rdquo; used in previous road traffic legislation the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; was not included after &ldquo;intoxicating liquor&rdquo;.  In subsequent sections, however, it was used.  We asked a question during the Minister&rsquo;s absence.  If the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is required in paragraph (<i>c</i>) of this amending Bill, why is it not required also in paragraph (<i>b</i>)?  As Senator Quinn stated, we are conscious that the Bill will be challenged.  I do not see how accepting the amendment would hurt it,  rather it could strengthen it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their contributions and I apologise for having to leave to attend a Government meeting.  </P>
        <P>On the proposed amendments, while I accept the Senators&rsquo; intent, they are misinterpreting the wording on the absence of the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;.  While I fully accept their bona fides in trying to ensure the legislation is as watertight as possible, the section is worded to do exactly that.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Donohoe referred to the 2009 Bill which became the 2010 Act.  He may recall, given all of the permutations and combinations used, that I stated I regarded the construction of the section as inelegant.  I offer due apologies to my civil servants and the officials in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  It was for this reason that we did not need to await the reduction in alcohol levels when we tried to ensure testing would take place.  We took the opportunity to re-examine the section.  When the Attorney General&rsquo;s office had a second opportunity to consider it, it insisted that our format was correct.  That format is reflected across a range of legislation.  The Attorney General&rsquo;s office insisted that, were we to make the changes suggested by the Senators, it could have a significant impact on the layout of other choices in other legislation.  I warned against the making of such changes.</P>
        <P>The subsection should be read in conjunction with subsection (2) which makes a distinction.  It reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall, unless he or she is of opinion that the person should be arrested, and subject to subsections (6) and (7), require a person to whom paragraph (<i>a</i>) or (<i>d</i>) of subsection (1) applies, and may require a person to whom paragraph (<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>) of that subsection applies&mdash;&mdash;</P><Col N="232"/>
        <P FLI="0">The garda&rsquo;s first option is to arrest a person.</P>
      
        <P>This clearly indicates that the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is not necessary.  There are four circumstances in which a garda can take action.  The concern of the Senators has been met in the section.  I have received very strong advice that this is the proper and safest way to do it.  It will prevent the creation of loopholes in the legislation.  For that reason, I commend the section, as it stands, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have great difficulty with what the Minister has said.  He is correct in one respect, as I do not think there is a need for the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;liquor&rdquo; in subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) which includes the words &ldquo;has consumed intoxicating liquor&rdquo;.  However, I do think there is a need for the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; after subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) which includes the words &ldquo;is committing or has committed an offence&rdquo;.  If I were a lawyer, I would make the defence that my client had not done the other three things listed.  The client may have consumed liquor but only did one of the other things listed in paragraphs (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>).  I do not understand how it can be regarded that the subsection is strengthened by the removal of the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;.  While I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point about removing it after paragraph (<i>a</i>), there is a definite need to include it after paragraph (<i>b</i>).  The subsection reads as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) is committing or has committed an offence under the <i>Road Traffic Acts 1961 to2011</i>,</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>c</i>) is or has been, with the vehicle, involved in a collision, or</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>d</i>) is or has been, with the vehicle...</P>
        <P FLI="0">I do not see how the Bill is strengthened in not having the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;; the opposite is the case.  The Bill will be challenged the first time someone is charged and a clever lawyer will find a loophole.  I do not understand how the Bill would be weakened by inserting the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; after paragraph (<i>b</i>).  I know the Minister wants to ensure the legislation will not fail to do what is intended, but it is essential that the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is used after paragraph (<i>b</i>), whatever about after subsection (<i>a</i>).</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P><Col N="234"/>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, to delete lines 28 to 32.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Amendment No. 3 proposes to delete section 2(6).  I will go through to the subsection to explain my position and that of others on this matter.  Section 2(6) states: &ldquo;A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall not make a requirement under subsection (2) of a person to whom paragraph (<i>a</i>) of subsection (1) [Subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) states: &ldquo;in the opinion of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ... has consumed intoxicating liquor&rdquo;, and subsection (2) contains three methods by which that can be verified.] applies if, in the opinion of the member, such requirement would be prejudicial to the health of the person.&rdquo;  We are dealing with a situation where the garda is of the opinion that the driver has consumed alcohol but because of some medical issue, he or she cannot request that it be verified by means of a breathalyser test.  What happens next?  It seems there is nowhere to go.  A garda forms an opinion that alcohol has been consumed but is he or she qualified to form an opinion about the health of the person and the implications of providing a breath sample?  On that basis, there is a strong case to delete this subsection.  If a person is drunk and a breathalyser is not available, there is no provision for any alternative verification method.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Amendment No. 4 provides for an alternative method of verification.  It states: &ldquo;Where a requirement is not made by virtue of subsection (6) or (7), the member may require&rdquo;.  I could have made it stronger by stating &ldquo;shall require&rdquo;.  There must be some other method to verify whether a person is drunk.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Ryan said.  He explained it very well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">What Senator Ryan requires is in the legislation.  It is difficult when looking at such legislation to tie all the bits together.  The amendment proposes to delete section 2(6) to make it mandatory that a person who, in the opinion of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, has consumed intoxicating liquor provides a preliminary breath specimen even where such a demand may be prejudicial to the person&rsquo;s health.  There is a bigger danger there of a court letting a person off if he or she is able to prove it was prejudicial to his or her health and the garda forced him or her to take a breath test.</P>
        <P>It is not true to say there is no alternative to the breathalyser test which the Senator wants to make mandatory in all circumstances even if a person is writhing around on the ground as a result of an epileptic fit, an asthma attack or something else.  The garda can arrest the person and bring him or her to the Garda station.  When he or she recovers, he or she can be breath tested or a urine sample can be taken.  If the person is in obvious distress, the Garda can call an ambulance, bring the person to a hospital and ensure that medical personnel look after him or her and take a blood or urine sample.</P>
        <P>The procedure is that a garda forms the opinion that, for medical reasons, a person cannot provide a preliminary breath specimen.  I would be happier if that was not in the legislation.  I concede that it places an onus on the garda to form an opinion of some kind.  He or she will not automatically do that.  The person will probably insinuate that he or she is not well or whatever.  However, one cannot put a garda in a position where he or she ignores the possibility that a person is genuinely distressed, ill or whatever.</P>
        <P>There is a safeguard in this section for the garda and, ultimately, for the State.  If a garda disregards a person who is in distress, is ill or whatever or has no discretion in that regard, it <Col N="235"/>would leave the State and the garda open to litigation if anything happened to the person subsequently.</P>
        <P>There are also safeguards for the driver.  Where a garda forms an opinion that the person is intoxicated, he or she can be arrested and a blood or urine sample can be obtained at the Garda station.  It will be a matter for the courts to decide in any subsequent prosecution about non-compliance with the requirement to use the breathalyser.  Once it is rebutted, a charge for refusal cannot proceed but the onus is on the driver to prove that.</P>
        <P>The taking of a blood sample or the provision of a urine sample by a person at the roadside is not practicable and certainly is not desirable.  People know my views on those who drink and drive, but a person&rsquo;s dignity needs to be upheld.  It is not desirable to have legislation which requires a person to give a urine sample at the side of the road.  The amendment to delete section 3(4) would make it mandatory for a person in hospital to either permit a designated doctor to take a specimen of blood or to provide the doctor with a specimen of his or her urine, irrespective of his or her medical condition and consequential ability to do so.  The provisions in sections 2(6) and 3(4) are designed to protect not only the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also the person on whom the obligations and requirements are being imposed.</P>
        <P>I hope I have clarified for the Senators that this is a reasonable and proportionate approach to take to do what we want to do.  I commend it to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Subsection (2) reads: &ldquo;A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall, unless he or she is of opinion that the person should be arrested,&rdquo; which indicates another opinion that the person concerned should be arrested.  Subsection (4) reads: &ldquo;A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may arrest without warrant a person who in the member&rsquo;s opinion is committing or has committed an offence under this section&rdquo;.  I do not necessarily regard amendments Nos. 3 and 4 as the be-all and end-all, but I hope I have clarified the reason people are concerned that the Bill, as it stands, could give individuals the opportunity to get off the hook.  Obviously, the Minister takes issue with amendment No. 4 on the basis that it suggests it might be done at the side of the road.  Before the Bill is taken in the D&aacute;il he might be in a position to take on board the issues we are trying to address.  It might be possible to come up with an amendment similar to amendment No. 4 which would provide an alternative if, for some reason, the breathalyser cannot be used.  If the Minister was willing to consider what might be possible in that vein, I would be happy enough.</P>

While I am not promising anything, in the light of the contribution he and other Senators have made on the matter, I undertake to reconsider the matter before the Bill is taken in the other House to ascertain if it can be copper-fastened.  We have had extensive discussions with the Garda on the matter during which we were specifically asked to give consideration to the need to safeguard the garda&iacute; on the spot also.  We will look at it closely to ascertain if there is anything further we can do.</P>

The Minister has been very successful in recent years in reducing the number of road deaths and this is another step in that direction, for which I congratulate him.

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann welcomes the Government&rsquo;s initiatives to support export led growth.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  The key message that should be sent from this House is that, according to the Irish Exporters Association Year End Review 2010 issued on 5 January 2011, in 2010 exports reached their highest level ever at &euro;161 billion.  This is especially encouraging in the wake of figures released by IDA Ireland that show that Ireland continues to attract significant inward investment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These statistics, combined with other economic indicators such as car sales, etc. provide hard proof that our policies are working and the real economy, which is based on the business environment, is forging ahead.  The extremely difficult economic climate both in this country and abroad during the past three years has led to difficult trading conditions for many firms and to significant job losses.  After two years of significant falling output it is now clear that growth returned during the latter part of last year.  The strength of the corporate sector is reflected also in the performance of corporation tax receipts in 2010 which were marginally up on the 2009 level and almost one quarter greater than expected.</P><Col N="237"/>
        <P Just="Left">Although employment remains stubbornly high, the economy shows signs of a return to growth and the Government&rsquo;s four year plan is the only credible roadmap for economic recovery.  The Exchequer returns, a high level of foreign direct investment and improving competitiveness are helping Ireland to create high quality jobs and return to sustainable growth.  While it is vital and right that our focus is on job creation, recent strong export performance is very encouraging as it provides the bedrock upon which future employment growth will be based.  To capitalise on this, the Government launched a strategy for trade, tourism and investment, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy.  The new trade strategy identifies wider systemic challenges around our cost competitiveness and our information technology infrastructure which are being addressed in order that we will be in a position to capitalise on the opportunities that will present themselves as the global economy recovers.  This provides the framework to maximise the potential for increased exports, tourism and investment that can support well-paying jobs in this country.</P>
        <P>Clearly, economic growth is essential if we are to have real improvements in living standards and increase employment again.  In this regard, growth will be achieved through an export led recovery driven initially by the main capital intensive manufacturing side but also by the more labour intensive services sector.  As exports grow, domestic activity will gradually expand.  The Government has been actively attempting to improve the business environment in Ireland and foster development of new and existing companies.  Labour cost competitiveness has been improved as a result of the demonstration effect of the public service wage bill, the air travel tax being cut, the reinforcement of the commitment to retaining the 12.5% corporation tax and the revamping of the business expansion scheme.</P>
        <P>As a result of our policies our export performance in recent years has shown considerable resilience.  Encouragingly, exports in the third quarter of 2010 increased, by 12.9% for goods and by 13.6% for services.  Food and drink exports expanded by 11% in 2010, exemplifying the broad nature of the recovery.  This recovery is not confined to the multinational sector but has also occurred within the indigenous exporting sector.  Exports to our traditionally strong markets such as the United Kingdom and the United States continue to be strong but, encouragingly, exports to new high growth markets such as India and China are also up and those to Brazil and Russia have increased by 12%.  Exports to north America were particularly strong, with sales to our largest market, the USA, up by 18% in the year and sales to Canada up by 27%.  Germany, the largest of the EU markets, provided a much needed boost to eurozone exports with Irish exports to that country increasing by 42%.  This is all very welcome news.</P>
        <P>Indicators of activity, such as the quarterly national accounts and national household survey and soft data from sources such as purchasing managers&rsquo; indices, show that economic growth patterns are in line with those contained in the budget.  These indicators mean that economic growth is expected to be 1.7% of GDP in 2011.  Last year the value of Irish exports reached &euro;161 billion, the highest figure ever recorded for exports.  Approximately three quarters of these exports were from the multinational sector, which is significant when one considers that IDA Ireland associated firms created almost 11,000 direct new jobs last year, considerably more than twice the number of jobs generated in 2009.  As set out in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, exports will be a key driver of economic growth over this period.  Accordingly, the improvement in price competitiveness will provide crucial support to sustain economic recovery and job creation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The agrifood sector grew by 8% and is expected to grow by as much again in 2011.  The growth in this sector was due to global demand, improved commodity prices and changes in EU policy on agricultural output.  The life sciences sector, which includes products such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, currently accounts for 63% of total Irish merchandise exports and grew by 12% in 2010.  It is expected that this sector will continue to grow <Col N="238"/>in 2011 but perhaps at a more moderate rate.  Although world trade growth is expected to slow this year, the Irish Exporters Association, IEA, is still projecting total Irish exports to increase by 7.2% in 2011 to a new high of &euro;172.6 billion owing to a weaker euro against sterling and the dollar.  Exports of goods will grow by 5% in 2011 with services forecast to grow by 10%, giving an overall growth forecast for 2011.  Those IEA figures were issued in early January.</P>
        <P>Food and drink exports increased last year by 11%, or &euro;800 million, reaching &euro;7.9 billion according to a Bord Bia report published on 13 January 2011.  Bord Bia states the sector was a major contributor to the economy&rsquo;s strong export performance in 2010 and that this performance was helped by a more stable consumer environment, reduced exchange rate pressures, improved competitiveness and rising global prices for most agricultural commodities.  This will continue to be the case.  I have information, which I do not believe can be contradicted, that at present there are only 26 days&rsquo; food supply in the European Union.  There is tremendous room for this country to produce and export agriculture products.  We have the very best people in this country at this time, producing high quality ingredients such as meat, milk and dairy products.  One can name any product and the farming community and the co-operatives and other parts of the industry will be up to speed with it.  All the major sectors recorded increases.  Dairy exports jumped by more than &euro;300 billion, a leap of 17%.  The meat and livestock exports were almost &euro;200 million higher and beverage and prepared food exports were also up significantly.  Overall prospects for this year remain positive and a survey of manufacturers shows an agreed optimism.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other important economic indicator for our growth and exports comes from IDA Ireland which has stated that Ireland is number one in the world for jobs created.  Figures released by IDA Ireland show that almost 11,000 new jobs were created in 2010, more than double the number created in 2009.  Last year the car scrappage scheme was reintroduced in January and provided a major boost for the motor industry, far exceeding expectations.  New car sales in 2010 jumped by 55% to 88,373, according to the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI.  The increase in sales last year delivered an extra &euro;109 million in Government revenue and an increase of 3,500 people employed in the industry.  The scrappage scheme has been retained and I have little doubt that these benefits will be sustained.</P>
        <P>When I began I stated that the unemployment figure is still too high, although it is stabilising.  Senator Buttimer is smiling and although the live register increased in December, this was due to seasonal factors.  The figure is still 30,000 lower than in August 2010.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the motion and cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I will continue the theme started by my friend and colleague about good news in the economy.  Before it is dismissed as being of little relevance, those of us who have had the opportunity of travelling abroad or of reading international comment about Ireland in the past 12 months could not help being aware that all the comments coming from this country, from politics or other areas of Irish society, are picked up by international investors and those who see the <Col N="239"/>country as a possible area of investment.  Perhaps they have been influenced, sadly, in a negative way.</P>
        <P>The current edition of <i>Tourism Matters</i>, produced by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, has comments from Shaun Quinn, its chief executive, in a wide-ranging review of the year and hopes for the coming year.  He indicates that there is understandable apprehension about the season ahead, given:</P>
        <P LI="1">[T]he continuing flow of negative economic comment, as well as the pressures now confronting our own economy.  Yet there are straws of recovery in the wind which offer the prospect of the beginnings of a turnaround in our fortunes.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">To continue in that vein, I suggest that this debate affords us an opportunity to speak about good news involving the economy.  The message that has predominated, particularly in the political arena, is one of negativity and a certain cynicism about the country and its prospects for recovery, which are not helpful.  I appreciate that political charge and counter-charge is the meat and drink of politics but in the past 12 months it has gone way beyond what might be termed, in legal parlance, fair comment in order to get a headlong rush for parties opposite to get into government.</P>
        <P>For example, Deputy Joan Burton used the word &ldquo;banjaxed&rdquo; on one occasion in reference to the country, which I found offensive coming from someone for whom I have a great deal of respect and who has a long history and tradition of positive political debate in this country.  She will more than likely be a senior member of the incoming Government.  I would venture to suggest that when she does take her position in the Government, I doubt we will hear the word &ldquo;banjaxed&rdquo; coming from her at any stage.  Whereas we face domestic difficulties caused by reduced consumer demand and the fall-out from the property sector, the export economy is performing at its highest ever level, with output at &euro;161 billion.  It has been suggested that the figure could go even higher in 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The success of the multinational sector is well known but I would like to focus on the indigenous agrifood sector.  This has become a key driver of the export expansion, especially during the final quarter of last year.  This sector of the economy, which was regarded as a sunset industry by certain quarters a few years ago, is now a real driver of our recovery.  There were clear signs throughout the year that the manufacturing and agrifood industries were repositioning themselves by shedding costs and moving up the value chain, exploiting renewed growth in global markets.  The agrifood sector grew by 8% and is expected to grow by as much again into 2011.  The growth in this sector is due to global demand, improved commodity prices and changes in the EU policy on agricultural output incentives.  The Irish Farmers Association, in a statement earlier today, indicated that farm incomes had shown a significant increase in the past 12 months, which all sides of the House would welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There were clear signs throughout the year that manufacturing and agrifood sectors were repositioning themselves.  The life sciences sector, which includes products such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, currently accounts for 63% of total Irish merchandise exports and it grew by 12% in 2010.  It is expected that this sector will continue to grow as the growth has been phenomenal in recent years, especially since the financial tsunami of 2008.</P>
        <P>Whereas world trade growth is expected to slow this year, the Irish Exporters Association is still projecting total Irish exports will increase by 7.2% this year, due to a weaker euro against sterling and the dollar, to a new high of &euro;172.6 billion, which is an extraordinary sum of money in the current international environment.  I suggest that this indicates a growth in the global economy which I hope can be fostered and encouraged, especially by the larger markets of the United States and the eurozone led by Germany.</P><Col N="240"/>
        <P>There are some pertinent statistics in the foreign direct investment area.  We are number one in the world for jobs created by foreign direct investment and figures released by IDA Ireland show that almost 11,000 new jobs were created in 2010, more than double the number created in 2009.  I know that on the negative side some 9,000 jobs were lost in the sector, although we emerged from the year in positive numbers.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The message that should be conveyed from this Parliament and from the country in general to the international community is that Ireland is ranked ninth from 183 countries in the world by the World Bank in terms of ease of doing business.  The 2008 to 2012 business environment ranking of the Economist Intelligence Unit placed Ireland 11th of 82 countries globally.  The 2010 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Ireland fourth for the availability of skilled labour and sixth for labour productivity.  It is no wonder that international companies are increasingly looking to Ireland as a location for their business.  Not only do we have a fine location on the periphery of Europe as part of the European Union, we also have a highly skilled workforce.  A figure that astonished me indicated that in people aged 18 to 30, the percentage of those with third level education in this country was almost 45%, or double the European average.  It is no wonder that Ireland is seen as an attractive location for foreign direct investment.</P>
        <P>The recovery in Irish manufacturing has finally started to translate into jobs and I refer the House to a paragraph in the national recovery plan published before Christmas.  It pointed out that from 1994 to 2000, we were an export-led economy.  That was before property bubbles, tax incentives or anything of that nature after 2000.  In that period the country demonstrated an increase in population and employment which was export led.  It suggests that a successful model from that period can be harnessed, although I readily acknowledge that two separate Administrations delivered on that success.  The Government has pointed out that we can repeat that performance with an export-led recovery.</P>
        <P>A trickle-down effect ranging from 12 to 18 months, according to economists, can be seen from the point of improved export figures to the creation of jobs.  It looks almost certain that from this year on, there will be a gradual decrease in unemployment figures.  As Senator Carty has pointed out, there was a decrease of 30,000 people on the live register between August and December, with an unfortunate blip in December.</P>
      
        <P>I hope momentum will pick up again in January.</P>
        <P>One figure constantly bandied about is that 450,000 people are unemployed.  I understand the number unemployed is closer to 288,000.  The gap between the two figures is accounted for by a large number of people who are involved in a variety of Government initiatives, working part-time or receiving payments or subsidies of one type or another.  Notwithstanding this, it is not acceptable that we have unemployment.  This is the issue with which the Government&rsquo;s motion is concerned.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />condemns the Government for creating an uncompetitive economy which has fallen from 5th in the world in 2000 to 29th this year in the Global Competitiveness Report; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />condemns the Government for failing to tackle high costs in areas such as energy and waste and for failing to open up to competition sheltered high cost areas such as the legal and transport sectors.</P><Col N="241"/>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  It would be churlish of me not to acknowledge the improvement in exports and the balance of trade in the past 12 months.  The purpose of the amendment is to place recent improvements in exports in the context of the larger economy.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senator Mooney that it is important to have debates on good news items and we had several such debates with the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, before Christmas.  However, it is also important to be realistic.  Figures for the rest of the economy are, to say the least, depressing, specifically those which show a disimprovement in competitiveness in recent years.</P>
        <P>I note with interest Senator Carty&rsquo;s comments on the car scrappage scheme.  While I support the scheme, given that Ireland does not manufacture cars, the more vehicles bought here, the greater will be the disimprovement in the balance of trade.  Any increase in car sales may be good for Swedish, German and French companies, but it does not have much impact on the economy, other than on those employed to sell cars.</P>
        <P>During the debates on employment before Christmas I recalled a discussion with the Minister for Finance, the other Deputy Lenihan, in which he had referred to a decrease of 30,000 in the number unemployed.  When I challenged the Minister on this figure, he responded with a wry smile, the reason being that the decrease reflected the large number who had left the country.  The single, greatest indictment of Fianna F&aacute;il in government is that people are being forced to leave the country again for economic reasons.  Politics has failed in the sense that another generation is leaving our shores not willingly but because they must do so to make a living.  For this reason, Senators on the Government side should stop trotting out the figure that the number unemployed has decreased by 30,000.  Reading through my list of contacts on my mobile telephone before Christmas, I was shocked by the number of those among them aged between 18 and 30 years who had left the country in the past 12 months.  When one meets the parents of those who have emigrated, they are, correctly, angry and upset.  They do not take comfort from the knowledge that the number on the live register has declined by 30,000 in the past 12 months.</P>
        <P>The disimprovement in competitiveness reflects a number of developments in the economy in recent years.  Senator Mooney is correct that the Celtic tiger had two distinct phases.  The first lasted from 1994 to 2001-02, a period when the economy was largely export-led and a large number of foreign companies invested here and created substantial and sustainable employment.  The second phase was the period following 2002 when economic growth was largely based on construction.  As a result of buoyant Exchequer figures, the Government lost sight of the importance of exports to the economy.</P>
        <P>Costs in certain areas of the economy have declined in the past two years.  Pay costs, for instance, a major contributor to competitiveness, have declined in both the public and private sectors.  Productivity, another important contributory to competitiveness, remains strong.</P>
        <P>Education is another major factor in competitiveness.  A recent OECD report on education showing a collapse in standards in science and mathematics was buried in other events over the Christmas period.  According to the report, Ireland&rsquo;s position in terms of qualifications and standards of teaching in science and mathematics has plummeted in a short period.  As a teacher of maths and science in a previous life, I have a particular interest in these subjects.  If the smart economy and innovation are to mean anything, we must ensure educational standards improve.  This will be difficult to achieve, given that resources will continue to be scarce for some years to come.  That does not mean, however, that standards of teaching and learning cannot be improved.  The next Minister for Education and Skills will have to tackle this issue head on.</P><Col N="242"/>
        <P>Innovation and entrepreneurship are also important to competitiveness.  Ireland has always had a significant number of entrepreneurs who have produced ideas in which they have been able to invest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Infrastructure is another key aspect of competitiveness.  I have acknowledged on a number of occasions that the lasting legacy of the Celtic tiger is the national primary road network which is second to none.  Other than roads, however, our infrastructure remains sadly lacking in a number of areas.  Broadband availability, for instance, is still a problem in my area, as well as others.  During the previous election campaign I heard more complaints on the doorstep about broadband than about any other issue, apart from the health service.  Broadband coverage has not improved significantly in counties Kilkenny, Carlow and other areas in the intervening period.  It was a major mistake to privatise the network when Eircom was privatised.  In so doing we gave away some of our capability to deliver a national broadband infrastructure.  Significant investment is required.</P>
        <P>Tax and regulation are also significant contributors to competitiveness.  President Sarkozy and others, including some of our friends in Britain, recently attacked the Irish corporation tax rate.  I share the Government&rsquo;s view on the importance of maintaining the current rate.  My party recently introduced a Private Members&rsquo; motion in the other House focusing on the need to maintain the rate at its current level.</P>
        <P>Regulation is also a significant issue.  While under-regulation of the banking sector has created major difficulties, certain economic sectors, including agriculture, are over-regulated.  The Government has given a commitment to remove some of the needless regulations in this sector.</P>
        <P>Not many people outside the House share Senator Carty&rsquo;s view that the Government&rsquo;s policies are clearly working.  Nevertheless, I concur with the Senator on the potential of the agriculture sector and the increasing contribution it has made to the economy in the past 12 months.  It is for this reason that I have significant problems with the Climate Change Response Bill, as currently worded.  It would be a disaster if we were to jeopardise the potential of the agriculture sector.  While climate change legislation is necessary and I do not deny climate change is taking place, the Bill sets unrealistically high targets.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.</P>
        <P>This is a timely and welcome debate.  The Senators opposite are acting in a delusional manner in congratulating the Government.  At a time when so many are unemployed or emigrating and so many businesses are closing down all we have from the Government is navel-gazing and an inability to govern.</P>
        <P>Ireland faces challenges and opportunities.  A myriad of issues confront people in indigenous business and the export market.  Senator Phelan is correct in suggesting we must help to create employment and jobs, to restore our competitiveness and to return our global trading level to where it was.  More importantly, we must provide jobs to the people at home.  That is what people want.  The next generation of employers and workers look to legislators like us for inspiration and policy.  We must tackle the cost agenda, restore confidence in the business world and force the banks, of which we are proud owners, to lend, to allow liquidity to flow and to allow people in agricultural and small and medium-sized enterprises to have capital.  This is not happening in the banks at the moment yet last week the Bank of Ireland awarded bonuses.  The Minister for Finance must set up an investigation.  We have public interest directors and we are the owners of the banks, with the Minister for Finance in charge.</P><Col N="243"/>
        <P>As Senators Carty, Mooney and Phelan said, we must broaden our export base and open new frontiers.  We must move away from the Americas and go to the Far East.  Cork is twinned with Shanghai and this is bringing people to the city.  It brings much-needed income and people to University College Cork, where there is a thriving international relationship.  We must seek new opportunities and be open to new ideas while rewarding, enticing and attracting.  This Government has adopted the wrong approach.  It has abandoned examining the OECD report on education, to which Senator Phelan referred.  The mantra from Government is about the smart economy.  We hear great lines about adding points to maths and science in exams but we need action.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney cited figures and tables on trade.  We are behind Malaysia, Qatar and other countries in other tables.  Why have we lost our place in the economic competitiveness table?  Senator Mooney referred to the period 1994 to 2000.  How did it happen that those sitting around the Cabinet table could take their eyes off the ball so that we are now the poor relation of Europe?  Last week President Sarkozy made a mockery of us.  This week, in this House I made the point that he should stay away from telling us what to do in this country.  We look after ourselves and our rate of corporation tax is very important.  However, we need a Government that will lead but we do not have that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all recognise the central role exports will play in the recovery of the economy.  I agree with Senator Mooney that, while we may be down and in trouble, we are not banjaxed.  We have great people, an intelligent workforce and a well educated group of people who want to work.  I hope they will come back when we have a change of Government.  We are not banjaxed.  We will not come back to the days of the Celtic tiger but perhaps we should not have aspired to be like that.  We lost many of our values as a society.  In the context of the motion, the Climate Change Response Bill raises questions about where we trade and how we do business.  The food and drink exporters came out against the Climate Change Response Bill that the Government is so keen to pass before it leaves office.  I do not know if the Government has a date to leave office.  There is a commitment to a 50% increase above the existing carbon reduction target.  These targets have been committed in Europe under the EU reduction plan.</P>
        <P>Considering the international market, Fianna F&aacute;il is very quick to blame international events for where we are.  However, the party fails to mention the international situation as a key component of Ireland&rsquo;s export increases.  Without being negative, the euro is weak relative to sterling and the dollar.  This has an important role in allowing our exports to rise.  It is not just Government policy that causes exports to increase.  Due to domestic factors, the Irish Exporters Association, IEA, states that the growth projection of 7.2% for 2011 in Irish exports is well below what is necessary to meet the demand in the EU-IMF four year plan.  That point has not been mentioned across the Chamber.  The post-budget analysis from the IEA also highlights the flaws in the thinking of the Government in regard to the research and development centres.  These need to be revisited so we can become a high-tech export economy.  I welcome the investment by Intel and the fact that Apple and EMC are doing so well in Cork.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s industrial growth, according to the innovation task force, has experienced two inflection points since we began to embrace the notion of Ireland as a country capable of industrial production and move away from an agricultural, agrarian society.  That is not to say the agricultural economy is not absolutely critical to Ireland&rsquo;s future.  The inflection points identified by the innovation task force were in the 1960s and 1980s.  The decision in the 1960s was to invest in human capital, primarily through free education at second level.  The country moved by a quantum into a new era of export led growth and industrial development in the 1980s with the decision to engage in social partnership.  The deal provided for industrial peace in return for reduced levels of personal taxation and a low corporation tax rate.  The innovation task force says we need a third inflection point at the start of the second decade of this new century.</P>
        <P>I commend and recognise the merit of the Government motion, and will support it, but I can see that more needs to be done if we are to make the third step happen.  This will make good on the key decisions of the 1960s and 1980s.  This time, it will be more complex and less easily achieved than if there were difficult to implement but simple policy decisions.  The context in the 1960s and 1980s was that the world was slow-moving.  Ireland had a much lower base from which to grow as a well off economy within the European context.  The challenge is much greater now and the complexity of the response that will be needed to maintain national wealth and personal wealth and take our place as an exporting nation at the forefront of exporting nations will be more complex and difficult.  Nonetheless, it is happening.</P>
        <P>I advise Senator Phelan that Senator Donohoe recently identified Innovation Ireland as probably the finest document to come from this current Government period.  Having read it again, I tend to agree with him.  It is the plan that Senator Buttimer said the Government does not have.  It contains many alignments with the Fine Gael&rsquo;s NewERA.  While there are divergences there are definite points on which the two documents touch.  For Senator Buttimer to say there is no plan is trite and untrue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The innovation task force report is an extraordinarily impressive document.  It emerged as a result of a recommendation, among a key handful of recommendations, in the Smart Economy document that we drive innovation.  This task force set out to show how that might be done.  As I read through some of the recommendations, I note a number of them have been acted on in this term.  I hope the next Government takes up the challenge of acting on more of the recommendation because I believe we can achieve this new inflection point in the early part of this decade.  It is necessary that we do it.  It is not only about regaining and maintaining competitiveness or of taking on board the lessons of the OECD report, which I agree were extremely worrying and are not only confined to mathematics and science but include the need for polylingual skills in this country.  I argue that children need to learn Chinese, or whatever other languages become dominant in the international markets, in school from an early age.  Education will be critical.  If the additional points that are to be given for mathematics were extended to some of the key languages, I would have no complaints.  That recommendation on the allocation of additional points is one that emerged from a report and is one on which the Government has acted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I spoke recently to people in PricewaterhouseCoopers about how Irish suppliers to big international companies are now under pressure to drive the carbon out of the products and services they supply abroad.  It is becoming a pressure to which many of them feel they need to respond <Col N="245"/>rapidly.  In terms of accounting procedures, PricewaterhouseCoopers is assisting many Irish companies in meeting that challenge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The demand to drive carbon out of our export of goods and services will not stop.  One need only look at Google&rsquo;s recent investment as the lead investor in a wind farm stretching 350 miles off the California coast to realise that it wants to be able to say of its data centres and service to its multimillion consumers that it is a company that is delivering its goods and services in a low carbon way.  We need to monitor that kind of investment.  Our small and medium-sized enterprises in that sector need to be able to respond to that and keep the level of carbon as low as possible in the products they provide.</P>
        <P>Such companies on investing here also examine Ireland&rsquo;s ability to work and provide power for their businesses in a low carbon way.  There is great hope there and many Senators on both sides of the House have spoken about the potential of the renewable sector in Ireland.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that we have managed to get to the point we are at today despite being poorly endowed in fossil fuel supplies.  We did not have any discovered gas when we were trying to grow the country in the earlier decades, although we have discovered a certain amount now.  However, when it comes to the old fuels, we are poorly endowed but yet we managed to develop as a strong economy, although I agree we need to regain that strength.  However, we managed to do it in one cycle.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As we move away from a fossil fuel economy &mdash; that is not a wishful statement as we are in the early stages of doing that &mdash; to a post-fossil fuel energy era, we are a well endowed country.  We have moved from being a country that has had to import its energy to one that ultimately will be an energy exporter.  That will give us an enormous edge in terms of that inflection point and it will be a product that we will export.  Our energy policy, investment in our grid and the investment that has been planned by the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is and Bord na M&oacute;na, which will amount to &euro;30 billion when it is totted up in the next decade, will effectively drive energy exports, and that will be critical.</P>
        <P>In terms of the message that has gone out from Ireland lately, I spoke recently to our man in Chicago, the IDA person there, with whom I go back a long way, about the impact of the stories of Ireland in the US press in terms of his job of trying to attract inward investment into Ireland in the form of foreign direct investment.  He said it is hard to predict but he expects that 2011 will be a good year for investment from US companies into Ireland and that while there are negative messages there, Ireland is to the forefront of people&rsquo;s minds.  The IDA is boxing clever in the United States at present and using the opportunity to speak to people to whom it has not spoken previously in parts of America to which it has not been previously.  To use the old clich&eacute;, even this particularly dark cloud may have a silver lining if the IDA continues to use its influence and renowned skillset overseas in attracting foreign investment into Ireland.  I am optimistic that prediction will come true.  Such influence is being coupled with the work of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s network of offices all around the world.  I have heard direct stories from very small exporting companies in my area &mdash; I am sure such stories are replicated throughout Ireland &mdash; of where Enterprise Ireland offices are fast-tracking and making it easier for companies that have innovative products and services to get into marketplaces in large cities around Europe and further afield.  I am extremely encouraged when I hear those stories of direct care and concern for small Irish businesses by Enterprise Ireland in the way it makes it much easier for Irish companies to overcome language barriers, bureaucratic barriers and taxation issues as such companies begin to move into unfamiliar territories.  I commend Enterprise Ireland on that engagement.  Much of it is unseen because this does not involve a large number of jobs.  It is not the stuff of Intel announcements, which I very much welcome, but it is critical.</P><Col N="246"/>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the climate Bill and whether it will impair Irish growth, I appeal to Members to look at the facts.  Under current commitments, by 2020 Ireland will need to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide it emits in its production of goods and services from 64 million tonnes a year, which is the current level, to 47 million tonnes.  The climate Bill commits us to reduce our emissions from 64 million tonnes to 47 million tonnes a year by 2020.  That means there is no difference involved, in that no additional burden is being put on the economy in gross tonnage terms over the period than is already committed to under our 2020 obligations.  Any attempts to present that Bill as being a dead hand on the prospects for the economy are untrue.  I have made the case already that we need to drive carbon out of our production.  I believe that Bill will do that and make us more attractive to inward investment and our exports more saleable in a global market that is expected to reach a value of &euro;5 trillion by 2015.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for this opportunity to speak to this motion.  I recognise, as should Members on all sides of the House, despite the amendment tabled, that there is great hope in the export figures we received recently.  Whether they were delivered by fluke, design or clever Government measures I am not sure, but they have happened and they are certainly a crutch for the Government in its hour of need.  It is certainly no coincidence that a motion of this sort is tabled in Government time to grab at a straw which may turn out to be something quite significant.</P>
        <P>I do not know, nor does anybody in this House, whether we will be able repay the IMF-EU the amount of money which we have borrowed from them.  I do not know whether the growth figures are realistic.  There are authorities on both sides, those who say one thing and those who say another, but I know we will be extremely lucky if we achieve that growth.  Our dependence on multinationals for our export figures is extremely significant.  I congratulate successive Governments for their steadfastness in holding to the decision to encourage multinationals to our shores; it was the great success of what was the economic boom.  The construction industry pillar of the boom has collapsed while the multinational pillar was the unsung element.  That element continues and we only need to look at the Intel announcement this week to see multinationals still have great confidence in the Irish economy and that is encouraging.  There is an apologetic acceptance of that by many of us because we do not like to give the credit for future economic growth to investment from abroad because we like to feel that it is done by ourselves, and indeed some is being done by the food industry.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State and his senior Minister to consider one thing: if multinationals are to lead us out of trouble, which undoubtedly they are, could we look again at the 12.5% tax rate?  Why do we attract so much employment from US multinationals, in particular, leading to so many spin off benefits to the community, to employees, to housing and to myriad other service industries?  The principal hook that attracts them is the tax rate.  There are incidentals, such as an educated population, but the main reason is the tax rate.  If we are to encourage the export-led, multinational-led recovery, why can we not lower that rate further?  Why is the Government so much in a straightjacket that it must stand by the 12.5% rate?  It is constantly resisting the pressure from Europe to raise that rate.  We had it from Mrs. Merkel yesterday and Sarkozy last week.  People are constantly hectoring us that we cannot accept loans from Europe while keeping this tax rate.  We are in charge of our own tax rates; as a nation we can do what we like with it.  We are not beholden to Europe on that and we should not be subject to pressure on it.  I suggest that the Government makes a unilateral decision to reduce corporation tax to less than 10% and stuff Sarkozy, Mrs. Merkel and their cohorts and let us see what will happen.  The result will be that the message will go out across Europe and to the United States that Ireland is taking the initiative to improve exports even further.  We should indulge <Col N="247"/>in what they refer to so derisively as tax competition; let us do it.  What is wrong with tax competition?  Europe says it does not want tax competition but we should be tax competitive, we should go in and say we will use this weapon and we do not care too much about the lost revenue because it will be compensated for by increased employment and exports.</P>
        <P>I am not anti-European but we must be careful about the balance in our relationships with Europe and America.  During the negotiations, it was clear the IMF and the European Union took very different attitudes.  It was the Europeans who screwed us, not the IMF; it was the Europeans who came down hard on us, telling us we cannot do this, that and the other.  It is perfectly apparent now that the IMF said we could burn the bondholders; it had no fundamental problem with that.  It was the Europeans, particularly Trichet and his boys, who said we would get no money if we did that.  Why do we have to take that sort of diktat from Europe?</P>
        <P>A funny thing happened in the European Parliament today.  Joe Higgins and Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso had a set to.  I would not normally be sympathetic with Joe Higgins but he said we should not be dictated to by European bankers, and that is what has happened; the bailout result pleased European bankers.  He was right about that.  The irony is that while Mr. Higgins said that and Mr. Barroso got all sniffy about it, I spent yesterday in London talking to hedge fund managers and they said we are bonkers and asked why we did not burn the bondholders, that it was what we were expected to do and what we should have done.  On the one hand, Joe Higgins is saying we should do it while, on the other hand, fund managers and real market people are saying we should do it but in the middle the Government claimed it was completely in thrall to the European Central Bank and capitulated to it.  Let us tell Europe we will look after our own tax affairs, that we will be export-led and we will do so by cutting corporation tax and not taking notice of its diktats.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not disagree with the Senator&rsquo;s notion of lowering taxes further but clearly we have severe Exchequer difficulties; therefore, it would not be realistic in the short to medium term to progress on a path of further reduction of corporation or other taxes.  Most regular economists would be sceptical about the idea, although I understand the red in tooth and claw capitalism that lies behind the assertion and I have no objection to it.</P>
        <P>The burning of the bondholders is a subject where Senator Ross and Joe Higgins are as one.  We must distinguish, however, between bond market operators in London and elsewhere because London is <i>sui generis</i>.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly the same happened in Geneva two weeks ago.  Exactly the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a certain euroscepticism that is not only healthy but positively believed in the British capital that also makes good paying sense for hedge fund operators in that part of the world.  When I lived there in the 1980s, I saw at first hand bond market and currency market operators making the most of their anti-European principles while making it a paying proposition from their own perspective of shorting the market or a currency.  I would not take my views from them or from Joe Higgins on these matters.</P>
        <P>We have bound ourselves to the European project and to a great extent, there is nothing we can do about that, short of the exit from the euro currency recommended by some people, a course of action I do not endorse; it would be most ill-advised.  When David McWilliams urges that in his columns, it is the formal logic of the sort of scepticism expressed by Senator Ross.  Most mainstream parties in this House would not suggest an export-led economy such as ours should leave behind one of its greatest benefits, that is, membership of a common currency.  A common currency inflicts pain in difficult times, such as when hostile rate movements make it <Col N="248"/>more difficult for us to trade, particularly with our nearest neighbour and largest trading partner, the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following sharp contraction in the past two years, let us welcome the fact that the latest data suggest the level of activity in the economy has stabilised and that the Department of Finance now expects GDP growth of 1.7% this year and average growth of 3% in the period 2012-14.  There is a strong consensus that growth will primarily be driven by the export sector over this period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our export performance in recent years has shown considerable resilience.  In order to capitalise on the strength of this sector, the Government launched a new integrated strategy for the promotion of overseas trade, tourism and investment &mdash; Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy<i>.  </i>It was launched last autumn and suggests that by providing the framework to maximise the potential for increased exports, tourism and investment, we can support well paying jobs at home.  It points to a series of reports and recommendations made to the Government by agencies and independent bodies suggesting we must go up the value chain.  This proverbial value chain, which we must now climb against a background of international and domestic recession, is one we would have had to climb irrespective of whether there was a recession.  It is important to execute this move much more quickly in the current climate.</P>
        <P>It is important to emphasise that many of the jargon words associated with the smart economy tend to alienate people from the core concept.  I do not like using the phrase &ldquo;smart economy&rdquo; and prefer to use &ldquo;productive economy&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>On foot of all the reports and our strategy, we are making an investment to exit recession.  We are moving towards growing productivity in small and medium-sized firms.  We are helping to make the operating environment more competitive for multinationals, which are present in great number and which must pay salaries that traditionally were higher than those paid elsewhere.  We have addressed many of the issues in the past two years.</P>
        <P>One of the achievements of the Government and the country &ndash; I hate to keep boasting on behalf of the Government &mdash; is that companies, managers, factory floor workers and staff in offices have made the necessary adjustments willingly in order to retain and safeguard jobs and to make companies and communities more competitive.  There is a push-pull factor in terms of people&rsquo;s reason for making the adjustment.  The people have made a remarkable adjustment in response to the very sudden recession, which was caused predominantly by an international banking collapse in our case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Nonsense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Of course, we have our own weaknesses.  An Opposition Senator stated Fianna F&aacute;il is always saying it was international rather than domestic factors that caused our very sharp adjustment and descent into recession.  I do not agree with this view.  I am one of a number of colleagues, including the Taoiseach, who have openly acknowledged the mistakes we made and who contend that, now that we have the benefit of hindsight, we should have slowed down the expansion of the property market earlier than we did.  There is no doubt we should have curtailed at an earlier stage some of the reliefs we curtailed in the last budget and the one before it.  However, when this issue was raised at the time in question, there was a great deal of opinion, from Government and Opposition sources and from some well respected international and domestic companies, to the effect that we should not do so and that we should pile on more incentives.  That is the context and we need to be balanced about it.  It is not just that the Government made mistakes.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="249"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s memory is somewhat selective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government did make mistakes in this matter and it is glad to acknowledge that.  We are glad to be in a position to rectify them if we can and set the platform for further expansion and growth.</P>
        <P>This new Government strategy and action plan, which was prepared by the Minister of State responsible for trade, Deputy Kelleher, is the result of co-ordination with all of the relevant Departments and State agencies.  It replaces the Asia strategy, it is global in scope and covers both existing and new high growth potential markets.  It has set a number of ambitious targets to be achieved by 2015.  Its objective is to create 150,000 new jobs in manufacturing, tourism and traded services.  The jobs total figure of 150,000 direct new jobs is from agency estimates based on their growth targets over the strategy period, which ends in 2015.  The IDA has set a target of 75,000 additional jobs, Enterprise Ireland is pinning its colours to the mast in respect of 60,000 new jobs and 15,000 jobs are pencilled in for the tourism sector.</P>
        <P>The new strategy foresees the creation of an additional 150,000 jobs, to be created indirectly through the very aggressive trade strategy.  The strategy is focused very much on creating a new and more visible presence for Ireland through agencies and embassies, and through direct marketing and promotion in markets in which we have not had a great footprint heretofore.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Forgetting for a minute Brazil, Russia, India and China, the fabled BRIC countries, Members should note that two thirds of the world's GDP is generated between the Middle East and Far East.  Any companies, countries or individuals who hope to be exporting entrepreneurs that ignore those markets do so at their peril.  The region to which I refer is where the growth of the future will be and where most of the world&rsquo;s population is located.  We need a new strategy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There will be a considerable challenge for Ireland because traditionally its trade, tourism and investment footfall has been very much in the United Kingdom, other parts of Europe, the United States and in what we might broadly describe as the English-speaking parts of the world with which we are familiar culturally and otherwise and with which we have connections.  It will present a big challenge for the current Government and its successor to penetrate the new regions, become very relevant and encourage Irish businesses to enter the new markets.  That is the primary purpose of our agency push and why I, as a Minister of State in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, am proud to say that, in recent years, there has been a significant redistribution of financial resources within the Department to the agencies that encourage indigenous companies to trade in export markets.  This is precisely because the challenge is so great, particularly in respect of the markets of the Far East.</P>
        <P>The new strategy foresees the creation of new indirect jobs.  This figure I referred to in this regard takes into account the various impacts from new jobs in manufacturing and services based on the number of projects, job intensity, purchase of raw materials and services, re-spending of salaries and impact of taxation.</P>
        <P>The overall objective of Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy is to marshal and co-ordinate the resources of the State in a way that best supports firms of all sizes and in all parts of the country that are trying to trade and grow their business overseas.  This new strategic approach recognises above all that it is critical that we, as a relatively small player in the global marketplace, work as a coherent team when promoting our economic interests abroad.  This joined-up approach is even more necessary when trying to gain or increase our foothold in new high growth potential markets.  It is a remarkable feature that I witnessed on some of my visits abroad as a Minister of State.  It is precisely in the new markets, be they in Singapore, China or elsewhere, that our agencies are best organised on the ground.  New markets force agencies that would have operated semi-independently in more settled markets to collaborate.</P><Col N="250"/>
        <P>When one considers the size and population of China and the wealth being generated by it, one notes intense collaboration and co-operation between the embassy and agency staff, precisely because the Irish footprint on the ground is very small relative to the size of China and to the number of cities with over 1 million people in that country.  It is a great challenge to be represented significantly in China.</P>
        <P>One of the key messages in the Government&rsquo;s national recovery plan is that export-led growth will fuel domestic recovery.  It recognises that the implementation of the strategy and action plan set out in Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy will ensure that our trade, tourism and investment sectors are well positioned to respond effectively to emerging opportunities as the global economy recovers.</P>
        <P>The national recovery plan has set out specific actions to spur further improvements in competitiveness across all sectors of the economy, including measures to cut costs in respect of energy, waste, transport, broadband infrastructure, professional fees, property and labour.</P>
        <P>Wages and other costs have adjusted to the change in labour market conditions.  Government policy has aided in this competitiveness adjustment.  Public sector wages have been reduced by an average of nearly 15%, sending a clear demonstration effect to the traded sectors, and the minimum wage is being reduced.  IBEC surveys have found that one quarter of companies cut basic pay rates by an average of 12% in 2009.</P>
        <P>Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy recognises that our favourable taxation environment has been a key strength.  The Government&rsquo;s recovery plan commits to maintaining the 12.5% corporation tax rate which the new trade strategy identifies as a key component of our industrial policy.  It is no accident that, in recent weeks and months and in light of the four year plan and the agreement reached with the EU, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, significant Ministers, including the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, have often stated how the rate is at the core of promoting Ireland.  We are not for changing.</P>
        <P>Ireland is not isolated in this regard.  We stand alongside many European countries, most notably a number in central and eastern Europe.  Although it is always difficult to say in an Irish context, our nearest neighbour and historical enemy of many years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>But friends now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;has been a great ally to Ireland in the tax debate at European level.  Not only are we locked into our commitment to a 12.5% tax rate, we are in an alliance with other European countries.  We have allies and friends on this issue, most notably our neighbour, the British Government.</P>
        <P>Driving and monitoring the implementation of the strategy is a new foreign trade council chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, through his responsibility for trade and commerce.  The role of the new council is to strengthen co-operation and co-ordination across all key State agencies, including by providing strategic guidance and direction to trade, tourism and investment committees in each key market.  It has also had discussions on how to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s profile abroad, for example, by maximising the impact of integrated trade missions, promoting Ireland through St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and making better use of our current joint economic commissions with China, South Korea, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia and Libya.  At the council&rsquo;s most recent meeting, the Department of Justice and Law Reform briefed it on the new mechanism the former has set up to align our visa regime with the priorities set out in the strategy.</P><Col N="251"/>
        <P>Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy has the distinction of being the first integrated strategy to promote overseas trade, tourism and investment and the first to have concrete targets for trade, tourism and investment up to 2015.  The overall objective of the strategy and action plan is to marshal and co-ordinate the resources of the State.  One of the follow-up actions in the plan is to ensure that the many Irish businesses which do not engage directly with any of the State enterprise agencies are informed as to the initiatives and actions set out in the strategy which would benefit them.</P>
        <P>Are the new strategy and all of the initiatives taken by the Government to support exporters delivering the desired results?  While the Central Statistics Office, CSO, will not have its estimates of merchandise and services exports for the full year 2010 until the end of February and March 2011, respectively, all of the indications from trends in the first three quarters of 2010 are that the value of Irish exports for the full year will be well ahead of 2009&rsquo;s approximately &euro;151 billion and could be our highest ever annual total.  We need to be mindful of this extraordinary statement.</P>
        <P>Not for one minute would I criticise the Opposition for being excessively negative.  In particular, Fine Gael is trying to be as positive as possible.  Senator Phelan and others sent a positive note by emphasising what has been a successful element in these past two years.  I am not talking about the Government, but about the country.  That we managed to squeeze out these export figures in the most hostile and difficult trading period in our history bar perhaps the economic war is an extraordinary feat, one that has largely been achieved by foreign direct investment and agile, competitive domestic companies that are trading across international frontiers.  We need to praise such companies more.  To a large extent, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are <i>ad idem</i> in this regard.  A new Government that punishes exporters through higher costs, taxes and State entanglements is not required.  We need to remove the shackles from these companies and make it easier for them to do their business overseas and repatriate their profits to Ireland.  We need to encourage a culture of innovating and growing Irish companies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of Senators referred to the innovation task force report.  As Minister of State, I have been proud to play a part in the task force&rsquo;s deliberations and recommendations.  Some Senators have stated it is yet another Government report lying on a shelf, but it is not.  To date, more than 51% of the recommendations have been implemented.  The document is predicated on the notions of action and implementation.  Give us a recommendation and we will implement it.  The task force&rsquo;s recommendations continue to be implemented.  We created a steering group to ensure this.  The group is not composed of bureaucratic or administrative patsies.  Rather, it is composed of people from industry who want to hold our feet to the fire in terms of the report&rsquo;s implementation.</P>
        <P>The report is not an arid document lying on a shelf.  It is living, breathing and being pushed through the Government process.  It is a great tribute to the Taoiseach that he championed this initiative as a follow on to his creation of the smart economy framework, which he published towards the end of 2008.  It is also a great tribute to him that the actions are being taken.  For years, the public and certain people in politics have rightly been cynical about reports that are trumpeted with great fanfare, glossy brochures etc. but are not implemented.  That was an unfortunate part of our history during and prior to the boom years, but this report is being implemented.  Despite the chuckles being deployed by Senator Phelan, he will find this document useful if he finds himself in government.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 50% of the recommendations have already been implemented and any Government that follows us will merely need to complete the remaining 50%.  Some of the actions will not be easy.</P><Col N="252"/>
        <P>The report has two fantastic core elements and I recommend that Members note them.  The first is the idea of creating an innovation fund of &euro;500 million to encourage companies.  It is not all about start-ups, in that it is also about scaling companies upwards.  Traditionally, Irish companies have found it difficult to survive upon reaching an annual turnover of approximately &euro;100 million.  They tend to be taken over or amalgamated, change their direction or switch their headquarters.  The key challenge is not only to encourage a culture of start-ups, but also to encourage a tradition of serial reinvestment by successful business people and entrepreneurs so that when they cash out of business, they come back in and start again.  This can only be done if we create a popular venture capital culture.</P>
        <P>The &euro;500 million fund has been greatly admired abroad and we hope it will be a magnet for attracting American venture capital into the European marketplace.  Traditionally, US venture capitalists have been conservative in their approach to European capital markets and reluctant to make the journey across.  Ireland is in a good position to attract that venture capital and to see it invested in Irish and European companies.  The fund is a successful part of the report and is already up and running on a pilot basis.  It is going well and has made its first investment.</P>
        <P>When creating the administrative arrangements around exploiting, developing and commercialising patents, new discoveries and copyrighted material, it is important that we get our ducks in a row.  Issues exist.  For example, I attended the Seanad some weeks ago following a particular High Court decision concerning current copyright arrangements.  We will adjust our rules accordingly to ensure that challenge is addressed.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In terms of how we treat intellectual property, it is important to position ourselves as a location of choice for people to commercialise, exploit and register their patents and discoveries.  Our universities comprise a fantastic infrastructure in terms of research and development.  It has been built up over ten years by tripling the level of spending devoted to research and development.  The road construction projects of the past 14 years have seen the completion of vital connections between our large cities, reducing journey times.  Alongside that physical infrastructural investment of the past 14 years, there has been a fantastic rolling out of investment in the intellectual or human capacity of our people through the investment in research and development in the universities.  There are hopes for the future and we can turn the corner and come out of recession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to speak to the motion.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="253"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking to the principle of the motion.  I am talking about this precise debate and the way it is handled.  I could not be more central if I tried, as I am sure the Acting Chairman will see because she is a woman of broad imagination and sympathy.  I remind the House that important legislation was rushed through all Stages in the House this morning.  I think this is frightful and disgraceful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad I was here to catch some of the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution because he spoke with characteristic verve and a positive attitude and without endlessly reading from a script; therefore, he knew what he was talking about.  I can agree with some of what he said but when he talked about certain areas of innovation and said we have 50% of the work done and all the incoming Government has to do is finish the other 50%, I wish that was all the incoming Government had to do.  On the contrary, the incoming Government is faced with a horrendously difficult economic situation, as the Minister of State is perfectly aware.</P>
        <P>This may be taken as an aside but it is an extremely relevant aside.  I was thrilled as I walked down to the Royal Irish Academy this evening to the launch of a book which is relevant to this area.  It was to be launched by Vincent Browne but I had to leave before he arrived.  As I walked, I heard on RTE radio Joe Higgins MEP speaking in the European Parliament.  He said something that I have been saying in this House and naturally I agree with it because I agree with myself.  He was asking how it was possible to create a just civil society and a proper economy based on principles of injustice and immorality, that every single economic commentator acknowledges now that it is wrong and a mistake to inflict the bill for the gambling habits of the banks on the innocent Irish taxpayer.  I refute absolutely the idea that we are responsible for the situation from which the Minister&rsquo;s innovative proposals are trying to get us out.  This has to be addressed.  I was delighted to hear, from the instant and hysterical response, that Joe Higgins had rightly got under the skin of Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of innovation, the Minister of State comes from a very talented family and he will know about the creative imagination, the capacity for lateral thinking, the inventiveness of Irish people.  I have recently written a foreword for a book on the subject of who are the Irish.  It is written by a fellow who has been involved in all kinds of different things.  The writer, Mr. Moran, was involved in the building, catering and entertainment businesses.  He lives in London.  He took people from every one of the 32 counties, not just from the areas of literature and the arts &mdash; but also from business, banking, science, invention, law.  We have that raw material of the creative imagination; what we need is to move it further on to the development of those incentives in a proper way.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State spoke about patents.  I did a James Joyce show in Munich some years ago in order to raise funds for an Irish charity and at the invitation of some members of the Irish community who were working in the European Patents Office.  They asked if something could be done to harmonise the patent system throughout Europe.  There is not sufficient time for this Government to do anything but we need to do it in order to encourage people.</P>
        <P>The second part of my argument is to highlight the number of new, fresh and original creative ideas in this country.  For instance, a multinational company based in Waterford closed its plant and repatriated the research and design ideas to America.  Our ingenuity and creativity was stifled because although that plant was making a profit, the American home base was in some financial trouble and perfectly legally they took our ideas.  We should try to keep our creative talent here.</P>
        <P>Last week I attended the Young Scientist Exhibition at the RDS.  If anyone wants to see innovation and ideas at work, this is the place to go.  For instance, a lad from Belvedere College explained his invention in a most magisterial manner.  He has designed a cyclist&rsquo;s helmet which monitors head movements.  The movement of the cyclist&rsquo;s head to right or left sets off a flashing <Col N="254"/>rear light direction indicator.  There is no need to take one&rsquo;s hands off the handlebars.  Even better, another young lad from another school has invented an application for a mobile phone or a BlackBerry which can turn the phone into a defibrillator.  Many wonderful young athletes have collapsed on playing pitches or have died from sudden adult death syndrome.  I am aware that defibrillators have been installed in clubhouses but every telephone could be turned into a defibrillator by means of this invention.  I advised the young man to take out a patent for his invention and he has done so.  Last year&rsquo;s winners of the competition were from Clonakilty.  They invented a test for enzymes in milk.  It was a simple but fantastic invention.  We can lead the world.  What young people need is the encouragement to do it and that Young Scientist Exhibition is just marvellous.  My old friends, the young women from Clonakilty, were there this year.  One of my good news stories concerns them.  A group of transition year young women students in the Sacred Heart school did a project on the problem regarding the drainage of rich nutrients from farmland which had caused a stink on the shoreline.  It was awful for the locals and a disincentive for tourism.  The girls identified the problem and they collected samples.  A chemical analysis showed that this material could be compressed and turned into briquettes that burned for twice as long as peat briquettes and had the same heat co-efficiency.  This is a fantastic development.  The mother of a dyslexic daughter created an aid which helps those with dyslexia by cutting the back off a cornflakes box and taking a triangle out of it, all to focus the eye.  She went to the Fingal enterprise centre and the invention is being manufactured in plastic with different coloured lenses.  She told me she appeared on &ldquo;Dragons Den&rdquo; and she was thrashed by one of the mouldy old lions.  The cowardly lion mauled her but the three other dragons invited her to talk to them after the programme because they thought her product was brilliant and they will help her with the manufacture and world-wide marketing.  It is not a language-dependent product.  One could read Hebrew backwards, read Chinese upside down.  We need such ideas but they require investment.  I spoke at an event in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will end on this point.  We need to invest.  I know these are difficult times and everybody is in the queue such as hospitals and schools.  I spoke at the Institute of European Affairs.  A wonderful young woman came up to me to say she was really worried about the country.  She is now studying law but had previously completed a high technology degree in some third level institution in Dublin.  Three years ago she was one of a class of 220 students, but when she returned this year, there were 12.  That is not good.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State for his clear description of what we are doing to take advantage of export opportunities in Asia and various other parts of the world.  The past three years have been the worst period of our history since the 1930s.  In addition to a crisis in the financial sector and the world economy, the construction industry has collapsed.  This has forced Irish industries to find new ways of competing.  Most would agree that we were overpaying ourselves.  Our wage bill was far too high.  To give a simple example, a bricklayer who previously demanded &euro;3 to lay a brick is now happy to do so for 60 cent.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>If he can get it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>That example demonstrates how a fine industry was brought to its knees by overvaluing the various services being provided.  Land was also exploited.  A site in a normal area which should have cost &euro;30,000 was being traded for &euro;100,000.  That gives a hint about why the construction industry collapsed.  Raw materials and labour became too expensive and when that happened, Joe public could no longer afford to buy a house.</P><Col N="255"/>
        <P>There has been an adjustment in the private sector because people had to accept lower pay.  That made our exports more attractive.  The euro has decreased in value against the dollar and sterling, which also helps industry to create employment.  We have to be led by the export industry.</P>
        <P>President Sarkozy and other European leaders should not worry about the Irish because we will look after ourselves when it comes to exporting and attracting companies.  Our attractive corporation tax rate of 12.5% should be the bottom line.  I agree with Senator Ross that we form our own tax policies and that if we want to expand inward investment, we need an attractive tax regime.  We have seen the success our tax policies.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has outlined how we will go about expanding exports to China and other Asian markets.  We have a great opportunity in the education sector because we have some of the finest educators and best accommodation on offer in the world.  We should attract a larger share of this market.  We are earning approximately &euro;800 million from students coming here to learn English, compared to a figure of &euro;12 billion in the United Kingdom and &euro;4.5 billion to &euro;5 billion in Australia.  Everybody wants to learn English which is the medium for most business transactions.  We should seek to ensure our schools teach Chinese and Japanese students.  We need a forward looking education system.  We could easily earn a further &euro;800 million from students coming here to learn English.  That would give a huge boost to our letting industry and other sectors.  Each student would spend in the region of &euro;22,000, a colossal amount of money.  For very little investment, we could create a considerable number of jobs.</P>
        <P>We should pay attention to where opportunities arise.  While we cannot create jobs, we can develop the climate to promote job creation in exports and services.</P>
        <P>Our economic recovery will be hindered until we sort out our banking problems.  Certain bankers still cannot tell the truth.  It is not good enough to give misinformation to the Minister for Finance when one considers what the taxpayer has done for the banks.  The people whom we have put on the boards of the banks should be obliged to report to the Minister on a weekly or monthly basis to ensure he will be kept up to date on what is happening in the banking sector.  We should break the banks into commercial, retail and investment sections and reduce them in size because they became too big to save in many cases.  We have saved most of the banks and it is important to restructure them in a way that sufficient credit will be provided to maximise the export industry.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion, particularly in the light of the amendment tabled to it.  The motion provides the House with an opportunity to unite behind our export success story, but, unfortunately, the Opposition has not responded to it.  The amendment condemns the Government for not being competitive enough.  I find that deeply hypocritical, given that we have listened to bellyaching from Opposition Members about the necessity to make Ireland more competitive and reduce the national minimum wage.  We have the absolute opposite in terms of a condemnation of the Government for our loss of competitiveness.  If Opposition Members are honoured by being elected to govern, they will quickly learn they will have to be consistent and coherent.  I also advise them not to be hypocritical.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;visited Intel more than four months ago because we are concerned about energy costs.  It is one of Intel&rsquo;s big problems with Ireland.  We heard that costs were getting out of control and that we needed to do something about it, which we did.  The fact that Intel has indicated it will reinvest in this country is such a good indicator.  What would we have done if it had not done so?  It shows the Government is doing the right thing and that the country is regaining its competitiveness.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Apart from energy costs, construction costs are down 40%; therefore, people can now afford to do business here and to expand.  We need to keep an eye on that and I am sure Fine Gael will do so if the people decide to put it in government.  If one is to curtail costs, it means making adjustments.</P>
        <P>We cannot be complacent.  Previous speakers asked how hard is it to do business here.  How difficult is it for businesses here to expand?  We heard about patents earlier and we must make things easier for people.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, has been in the House to address the red tape.  We must streamline things for small and medium sized enterprises in particular.  We are in danger of throwing the baby out with the bath water.  There is this notion that we had no regulation and that is what got us into trouble but that we will now have far too much regulation.  There needs to be a happy medium.</P>
        <P>It is vital the message that Ireland is good and open for business is made very clear to people.  That is why we must ensure we keep an eye on whatever constraints there are on business.  The Minister of State spoke about strategies that have been adopted and that this is the way to go.  Everybody acknowledges the successes which have been achieved.  However, we need to be careful and hear what small businesses are saying, such as, how difficult it is to get paid, in particular, by the State, or whatever.  We need to keep an eye on that area.</P>
        <P>Tourism has massive potential but it has been quite damaged.  We have bad statistics because of the perception that Ireland is too dear.  Why is it too dear?  We are in danger of killing the <Col N="257"/>goose which laid the golden egg.  We now hear there is a lot more value in restaurants and so on than ever before.  That is a good thing.</P>
        <P>After the changeover to the euro, many people decided it was cheaper to bring their family for a two week holiday to Spain than to remain in Ireland.  That was terrible.  My family holidays were always in Ireland.  We kept the money in the town, spent locally and developed the indigenous economy.  We did not have that tradition of going abroad.  Besides it cost a fortune to get a flight in those days whereas now it is so much cheaper to go to Spain.  That is something on which people in the tourism industry need to keep an eye.  People enjoy themselves when they come to Ireland but it is expensive.</P>
        <P>I am tired listening to people say that lowering the tax rate was a bad thing.  As soon as we lowered the tax rate, the money came in.  People will pay fair taxes.  The cost of things is very transparent and if we want people to do business here, we should make it affordable for them.  It is better to serve food in a bar which is full and a little bit cheaper than to serve more expensive food to fewer customers.  People recognise that now and costs are coming down.  That is where we are regaining our competitive position.  I am glad to see that because it is a good news story.</P>
        <P>I agree totally with what Senator Norris said about the young scientists and how we need investment.  He spoke about bankers and about what happened in the European Parliament this afternoon.  However, he needs to recognise that if we are to invest in those young scientists and young geniuses of the future, we need a working banking system.  Whether we like it or not and whatever happened in the past, Ireland had no choice but to support the banking industry.  Investment only comes through the banking sector and that is why we need a coherent banking structure.  I am glad our competitiveness is improving.  Long may the good work by the Government in this area continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I have always felt there was a very strong link between exports and tourism.  For that reason, it is very important to ensure we continue to promote Ireland abroad wherever opportunities arise, which we have been doing exceptionally well.  There is always a temptation in times of economic constraints to cut back on expenditure to develop and expand on the goodwill which exists abroad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If people have a particular loyalty to a country and if they see one of its commodities abroad, they will buy it despite the competition.  There was one great example of that, namely, Aer Lingus.  Over the years people who travelled from abroad and who were of Irish extraction invariably sought to travel with Aer Lingus when it was the national airline.  When that ceased to be the case and when it cut certain routes to Shannon Airport, which had a major impact on Shannon, I do not know how many people I met in America who said their loyalty to Aer Lingus was gone and that they saw no difference between it and any other airline if it could pull a service and harm a whole region.</P>
        <P>The same applies to any Irish goods on sale abroad.  We obviously have a very good name in terms of the product we provide and we are able to compete.  More important, the brand we have is strong and holds on to that loyalty about which I spoke.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Looking back at some of the debates we have had, in particular around St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day when Ministers travel abroad to represent Ireland, the view has been expressed that should not happen &mdash; in other words, we should cut back on that expenditure.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  The people inviting representatives from Ireland are the prospective customers for the products we are selling.  There are 40 million people of Irish extraction in North America.  That gives us an inroad and a degree of exclusivity in that market.  However, if one does not <Col N="258"/>service that market in a small way by sending representatives abroad, it brings us back to the example I gave of Aer Lingus.  The very same thing will apply to the customers who show loyalty to us from that market.  We need to be very careful that we sustain and develop the loyalty we have and that we recognise the global network at our disposal through our Diaspora.  Above all else we should try to maintain the qualities we have had in the past in the context of tourism.  In other words what we have is our strength.  If we try to copy and ape other countries with something different, then we lose the very market to which we have access.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to address some of the points made in the debate.  The suggestion that block layers being paid too much was the cause of the collapse in the construction industry is a first.  I have not heard that before, but I have heard it here.  What about the building of so many houses, a policy that was encouraged by Government?  What about the greed of developers?  What about the disgraceful and, indeed, criminal activities of the banks, with no one held accountable yet?  These are the reasons the construction industry collapsed, not that block layers were paid too much.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley said that if one is to curtail costs, it means making adjustments.  Of course, when costs need to be curtailed, adjustments are required, but it was at the time when we had the Celtic tiger and money was flowing in from construction and other sources that the Government should have been suggesting curtailing costs and making adjustments rather than pumping money here, there and everywhere, resulting in us being in the position in which we find ourselves of needing to ask the IMF for a bailout.</P>

Past Taoisigh said we needed to fight for our freedom, but they also stressed the need for economic freedom.  It is a pity that under the Government we have lost our freedom for the coming years as a result of the activities in the past 13 years of governments led by the party of which Senator Butler is a member.</P>

	<P>The Senator can reject it all he likes, but the people are waiting in the long grass to tell his party what they think of it.  I agree with the policy of low taxes referred to by Senator O&rsquo;Malley and we need to do everything possible to keep our taxes as low as possible.  I also fully agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day which represents an opportunity that any country would love to have to sell itself.  If we want to have a Government representative in the White House or anywhere else, however, the sooner the Taoiseach calls an election to get a proper Government in place, the better.  I know what is happening.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s idea is to run along up to 10 March, tell the Green Party to go to hell with itself at that stage, go to New York, Washington or wherever, and whenever he comes back, call the election.  That is the plan at the moment.  He would be better off going to country as soon as the finance Bill is passed.  Let us have the finance Bill.  It should have been on its way to being passed, but the Government is not doing that.  We know what it is at.  It is trying to delay the Bill to get to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and call an election afterwards.  I believe even the Green Party Members are waking up to what Fianna F&aacute;il is up to at this stage.</P>
        <P>We have discussed our amendment on export-led growth and given our policies on it.

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I am particularly pleased it is the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs as some of what I have to say will look to elicit the support of the European Union.  I am looking for a statement on the spate of recent murders, which was particularly intensified over the Christmas period, of Christians in a number of Middle East countries.  There is a need to defend Christian minorities within those countries.</P>
        <P>There was an alarming case in Nigeria where 32 people were killed, with over 70 seriously injured, over the Christmas period.  In a previous incident in Jos, Nigeria, 86 people were killed.  In Pakistan suicide bombers killed 47 people and left over 100 people injured.  In Iraq a couple of people have been killed and many were injured as well.  I know representation has been made by various Christian groups to the Obama Administration in regard to Iraq and the greater protection of Christians there.  On New Year&rsquo;s Eve a bomb attack in Egypt killed 21 Christians and injured over 100 people in the Church of the Two Saints in Alexandria.  Over 80% of those who have been targeted have been Christians.  Aid to the Church in Need, a Catholic-based organisation dealing with religious freedom, estimates that somewhere between 75% and 85% of all acts of religious persecution are directed against Christians, with many, unfortunately, coming from Muslim extremists.</P>
        <P>The international community is to a great degree refusing to acknowledge and highlight these atrocities, which in some instances are tantamount to ethnic cleansing.  Many international communities are failing to realise these atrocities but the Obama Administration has acknowledged that Christians are primarily targeted in this regard.  There is a real need for the international community to take steps to prevent such acts.  A lone voice in doing this recently has been Pope Benedict XVI, who has highlighted the persecution of Christians in a wide range of countries.  In the past two or three weeks we have seen in Iran a significant number of Christians arrested and incarcerated without trial in some of the most heinous prison regimes to be found anywhere in the world.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This and other countries embracing a human rights ethos must lend their voices to defending these people, even leaving aside the fact that we are a Christian country.  Italy has proposed that the EU consider withdrawing aid from countries which fail to protect Christian communities, and we should support this policy.  The European Union should articulate its strong objection to what is taking place and its support for having such action arrested.  I am happy to allow a minute or so to my colleague, Senator Norris, who will support my argument.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Senator Jim Walsh, for so generously making this time available.  I asked if he would allow me to participate in the debate because he has picked an extremely significant issue which deserves a widespread debate.  I commend him on taking the matter up as it is extremely serious.</P>
        <P>I asked if I could participate because I have some personal knowledge of the matter.  When I began going to the Middle East approximately 40 years ago, the population of Bethlehem was 80% Christian and 20% Muslim but that has now been reversed exactly.  That is partly due to the Israeli occupation.  I know from friends that another cause is the bullying tactic adopted by mosques, which blare highly political sermons into the Christian districts, which is really deplorable.</P><Col N="261"/>
        <P Just="Left">The awful violence which Senator Walsh spoke about so eloquently is an embarrassment to mainstream and decent Muslims, which are in the undoubted majority.  There is a fanatic minority which has been exacerbated by the attack on Iraq, etc.  I have also been in Egypt and spoken to some of the Copts.  There was an appalling attack on a Roman Catholic church, when over 100 people were killed in Baghdad, but there was also an attack on people at a special Christmas service in Alexandria.  It was abominable for people celebrating the birth of Christ to be attacked in this way.</P>
        <P>I am particularly glad Senator Walsh gave me this permission as I ask the Minister of State if it is possible for him to give any information on the position in Pakistan.  A woman, Ms Asia Bibi, has been sentenced to death for blasphemy, with the act including a defence of the Christian religion.  People are being condemned to death for converting, so what kind of freedom is that?  I read a book over Christmas which was not terribly high-brow but it was interesting.  It is called <i>Labyrinth</i> and was written by Kate Mosse, and it takes us through the Crusades period, detailing how Cathars were horribly persecuted.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I would be a little reluctant to impose sanctions as that may injure the most vulnerable people in the country.  I would agree to it if we could injure the governments but our actions must be political.  We must consider our own blasphemy laws as it is an important subject.  We can consider the assassination of the governor of Punjab in Pakistan for the crime of talking about repealing blasphemy laws.  Ireland was given as an example because we introduced blasphemy laws.  Members of the Pakistani bar displayed appalling behaviour in openly cheering and throwing flowers on the man who murdered the governor, simply because he preached a certain degree of tolerance towards Christians.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senators Walsh and Norris for their contributions on this issue.  There is no doubt that there has been a growth across the world in religious intolerance, not only Christianophobia but also Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.  It is intolerable at this stage of human development that such growth should occur.</P>
        <P>The Christmas Eve bombings in Jos, Nigeria, which claimed 80 lives, are widely believed to have been the work of an Islamist fundamentalist group known as Boko Harem.  While a number of Muslim religious leaders have condemned the bombings outright, unfortunately their condemnation has not been heeded.  Violence in and around Jos has been predominantly between Christians and Muslims and has a complex origin.  Continued efforts by the state and federal governments to address the root causes of the violence are required if recurrences are to be prevented.  The Irish Embassy in Nigeria has provided financial assistance to people in Jos, especially those who have been displaced or require relief as a result of intercommunal violence.</P>
        <P>The promotion of religious tolerance is a key objective in our bilateral relations with Pakistan and in European Union relations with that country.  Senator Walsh specifically referred to the need for the EU to be proactive in this matter.  For its part, the Pakistani Government has given clear commitments to the European Union to combat extremism, protect religious minorities and promote religious tolerance.  The work of the independent, national Human Rights Commission of Pakistan is welcomed, especially its public position on the obligations of the state.</P>
        <P>Ireland will continue to work closely with our European Union partners and other international partners to secure the human rights of all minorities in Pakistan.  The recent assassination of the Governor of Punjab, a case to which Senator Norris referred, highlights the difficulties faced by courageous people in that country.</P><Col N="262"/>
        <P>I was gravely concerned about the horrific attacks against defenceless Christian worshippers at Our Lady of Salvation Church in Baghdad on 31 October and the Coptic Church of the Saints of Alexandria on New Year&rsquo;s Eve.  I condemn unreservedly the deplorable attacks on 18 and 19 January against Iraqi security forces providing support in this area.  Groups such as al-Qaeda in Iraq which carry out these attacks are bent on destabilising the countries in which they operate and imposing religious totalitarianism.  Ireland and the European Union are committed to ensuring such efforts to fragment and undermine pluralistic and democratic states do not succeed.</P>
        <P>I do not agree that we should penalise governments for the actions of a violent few.  We should work to help governments in Iraq, Egypt and elsewhere which are making efforts to improve matters in this area.  The formation of a new Government in Iraq in December 2010 was an important step in the democratic development of a pluralistic state in which Iraqi Christians, Muslims and members of other religious denominations can live together.</P>
        <P>As Senator Walsh noted, the Italian Government has produced a so-called food for thought paper to promote freedom of religion and related counter terrorism measures.  The document, which is due to be considered at the European Union Foreign Affairs Council on 31 January, is welcome because it highlights the concern we all share on freedom of religion and belief, including the deplorable recent attacks on innocent worshippers.  The Italian paper makes several detailed proposals which the Government will examine carefully in co-operation with our European Union partners.  There are no proposals for cutting aid to countries where Christian communities have been attacked.  In any event, such proposals would be counter-productive.  The European Union is, however, engaged in a concerted effort to ensure governments fulfil their responsibilities.</P>
        <P>Ireland will continue to work closely with our European Union partners in this area.  In 2009, the European Union General Affairs and External Relations Council issued Council conclusions on freedom of religion and belief.  The conclusions reaffirmed the strong commitment of the European Union to the promotion and protection of freedom of religion and belief.  States must ensure their legislative systems provide adequate and effective guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief to all without distinction.  Since the adoption of these European Union Council conclusions, Ireland has been working continuously with European Union partners to implement them in a meaningful way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland and the European Union have also been active on these issues at multilateral level.  Ireland has actively supported resolutions on the elimination of religious intolerance at the United Nations Human Rights Council and General Assembly.  At the most recent session of the General Assembly in October and November 2010, the European Union brought forward a resolution on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief.  Ireland co-sponsored this initiative, which passed by consensus.  In March 2009, at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Ireland co-sponsored a draft resolution on discrimination based on religion or belief and its impact on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, which reaffirmed the right to freedom of religion or belief.  In June 2010, at the Human Rights Council, the European Union successfully proposed a draft resolution on the issue of freedom of religion.  It will continue to engage in this matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to the case of Ms Asia Bibi, a Christian woman in Pakistan who has been condemned to death for blasphemy.  Ms Bibi&rsquo;s case is a cause of grave concern.  The Pakistani authorities have indicated this is the first time a death sentence has been imposed under the country&rsquo;s blasphemy law and that there has never been an execution in these circumstances.  This assurance provides cold comfort.  The European Union and senior officials of the <Col N="263"/>Department of Foreign Affairs have made clear that this is an horrific development.  The concerns expressed in the Seanad will be passed on to the Pakistani Embassy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response which recognises that this is an important issue.  I hope Ireland will support the Italian initiatives and will be at the forefront of European Union efforts in this regard.  Christians continue to be the most oppressed minority in the world.  We must ensure protection against fundamentalism is provided for Christian communities.  In this regard, I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on the need to actively support freedom of religion or belief.  We should proof all our legislation with regard to freedom of conscience.  In July last, the House had a debate which did not recognise the fundamental principle of protecting all minorities.  In this instance, the minorities in question are Christians.</P>

	<P>None of us referred to another minority faith which is suffering oppression, namely, members of the Baha&rsquo;i religion.

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Roche.  In welcoming the opportunity to raise the importance of mental health in society, I call for a unified, collective approach to growing problems in the area of mental health.  The recent budget imposed a further cut in funding for these services.  The budget for mental health as a proportion of health expenditure has been reduced from 7.9% to 5.3%.  The promise set out in the programme for Government to publish a timeframe for implementing faster access to mental health services has been put on the long finger.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the strategy, A Vision for Change, under which 8.4% of the health budget is deemed necessary to deliver an adequate service, has stalled.  The United Kingdom spends in excess of 12% of its health budget on mental health.  It is important to promulgate mental health as a serious issue because all of us in the Chamber know someone who committed suicide or is suffering from depression and myriad mental health problems, some related to the economic downturn and others to job insecurity and family circumstances.  In his role as spokesperson on mental health my Fine Gael colleague, Deputy Dan Neville, has made the connection between job loss and suicide.  The level of unemployment has trebled and the annual suicide rate increased by 24% last year, a worrying statistic.  All Members agree that we cannot put a price on a human life.</P>
        <P>I welcome the commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, and acknowledge his genuine approach.  I also welcome the commitment to the National Office for Suicide Prevention, but we need greater investment in the health budget.  This can be achieved by making savings elsewhere.  Some 1,500 nurses have left the mental health service in the past three years and the moratorium means there is no replacement of staff resulting in an inadequate staffing level.</P>
        <P>At Cork University Hospital Ward GF in the psychiatric unit has not been upgraded or received the same level of investment as other parts of the hospital.  It is important that it <Col N="264"/>receives the necessary level of funding.  Psychiatric services in Cork require urgent investment.  We have not seen significant community provision as promised in A Vision for Change.  Despite the great work of the staff who provide a tremendous service, Ward GF should be closed and a modern facility developed.  This would benefit those who require the service and treatment and help to enhance morale among staff.  It would also create a great sense that this society attaches importance to mental health issues.</P>
        <P>It is important that we protect the most vulnerable in society.  In 2009 some 200 children were admitted to adult psychiatric hospitals.  That is not good enough and must change.  I met Cork Simon Community and Samaritans which do great work with those under pressure.  There is unprecedented demand on their services.</P>
        <P>On our approach to mental health, there is a need for integration and a link between the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills to allow people to access F&Aacute;S training and become involved in education to increase their self-esteem and self-awareness.  Rather than delaying implementation of A Vision for Change, we must give hope to the forgotten in the health service.  In this regard, there is a need for firm commitments regarding mental health issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  It is important to bear in mind that A Vision for Change is a work in progress over a period of seven to ten years.  Given the current financial constraints, the maximum reduction in funding for the entire sector has been capped at 1.8%, relatively lower than in other areas.  It is a dangerous delusion for anyone in this or the other House to suggest any part of the public service is outside budgetary considerations.  There has been a significant increase in the incidence of suicide.  Members on this side of the House are conscious of the importance of the issue.</P>
        <P>Considerable strides have been made under A Vision for Change.  The mental health service is leading the way in terms of service user involvement, an area in which people were being pushed away.  The National Service Users Executive advises on issues relating to planning, delivery, evaluation and monitoring of mental health services.  It has shown significant improvements.  The NSUE report is due out soon and, while I cannot anticipate its findings, I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, is extremely pleased that it shows progress.</P>
        <P>The Senator referred to the child and adolescent service, an area which requires a special focus.  We now have 55 multidisciplinary child and adolescent mental health teams in place and a further five teams are in development.  In terms of inpatient bed capacity, the number of beds has increased from 12 in 2007 &mdash; a low base &mdash; to 52 at present.  New purpose built 20-bed units in Cork and Galway are opening this month.  Work on the second phase of the child and adolescent unit at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Fairview is due to commence this year.  We were all moved when the problem in this area became apparent a number of years ago and in difficult circumstances efforts are being made to rectify it.  It is proposed to replace the existing six-bed facility at Warrenstown, Blanchardstown, increasing capacity to 12 beds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Central to implementation of A Vision for Change is the closure of old units, a matter which can be controversial.  A number of old units will be replaced by more modern services.  One example is St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital, Grangegorman, where acute admissions have ceased following the opening of the Pine Ward in Connolly Hospital.  I remember visiting the hospital as a member of a health board and it smacked of Victorian times, notwithstanding the love and care shown by the staff.</P>
        <P>Another subject of public debate is St. Senan&rsquo;s Hospital, Enniscorthy which is due to be replaced by a more modern facility to deliver better services in Wexford and Waterford, including day hospitals, a crisis house, high support residences and a community nursing unit.  The <Col N="265"/>decision of the Mental Health Commission to attach conditions to the registration of St. Senan&rsquo;s Hospital, requiring that new acute admissions must cease by February, has necessitated the acceleration of the planned acute service reconfiguration in the south east.</P>
        <P>Plans for the transfer of acute inpatient admissions from St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital, Portrane to a new purpose built unit on the Beaumont Hospital campus are proceeding.  I am familiar with the hospital in Portrane and anyone who visited the institution was appalled.  It was an extraordinary building built in Victorian times.</P>
        <P>There are plans to reconfigure mental health services in Tipperary South.  A residential unit is under construction in Clonmel that will allow for the closure of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  It is also proposed to transfer the acute admissions facility at St. Michael&rsquo;s Unit, Clonmel to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Kilkenny.</P>
        <P>See Change &mdash; the national stigma reduction campaign &mdash; will continue this year.  The aim of the campaign is to positively change social attitudes and behaviour in order to encourage people in distress to seek help.  This will feed into the valuable work of those who are trying to prevent suicide.</P>
        <P>A Vision for Change is a work in progress and improvements will continue this year.  There is a reduction of 1.8% in funding for this sector which is relatively low compared to the figures in other sectors.  An additional &euro;1 million has been provided for the National Office for Suicide Prevention this year.  The achievements, therefore, in the mental health service are real.  The issue concerns all political parties; it is not the domain of one party.  Ireland was lagging behind in dealing with mental health issues, but we are catching up.  Improvements have been made and there is room for more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to focus on the need for a new modern facility in Cork University Hospital.  It is necessary.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s reply was comprehensive.  It is important we maintain the focus on mental health issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I should have said that the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, asked me to mention in particular that he regretted he could not be here because he has been detained in the other House.  Unfortunately, had we known about the change of time, he might have been able to be here.  He is deeply concerned about this matter.  I will convey to him the Senator&rsquo;s concern about services in Cork.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State might also mention to the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, my concern that he has not mentioned the current building programme for mental health services in Letterkenny.  There must be a form of paranoia in the north west when we think we are being ignored.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, is here to respond to the matter I am raising, that of the withdrawal of the public service obligation, PSO, for the Dublin to Derry route.  I was aware a debate was ongoing and an investigation or report was done on what PSOs, if any, should be maintained.  I spoke to the relevant Minister and a number of other Ministers on this.  I outlined the case that while improvements in road and rail links would necessitate a reduction of PSOs routes and in the need for them, the north west was not one of them, that it had not had investment in rail services or in the road network, and that the argument for the withdrawal of the PSO on the Dublin to Derry route should not be made.</P>
        <P>It is with absolute disgust and total shame that I read an e-mail last week which announced that the PSO for Derry would be withdrawn while other PSOs should remain in place.  I under<Col N="266"/>stand we have made very tough decisions in this House and the other one to achieve economies, and they have been made on the basis of the lack of moneys available.  I tabled this Adjournment matter to ask why it was determined the PSO service for Derry was inappropriate when it has remained appropriate for other places to have such a service.</P>
        <P>We all know the Government has invested in services.  It has invested in the expansion of Derry Airport, in the PSO down the years and in the Dublin to Belfast rail service.  It has been the Northern Ministers and the current Minister, Conor Murphy, MLA, who have neglected the Coleraine to Derry section of the rail service.  Not many people in the South know that one can take a train from Dublin to Derry but the problem is that it takes a minimum of five hours to get there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We accept the Government has invested serious money in the A5 road project and we know that project is developing.  Minor complaints have been made from landowners but we know the major concern road users have is that they do not have access to even a dual carriageway that they were promised.  We did not get the motorway that was built from Dublin to Waterford, Dublin to Cork, Dublin to Limerick, Dublin to Galway, Dublin to Sligo or Dublin to Belfast.  All we got was a promise of a dual carriageway.  Deputy Costello of the Labour Party has said that if his party gets into office, that project will not happen.</P>
        <P>We are in power now and there is a possibility that we will not be in power in a few months&rsquo; time.  The Northern Ministers are not delivering on the train service, the Labour Party has promised it will not deliver on the A5 road project and the Government has pulled the PSO from the Dublin to Derry air service.  I hope there is a valid reason for it and that there is a commercial reason for this PSO not to be pulled.  I  am the person who fought the corner initially with the then Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, and every successive Minister for Transport.  I sat down with Michael O&rsquo;Leary, Padraig O&rsquo;Ceidigh and all the operators and begged them to fly into Derry Airport.  It is galling for me after almost 15 years in national politics to see the PSO being pulled on this route.  The issue is not the pulling of the PSO but the timing of it.</P>
        <P>The Derry city of culture year is approaching, we have had the Clipper stopover and we have had many acknowledgements of what is important for the north west and its main city of Derry.  This year will mark the 400th anniversary of Letterkenny, and how will we celebrate it?  Rather than increasing the access for people to get to the north west for 2011, 2012 and 2013, we are telling them we are closing shop.  We are closing down the access to the region.  It is simply not acceptable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope there is an argument and a reason for this.  I could read the Minister of State the e-mails I have got from the people who use that flight route.  I can hear their despair.  Those people who leave Derry to come to Dublin on business do not have the opportunity to make a return journey by public transport.  I hope we have answers for them.  I hope the people of Donegal ask serious questions about the future Government of the Labour Party and Fine Gael, about which everyone is talking, which will pull the money allocated for road projects.  We accept that sensible economies need to be made.  We are not against Donegal Airport maintaining its investment but we ask what makes the people in the east of Donegal who use Derry City Airport different.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I fully appreciate the Senator&rsquo;s passion and concern about this matter.  I was checking some details in the reply provided by the Department.  The Minister for Transport assures me he fully appreciates the concerns raised in regard to the recent decision that has been made on the PSO route.  The decision involved the Government&rsquo;s agreement to support the continuation of a PSO route between Donegal and Dublin and between Kerry and Dublin.  In line with the value for money review of Exchequer expenditure on the regional <Col N="267"/>airports programme, the Government also agreed to cease requiring PSO routes between Dublin and Sligo, Knock, Galway and Derry from July this year.</P>
        <P>In the context of a regional strategy, the Government decision took account of recent improvements in alternative transport modes, the change in EU legislation covering PSO services, the completion of the value for money review and the requirement to make best use of scarce Exchequer resources.  The review, published on 12 January last, involved extensive consultations with a wide range of stakeholders, including the regional airports, the Border, midlands and west regional assembly, IDA Ireland, the IAA, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Aer Arann and Ryanair.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recommending that the Derry PSO be discontinued, the review noted that the numbers of passengers on this route have been falling consistently since 2006.  In the past three years, passengers on the service have accounted for between 5% and 6% of total passengers at the airport.  Derry has also been the second most expensive route in terms of funding per passenger.  The cost per passenger has ranged from &euro;89 in 2006 to a peak of &euro;111 in 2009.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Derry has good air service connectivity to other destinations which, according to the review, account for 30% to 40% of total passengers in the past three years.  Members of the public in the region wishing to travel to Dublin can, as the Senator mentioned, avail of the PSO flight from Dublin to Donegal or Donegal to Dublin.</P>

	<P>They are an hour and a half away from that airport.</P>

	<P>Alternatively, they can journey by road where road improvements on the N2 have reduced travel times significantly.</P>
        <P>In the context of the St. Andrews Agreement leading to the restoration of the Northern Executive in 2007, the Irish Government made a commitment to provide funding of sterling &pound;400 million.  This will contribute to a roads investment programme for Northern Ireland which includes the upgrading of the A5 road from Aughnacloy to Derry-Letterkenny to dual carriageway standard.  Progress to date on development of the A5 project has been good with all scheme milestones met on schedule.  The third key project milestone, publication of draft orders, was achieved in November 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Senator mentioned, the Belfast-Derry train upgrade is a matter for the Northern Ireland authorities.  Overall, the Minister for Transport believes that the combination of an improved surface transport network together with a more consolidated air service network to regional airports, along with the State airports at Cork, Shannon and Dublin, provides the necessary transport arrangements to underpin sustainable development.  The Irish Government has made a significant investment in Derry Airport, as the Senator acknowledged, in recent years through the PSO route and in funding development works at the airport.  It is hoped that this funding will assist in securing a commercially strong airport which benefits the North and north west of the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s answer.  Am I right that the review that involved extensive consultations with the BMW regional assembly, IDA Ireland, the IAA, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Aer Arann and Ryanair recommended that the PSO be discontinued?  That is how it reads.  For it to say 5% to 6% of total passengers are going elsewhere other than to Dublin makes sense when London is a major hub.  I draw the Minister of Transport&rsquo;s attention and that of his officials to the fact that it would be quicker for me to fly to London and back to Dublin than it would be to drive to most parts of the area being serviced by Donegal Airport.  That is no reflection on Donegal Airport.  That is a reflection on the size of the county.</P><Col N="268"/>
        <P>It is unacceptable to say the Northern authorities are in charge of the Belfast to Derry train service.  There should be a Dublin to Derry train service, which would be a European cross-frontier train service that could attract funding if anyone was interested in looking for it.</P>
        
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will take those points back to the Minister because I will write to the stakeholders to ask what case they made for the retention of the PSO because it appears they made the case to get rid of it and that is a scandal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s concerns to the Minister.  It may not be correct to suggest the consultations with the BMW regional assembly, IDA Ireland and other authorities I mentioned led directly to this.  It was simply a reference to the fact there were consultations with them.  It is a harsh reality that the per passenger costs on the route were significant at &euro;111.20.  It is a tender issue but it is, nonetheless, an imposition on taxpayers at a difficult time.  I will ask the Minister to pay attention to the specific points made by the Senator.</P>
