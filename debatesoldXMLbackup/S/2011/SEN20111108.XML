	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; sc&eacute;ala faighte agam &oacute; Cheann Comhairimh Toghch&aacute;in an Uachtar&aacute;in a chur in i&uacute;l dom go ndearna s&iacute;, ar an 29 Deireadh F&oacute;mhair 2011, a dhearbh&uacute; Michael D. Higgins a bheith tofa ina Uachtar&aacute;n ar &Eacute;irinn.</P>
        <P>I have received a communication from the presidential election returning officer informing me that she has, on 29 October 2011, declared Michael D. Higgins to have been elected President of Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take the opportunity to warmly congratulate the President-elect, Mr. Michael D. Higgins.  He was first nominated to this House by the then Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, in 1973 and also served with great distinction in the 17th Seanad from 1983 to 1987 where he excelled in his contributions on matters of social justice and equality.  He used the House to highlight many humanitarian issues in places such as Nicaragua and El Salvador.  On my own behalf and on that of the House, I wish him, his wife, Sabina, and family every best wish for his term as the ninth President of Ireland.  It is appropriate that the leaders of the various groups and parties in the Seanad be allowed to make a brief statement to express their good wishes.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On my own behalf and that of the House, I warmly congratulate Mr. Michael D. Higgins on his election as the ninth President of Ireland.  Following a long and distinguished career in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, Mr. Michael D. Higgins brings to the Office of President a wealth of experience and knowledge that will render him an excellent President and ambassador for Ireland.  Over the course of his long and distinguished career as a poet, scholar, academic and public servant, including as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, he has made a significant contribution over the years.  He is equally well known as a champion of causes of social justice and equality both nationally and internationally.  I had the experience of working with him on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and know him to be a man of integrity and intellect, qualities that will serve him well in his new role as Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann.  His considerable experience and passionate commitment to social justice are exactly the attributes we need in our Head of State.  I have no doubt that he will make a very valuable contribution to the Office of President in the next seven years.</P>

	<P Just="Left">D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas le Michael D. &Oacute; hUig&iacute;nn mar Uachtar&aacute;n tofa na h&Eacute;ireann.  I had the pleasure of serving with him on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and I agree wholeheartedly with the Leader of the House.  His record in human rights and standing up for those who need our assistance, the weaker people in our society and across the world is exceptional.  I have no doubt that he will perform his duties as President to the highest level of his ability and will do us all proud.  He has had a distinguished career in both Houses &mdash; the Seanad and D&aacute;il.  Given how he conducted himself during the presidential election campaign, and as a legislator and a champion for the oppressed, it is clear he will do our country proud.  On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I wish him well on taking up his post on Friday.  I have no doubt that he will be an excellent President and will continue the excellent work done by an tUachtar&aacute;n, Mary McAleese, and her predecessor, Mary Robinson.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join the Cathaoirleach and the other party leaders in congratulating Mr. Michael D. Higgins, our ninth President.  He has had a long and distinguished career in both the Seanad and D&aacute;il as well as in the Cabinet and representing Ireland abroad in different capacities.  I am particularly proud to stand here and welcome his election on behalf of the Labour group of Senators.  Each of the 12 Labour Party Senators nominated Mr. Michael D. Higgins personally.  He was nominated by Labour Oireachtas Members and as a party we are very happy to have nominated him.  As he said at the count in Dublin Castle, he will of course be a President for all the people.  I know he will be a President of whom we will all be proud, not just those who canvassed for him, but also those who did not and supported others.  He will be a President who will make us all proud and will represent Ireland abroad with dignity, integrity and honour.  I am very proud to be able to welcome his election.  I wish him, his wife, Sabina, and their family very well.</P>

	<P Just="Left">With my colleagues in the Independent group I extend warm congratulations to the President elect, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, known affectionately throughout Ireland as Michael D.  No doubt he is inspired by his love of poetry, the arts and the Irish language.  Michael D. Higgins was an innovative and visionary Minister for the Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  He has been a consistent champion of human rights and social justice and equality in Ireland and internationally.  Michael D. Higgins is currently adjunct professor of the Irish Centre for Human Rights in Galway and with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Attorney General is a past student of NUI Galway.  He has spoken of the importance of inter-generational solidarity and of the important role young people will play in his Presidency as he works to shape Ireland&rsquo;s future.  He has also indicated his intention to focus on young people on the margins of society, in particular those in institutional care and to visit normally closed institutions.  I believe these are excellent signals for his presidential term.  I wish him the best in his well deserved role as Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh le Miche&aacute;l D. &Oacute; hUiginn, Uachtar&aacute;n tofa, lena bhean ch&eacute;ile, Sabina, agus lena chlann go l&eacute;ir.  I am pleased our ninth President will be, Michael D. Higgins, a friend of many years standing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I got to know Michael D. Higgins through our mutual friend, the late Dr. Noel Browne.  Michael D. Higgins and I were the only two public representatives to attend the funeral of Dr. Browne in Galway, which I thought quite extraordinary.  Perhaps that is because the late Dr. <Col N="175"/>Noel Browne, Michael D. Higgins and I stand for the liberal agenda.  I am glad that those who did not want a liberal as President now find themselves somewhat discomforted.  There is no doubt but that Michael D. Higgins comes from the great liberal tradition that cherishes equality, human rights, decency and fair treatment for all citizens.  He is also a thinker.  I was dismayed to hear people suggest during the election campaign that philosophers and philosophy were all wrong and were somehow above or beneath the people.  I believe the people have a deep hunger for wise ideas which they and I believe we get from Michael D. Higgins.</P>
        <P>I am glad that 67% of my second preference votes went to Michael D. Higgins.  That helped to get him elected.  As far as I am concerned that was the positive element of the entire election process.  If one looks back at Michael D. Higgins&rsquo;s record, he epitomises excellent and unique qualities in Ireland, in particular his devotion to the Irish language, which is not just lip-service.  Michael D. is a fluent and beautiful speaker and writer of the Irish language.  He is also a poet, a thinker, an academic and a person who probes ideas and is not afraid of examining them, which is extremely important for this country at this time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Michael D. Higgins will be a great President, one with an interest in human rights and equality.  He is also always gentlemanly.  There was very little that was unpleasant or unsavoury in the discussions between the candidates of the presidential election, although I cannot say that in respect of all sections of society.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  Throughout the entire campaign, Michael D. Higgins behaved with graciousness, dignity and generosity, which is a good indication of the manner in which he will behave as President of Ireland.  I look forward to attending his inauguration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party, I extend a warm comhghairdeas to Michael D. Higgins, whom I believe will be an outstanding President for all the people of Ireland.  I have no doubt that he will bring his unique qualities and attributes to the job of President.  He will most certainly be a President of whom we can all be proud.  It is hoped he will be a President that will inspire people, in particular young people.  Given the current situation in which we find ourselves we need leaders to inspire.  I believe Michael D. Higgins is one such leader.  I am proud the people voted in large numbers for him and that he will be our President.  As I stated, I have no doubt he will be an outstanding President for this country and for people outside of Ireland, including the Irish Diaspora in whom I know Michael D. Higgins has a fond interest.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the reform of the junior certificate, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 5.45 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons, who may share time, not to exceed eight minutes, to be followed by questions to the Minister from the floor during which Senators are asked to confine themselves to one minute when asking questions; No. 2, statements on recent developments in the eurozone, to be taken at 5.45 p.m. and conclude not later than7.15 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed five minutes, to be followed by questions to the Minister.  In order to allow as many Members as possible to ask questions, I ask that questioners be confined to one minute each.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With regard to the proposed appointment of Mr. Kevin Cardiff to the European Court of Auditors, I remind the House the purpose of the European Court of Auditors is to ensure that EU taxpayers receive maximum value for their money.  The court has the right to check and audit any person or organisation handling EU funds and frequently carries out on-the-spot checks.  I ask if the Government can confirm who proposed Mr. Cardiff for the vacancy arising next February.  Does the Government still support the proposal for Mr. Cardiff to take up that post?  I note in a statement today from the Department of Finance that the Government fully supports the proposed appointment.  The Leader will note the concerns raised by his colleagues and the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s colleagues in Europe, which are shared by both me and my party.  I question the appointment of a person to the European Court of Auditors who presided over &euro;3.6 billion being unaccounted for in the Department of Finance.  This is beyond belief.  When will the Government withdraw the nomination of Mr. Cardiff in order to counteract the embarrassment which will be brought upon the country should he go for interview?  I expect a direct response because the Government cannot and should not proceed with this nomination.  It is as plain as the nose on one&rsquo;s face.  This charade should cease <Col N="177"/>and the Government should look elsewhere or else consider extending the tenure of the individual in the position who has done a superb job.</P>
        <P>Mr. Draghi has recently been appointed as head of the European Central Bank.  The 0.25% reduction in the interest rate is very welcome as is a further interest rate cut to the base ECB rate.  A number of institutions such as Bank of Scotland Ireland, Irish Nationwide, Permanent TSB, KBC and EBS have announced they will be passing on this rate reduction to variable mortgage holders and this is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>We heard yesterday, and it was reported today, that National Irish Bank intends to increase its variable mortgage rate by 1% rather than decrease it.  This will affect 200,000 variable mortgage holders.  I am sure all colleagues in the House find that decision disgraceful.  I also find disgraceful the silence of the two Government-supported institutions, Bank of Ireland, which also covers the ICS, and AIB.  Hundreds of thousands of other mortgage holders are anxiously waiting to see whether these institutions will pass on the rate cuts.  In its programme for Government, the Government promised that banks in receipt of State support would be forced to forego 25 basis points increase on their variable mortgage rates.  Already this year we have seen two rate increases for variable mortgage holders with nothing being subsumed, as was promised by the Government.  There has been complete inaction on this.  The Financial Regulator, Mr. Elderfield raised this issue three months ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, to call for a special debate to be held in this House to find out what contact there has been between Government and, specifically, AIB and Bank of Ireland, into both of which taxpayers&rsquo; money has been paid to keep them afloat.  Mortgage holders are still being crucified but we have control over those two banks.  I remind the Government it promised faithfully to increase to 30% mortgage interest relief for those who bought houses between 2004 and 2008.  That has not happened although there was a sop by way of the Keane report.  I was told by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, that we will have resolutions before the budget.  What are the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance doing now?  Only this week, the Minister stated, by response to the rate cut&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien, will you attend to the amendment, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The amendment to the Order of Business proposes that the Minister for Finance attend the House to explain to Members and the people what the Government is doing to ensure that State-funded banks which have had billions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money paid into them to keep them afloat will pass on this rate cut, when they will do so, and also what they propose in regard to a further rate cut that will probably come down the track before Christmas. We cannot wait for the Christmas to act on the mortgage crisis.  It has been in office for nine months and has done nothing.</P>

        <P Just="Left">On the Senator&rsquo;s comment on National Irish Bank, I believe all Members, on both sides of the House, condemn the failure or refusal of any institutions, in particular those receiving State money, to pass on interest rate cuts.  It is outrageous that they refuse to do so &mdash; not only has National Irish Bank so refused but it has indicated it will increase rates, which is outrageous.  However, the Taoiseach has indicated that, if necessary, he will introduce legislation to require these institutions to pass on interest rates to their customers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be grateful if the Leader would bring the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the House to outline the Government&rsquo;s current foreign policy objectives and, in particular, to explain the thinking behind the decision to close Ireland&rsquo;s embassy in the Holy See.  I do not know if the Minister plays tennis, but I think this one will go down as an unforced error.  At a time when our economic and political sovereignty is very circumscribed, the last thing we should be doing is closing our embassies.</P>
        <P>Given the relatively low cost of maintaining our embassy in the Holy See, it beggars belief that it is being closed.  It is important to remember that for Catholics and non-Catholics alike, the Holy See remains an important centre in international diplomacy.  One need only think of the stands that were taken on the Iraq war, the campaign to ban landmines and the recent NATO intervention in Libya.</P>
        <P>I am open to correction when I say that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has access to approximately 40 permanent diplomatic missions and that some 80 missions are accredited to the Holy See.  When one closes an embassy and becomes a non-resident, one closes off one&rsquo;s access to the state in question, to some degree, one&rsquo;s access to the other ambassadors and missions that are accredited to that state and one&rsquo;s access to third countries.  This is a very foolish thing for Ireland to be doing.  I have not even begun to address the needless hurt it has caused to many Catholics in this country.  I wonder how the message that the Government has gone hostile on the church will play in certain sections of Irish America.</P>
        <P>Irish people can see the wood from the trees.  They can have their views and they are right to have them.  There have been many controversies in recent times.  Hard things have been said and needed to be said.  That is different from breaking off long-established ties that have been of great value to this country.  I have mentioned that Ireland and the Holy See walked the same road during the campaign on landmines and the jubilee campaign, which sought the abolition of debt in advance of the millennium.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This a very short-sighted decision.  I ask for it to be revisited.  The Minister has claimed that this is being done for economic reasons.  He should specify to this House the economic circumstances in which it would be proposed to reopen the embassy.  I look forward to an early engagement between this House and the Minister.</P>

        <P>I am concerned about the main story in <i>The Irish Times</i> today about a cap on student numbers proposed for third level.  That is a serious proposal and the Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, must tread carefully before he goes down this road.  Approximately 400,000 of our people are out of work and if third level education was not an option for them that figure would be far greater.  If the Minister was to proceed on this issue it would drive points upwards and put our students under further pressure.  It is probable also that more private colleges would emerge.  It is time the Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, grasped this nettle and examined a funding mechanism that is equitable and fair but I do not agree with a cap on student numbers.</P>
        <P>I, too, refer to the importance of passing on the European Central Bank rate cuts.  Home owners and families are under incredible pressure in terms of debt and the last thing we want is the banks in this jurisdiction holding on to the rate cut.  It must be passed on.</P>

	<P>Second, I would like the Leader to discuss a matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Shane McEntee.  The Minister of State came into the House some weeks ago and stated that the Wildlife (Amendment) Act was to be amended in regard to stag hunting.  I am a Member of this House partially because of that issue but the reality is that when the media queried that issue with the Government Press Office yesterday they were told that the Minister of State was only expressing an opinion in this House and not Government policy.  That raises serious questions about the functions of debates in this House and what Ministers say here.  Are they giving their own personal opinions or telling us what is Government policy?  Are we debating Government policy with them or their own personal opinions?  I would like the Leader to respond to that issue.</P>
        <P>We need a debate on foreign policy.  Foreign policy used to revolve around a number of issues such as peacemaking, making networks and other issues apart from economic return.  I was concerned to see that embassies are being closed on the basis of economic return.  Our own predecessor on this side of the House, Frank Aiken, saw foreign policy as more than just about economic return.  If other nations applied that to us we might see many embassies closing down here.  It is not just about economic return.  We need a full debate on this because I do not believe it is the tradition of the Labour Party that foreign policy is conducted solely on the basis of economic return.  I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Brien.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I would also like to welcome Senator Norris back to the House again.  Many here are disappointed that he is back in the House; not because he is not welcome, but because we thought he might be in a different house on this occasion.  I would like to add my words of welcome to the President elect, Michael D. Higgins.  He will add great stature to that house.  He is following in the footsteps of people who have done a wonderful job in the past, but I am sure he will enhance that role in the future.  It is also an honour for this House, as he is a former Member of the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I have been involved in quite a few building projects in the last 50 years and we always got the work done by employing an architect or an engineer to ensure that the building work went ahead correctly.  I say this because I am concerned at the reduction in the number of clerks of works for State and county council contracts from 4,000 to 120 in the last few years.  This means that when an architect or an engineer commissions a builder to do work for the county council or the State &mdash; I am not too worried about private contracts between parties, because they can look after themselves &mdash; I would assume they inspect that the work is actually going ahead.  If clerks of works are not employed, the likelihood is that the work is not being checked.  In other <Col N="184"/>words, the architect or the engineer designs the work, commissions the work, and then assumes it is done and comes back and looks at it later.  If the builder decides to take a short cut and nobody is there to inspect that the work is being done, then what happened in Priory Hall and many other building sites is likely to happen again.</P>
        <P>There is a need for something to happen here.  I am not sure of the answer, but if the number of clerks of works has been reduced from 4,000 to 120, then it is fairly clear that work is likely to have gone ahead uninspected and the sort of problems we have had in Priory Hall and elsewhere are likely to continue.  The Minister responsible for this area should come in here and answer that issue for us, and at least investigate it and see if it is taking place.</P>
        <P>I would also add my voice to those Senators who called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come in here for a debate, with the principal agenda of the closing of embassies.  Let us make sure this does not just happen on a whim.  I am in danger of thinking the closing of the embassy in the Vatican is a whim rather than anything else while leaving embassies open such as those in Lesotho and Malawi.  There is a much closer relationship between the people of Ireland and the Holy See than in the case of some of the other embassies.  The word has been correctly expressed by Senators Byrne and Mullen as to the need and benefits of that relationship.  We should not allow this to happen on the whim of one person or one Government.   It should take place after a discussion and this is the perfect House for that discussion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I would welcome a debate on the appointment of the nominee to the Court of Auditors.  The information I am getting from Brussels is that there is no enthusiasm for this appointment and it is important that there is a debate in this House.  There is a draft report from the committee on budgetary control in Brussels which is being considered and it will go through the full course if the nomination proceeds.  It is important that we in this House have a debate on who we send to a very important role at European level.  This is about accountability.</P>
        <P>One of the issues I dealt with in my short time in Brussels was cross-border health care.  In Ireland we set up the treatment abroad procedure whereby if someone requires such treatment he or she has to get clearance before travelling and availing of that treatment abroad.  I have come across a case where a person has been referred by a hospital consultant for treatment abroad.  This person applied for clearance from the treatment abroad fund and received a response that the cover would not be given as the treatment is available in Ireland.  I wrote to the relevant authorities on Thursday asking where in Ireland this treatment was available.  I received a short and to the point response on Friday saying it is not their responsibility to identify where in Ireland that treatment is available.  This is from a HSE official.  I do not think this is good enough.  This is about accountability.  Our role in government and in whatever public service job we do is to work towards resolving problems rather than creating them.</P>

	<P>That has to change.  My question is on a different issue and I will get to it.</P>
        <P>I support the call by Senator Mullen to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the House to discuss the closure of the embassies, but also the disgraceful treatment of 14 Irish citizens on board the <i>MV Saoirse</i>.  These people were essentially abducted by the State of Israel and brought to a port in Israel.  They have been held there since.  They were asked to sign deportation papers which would have been an acknowledgment on their part that they entered Israel illegally.  They had no intention of going to Israel.  They were abducted from their boat.  High-pressure water hoses were used on some of those on the boat.  They were on a humanitarian mission to bring much-needed aid to the people of Gaza.</P>
        <P>We have had a number of discussions in this House about cross-party motions on Palestine and its place in the world and the UN.  We have an appalling humanitarian crisis in Gaza.  When in opposition the T&aacute;naiste described Gaza as a giant open air prison.  The leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Martin, was also in Gaza and described the conditions as appalling.  The president of Sinn F&eacute;in was in Gaza and also described the conditions as appalling.  This is one of the issues on which there is cross-party support.  It is important that all Members and all voices unite on this issue to put pressure on the Israeli Government to lift the siege and the embargo in place on Gaza.  It is strangling the people and causing untold misery and suffering to the people of Gaza and Palestine.  It is important for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come to the House and have the discussion on that issue and other issues raised by previous Senators.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader please bring to the attention of the Minister for Health what appears to be an ongoing disconnect and a glaring gap between the stated ministerial and Department of Health policy and the realities of the roll-out of health services?  Last week, the Minister stated in good faith and following advice from his officials that it takes 15 days to turn around a medical card application.  In reality, everyone knows this is absolutely far from the truth.  My concern is the unilateral policy of the Health Services Executive to close down public wards and beds in public nursing homes such as in Abbeyleix District Hospital, Ofalia House, Riada House, St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospital, Shaen and Mountmellick hospital.  The reality is that this appears to be totally at odds and at variance with the stated policy of the Government and the Minister.  It is forcing elderly people in their 80s and 90s in Abbeyleix District Hospital to seek accommodation in private nursing homes.  Last night, I was at a public meeting of upwards of 1,500 people, many of whom were in serious distress.  One man in the hospital is due to celebrate his 100th birthday on 16 December.  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to rein in the HSE.  There is no HIQA report and there is no problem with the hospital.  There are no health and safety, clinical or health provision issues.  This is purely a book balancing exercise and the most vulnerable in our society should not have to pick up the tab for it.  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to rein in the HSE and request that it operates under the policy he has set down.</P>

	<P>While it is understandable that many tributes should be paid to the new President-elect, a more important event took place at the weekend which I wish to put on the record of the House.  I congratulate Sligo Rovers on winning the FAI cup final.  In the scheme of things a famous manager said once that the sport was more important than life or death.  I endorse all that has been said about our former colleague and the now President-elect, Mr. Higgins.  Like several of those who have spoken, I had the pleasure of serving with him on the foreign affairs committee and of travelling with him on several occasions.  He is an extraordinary man who will bring a new dimension to the presidency.  I am sure there will be an opportunity for the House to pay tribute to the outgoing President, Mary McAleese, and Senator Martin McAleese for the outstanding job they have done as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader invite the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to the House to discuss further the job losses announced at the Bank of America facility at Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim?  Yesterday, the company announced that a further 100 jobs would be lost.  This is on top of 60 compulsory redundancies announced at the time the company stated it would withdraw its credit card service in Carrick-on-Shannon in August.  The air of cloud or gloom around Carrick-on-Shannon since August has darkened considerably in the past 24 hours as uncertainly continues to mount upon uncertainty.  The only person who appears to have some insight into the thinking of those in the Bank of America corporate entity is the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  I commend him on his proactive stance.  He met the workers and the Irish executives in August and, while in America, he also met Bank of America executives based there.  I commend him on this work but this is why I call on the Minister to come to the House to clarify exactly what he believes to be the agenda of the company.</P>
        <P>Will there be a continuing haemorrhage of jobs to the point where it will become more attractive as a corporate takeover?  As the Cathaoirleach and all Members will be aware, whenever there are corporate takeovers they are followed inevitably by job losses.  There were 700 plus jobs under threat and now with the reduction of 100 staff the figure is down to 600.  Will we see a drip-drip effect in the coming months while whoever takes over the company is being sorted out?  It is unfair to the workers, their families and the wider economy.  I want to empathise with those who have lost their jobs.  Even one job loss brings personal misery.  I hope the Leader will accede to my request in light of the very serious nature of the announcement made yesterday.</P>
        <P>I endorse all that has been said in asking for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come to the House to discuss the closure of the Vatican embassy.  It is a bad day for Ireland.</P>

Young people are following the lead of older people.  It is a serious issue which needs to be put on the agenda in a serious way by the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I join Senator O&rsquo;Brien in his comments on National Irish Bank.  It has some neck.  It is outrageous that banks see fit to disregard what the Taoiseach of the country has said he would like to happen.  He said if the banks do not pass on the cuts we will have to bring in legislation. <Col N="187"/> If we have to do that it will be done quickly.  I do not know if it can be done this week and it is not my position to say.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As a neutral observer of the sometimes acrimonious altercations between Opposition and Government, can the Government make a statement indicating precisely what are the differences between this and the previous Administration?  It seems there is no difference at all.  I have a great deal of sympathy for Senator Bacik because she must be experiencing a very unpleasant sensation of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>.  She introduced a climate change Bill in the last session and was advised by Friends of the Earth, which issued a strong statement condemning the Government.  It does not swallow the situation.  It was obvious during the final days of the last Administration the junior partner was rolled over on by the Government.  It might happen to the Labour Party as well.  What are the differences?</P>
        <P>With regard to the Keane report which was mentioned, I have raised the issue in public.  The inquiry comprised 22 members, including 17 civil servants, three members of the Central Bank, one representative from AIB, one from the EBS and none from New Beginning or representatives of the people who are actually feeling the pinch.  Once again, the good old establishment ignored people who are actually experiencing difficulties.  The principal recommendation was that MABS be upgraded.  We already know it is under financed, under resourced and cannot do the work.  It was a cosmetic procedure.  It is rubbish.  It is like Tweedledum and Tweedledee, and I and the decent people of Ireland would like to know the difference.</P>
        <P>In regard to the bondholders, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, were supposed to do all kinds of wonderful things but have done absolutely nothing.  Our money is being poured down the drain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I join colleagues in raising the issue of the disastrous abuse of alcohol in our society.  I am pleased that not only the Taoiseach, but also the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, have indicated their intention to take action in this regard.  They are talking the talk, and I hope they will walk the walk.  There has been an increase of 145% in the number of people under 18 years presenting at hospitals with alcohol-related injuries.  In County Donegal last month, for example, 26 young people were hospitalised in one weekend as a consequence of alcohol abuse.  An important factor in this problem is below-cost selling and promotions by alcohol retailers.  Will the Government, in its consideration of the Seanad, examine whether it is appropriate in these circumstances, given the damage arising from the unwise use of alcohol, to have a representative in this House nominated by vintners?  I would contend that it is not.</P>

        <P>I join Senator John Whelan in calling on the Minister for Health to address the privatisation of nursing homes.  I am afraid that Abbeyleix might not be a one-off situation.  We have a similar situation in the St. Francis nursing home in Galway.  It is not necessarily just an HSE issue but may also be a policy of the Government to move towards privatised old people&rsquo;s services.  We certainly do not agree with that and would like a full debate on the matter.  Next time the Minister for Health comes to the House we would prefer to have more than 40 seconds to question him on such issues.</P>

        <P>This morning the North West Alcohol Forum in conjunction with the north west regional drugs task force launched a report, entitled Hidden Realities, which highlights the concerns we have had about alcohol for many years.  The report specifically investigates children&rsquo;s exposure to risk from parental drinking, much of which takes place in the home.  While there is much in the report, it highlights that when children, who have been physically abused by their parents as a consequence of alcohol, present in hospital, the role that alcohol plays in that abuse is not noted in the hospital report or in the report that goes to social workers thereafter.  That could be done easily and would not cost money.  It would raise the profile of the issue in hospitals and give us a clearer picture of where and among whom the alcohol abuse is occurring and therefore allow more cost-effective decisions to be made on spending money on the protection of children.  Without statistics and information, we cannot make those decisions.  The Minister for Health and-or the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs should review that as a matter of urgency with the HSE.</P>

I, too, look forward to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade coming to the House to discuss this matter, in particular the closure of our embassy in the Holy See, an important posting in the Villa Spada.  The connections and diplomacy in this regard are important.  I am glad there will be no diminution in diplomatic relations as the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will act as our ambassador in the Holy See, although, admittedly, non-resident.  However, I wish it could be otherwise.  We must, out of respect, hear the Minister on this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our embassy in the Holy See is the State&rsquo;s oldest diplomatic connection.  Let us wait to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter.  Another issue close to my heart in this regard is our diplomat, the late great Monsignor Hugh O&rsquo;Flaherty, the Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican, a Killarney man, a man from the Kingdom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We must acknowledge the good work done.  The memorial weekend was recently held, at which the fifth humanitarian award was presented.  Perhaps Senators would like to join me next year in Killarney.  I extend an invitation to all for that weekend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s time has expired.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to come before us to discuss this and all of the aspects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade come to the House.  I concur with Senator Cullinane regarding the suffering of the Palestinian people at the hands of Israel.  Senators will recall it is not so long ago since Israel used forged passports for its citizens to carry out its murderous deeds.  We were all outraged at the time but we still did not interfere with diplomatic relations as a result of that.  There are many countries with whom we disagree on issues of human rights but we understand that the role of diplomacy is to keep dialogue going.  I find it ironic, therefore, that we would consider closing the embassy at the Vatican, particularly when one considers the tradition and the history attached to that relationship.  I fully echo what Senator Coghlan said when he mentionedMonsignor Flaherty.  We are all so proud of that connection.  I know from speaking to people they are absolutely astounded at the suggestion that this embassy would be closed.  In my view it is disingenuous to put it in the same context as the closure of an embassy in Iran and also in East Timor.  There has to be an underlying message in the manner in which it is being handled.  If there is not an underlying message &mdash; let us be generous in our judgment &mdash; then it is perceived, first of all by the people here who will be deeply hurt, Catholic and non-Catholic, on the island and also our 70 million people of the Irish diaspora spread throughout the world who have received this cold message.  How will they feel and how will they explain it to the people with whom they come into contact?  There is a chance to correct this and a chance to remedy it because nobody will believe or accept that it is about saving money. There is a deeper underlying message.  It is the wrong time for that message because it hits at our very sovereignty at this time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have had many opportunities and availed of them to compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on different issues because he is a man for whom I have great respect and admiration.  However, I am saddened, disappointed and shocked at what is happening in this case.  I am glad to see some utterances even from the far side.  I ask the Cathaoirleach and the Leader to please have the Minister come to the House as soon as possible and le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;, we can correct and remedy this before too much damage is done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryBrennan"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to a subject which is close to my own heart.  Pharmacists are allegedly imposing mark-ups of between 70% and 350% on the wholesale price of prescription drugs for private customers, resulting in medicine costing significantly more than in other EU countries.  In light of these prices, many people are travelling north of the Border to avail of less expensive medicines resulting in a significant loss to the Irish Exchequer as well as collateral damage to other businesses losing shopping customers in the Republic.</P>
        <P>I am aware of two families from the midlands of this country who travel to the North once a month.  They live in two different counties in the midlands and they travel to the North for better value from pharmacists.  They fill their cars with groceries to make the journey worthwhile.  We should do what we can.  The unnecessary and unjustifiable cost to the Exchequer of inflated medicines in situations where the State is meeting the cost of prescription medicines is another factor that must be investigated.   Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, to attend the House at his earliest convenience to make a statement outlining the steps <Col N="194"/>he is taking to tackle the enormous mark-up imposed on essential medicines by pharmacies, and to state what progress has been made in delivering better value for prescription medicines for members of the public?</P>

I also congratulate Mr. Higgins&rsquo;s colleagues in the Labour Party, and our colleague, Senator David Norris, whom I am glad to see back in the House.  He had a number of challenging weeks during what can be described as a challenging campaign for all the candidates.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise two issues, the first relating to the amendment to the Order of Business dealing with the whole issue of mortgage debt and interest rate reductions not being passed on by a number of institutions in the country, even though it was both a cornerstone of the programme for Government and one of the pre-election promises by both the Labour Party and Fine Gael that this should happen.  It has not happened, which makes a broken promise in anybody&rsquo;s language.  We need a debate.</P>
        <P>I agree with the very sensible comments of Senator Conway.  I have stated in the House we need to hold the public interest directors of all financial institutions to account.  They are the representatives of the taxpayers of this country on the boards of those banks and they must be held to account.  If they are not fulfilling their obligation they must be sidestepped.</P>

        <P>I will not push the matter to a vote today but I ask the Leader to take on board No. 16, motion No. 5, on the Order Paper which relates to the issue of septic tanks.  Disgraceful legislation is being introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  This is an outright, categoric attack on every house in rural Ireland.

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but I hope that if it closes it will be only a temporary arrangement, given this country&rsquo;s links there.  The Vatican is one of the oldest states in Europe and has made a great contribution to European civilisation including what it did for the preservation of democracy in France and Italy after the Second World War.  If we cannot fund the Villa Spada we could have a more modest embassy.  It is not the size of the embassy that counts but the presence of our mission to the Vatican.</P>

We will endeavour to have a debate on the matter at an early stage. </P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Taoiseach have asked the banks to pass on the reduction in the rates to their customers.  The Taoiseach has said that legislation will be introduced, if necessary, to compel them to do so.</P>

        <P>Senators Mullen, Byrne, Quinn, Mooney, Leyden, Coghlan, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Jim D&rsquo;Arcy referred to the proposal to close Ireland&rsquo;s embassies in East Timor, Iran and, in particular, the Vatican.  It has been decided, following a comprehensive review of spending to which every Department contributed, to close these missions for economic reasons.  The Government believes it is important to continue to have strong diplomatic relations with the Vatican.  That is why it has decided to nominate a senior official from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as Ireland&rsquo;s ambassador to the Vatican, servicing it from Dublin.  I hope that decision can be revisited when the economy improves.</P>
       <P Just="Left">Senators Healy Eames and &Oacute; Clochartaigh expressed their justifiable pride in the election of Michael D. Higgins.  I think we all agree with them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Healy Eames raised the question of the cap on university numbers.  She may wish to raise the issue with the Minister for Education and Skills when we have a debate with him in a matter of minutes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Byrne spoke about the Wildlife (Amendment) Act.  We will let the hare sit on it and come back to it on another occasion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Moran and &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the question of septic tanks.  The Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011 will be taken in the House next week.  Senators will have ample opportunity to discuss the matter with the Minister when he is in the House for that debate.  Householders will be required to pay a modest registration fee of no more than &euro;50.  That nails all the scaremongering in which people like Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill have been engaging.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn raised the question of the numbers of clerks of works being reduced.  They have been reduced mainly because of the massive decline in the construction industry but the question of architects and the examining of buildings is one I will raise with the appropriate Minister to ensure those inspections are carried out, particularly of State buildings.  That is happening but I will clarify the matter for the Senator.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Burke referred to a person seeking hospital treatment abroad and raised the question of the accountability of officials in the Health Service Executive.  I invite the Senator to raise that matter on the Adjournment when the position can be clarified.</P><Col N="197"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Cullinane and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the issue of the boarding of the <i>MV Saoirse</i>.  I will ask about this.  It is the intention of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come to the House to address the many issues Members have raised in recent weeks.  I hope that will happen within a matter of weeks when those items can be discussed.</P>
        <P>Senators Whelan and &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of the closure of nursing homes in Abbeyleix, one of which had no problem with the Health Information and Quality Authority.  HIQA seems to be the problem in regard to the closure of quite a number of nursing homes but it is a matter I will raise with the Minister for Health.</P>
        <P>Senators Mooney, O&rsquo;Keeffe and others complimented Sligo Rovers on their success, with which we all agree.  They ploughed away for many years in the League of Ireland without success and nobody would begrudge them the success they have achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mooney also raised the issue of voluntary redundancies at MBNA.  All supports of the relevant agencies will be made available to the workers affected.  We are told the majority of the redundancies will be voluntary.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, and his officials are in constant contact with IDA Ireland  and the company in an effort to protect the maximum number of jobs.  The process of attempting to find a buyer for the operation as a going concern is continuing and the Minister is very encouraged by the positive expressions of interest in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Noone raised the issue of the below cost sale of alcohol.  That is an issue on which we should have a debate and the Senator might consider tabling a Private Members&rsquo; motion on the subject.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and invite him to address the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the opportunity to address the Seanad on this important issue.</P>
        <P>As Senators know, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, was asked to undertake a review of the junior cycle curriculum in schools, to examine how creativity and innovation might be strengthened and curriculum overload and rote learning addressed.  The review was undertaken against a backdrop of extensive longitudinal research, commissioned by the NCCA and undertaken by the ESRI.  This research tracked the progress of some 900 students in 12 case study schools as they transferred from primary level and progressed through each year of junior cycle and senior cycle.  For those Senators who have plenty of time on their hands, this is a fascinating read and I strongly recommend it.  Hero teachers in first year become villain teachers in sixth year because they are not teaching to the points and to the examinations.</P>
        <P>The study identified that while the vast majority of students generally coped well in school there was a significant undercurrent of dissatisfaction for some students, particularly those <Col N="200"/>trapped in what are described as low ability groupings, who become increasingly disengaged from learning.  By year 3 of junior cycle, students indicated that they were stressed, with many sitting ten to 15 subjects in the examinations, and experiencing the examination as exerting a significant negative backwash effect on teaching and learning.</P>
        <P>The research has been particularly insightful in providing for a strong student voice in this debate.  In addition, a study on national testing of pupils in Europe was published in 2009, and the Educational Research Centre completed a study, published in 2010, on standardised testing in lower secondary education.  The famous PISA 2009 study also provided insights into the review, with Ireland showing a significant decline in standards in literacy and mathematics, but not in science.</P>
        <P>Concerns have also been highlighted by higher education and industry interests, indicating that students are not acquiring the skills they need to become autonomous learners and cope with the demands of the knowledge society.  Frankly, all the evidence is pointing to a need for change.</P>
        <P>In February 2010, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment published a discussion paper, Innovation and Identity: Ideas for a New Junior Cycle, to initiate a major process of public consultation on the future direction of reform.  The consultations included a national symposium, an online questionnaire, a blog, meetings with a wide range of interests, including educationalists, industry personnel, parents and students, and 40 written submissions.  The recommendations submitted to me by the council build on this research and consultation and on extensive discussions with the education partners through the council&rsquo;s consultative structures.  I would like to record my appreciation for the council&rsquo;s innovative and professional work in developing these proposals, which I endorsed recently.  I have asked my officials to begin discussions on implementing the proposals with the education partners, so that the necessary planning and development work can take place.</P>
        <P>Senators who are interested in examining the detail of the proposals can find them on the website of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, <i>ncca.ie</i>.  They are also being circulated to the House, together with a short summary.  I understand they have been e-mailed to Senators and can be downloaded by those who are interested in them.  The proposals envisage that the existing range of 25 subjects in the junior cycle will be continued.  The length of syllabuses will be reduced to 200 hours for most subjects and to 240 hours for the core subjects of Irish, English and mathematics.  The option of offering additional short courses of 100 hours&rsquo; duration will be open to schools.  This would provide for school-based innovation and increased flexibility.  A cap of eight subjects &mdash; or seven subjects and two short courses, or six subjects and four short courses &mdash; will apply to what can be studied for qualification purposes.  I will come back to this later in my speech.  In essence, we intend to impose a cap of eight on the number of subjects that can be studied to examination level.  This limit is being proposed for good reasons.  It will make time and space for active learning, embed key skills such as literacy and numeracy and put the focus on learning rather than on examinations.</P>
        <P>Six key skills &mdash; managing myself, staying well, communications, being creative, working with others, and managing information and thinking &mdash; will be embedded in all subjects.  Subjects will be assessed by means of a written examination set and marked by the State Examinations Commission and by means of a portfolio.  The portfolio will be marked by the class teachers in the school, moderated by the school and subject to external moderation on a sample basis by the State Examinations Commission.  Detailed arrangements for school and external moderation are being discussed with the commission.  In general, the portfolio will attract 40% of <Col N="201"/>marks and the written examination will attract 60% of marks, although that may vary by subject.  Short courses will be assessed by means of a portfolio and will be subject to internal moderation by the school.  The term &ldquo;portfolio&rdquo; may include practical tests or events such as school musicals in a short course context, as well as project or portfolio work.  It will depend on the area of learning.  I stress that all of this work will happen within the school space.  It will not be done at home and brought into school.  It will be possible to verify that it was done by the student in question.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The subject reforms will begin on a phased basis in 2014 ahead of the first examination in 2017.  English will be the first subject to be implemented, in keeping with the priorities in the national literacy and numeracy strategy.  Groups of subjects will be implemented thereafter on a phased basis.  Change will be implemented at a pace which the system can sustain.  I will come back to that if Senators want to explore what I mean by it.  Report card templates will be developed by National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for reporting to parents on the progress of students.  These will be available in 2012-13 for use by schools in 2013-14.  As Members may be aware, the literacy and numeracy strategy provides for standardised testing in English and mathematics to be introduced in the second year of junior cycle as well as two assessments in primary.  A review of the new forms of assessment will be completed by 2019 in order to inform the ongoing roll-out.</P>
        <P>The NCCA has also proposed that there will be an additional award at level 2 of the National Framework of Qualifications for those students with special needs who find the level 3 programme unsuitable.  This award will be based on five priority learning units &mdash; communicating and literacy, numeracy, looking after myself, living in a community, and preparing for work.  Specifications will be developed by the NCCA.  Assessment will be by means of a portfolio, with internal moderation by the school, and sample external moderation by the awards body.</P>
        <P>The new Qualifications and Quality Authority of Ireland, Second Stage of the Bill having being passed by this House, has indicated a willingness in principle to certify at this level.  FETAC already certifies a wide range of awards at levels 1 to 6 in the framework, including for special needs.</P>
        <P>The proposals, therefore, are designed to provide a momentum for real change in the classroom.  They balance bottom-up innovation through short courses, which can account for up to 25% of the award, with nationally set standards for subjects, a strong focus on student learning, a key shift in assessment towards more flexibility, and a greater role on the part of the class teacher.  I believe that the proposals put forward by the council are designed to address the concerns already highlighted.  I assure the Members, however, that much of the detail remains to be worked out and it is particularly important that we ensure the reforms address the needs of those who are currently least served by the system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On assessment, I welcome the emphasis on the dialogue between student and teacher in the learning process, and the increased role of the class teacher both in assessment of learning and assessment for learning.  I must stress that unless the examination changes, nothing else will.  It is key to this process.  That is the reason I am determined that assessment reform must be an integral part of the reforms if we are to make real change in teaching and learning and, critically, in the student experience.</P>
        <P>I fully accept the need for a deliberate approach to the issue of measuring learning.  The new proposals strike a balance in this regard.  There has been considerable concern in recent years about rote learning, and the examination system has been widely criticised as focusing on recall rather than on other critical skills.  The assessment reforms in the junior certificate must be <Col N="202"/>designed to address these issues, with students being asked to demonstrate their understanding and competences.</P>
        <P>However, assessment alone cannot address this issue.  It will take a concerted effort from all involved in education and a changed mindset across the community to ensure that the proposed reforms have the desired effects.  We must think of students&rsquo; futures and their capacity to be able to apply their learning in various contexts throughout their entire lives, rather than learning things off by heart for an examination.  Short-term recall without real understanding will ill-serve their future needs and the needs of our society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Great care will also need to be taken to ensure that the portfolio work is designed to promote important key skills and innovation, and that the learning objectives are not defeated by an overly formulaic or rehearsed approach.  I am aware of the concerns highlighted regarding teachers being advocates for their students, and the changed relationship which would occur were they to adopt a formal assessment role for qualifications purposes.  Teachers have an advocacy role but they also have a professional assessment role which is a normal part of the teaching and learning process.  The tensions inherent in these roles are grappled with by teachers throughout the European Union, and entirely externally-based assessment in lower secondary education context is a rarity.</P>
        <P>I am also aware the history and geography teachers have expressed some disquiet about their subjects under the new dispensation but it is worth noting that geographical and historical awareness skills have been included in the 24 statements of essential learning, that is, that these skills will be required in order to achieve the required outcomes.  Good and enthusiastic teachers in history and geography have the opportunity to inspire a real interest in their subject and so ensure that pupils will want to sit the examination.  Overall, I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered at the discretion of the school, and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.</P>
        <P>I welcome the level 2 award proposed for those students with special needs for whom level 3 may not be suitable.  While I am aware of the extensive guidelines for teachers which have been developed by the NCCA on how best to mediate the curriculum for students with special needs, the new level 2 award will address a particular gap in the system.  The priority learning units within it are designed to support many students in their pathway towards independent living.</P>
        <P>I want to stress that teachers and schools will be supported in making these changes by investment in professional development, particularly in the new roles of assessment and moderation.  I am aware that the changes will not be easy and that we will face many challenges along the way, but we must recognise the need for change and the opportunities it will present for a more stimulating learning experience for our students.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to thank the staff and the board of the NCCA, and those involved in its various committees, for their contribution to these ground breaking proposals.  They have put learners and their needs centre stage in their deliberations.</P>
        <P>This radically different examination needs a new name.  For that reason, I have asked those directly concerned to give suggestions for a new name.  I have formally written to the Irish Secondary Schools Union to consult with its members and to suggest a new name by the middle of December.  I look forward to beginning the dialogue and development work with the partners in education to implement the reforms.  I thank the House for the opportunity to debate them.</P>

<Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his opening remarks.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the proposals published by the NCCA.  We appreciate that it has been the culmination of much work, both by NCCA staff under the direction of Anne Looney and by the consultative board led by Tom Collins.  I also appreciate that these proposals represent just one part of work being carried out on the junior cycle, senior cycle and the issue of entry into third level, and that this has to be seen in the context of the continuum of second level education and the entry process for higher education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no doubt that change is needed at all levels if we are to move the focus of our second level education away from an excessive emphasis on rote learning and towards the acquisition of key skills, the kind of skills that people will need for the jobs of the future, as well as life skills.  These skills include critical thinking, problem solving and communication skills.  To be effective, change must involve both curricula and exams.  We have changed the curricula in different courses over the years, but we never fundamentally changed the examinations.  As a result, we have not had success.  We can tinker as much as we like with the curriculum, but as the Minister pointed out on other occasions in the House, there is always a pressure on teachers to teach to the test, even when it goes against their best professional judgment.  Pressure is put on them by students and parents to get the best test results, even if that flies in the face of what is the best education for the young people involved.  There is no doubt we need change across the entire second level programme but it is right to start at junior certificate level, because the stakes at leaving certificate level are obviously much higher.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the move away from measuring everything in one examination at the end of third year.  The 40:60 balance between examinations and school-based work is appropriate.  Teachers are the best judges of students&rsquo; standards and abilities.  With proper training and support, they should be in a position to assess their students&rsquo; work without leading to a distortion of the traditional student-teacher relationship.  The class teacher is the one person who has an opportunity to observe his or her students over a sustained period of time, performing a range of different tasks, including essays, demonstrations, team work and so on.  Unlike the external examiner who can only deal with the paper before him or her, which is an attempt by a student on one particular day in a few short hours, the teacher can make a judgment on the student&rsquo;s real ability as demonstrated to that teacher over the full cycle.  I fully appreciate that teachers have concerns and that parents, particularly in small towns, will put pressure on them to give students good results.  However, we can and must educate parents and students on how doing that might serve some short-term goal but, in the long term, it is against their best interests.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are not dealing with the leaving certificate and it will not determine someone&rsquo;s entire future and what course they take.  The group certificate and intermediate certificate exams midway through second level used to be the final exam for most students and was their passport into the world of work.  Therefore, there was significant pressure surrounding them.  However, for most students this is now just an opportunity to get feedback halfway through the cycle as to how they are getting on, get guidance on areas in which they are good and skills that they should be looking to develop in the senior cycle.</P>
        <P>I understand the concerns which have been expressed as this constitutes very significant change.  As the Minister said, a fully externally accessed examination system is unique in international terms.  However, it is what we are used to.  People need to have confidence in the education system because it is so important.  It is difficult to bring people along with such a significant change.  Students are concerned and teachers and parents want their students to do the best.  It is important to inspire confidence and I appreciate the concerns.  However, with the right supports those concerns can be addressed.</P><Col N="204"/>
        <P>The Minister has aluded in some of the commentary in the newspapers in recent weeks to a possible role for IT, not just in the external modulation but perhaps in the small town environment.  The Minister might respond on that.  I am not sure if that was what the Minister meant but there was a remark made about the use of online systems for marking papers.</P>
        <P>Teacher education is so important as the Minister will be aware.  As I understand it, assessment is not a major component of the training programmes at pre-service stage.  I am not sure if much has been done on this in terms of in-service training.  There has been a move over the last few years to try to move to assesment for learning but I am not sure if it is at the stage we need in order to make changes as significant as those we are proposing.  There will be a need for in-service training and for resources to be provided for it.  I hope the Minister will give us an idea of his thinking on this and whether it has been costed and if the resources are available.  For this to work we have to be confident that the training will be there in good time.  I understand that work is being done on restructuring pre-service training for primary and post-primary teachers.  This is long overdue and I hope that assessment for learning will be a key part of that process.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposal on short courses.  This is an exciting opportunity for students to develop a wide range of skills and talents in areas such as drama, music, ICT, and skills of relevance to the local economy, such as fishing, agriculture or other industries.  It also provides a great opportunity to recognise the role of programmes like young social entrpreneurs, community involvement and so on, which should be as equally valuable as a student&rsquo;s achievements in particular subjects.  There is great scope in this regard and I am confident that many partners, such as IT companies, would be interested in working with the Department to progress this issue.</P>
        <P>Flexibility is positive but it is important that we ensure the necessary quality is present.  The Minister will be aware from reviews of transition year that some schools do an amazing job, but in others the students do not get a very positive experience.  Some programmes are being developed nationally by the NCCA.  It is important that the programmes developed by schools are validated by a national body so we can be confident of their quality.</P>
        <P>I support the cap on the number of subjects for examination purposes and I do not necessarily believe that everything should be assessed, provided the range of subjects are genuinely on offer.  In his opening remarks, the Minister stated the subjects would be available but there have been reports in recent days about alarming cutbacks in the number of second level teachers.  Theory is one thing but if the teachers are not available the schools will be simply unable to offer the subjects and we run the risk of making it impossible for schools to provide the subjects we claim students can study and we run the risk of jeopardising the success of the excellent proposals under discussion today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the Minister will take on board the call I am making today for science to be made compulsory.  I appreciate that the Minister has every subject teacher group in the country, including history and geography teachers and every one else, suggesting that their subject is the most important but there is no doubt that awareness of scientific issues is central to achieving the targets set out in the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006-2013 and the national skills strategy.  I appreciate that 87% of students are taking science in the junior certificate cycle but I believe strongly that everyone should get the opportunity at least to experiment with it at the start and then decide whether they wish to take it on in the senior cycle.  I highlight the need for information and communications technology to be better across <Col N="205"/>all areas although I am aware it is in the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, document.  Resources and training will be key issues in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fianna F&aacute;il supports the document and we realise a good deal of work has been done on it.  We have concerns with some areas but with the right implementation plan it can be done.  I am keen to see a detailed implementation plan as soon as possible with resources earmarked and genuinely set aside so that they will not be subject to cuts in the budget next year or the year after.  This is necessary so that those in the system can have confidence that the Government is serious about seeing this through and ensuring it can be effective.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to speak for five minutes and to share my time with Senator Healy Eames.  </P>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an Teach. The Minister is very good at coming here. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment commissioned the educational policy research centre of the Economic and Social Research Institute to carry out a study of student experiences of the curriculum in the first three years of their post-primary schooling. The report was produced in September 2007. </P>
        <P>Among the first and second year findings, students reported that they learned best when teachers explained things clearly, had a clear grasp of the subject, made learning fun and encouraged students to express their opinion in class.  It was noted that a didactic form of teaching or teaching from the book was viewed by students as less helpful to their learning.  The process of keeping students interested and focused on learning was helped by the use of a variety of teaching methods such as video and audio resources, group work and class discussions.  Students reported that such methods were used less frequently by teachers in third year.</P>
        <P>When asked their opinion about what would be helpful to them, students commented that it was hard to concentrate if all they do is read from the book.  A student from a girl&rsquo;s school with mixed ability said it was good to do a little of everything, suggesting that if they did a little light tape work and then some writing it would be better than doing the same stuff every day.  She explained that some teachers do the same stuff every day and that this gets boring.  She further explained that if the class is boring one cannot concentrate, regardless of how much one wishes to take it in and her view was that if a class was boring the learning would not stay in a student&rsquo;s head.  She explained that in such cases one wishes for the class to end, one wonders what time it is and one simply wishes to get out of the class because it is so boring.  It is not what is being said by the students that matters but what they hear.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s ambition to reform the curriculum because many reforms have been tried during the years and sometimes the cure has been worse than the disease.  I hope on this occasion theprogramme will succeed.  As a reforming Minister, he will ensure everything is tried to ensure that happens.</P>
        
        <P>Some one quarter of students reported that they were afraid to tell teachers if they did not understand something in class and feared a negative response.  Some students preferred to go as a group to ask a teacher for help but many others preferred to get help from their friends.</P>
        <P>The Minister has backed plans to abolish the current junior certificate and replace it with what is billed as a radically changed junior cycle.  The chairman of the Teaching Council, Mr. Tom Collins, said the new proposal represented an historic achievement for the council.  I hope it is because I fear for education in this country at the current time.  In many ways we are slipping and not keeping pace, and we have to face that fact.</P><Col N="206"/>
        <P>I heard on the grapevine that some letters have been sent from the TUI in regard to difficulties with continuous assessment.  Is that the case?  I hope teachers will buy in to the change.  It is important that they do because as Senator Power said they know the students best at this stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the limit on subjects will not restrict learning.  I do not think it will but we have to be careful.  I concur with the Minister&rsquo;s proposals to reform the junior cycle and wish him good luck.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome the broad thrust of this document.  Based on my experience at school level and third level from being a teacher and educator, it is hard to believe this will happen but it is possible with the right will and determination.  I feel confident it is part of the ethos of the Minister to make sure change will take place. </P>
        <P>Creativity and innovation are critical.  Our new President-elect, Michael D. Higgins, is the hallmark for creativity and it is his watchword.  If ever we needed it to be released in our people it is now but it must start in the education system.  The Minister is correct; nothing changes unless the exam does.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have a number of very quick questions.  I am concerned about level 2 and level 3.  I understand level 3 is broadly the same as the current junior certificate programme, which is fine.  I understand level 2 is for special needs children.  I have worked extensively with thousands of children in this country at second level on a private basis for which I was paid.</P>
        <P>One group is missing.  Special needs children probably comprise 5% to 10% of the population at most.  The current curriculum probably suits about 70% of children.  Therefore, about 20% of children are in between special needs children and children whom the current curriculum suits.  Such children are streetwise and bright but not motivated or supported by family.  The Minister knows who they are; they are the children who drop out early from school.</P>
        <P>They are not stupid but they lost interest in learning a long time ago.  There is a mechanism in the new system to suit such children, in terms of the combination of short and long courses, but study time during the day where children are shown how to study must be built in.  One short course available should be learning how to learn.  Homework support is also important because such children are not getting it at home.  Let us not pretend we can change all homes because we cannot.  While the proposal is for eight subjects in total, for that middle group there may be a requirement for a combination of perhaps five or six subjects.  We must let students choose those subjects, but with in-school study and home support.</P>
        <P>The next question we must consider is who will have the freedom to design the short courses.  Will it be schools, outside providers or, in some cases, very bright students?  I am concerned about the date of commencement of the new curriculum in that I hoped it would be sooner.  For a child entering junior certificate year in 2014, for instance, will he or she have the option to avail of the new system or will it not be introduced until 2017?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister consider introducing an intranet which would allow for online communication between schools and homes, whereby parents can access homework assignments, teachers&rsquo; notes and other learning resources?  That facility is available in various countries internationally and is working well.  I hope there is a buy-in from all teachers.  I urge caution in regard to the reduction of 2,000 in teacher numbers, 1,000 of which will be at second level.  There could be a tipping point where we go too far.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s comments on these points.</P>

	<P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister to the House.  His Ministry is the most important, because without education we will make no progress.  Last week I had a lengthy meeting with the president of DCU&rsquo;s students union in the course of which we discussed education, research, the way forward, teaching, fees and so on.  Although we are talking about reform of the second level junior cycle today, rather then third level, I would contend that there is no difference.  Education is right and good where it is about developing understanding.  Knowledge and understanding are the same to a nine year old as they are to a 19 year old.  The only difference is in the type of knowledge we present to them and where and how we present it.  For the nine year old in primary school and the 19 year old in the hallowed halls of university, knowledge remains the same.  We merely present it in a different way depending on the student&rsquo;s age.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Definitions of education are difficult, because education is about what happens from birth to death; it is a continuing process.  If I were to sum it up in one word, it would be &ldquo;energy&rdquo;.  Most of what we do is about energy, how we harness that energy and what we do with it.  Any discussion about education is essentially a discussion about human energy.  Education is the unique pursuit of that individual energy in people.  The job of education is to counteract inertia, torpor and apathy.  The question is how one brings it about, the ways and means which allow, as Whitehead said, young people to learn to look up and look out.  How to ignite that energy is the question.  In the ever changing world in which we live, the question we face is how does education parallel that world, contend with it, counteract it and make it come alive.  We may then ask whether mathematics, Mandarin Chinese or history is the answer.  They are all the answer but also not the answer.  The true answer is creativity and the real question is how can we define, capture, explore, develop and extract this great creativity and which disciplines of knowledge will allow us to do so.</P>
        <P>My first suggestion is that the Minister make the arts &mdash; by which I refer to drama, music, poetry and visual arts &mdash; compulsory subjects within the new junior certificate cycle.  It is the perfect opportunity to make the arts independent, with the same status, discipline, structure and profundity of knowledge that we give to mathematics and literature in the school curriculum.  Second, having spent 22 years working in the department of communications in DCU, I am aware that orality, oracy and vocality &mdash; the ability to express the human instrument that is voice &mdash; are tantamount to education.</P>
        <P>I know it is mentioned in the literacy and numeracy report, but orality, oracy and vocality could be the key to the combinations of knowledge.  This is not just fresh learning, but fresh combinations of knowledge.  It is a unique opportunity to make this an important, independent vocality and an important, independent subject.  We are suffering from a glut of information.  There is no such thing as information scarcity, yet it is not lack of information that keeps us at war, keeps people starving or keeps crime rates high.</P>
        <P>George Bernard Shaw said 50 years ago that:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The average person today is about as credulous as was the average person in the Middle Ages.  In the Middle Ages, people believed in the authority of their religion, no matter what.  Today, we believe in the authority of our science, no matter what.  </P><P Just="Left">We can counteract that in the new junior cycle with the idea of the arts. Seamus Heaney said, &ldquo;Bear with the present; what will be will be. The future is cloth waiting to be cut.&rdquo; </P><Col N="208"/>
        <P FLI="0">That is a template we might be able to use.  I stand for the arts as counteracting torpor, lethargy, apathy and as counteracting the information glut that tends to take over our education system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire chuig an Seanad agus d&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas ar&iacute;s leis as ucht an obair ar fad at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige san am gairid mar Aire.  I applaud the Minister&rsquo;s enthusiasm and his advocacy for change in the junior certificate in particular.  I love the quote that unless the examination changes, nothing else will.  I believe this is his first contribution in these Houses on the reform of the junior cycle, and there is a feeling that he is open to consultation and other suggestions, which I welcome.  I also applaud Dr. Anne Looney and Professor Tom Collins for their innovation.</P>
        <P>What intention does the Minister have to place the arts at the heart of learning?  Unlike Senator O&rsquo;Donnell, I am not necessarily looking for compulsory courses, but I do think this is a time for innovation and creativity.  This is a great opportunity to innovate and yet celebrate the Irish imagination and our potential for creativity in education.  I can provide examples of how using the arts can keep people in disadvantaged areas in school, such as <i>El Sistema </i>music project in Venezuela and the project of the Irish Chamber Orchestra in Limerick.</P>
        <P>The six key skills that will be embedded in subjects as defined in the NCCA document of October 2011 include managing myself, staying well, communications, being creative, working with others and managing information and thinking.  The recently published document from the UK&rsquo;s Cultural Learning Alliance, which consists of a number of organisations that came together to look at this and which was funded by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, outlines very strongly the benefits of structured arts learning at second level.  It made a number of key findings.  First, learning through arts and culture improves attainment in all subjects.  Taking part in drama and library activities improves attainment in literacy.  Taking part in structured music activities improves attainment in maths, early language acquisition and early literacy.  We do not want to demarcate all the subjects all of a sudden.  Arts can support numeracy, literacy and reading.  Schools that integrate arts across the curriculum in America have shown consistently higher average reading and mathematics scores, compared with similar schools that do not.  Dr. Anne Looney has much information on this and spoke about it in her own capacity.</P>
        <P>Second, participation in structured arts activities increases cognitive abilities.  Third, students from low income families who take part in arts activities at school are three times more likely to get a degree.  Arts activity can keep a person in school, particularly in a disadvantaged area.  Fourth, employability of students who study arts subjects is higher and they are more likely to stay in employment.  What I want to stress here is that the marketplace should not determine our curriculum.  Just because Google or Intel suggest to us that there should be a concentration on mathematics to the detriment of other subjects&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">Students who engage in the arts at school are twice as likely to volunteer and are 20% more likely to vote as young adults.  That is the fifth key finding from this report.</P>
        <P>It is evident that the arts can play a very important role in realising these objectives as set out by the Minister and the NCCA&rsquo;s report, which is a role that has been underutilised until now.  I note with concern that drama is not mentioned as a subject in the new junior certificate curriculum.  It is examined in the short term in terms of performing, but not as a particular subject.  Arts and crafts are specified as a particular subject, but not drama.  Drama and the arts can support the learning of other subjects too.</P><Col N="209"/>
        <P>Will arts education specialists be part of the planning process for the new junior cycle?  The arts have the potential to make an enormous contribution to the new system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">International research and work being carried out in Ireland demonstrates how exposure to film, drama, visual arts and literature can support literacy, independent critical thought and creativity, all of which have been identified by the Minister and the NCCA as the main targets of education reform.  The arts present a very exciting opportunity to help realise these objectives, but in order to achieve this, greater links need to be made between the Department of Education and Skills and the arts sector.  I understand that officials from the Department of Education and Skills and officials from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht either have met or are set to meet.  I would like to see how those skills might be exchanged, particularly in cultural organisations in this country, such as the Ark, the education departments of the Irish Film Institute and IMMA, and Music Network.  The Irish Chamber Orchestra in Limerick is doing great work and is modelled on the experience of what is going on in Stirling in Scotland and <i>El Sistema</i> orchestra in Venezuela.  Music is used to retain attendance in school and helps support the other elements of the curriculum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  I understand that the debate is on junior cycle reform, but I would like to make reference to Senator Mac Conghail&rsquo;s speech.  As a music teacher for over 20 years, I wish he could have been in the classroom at times when I was in utter despair.  I welcome his words and I agree wholeheartedly with him as a teacher in a socially disadvantaged school.  I taught children from severely disadvantaged backgrounds to play an instrument, to perform in an orchestra, to travel abroad with us and to continue on to third level education.  These are the things that have given me the most pride in my career to date.</P>
        <P>I welcome the news of the changes to be implemented in the junior cycle reform.  As a teacher for more years than I care to remember, I wholeheartedly agree that with the changes in innovation, technology and our general way of life, our approach to education should embody a realistic shift from the rote learning system that we have had for years to a more broad-based system which will encourage our students to think more independently.  This will, in turn, ensure that they are more prepared for life after school.</P>
        <P>Being examined in only eight subjects at junior cycle will take away some of the pressures that our young students experience in schools today.  In my own school, students have told me that they chose their subjects for the leaving certificate not because they had a particular love for the subject, but because the percentage of A grades in that subject was higher, and would enable them to get more points for their chosen course of study.  That speaks for itself.  Students in many schools study in excess of ten subjects for the junior certificate and indeed my own children studied 12 subjects.  Even more worrying is the number of 15 year olds who study 12 subjects in school and then take extra subjects outside school, which places an unnecessary amount of pressure on them.  This leads to more problems and I wonder how much of this information can be realistically retained.</P>
        <P>From my own experience in schools, I have increasingly found that students count their junior certificate and indeed leaving certificate results in terms of the amount of A grades they achieve, rather than the amount of honours or passes.  When I did the intermediate certificate, as it was called then, it seemed to me that students certainly did not get as many A grades as they do now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It was honours and pass.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="210"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  One came out and said one got X amount of honours and that was it.  Nowadays, every year we hear &ldquo;I got nine As&rdquo; or &ldquo;I got ten As&rdquo;.  There is not a mention of the C or the B that might have been very well earned.  There is too much pressure to get A grades.  An A grade now seems to be the equivalent of an honour.  Nowadays the pictures on the school &ldquo;walls of fame&rdquo; are of students who have achieved ten, 11 or 12 As in their junior certificates and 590 or 600 points in their leaving certificates, which can place a terrible amount of pressure on younger siblings and peers.  I welcome the news that the new junior certificate will include tasks that will allow students to focus on improving their observation, inquiry and critical thinking skills and learn to value what it means to be an active citizen with rights and responsibilities in local and wider contexts, rather than the ability to learn from a book.  Maybe they will appear on the school wall of fame for their team spirit, their musical ability or their charity work.</P>
        <P>Students will study no more than eight subjects, or seven subjects and two short courses, or six subjects and four short courses.  Again, I welcome the introduction of these short courses.  I am wholeheartedly in agreement that students should be accredited for involvement in school activities such as musicals, sport or debating, which will give them the opportunity to excel in their chosen areas of interest.  I also welcome, as spokesperson on disability, the level 2 award that is to be introduced for students with special needs for whom level 3 is not suitable, and the news that the assessment for this will be within the school.  I welcome the assessment aspect of the proposed changes and again urge that it is carefully thought out before implementation.  Any danger to the new system will be at the assessment stage.</P>
        <P>The move away from rote learning is to be welcomed.  In the classroom I have seen many examples of students who perhaps do not apply themselves as well as they could but are excellent at cramming for exams, only to forget the information the following day.  I have also seen, with greater frequency, the student who works extremely hard throughout the year, giving her best but never gaining the marks she deserves.  The idea of assessment, if implemented correctly, will benefit the student who deserves to achieve better grades for effort alone but will never attain these marks under the current exam system.  As the Minister said, if the exam does not change, nothing will, and that is a prime example.  It is proposed that the written exam will be worth 60% of the overall grade and the portfolio 40%.  The issue of assessment within the school needs careful consideration and I urge the Minister to hasten slowly and tread carefully in this regard.</P>
        <P>To speak about my own subject, when the new junior certificate music syllabus was introduced in 1994, students did a short practical exam, worth 25%, as part of the overall exam.  As a teacher in a VEC, I was allowed to examine the students myself, and did.  Senator Power brought up the issue of assessment, and the preparation for assessment in these exams was very well thought out by the Department, with a one-day in-service course which taught the examiner how to examine.  I hope the situation will be similar under the new system &mdash; I am sure it will.  The facts of the assessment and what is to be assessed must be carefully thought out and shown to examiners.  A lot of time can be wasted on irrelevant things at in-service courses.  They should stick to the facts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The practical part of the music examination at leaving certificate level is worth 50%.  Speaking to my colleagues, I have heard that they do not want the responsibility for that final 50%.  I can understand this, as we all do continuous assessment on a weekly or monthly basis in the classroom.  This can be worked out, but it needs careful consideration, particularly when there are so many marks involved.</P><Col N="211"/>
        <P>A cap seems to be proposed, according to today&rsquo;s newspapers, on the number of students entering third level education.  I listened to a debate on this on Radio 1 this morning in which someone commented that if such a cap is implemented, junior certificate students may continue to think in terms of the leaving certificate, working towards the points they need.  I ask the Minister to take this into consideration also.  I welcome the news of the junior cycle review and ask the Minister to consider my proposals.</P>

	<P>May I share my time with my two colleagues Senators Crown and Barrett?  I will take four minutes and they will take two minutes each.  I am being very generous.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to see the Minister here, not just because we have a blood relationship but because he is a breath of fresh air, not only in the House but in that seat.  He has hit the ground running and come in with enthusiasm and with a question in his mind, not just about the junior certificate but also about everything else.  I wish him well and I hope everything works out well for him.  I am impressed at the challenge he faces now, with everybody asking him to continue to include arts, drama, or history, and not to forget about science, geography or compulsory Irish.  It seems to me he has quite a challenge.</P>
        <P>I will not speak quite on that basis.  I am impressed with the system in France.  I have four French grandchildren, some of whom have gone through the junior cycle, and I am impressed with the international baccalaureate, which is a great system and seems to work well.  The international baccalaureate middle years programme, for students aged 11 to 16, provides a framework of academic challenge that encourages students to embrace and understand the connections between traditional subjects and the real world with critical and reflective thinking.  It seems to me that this is what we are looking for, namely, to encourage critical and reflective thinking.  It will be helpful with regard to innovation if we can get students of that age to think for themselves rather than learning from books alone.</P>
        <P>I had an exciting experience a couple of weeks ago down in Tralee with transition year students who were taking a course in innovation.  Six hundred of them got together and we brought 60 students down from Drogheda to join them.  These were youngsters of 15, just out of the junior cycle and into the senior cycle.  To watch and listen to what they were doing was amazing.  I introduced myself to one young lady who was sitting beside me.  She looked very stylish &mdash; the others were all in uniform, but she was wearing high heels.  I was impressed with this young lady, whose name was Tara Haughton, because after taking a course in entrepreneurship she invented a system which now has customers in 22 countries who contact her through her Internet site.  Would you believe that?  I will not go into the detail of what she is selling, but it is to do with high-heeled shoes.  It is marvellous.  The course asks students whether they can find a challenge or problem in their area and then find a solution to it.  That is where the innovations are coming from.  It is very impressive.</P>
        <P>I was interested in Senator Healy Eames&rsquo;s comment that 20% of students are between the level of special needs and the level that suits most of the other students.  I have the experience of meeting Howard Gardner on one occasion, and he spoke about the seven different intelligences that we should consider.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That was to do with the leaving certificate applied.  It impressed me no end.  Charles Handy, on the other hand, talks about ten different intelligences.  The word they use is &ldquo;intelligences&rdquo;.  How do we encourage this intelligence?  It is not a matter of skills.  I know the leaving certificate applied is not the junior certificate, but I urge the Minister to <Col N="212"/>keep an eye on that and to do what he can.  They are quite disappointed at losing the co-ordinator they had.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will mention one other concept which has to do with language.  It is the Michel Thomas system of learning.  I am very impressed with what I have read about it.  We talk about how to teach languages, and I believe this is an exciting method that we should consider.  One teacher I know has decided to use part of the Michel Thomas method to teach French.  The method does not use books, memorising or homework, and is based on giving students the confidence to speak a language.  In essence, Michel Thomas breaks a language down to its component parts and enables learners to construct the language themselves.  This reminds me of going to the Gaeltacht.  We had no books or, at least, I do not remember having them and we did not have rote learning.  We simply learned Irish.  I remember my children and ourselves coming back from the Gaeltacht and being able to speak the language but not because we had been taught in that way.  I offer one quote from <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper about the experience of someone who taught French in a school in London for one week:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">He astounded staff at a school in north London by teaching a group of teenagers deemed incapable of learning languages.  In one week, they learned the amount of French it normally takes five years to acquire.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I refer to it because I believe language teaching is capable of being done in a different way and I include Gaeilge in that.  We can achieve a great deal more.  I am pleased that the Minister is here and that we are having this debate.  I believe we can go a long way with it.  I was pleased with the words the Minister used as well and with the investment in language teaching.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will cut down on the formalities because of time constraints.  As we are all aware, the opposite of education is ignorance.  The educated person lives longer and better, is more prosperous and healthier, eats better, smokes fewer cigarettes and has better control of his or her fertility.  These are well established international facts and the arguments for a good education are overwhelming.  The key issue is what to teach people.  Sometimes, the Irish follow the Brendan Behan dictum that the first item on the agenda of any Irish organisation is the split.  We seem to fall naturally into a split between the arts and the sciences.  We live in a world of medicine and science and I practise in a world of medicine and science but I was better at the arts and my best examination results in school were in the arts.  Any good career guidance teacher would have suggested that I keep away from medicine and it is striking that I have managed to achieve a modest level of success in it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow Senator Mac Conghail to produce my first play.  I read approximately 20 non-science books per year and I am interested in this issue.  It is not a question of either-or, we must have both.  We live in a world of science governed by gravity, temperature, relativity, meteorology and evolution.  These are all realities and we should teach people science all the way through school, not to pick out the brilliant scientists who will become the elite whitecoat-wearing eggheads, but to give people an essential part of the skill set they need to interpret the reality of life.</P><Col N="213"/>
        <P>If we had more people in these two Chambers who, in addition to having arts backgrounds, understood the critical importance of science, social science, history, geography and natural science, then they would make many more sensible decisions about such things as energy, the economy and agriculture.  It is critical to produce people who have these skills and it is essential that people have a mandatory arts component all the way through to the time they leave school at 18 years of age.  This should include a mandatory foreign language not for matriculation purposes, but to give students a skill which most of our fellow European citizens have in an area in which, in general, we fare rather poorly.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to discuss the junior certificate without asking the following existential question.  Do we really need to have an examination that people do half way through secondary school?  I remain to be convinced that some outside-the-box thinking would not come to the conclusion that it is a historical construct that we inherited, that we ape the British and their O-level examinations, that it does not make a great deal of sense and that it hinders the flexibility of teachers to cater for younger secondary school students.  I trust I have not gone on too much.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always a pleasure to welcome the Minister to the House.  He bubbles over with ideas in education.  The Minister stated that concerns have been highlighted by higher education industry interests indicating that students are not acquiring the skills they need to be autonomous learners or to cope with the demands of the knowledge society.  I offer a word of caution because it was adults who destroyed this country, not the children.  Some of the comment from people in higher education is patronising to say the least.  The Minister and I have attended student meetings at which the best speakers were the students, not the esteemed figures of Irish higher education.  Their goal appears to be to avoid contact with students.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out that higher education is remarkably expensive and that the highest paid people in third level education in Ireland have nothing to do with students. This distancing from reality is much to their disadvantage.  I direct the same remarks to the members of IBEC and other bodies.  These are the people who undermined so much of our public administration, banking and so on.  It is somewhat rich of them to blame people who are 14 and 15 years of age at this stage.</P>
        <P>There is a problem with mathematics and it is not being addressed by the same university heads who offer bonus points to those who can afford grinds.  No attempt is being made to reform the teaching of mathematics to people in schools.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>According to a recent report, the high percentage of so-called out-of-field teachers is having an adverse effect on the achievement of second level students in mathematics.  Another effect is the pressure these heads have put on language departments.  I gather they have shut down more than they have opened up in recent times but we need more foreign language expertise in the country.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about continuous assessment.  From where is progress continuously assessed?  At third level it has been scaled back because it depends on whose father or uncle had the best website for downloading purposes.  I make the point as a message of caution.  There have been many ill-advised comments from outside bodies such as those I have mentioned.  Too little time is spent in the classroom and too little of the budget is spent in the classroom, especially at third level.  Let us make it people-centred as the Minister intends and let us not write off rote learning entirely either.  I imagine Frank Lloyd Wright passed all his examinations and then became the creative person the Minister greatly admires.  There is a list of things that people should be able for such as meaningful learning and sociological understanding but it requires some foundation, much of which comes from hard work and learning.  Mathematics is hard <Col N="214"/>work and foreign languages are difficult subjects and we cannot ignore this in the passage of any reform.

	<P>It is dangerous to let three speakers share because they had ten minutes between them.  Anyway, I have been more than fair.  Six Members are offering to speak.  We must finish by 5.45 p.m. because of how the business has been ordered.  I call on Senators to confine themselves to questions because I am keen for the Minister to have 12 minutes to respond.  I call Senator Clune.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not realise I was restricted to questions.  I carried out some research before coming to the Chamber.  It is now 12 months since the OECD PISA report was published.  It was a shocking indictment of our system.  The Minister was surprised although he was in a different role at the time.  For the first time it called into question our literacy standards.  There have been warning signs about numeracy but for the first time literacy was affected.  Then we took note of it.  Last year, we slipped from fifth to 17th in the figures.  It is important to reform the junior certificate and this would represent one small step forward.</P>
        <P>There appears to be evidence of grade inflation in the junior certificate.  How does this tie in with international standards which appear to show a decline in Irish standards?  It is important to take note of international standards because we are a part of an international community.  We were proud of our education system and we display and promote it internationally.  I am keen to hear whether the Minister has any insight into this matter.  There appears to be evidence of grade inflation because more students have been getting A grades but this does not tie in with the OECD figures.</P>
        <P>Another question, to which Senator Healy Eames referred, relates to the 20% of students that the current junior certificate does not suit.  I imagine the reforms will suit this 20% of students because of short-term classes and so on.  However, we should not throw out the other 75% and we should not throw out everything with the bathwater.  We need an examination and we need students to be tested.  This much is important and it is important to have a junior certificate and to test children because they will be adults shortly afterwards and they need the confidence to step up to the plate.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I will be brief and stick to two questions.  The proposals brought forward by the Minister will bring about greater creativity and innovation in the whole learning environment for junior cycle students.  The Minister indicated he is asking his officials to engage with the education partners in respect of implementing these proposals.  What stage is that at?  What timescale is involved?  How long will it take before the discussions turn into a more formidable template for implementation?</P>
        <P>The Minister outlined the importance of ensuring ICT is strengthened across all subjects, something with which I concur.  We are in a new learning age and ICT must be strengthened.  Where is the budget commitment to go with that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  He is well known as a reformer, something which is widely recognised.  The reform of the junior certificate is timely, important and one which everybody involved in education will welcome. </P>
        <P>I note the six key skills, which is an excellent development.  Are those set out in the presentation exhaustive?  If they are, I suggest the Minister might consider an additional one under <Col N="215"/>the heading of &ldquo;staying well&rdquo;.  We know suicide is the leading cause of death among young people between the ages of 15 and 24 in this country.  Perhaps we could use the new programme to embed a module into the junior certificate cycle to promote positive mental health.  There is a general provision but we should make it more explicit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Skills such as coping with failure, disappointment and rejection, the importance of self-esteem, the ability to recognise it is normal to sometimes feel down and others are needed.  Teachers are very important gatekeepers in this area and perhaps they should be retrained or upskilled to recognise potential crises in the lives of young people.  I feel strongly that training should be embedded in primary and preschool settings.  There is now an opportunity to do something about the problem and I urge the Minister to consider what can be done.</P>
        <P>There does not seem to be a huge emphasis on the importance of physical education in the cycle.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am the Senator who has most recently done the junior certificate.  </P>
        <P>Concerns were raised about science not being a core subject.  Will students have the opportunity to try subjects before they have to sign up to them?  If they have a choice they may not choose to study science.  What is the take-up of science in schools where it is currently an optional choice?</P>
        <P>Can the Minister give any further detail on the policing of continuous assessment and portfolio work?  How will schools moderate work marked by teachers?  Teachers will be checking teachers within a faculty.  If that is the case I would be concerned it could cause tensions among peers in schools.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about external moderation on a sample basis by the SEC.  How large will be the sample of schools within an area or students&rsquo; work within a school?  When I studied junior certificate science we rushed to fill out our experiment books at the end of the year because they might have been examined.  We did not necessarily do all the experiments but we filled out the books for the sake of it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On the methodologies of teaching, has Howard Gardner&rsquo;s theory of multiple intelligences been considered?  We spoke a lot about what is available for assessment and teaching but the methodology of teaching, the ways of learning, the wide range of cognitive abilities and the human potential people have need to be considered.  Has the Minister considered retraining some teachers in how children learn?</P>
        <P>The eight intelligences of the child must be taken into consideration.  It has been found in America that bodily and kinesthetic and muscle movement helped various children to learn.  Each child should be given the opportunity to learn in ways which are harmonious with his or her unique mind.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to assessment, short courses and musicals.  Will schools in deprived areas be provided with assistance?  It costs money to put on a musical.  Have teachers bought into continuous assessment or is the dialogue just beginning?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I refer to students who are at a physical disadvantage, not because they are physically disadvantaged personally but because the buildings they are in are dumps. <Col N="216"/> All the research shows if children are taught in very poor facilities, such as prefabs or old buildings, which are inadequate before they go to post-primary school, and then move into another building which is inadequate they are at a disadvantage.</P>
        <P>I wonder how we will have a level playing field to ensure we get the best out of teachers or students.  There is a conflict between those who will be taught in new facilities and those taught in dumps.  I am not sure how the Minister will be able to address that challenge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will try to address most of the points made.  If possible I will try to write to Senators in response to some comments.</P>
        <P>A lot of concern was expressed about buy-in by teachers, particularly on the question of assessment.  As I said, unless the examination changes nothing else will change.  I am acutely aware of the reservations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One senator asked a specific question on the examination proposals.  The ASTI has had a long-held position in regard to this matter.  It has said it is not happy and is opposed at the current time to assessing students for examination purposes.  It constantly assesses students.  There is an historic reason for its objection, namely provincial town pressure.  The ASTI is not being obstructionist on this.  It has genuine concerns which I understand.  I hope to work with it to see if we can find ways to alleviate them.</P>
        <P>Senator Power referred to the possibility of electronic assistance using ICT.  We are exploring the idea.  If teachers verify that the work in question from a pupil is his or her own work, and not done at home by somebody else, with better IT support it could be filed electronically.  That is the world we are in.  Work could be open to assessment on that basis and we are currently actively exploring that.</P>
        <P>Senator Crown, referring to various subjects, said it was not a case of either-or.  There has to be a mixture of everything.  The 24 statements, the use of the arts in a creative way to enable better communication, confidence in presenting and working together in groups are covered.  I invite Senators to read the curriculum and look at what the NCCA has done in regard to the sorts of things we are trying to include.</P>
        <P>The NCCA and the Department could very easily have gone through the various stages and presented a well worked out and detailed template for a new junior certificate examination.  We chose not to do that for a very good reason.  We want people to buy into the formulation, development and completion of the process.  That is why we will enter into discussions without preconceptions with the various stakeholders, including teachers and management bodies.  The change involves a lot of timetabling issues.</P>
        <P>A Senator asked about a range of subjects and economic pressures in terms of resources, and said we might lose subjects such as languages.  Towns like Clonmel, Tuam, Carrickmacross or other traditional towns may have three schools.  There may be an array of language teachers to provide a full range of language training.  In this day and age we can no longer afford the luxury of ignoring those resources.</P>
        <P>We have to find ways of providing language teaching, even if it means people being in different schools at different times or going to one class in one school.  It is part and parcel of where we are.  We have too many secondary schools with 200 to 300 pupils where the range of subjects and capacity to deliver them is limited.  We will have to consider ways of maximising efficiencies within our current constraints.</P>
        <P>I fully agree there is a strong correlation between music and mathematical ability; that is a long-established connection.  In terms of finding new ways to teach the fundamental skills of literacy and numeracy, I am not a professional educationalist, but everything I have read sug<Col N="217"/>gests, and this goes back a long time in the theory of education, that capability in numeracy and literacy are great predictors of future outcomes in terms of a person&rsquo;s subsequent venture into any particular vocational sphere.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to making the arts compulsory, much depends on the primary curriculum.  One cannot talk about this in isolation from everything else.  As Professor Tom Collins famously said at an Irish Primary Principals Network conference some years ago, children in Ireland today enjoy their primary school experience.  In the year in which we are celebrating 180 years of primary school education, we should acknowledge that this generation of primary schoolteachers and the new curriculum have removed fear from the childhood experience of going to primary school, a fear which was formerly deemed normal and characteristic.  The teaching of arts, dance, motion, drama and articulation are now woven through the entire curriculum, so much so that anybody who has contact with young children will know that school is something they enjoy.</P>
        <P>The problem is that children subsequently undergo a curtailment within the very tight constraint that is the secondary school experience.  This is the context within which we areseeking to reform the junior certificate.  First, it will have a new name, to be chosen by the Irish Secondary Schools Union.  What is most important is that the junior cycle cannot be evaluated in isolation from the literacy and numeracy strategy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question of resources was raised by Senator Averil Power and others.  We are extending the teacher training programme for primary schoolteachers from three to four years, at a cost of some &euro;90 million in a full year.  I have found the money from within existing funding and have so far met the requirements for budgetary reduction as requested by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  The additional year will be primarily centred on pedagogical and educational skills and will incorporate a consideration of the multiple skills and intelligences of students and how they can be nurtured and developed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Likewise, and perhaps even more importantly, at second level we are extending what was traditionally referred to as the H. Dip from a one year to a two year course.  That additional year will again focus on pedagogical and teaching skills.  There will be a fundamental difference in testing in that we will have measured and standardised learning interventions at second class, fourth class and again at second level.  When one is cooking one must constantly sample the dish in order to ensure it tastes as one intends.  We are engaged in a similar process in terms of measuring learning inputs and outcomes.</P>
        <P>It is not a question of examinations or critically assessing pupils.  One of the Senators suggested that there be a mid-term examination.  We must bear in mind that the credibility of the examination system is crucial.  As unsatisfactory as the points system is, and the accompanying rote learning for the leaving certificate, the system is trusted by everybody.  It has not been tainted with the type of defilement that has been done to so many institutions in this country.  It has been utterly beyond any type of interference, and we interfere with it at our peril.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new intake of teachers will be better and longer trained.  While primary schoolteachers are seen to teach children, secondary schoolteachers are seen primarily to teach history, mathematics and so on rather than teaching young adults.  We must incorporate an holistic approach at second level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is that it is all about the examination.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The literacy and numeracy strategy is being rolled out and is part and parcel of broader reform.  The curriculum does not function in isolation.  It will take time and resources to implement reform.</P><Col N="218"/>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the points system, in my innocence, I was two months in office before I realised the points system was not part of the education system as we know it.  Rather, it is owned and controlled by the universities.  Senator Mary Moran talked about honours and pass levels.  We intend to simplify the grades at junior cycle in order that the examination no longer functions as a mock leaving certificate.  If one asks a student how he or she has done in the junior certificate, one will be told what has been achieved in terms of leaving certificate points.  It is like a simulated leaving certificate.</P>
        <P>The final part of the process of reform must be to open up the constraints of the second level curriculum by reviewing the points system.  I advise Senators to read Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland&rsquo;s paper at <i>transition.ie</i>, where she shows that the number of university courses available through the CAO application process has exploded by 300% in recent years.  The system is being used by universities to attract high-level points and to boast that access to a particular course requires 550 points or whatever.  We can change that.  One of the recommendations that came out of the conference in UCD in September was to look to a system such as that in the University of Melbourne in Australia, where all first year students now take one of eight foundation courses.  If one wishes to study science, arts, finance or whatever, one takes the appropriate foundation course before proceeding to a more specialised choice after the first year.  UCD already does this in the case of engineering with students taking a common course in first year before specialising in chemical, electronic or civil engineering.</P>
        <P>Such a system removes pressure from students and prevents the disastrous consequences of pupils filling out the CAO form in February of sixth year, when they are 16 or 17 years old.  Evidence shows that where students attain only their second or subsequent choice, the probability of them dropping out is very high.  Most of us are of an age to recall when men who thought they had a vocation realised within weeks of joining a seminary that they were mistaken but did not tell their mothers for three years.  Young people are understandably anxious when telling their parents that they made the wrong choice and do not like the course they are doing.  Addressing that issue is part of the process of reform.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate that the focus of the discussion was on the question of liberating the first three years of secondary education, that reform is not happening on its own.  Rather, it fits into the continuum of reform to which I referred.  I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

    <Title>Recent Developments in the Eurozone: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to update Members on the ongoing situation in the eurozone, a situation which greatly affects us all.  The euro area sovereign debt crisis has been going on for almost two years, but has stepped up a gear in recent months, particularly since August.  The events of the past week have been particularly disturbing.</P>
        <P>It is worthwhile to point out that EU policy has actively responded since the crisis began.  That response may not have been adequate but it has been substantial.  I refer, among other actions, to the following: the establishment of crisis resolution mechanisms; of the temporary facility, the EFSF; and the more permanent structure, the ESM, which are designed to help vulnerable member states and ensure an improved governance structure within the European Union and particularly the eurozone and the European semester.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding these important developments, the perception has remained that policy makers were playing catch-up with the full scale of the problem.  This is not simply a question of perception, but is reality and we have suffered as a consequence.  However, a substantial leap was taken at the European summit in the early hours of 27 October.  Although the situation <Col N="219"/>remains fragile as the events of the past week have clearly demonstrated, Senators might agree that the co-ordinated approach clearly demonstrates that the EU can unite and work in the interests of all its citizens.  It shows the EU is strong and can make significant decisions and the kind of progress that not so long ago would have been regarded as almost unthinkable.  The deal of the morning of 27 October marked an important turning point because it was the first time we saw a clear political will to get to grips with the issues we face.  I hope everyone would agree that we can take some encouragement from this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I am sure Senators will be aware, on 23 October the European Council identified a number of key priorities for internal economic policy to be pursued in the short and medium term in order to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  These include the completion of the Single Market, including the digital Single Market, measures to support SMEs and the reduction of administrative burden.  It also called for a stronger focus to be given to growth-enhancing aspects of the European Union&rsquo;s external policies in order to maximise their contribution to growth in Europe and to shape the conditions to attract more inward investment.  It is clear that acting in unison to tackle these challenges within the framework of the European Union rather than doing so in isolation makes eminent sense.</P>
        <P>Recognising the pressures on national budgets, the European Council also agreed temporarily to increase co-financing rates for EU funds, which will have direct benefits for Ireland and will facilitate us in drawing down EU funding.  In this regard, the Heads of State and Government agreed to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s suggestion that, in examining the possibilities for boosting investment in Europe, the European Investment Bank should have a particular focus on countries implementing an EU-IMF programme, which is a welcome commitment.</P>
        <P>Over the course of the European Council meeting and euro summit on 26 and 27 October, work was finalised on the various elements of a comprehensive package of measures designed to restore stability to the euro area.  The agreement reached covers a number of key issues, including bank recapitalisation, debt sustainability for Greece, firewalls to prevent contagion and improved governance within the euro area.  In each area, Irish interests have been fully protected.  Measures were agreed that, when implemented, should put Greek debt back on a sustainable footing and would help Greece to start rebuilding its economy which will take quite a long time.  It was agreed to extend the capacity of the EFSF, through two basic leverage options, to ensure that we have robust and secure firewalls to prevent contagion into other member states.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding our limited business and financial links with Greece, as a so-called &ldquo;programme&rdquo; country, Ireland is more exposed to the fall-out from the Greek situation than other countries might be.  Therefore credible and viable firewalls are vital.  This will help to reduce the risk of derailing the recent substantial progress we have made.  As such, this is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Measures were agreed to ensure that Europe&rsquo;s banks were adequately capitalised and would have access to funding.  In addition the Heads of State and Government agreed on ten measures to improve euro area economic governance, including regular euro summit meetings at least twice a year, and regular meetings of the presidents of the euro summit, Commission and the euro group.</P>
        <P Just="Left">President Van Rompuy, working closely with the presidents of the European Commission and of the euro group, will prepare a report for the December European Council on possible steps to further strengthen economic convergence within the euro area, to improve fiscal discipline and deepen economic union.  As part of the report, President Van Rompuy will explore the possibility of limited treaty changes.  In this, it is very important to bear in mind that no outcome is predetermined.  I am convinced there is considerable scope to go further within <Col N="220"/>the parameters of existing treaties and we should exploit that mechanism to the full in the first instance.</P>
        <P>Bearing in mind the recent events in Athens, it is important to remember that the Greek situation is a key part of the current difficulties.  A credible solution to the Greek crisis is in all of our interests, including for us in Ireland.  Of course, the involvement of the private sector in resolving the Greek situation has led to similar demands here.  I reiterate what the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance have said when I say that the restructuring of its public debt will be no panacea for Greece.  In fact, the very harsh austerity measures and the conditions affecting the sovereignty of Greece, which must complement the new adjustment programme, will have grave implications for the living standards of the Greek people for the foreseeable future.  These measures and other conditions are much more severe than anything that we in Ireland have experienced, will experience or wish to experience.  This is simply ignored by those who call on Ireland to do the same.</P>
        <P>In addition, there is the crucial issue of reputational damage.  Reneging on our commitments would have major adverse implications for our international reputation.  Such action could seriously damage our prospects of attracting foreign direct investment and trading our way to economic recovery.  This brings up a final critical difference between the two economies in this regard and it relates to the importance of international trade.  In Greece, exports amount to the equivalent of just 20% of GDP, whereas this figure is more than 100% of GDP in Ireland.  I believe that any move towards a default, whether structured or unstructured, would have severe negative consequences for the exports that drive our economy and the long-term health of the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Equally important is that any reneging on our commitments would necessitate eliminating the primary budget deficit almost immediately.  In other words, it would be disastrous and the effects would be felt by every man, woman and child in this country.  I want to be clear in this regard: the Government will not contemplate such an irresponsible approach.  However, the Government is acutely aware of the huge burden that has been placed on the shoulders of Irish citizens and we have already done a considerable amount to renegotiate the programme agreed by the previous Government, including the interest rate reductions, which are worth up to &euro;10 billion; the acceptance by the troika of the measures contained in the jobs initiative; and the extension of the fiscal adjustment period to 2015.</P>
        <P>Another key element of our strategy involves a strengthening of economic and fiscal co-ordination in the euro area.  A set of measures that go beyond recently adopted reforms will be put in place, reflecting the need for greater co-ordination within a monetary union.  In general terms, the surveillance of national budgets in the euro area will be tightened.  Specifically, among other things, euro area member states will be required to adopt fiscal rules into national legislation to consult with other member states before adopting any policies with potential spill-over effects.  More rigorous oversight is envisaged for member states in excessive deficit &mdash; in other words, where deficits and-or debt are too high.</P>
        <P>A number of important governance improvements were also endorsed.  There are many dimensions to this including the following: Heads of State or Government of the euro area will meet at least twice a year at euro summits in order to strengthen euro area governance and ensure closer integration; there will be a president of the euro summit; the EU Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs has been given additional functions; and various changes at the level of officials to improve matters are also envisaged.</P>
        <P>In my view, governance reform is essential.  There is no point in addressing the symptoms without addressing the underlying root causes.  In other words, the Government&rsquo;s view is that <Col N="221"/>every appropriate step should be taken to ensure that the difficulties now confronting us do not recur.  As such, we are very supportive of enhanced economic governance within the euro area.  The lesson from the current predicament is very simple.  Being part of a monetary union requires effective co-ordination and surveillance of monetary and fiscal policies, which can only be achieved through an adequate and balanced system of governance.</P>
        <P>I will briefly outline some of the main guiding principles regarding our approach to the governance debate as it moves to its next stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland is firmly in favour of improved governance that is balanced and offers correct safeguards.  We believe it is in all our interests.  The urgency of the current situation demands prioritisation of value added measures that can be implemented quickly and, preferably, within the existing treaty.  We need to see and then assess in due course any proposal that may require treaty change.  We propose that institutional balance must be maintained, avoiding, where possible, excessive use of intergovernmental methods and respecting the role and expertise of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that these are unpredictable and worrying times but a significant amount of progress has been made at European level to deal with this crisis.  There is no doubt that further steps need to be taken.  The euro has been good for Ireland and has contributed dramatically to its economic growth in the past decade.  The euro can be great for Ireland in the future.  Ireland&rsquo;s place is in the euro.  There is no viable alternative.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, to the House and wish her continued success in her Ministry.  As deputy leader of the Council of Europe group, I have found the Minister of State accessible.  This is the first occasion on which the Minister of State has provided a briefing for Members prior to the meeting in Strasbourg, which is helpful.  It is hoped the Minister of State will be able to continue to provide this service to Members.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State, when in opposition and Chairman of the Sub-Committee on the Review of the Role of the Oireachtas in European Affairs, of which I was a member, brought forward an excellent document in regard to legislation from Europe and its role in regard to the Oireachtas.  That document was particularly influential in terms of the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  Under the Lisbon treaty, the D&aacute;il and Seanad have powers in regard to the referral, postponement or vetoing, in co-operation with other parliaments, of Bills.  However, this House has not thus far received any European legislation for scrutiny.  While the sectoral committees deal with legislation, they do not, as far as I am aware, have the same powers as the D&aacute;il or Seanad in terms of referral, deferral or revocation of legislation from Europe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Perhaps the Minister of State will, through discussions with the Whips and the Leader of the Seanad &mdash; I know Senator Cummins and members of the Government parties in the Seanad are open to this idea &mdash; provide that the Seanad deal once a month with controversial European Bills.  There is a wealth of information and talent in this House, an expertise in different fields from the length and breadth of this country, which would ensure Bills in respect of bogs, septic tanks and so on are thrashed out in a detailed manner.  Currently, numerous Bills are being passed without proper scrutiny.  The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs no longer undertakes scrutiny of legislation and the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny no longer exists.  Such legislation is referred to sectoral committees.  Perhaps the Minister of State will ensure Bills which she deems worthy of detailed discussion are discussed in this House, following which, if considered necessary, such legislation could be deferred or vetoed in co-operation with other member states.</P><Col N="222"/>
        <P Just="Left">The current situation in Europe is complex and is evolving every hour owing to the situation in Italy and the failure of the motion of confidence in the Italian Prime Minister.  The situation in Greece is also complicated.  All of this is putting great pressure on the euro and the stability of the European Union and eurozone.  On the proposal to introduce a further treaty on integration, support for that would be unlikely given the current experience in Ireland in terms of the recently held referendums.  We must defend our 12.5% corporation tax.  There is a danger that any treaty seeking a unified tax approach in the European Union would target our corporation tax rate.  Our corporation tax rate is the key to our future success.  I do not want to take up the time of the House recalling all the decisions and broken promises of this Government.  I did not stand for election in the last general election.  However, the 58 members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party who lost their seats must be aggrieved that the public was misled in relation to burning the bondholders and the statement of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, that the banks would not receive another cent.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, to the House and thank her for the update on the situation in the eurozone.  As the Minister of State said, this is an extremely worrying and unpredictable time for everyone.  People are frightened and confused and the complexities of the problems are beyond the comprehension of most ordinary people.  I am sure many Members of this House would admit to being confused by the complexities of the problem within the eurozone.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was great optimism and hope following the European Council and euro summit on 27 October in terms of the identification of key priorities for internal economic policy.  However, the political chaos in Greece and uncertainty in Italy during the past week have undone much of that good work.  People are concerned and confused by the difference of opinion between economists and experts in regard to how to resolve the problems within the eurozone, in particular those in Ireland.  Those of us who tune into current affairs programmes are aware how widely experts can differ.</P>
        <P>Since taking office seven months ago, this Government has acted responsibly and in the best interests of the country.  It had a huge job to do to repair our reputation abroad.  Everyone accepts that was a major job of work.  The Government has astutely negotiated interest rate reductions of &euro;10 billion, convinced the troika to support job creation measures, secured approval to reverse the reduction in the minimum wage and obtained an extension to 2015 in <Col N="223"/>the fiscal adjustment period.  Political stability in Ireland, in contrast to Greece and Italy, leaves us well positioned to attract inward investment when we begin to emerge from the recession.  I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, that this is dependent on us honouring our commitments and debts.</P>
        <P>We must hope that the measures being put in place to put Greek debt back on a sustainable footing, coupled with the extension of the capacity of the EFSF and measures to ensure Europe&rsquo;s banks are adequately capitalised, will have the desired effects.  As in Ireland, poor governance and regulation throughout the eurozone is the cause of where we are today.  I welcome the tightening of surveillance of national budgets, more rigorous oversight of member states in excessive deficit and the changes at official level.  The appointment of a president of the euro summit is welcome.  We must never allow what has happened throughout the eurozone to occur again.  We should certainly support changes to the treaty if these are necessary.  However, like Senator Leyden, I would be concerned about any attempt to alter our corporation tax rate of 12.5% because much of our inward investment is attracted by that low tax rate and we have to fight to maintain it at all costs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While this is a very worrying time for many people, we have to welcome the progress that has been made, as the Minister of State has outlined.  We should all be supporting the Government in its efforts in these difficult times.  We need to restore confidence in the economy.  We need to get banks lending to small business and we need to help small and medium businesses.  We need to encourage multinationals to invest further in the country.  We have to reduce the scourge of unemployment and we have to give people back their dignity.  We have a strong team batting for us in Europe, led by our Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny and our Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan and the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton.  We wish them well as they have a difficult job but they have got off to a good start and significant progress has been made in seven months.  I am very confident that if we are back here this time next year, we will be in a much better situation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The situation in Europe is very fluid and worrying.  I find it difficult to grasp what is happening.  As Senator Mullins said, if different economists with doctorates from Harvard disagree on fundamental issues to do with Europe, it is very difficult for an ordinary citizen to discover what is really going on.  I noted that this is the longest period in hundreds of years in which Europe has not been at war with itself and this is significant.  The European Union, formerly the Common Market, was born out of the ashes of two world wars which claimed the lives of 17 million people in the First World War and approximately 25 million people in the Second World War.  Europeans realised that European integration was important and that the biggest scourge for Europe was extreme nationalism which culminated in the Second World War when Hitler used Europe to further his aims.</P>
        <P>Europe is now at a very serious financial crisis but the bigger picture shows that Europe is at peace, militarily but perhaps not financially.  The generations who went before us suffered massive unemployment and also were the casualties of two wars.  I remind the House that 7 million civilians died in the First World War.  No matter how bad things are, one hundred years ago in 1911 the rumblings of the First World War were beginning and extreme nationalism took hold of Europe.  It almost destroyed Europe and it destroyed many lives.  This is a democracy and Ireland and this House should do everything to help ensure that Europe can live in peace.</P><Col N="224"/>

I am in business and I know how difficult it has been and I know that businesses and families are suffering but when we get our financial sovereignty back that will be a good day.

	<P>We lost our sovereignty and no amount of denial will solve the problem but we must move on from here.  Today we are a little further forward than we were six months ago, even though we are not in a great position.  The Minister of State may be better informed than I am about the situation in Greece and Italy as it seems to be difficult to comprehend.  I note that Berlusconi has lost his vote but he won the vote on the austerity measures.  I do not know if this is correct but the Greek Prime Minister-elect has said he will not agree to the austerity measures so I am at a loss to know to what has happened in the last <Col N="225"/>half an hour.  It seems that by tomorrow morning our debate could be dealing again with a problem in Greece or a case where Italy has survived.</P>
        <P>On a lighter note, I am pleased that Trapattoni and not Berlusconi is in charge of our team next week.</P>

	<P>It is always a pleasure to listen to Senator Harte.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wonder when Europe will have its plan B ready because it is difficult to see much of a future for Greece under the present arrangements.  Perhaps it should never have been admitted to the euro and it should certainly have been allowed to get out because we deprived it of its ability to set its own interest rates and exchange rate.  Prolonging the agony of Greece by holding it within the eurozone is a wrong policy.  The eurozone has to come to terms with this.  The countries which did not join the eurozone, the Scandinavians and the United Kingdom, are the ones which have retained these instruments of economic policy.  The design flaws in the euro were that there was no exit mechanism and it is about time we came up with an exit mechanism rather than hold countries in the euro against their long-term interest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was assumed that lower interest rates and significant capital flows would solve problems but Ireland is the test case of this assumption.  So much capital flowed from Germany into Irish banks that it destroyed asset prices in this country, destroyed the banking system and this eventually undermined the public finances.  We were warned back in 2000 of the dangers for Ireland in joining the eurozone when the United Kingdom was remaining outside.  We confused the benefits of Europe, the EU, as a free trade area which had operated for 50 years, with the common currency.  Ireland is an illustration that this common currency failed because it promoted such unstable flows that it destroyed asset values in this country and eventually the public finances.  I am not so sure that having more presidents in Europe is the way to solve that problem.  The plan B in Europe will be two currencies, probably one based on Germany and the other based on the Mediterranean.  Continuing the experiment when it is causing so much misery throughout the European Union calls into question just how stubborn do people have to be in continuing with policies which cause so much misery for European citizens.  I do not welcome the unprecedented interference in the internal affairs of Greece and Italy in recent weeks.  These countries are democracies which should be entitled to have their own systems of government.</P>
        <P>We ignored strong advice when we joined the euro.  It is a relatively small proportion of our trade &mdash; about one third of the total.  Joining without the United Kingdom was foolhardy. We did not have proper institutions to control the capital flows.  As the Minister of State said, we had massive failures of governance in the way we ran banks and in the way the Department of Finance was run.  I refer to the sheer lack of economic expertise in the Department of Finance as referred to in the Wright report.  Only 7% of the staff had qualifications at masters level in economics.</P>
        <P>We did not know what we were doing when we got involved in this and there has been an extremely difficult adjustment period coping with that mistake.  Europe must seek not merely to patch the thing up yet again but fundamentally to rethink whether we can retain the benefits of the European Union as a free trader, with all the gains and trade the Minister of State mentioned, in a currency union that is not working.  This may require treaty change which would be very difficult to get passed in this country.  We rejected treaty changes twice before and as a result referendums were held twice.  This did not show the EU being held in great <Col N="226"/>public esteem.  When something does not work eventually governments must get together and admit this is the case.  The experiment of the euro is now firmly in that category.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As things stand it is not possible for current arrangements to deal with eurozone debtors Spain and Italy, but they can deal with Greece.  The combination of both Spain and Italy would come to more than &euro;2.2 trillion in public debt.  That is almost twice as high as the proposed &euro;1.25 trillion European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, vehicle.  That latter amount would have only enough firepower to keep buying Spanish and Italian government debt for approximately two years, assuming &euro;10 billion per week at a purchase rate.  This would not be able to cover the full insurance of the bonds and also assumes that no other country would require help.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given these constraints, it is clear that the only credible lender of last resort is the ECB.  That is where we must get to, at some stage.  Every other fiscal zone in the world that has its central bank as the lender of last resort, as such, is enabled to print money.  The main method of doing this is quantitative easing such that a central bank can buy the country&rsquo;s own bonds.  The initial thought of providing 20% to 30% first-clause insurance is completely nonsensical because an investor buying government bonds would naturally expect to get much more back from a eurozone sovereign investment than simply 20% to 30% on the euro.  When a sovereign state defaults its recovery value is based upon whatever IMF-sponsored bailout restructuring can be arranged.  I cannot see how it is possible to suggest 20% to 30% insurance could be supplied during bailout recovery if this is being supplied by the same institutions to which we are looking for that bailout.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the end we saw the ECB stepping up its buying programme to more than &euro;10 billion last week yet the Italian five and ten year bond yields are on a one-way ticket to 7%.  The general belief in the market is that the EFSF will simply not have enough firepower to stem the flow.  The only way a concerted market short can be tackled is to ensure that those trying to force down the market have no idea of the size of the pool of money against which they are playing.  By setting an upper limit on the EFSF the bears know what they are fighting.  Were the ECB to have a mandate to print money and buy it would require much less money to turn the market around simply because the bears would be the ones with the constraints on their limits <Col N="227"/>of capacity, rather than the ECB.  One cannot beat an unlimited capacity so why try?  The problem is Germany and its completely irrational fear of inflation.  When we get beyond that we will be all right.</P>
        <P>Ireland is not Greece but we must make some comparisons.  Greek default equals Greek-style austerity.  We have not gone anywhere near that.  The last round of austerity in that country required a 15% further reduction in public sector salaries, a &euro;5 billion increase in income taxes, a &euro;5 billion decrease in social welfare payments, 2,000 schools being closed and 30,000 public sector employees going on short-time work before being let go in 18 months.  We are nowhere near that sort of position.</P>
        <P>I mention some other points.  If a nation is impoverished from outside that nation will rise up.  The Greeks are being impoverished by the extent of the austerity imposed on its citizens.  We seem to have forgotten that it is not so long since some of the 17 countries in the eurozone had military dictators &mdash; Spain, in the early 1970s, Greece in the mid-1970s.  If we push a nation hard enough &mdash; I am not concerned about the people who merely riot, the thugs &mdash; and if its middle class is impoverished it will rise up and there will be a revolt.  That can happen.  We have been looking down our noses at some of the slaughter going on in sub-Saharan Africa but in the last century Europe slaughtered its citizens more than did any other continent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Are we to continue going down this route because we want to hold true to a principle argued 15 years ago, prior to the establishment of the ECB between the Germans and the French?  On that occasion the Germans won and made the ECB entirely independent of political control.  At some stage the nations of the Continent must step up to the plate and put in place the structures required to force the ECB to print money.  It must happen.  Barry Eichengreen, the US scholar, has a view that on every occasion that European Ministers or leaders meet they kick the can down the road and make a bad scenario worse.  That seems to be where we are getting to but eventually we must bringing this situation to a conclusion and it will be by means of the ECB printing money and putting more money into circulation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume I will be accorded the same time to speak.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, for the work she is doing, but it is rather unfortunate she has been briefed against by her own Government.  That appeared to be the case judging from an article published last weekend.  It is very fortunate she has support from Senator Terry Leyden on this side of the House, while I have expressed personally to the Minister of State my belief she is doing a very good job.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I mean it in a genuine way.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight some points.  Many speakers have made statements, including the Minister of State.  She stated, echoed by her colleagues, she is very supportive of enhanced economic governance.  I am not, nor is my party.  Page 8 of the communiqu&eacute; explains what enhanced governance and surveillance means.  It means adoption in member states of rules on a balanced budget.  I do not agree with that.  If we had those rules on balanced budgets in 2008 when our taxes came over a cliff, we would have been obliged to cut social welfare by up to 40% in that year alone, rather than take in the long period ahead.</P><Col N="228"/>
        <P Just="Left">There is an invitation to national parliaments to take into account recommendations adopted at EU level on the conduct of economic and budgetary policies.  There is now a commitment in this programme to stick to the recommendations of the Commission and of the relevant Commissioner regarding the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact.  For member states in the excessive deficit procedure, which includes us, of course, but also most eurozone countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>Five or six excepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Are there only five or six?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  Any country with a deficit higher than 3% is included, thus most euro countries.  Under these proposals the Commission and the Council would be able to examine national draft budgets and adopt an opinion on them before their adoption by the Parliament.  Therefore, the entire secrecy in the budgetary process would be exempted in order to allow the Commission to decide what would be in our budget.  In addition, it would be entitled to suggest amendments.  I find much of this very concerning.  While others seem to welcome it with open arms and express support for it, I do not believe much thought has been given to it.  The language used is: &ldquo;in the case of slippages of an adjustment programme closer monitoring and coordination of programme implementation will take place&rdquo;.  That is what the Government signed up for a couple of weeks ago.  It may be necessary in the context of receiving financial aid from other countries but in terms of the normal run of countries, we are ceding even more sovereignty to the European Commission because currently under the EU-IMF arrangement, we have broad capacity to decide what will be in our budget as long as we reach the targets set out in terms of annual deficits.  That is the reality and what the IMF said.  The Government can do what it likes in the budget as long as it achieves a certain target.  The Government has full economic sovereignty over what it wants to do.  Even if we were in the bond market and not the IMF, we would have to reach certain targets and our choices would be limited.  </P>
        <P>I would like to ask the Minister of State about the EFSF bond auction yesterday, which was cancelled last week.  What is the Government doing in terms of a contingency plan?  It is deeply worrying if the EFSF cannot borrow money on the markets or is only getting a limited demand for the money.  What is the Government doing in terms of a fall-back?  Are we sitting back and waiting for &ldquo;Merkozy&rdquo; or whatever one wants to call them to tell us what is going on because unfortunately, that is what has been happening?  When the Taoiseach and the Minister of State came back from Brussels in July with the reduced interest rate, we all welcomed that.  They also claimed credit for the extension of the terms of the loans when that very week in the D&aacute;il, the Taoiseach said he was not looking an extension of the terms of the loans.  In our interests, the Government must be more actively engaged in what is going on in Europe because it seems we are not doing anything.  If this all goes belly up, will we say &ldquo;Oh no!  Merkozy did not work it out&rdquo;?  We must work it out.</P>
        <P>I take issue with something the Minister of State said which was also said by the Government earlier this year, namely, the allegation that Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers did not attend European meetings.  The evidence suggests the opposite.  A study was done in Sweden which found that Ireland was the fifth best attender at European meetings over a ten-year period.  The Minister of State, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the T&aacute;naiste spoke about the tragedy that Ireland did not attend meetings.  The table done by Swedish academics shows that we were <Col N="229"/>number five.  A very wrong message was sent out.  I was certainly annoyed with the previous Government when I heard that but when I checked the facts, the allegation did not stand up.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  I refer to the availability of money, in particular for small and medium-sized businesses.  The Minister of State referred to a structure, or a mechanism, to make money available to small and medium-sized companies.  Will she elaborate on what is proposed in that regard because it is one of the big problems facing this country?  To give her an idea of the problems we face, a friend of mine was involved in a project in France costing &euro;20 million and was able to borrow &euro;18 million in Germany at 3.85% fixed for ten years.  The project has now finished and is yielding quite a good return.  The same facility would not be available in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to touch on an issue raised by Senator Terry Leyden and which I have raised on a number of occasions in this House.  On the last occasion I raised it, I proposed that two days per month be set aside in this House to deal with legislation and proposals coming from the European institutions.  I have a very strong view on that having served in the European Parliament for two years, having seen the volume of legislation with which we must deal and, in particular, because Europe will now have a greater say on the issues affecting our financial planning, whether we like it.  Will the Minister of State take that proposal on board?</P>
        <P>I have seen proposals from Europe go through various joint Oireachtas committees but, unfortunately, those committees do not have adequate time to deal with major issues.  It is time we looked at that.  This House could play a very useful and constructive role in dealing with those issues.  Is the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs prepared to support that proposal and to see how we could advance it further?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State and would like to pick up on the point Senator Colm Burke made.  The Minister of State was chairman of a sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs of which I was a member in the last Administration.  She brought forward proposals at that time which would be very much <i>ad idem </i>with what Senator Colm Burke suggested, so perhaps she would have a comment to make in that regard because the new configuration of committees cannot physically, mentally, logistically and in every other way deal with the volume of directives and other proposals from Europe.  Senator Colm Burke is absolutely right, so perhaps the Minister of State will have something to say on that.</P>
        <P>I refer to some of the remarks made by those on the other side of the House.  I would probably say the same if I was on that side.  I know the Minister of State will not comment on all the promises and commitments made to the electorate before and subsequent to the election, on the activities in which the Government has been involved, on the quote on 5 February that it is neither morally right nor economically sustainable for taxpayers to be asked to beggar themselves to make profits for speculators, on the statement made on 9 February by the now Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, that not another cent would go to the banks and so on.</P>
        <P>The one thing that emerged last week was not so much what was happening in Greece or the emerging Italian crisis but the fact that this Government sanctioned the payment of &euro;700 million to junior bondholders, which was not guaranteed or secured and did not have to be paid.  I appreciate there is a moral argument and I understand from where the Minister of State is coming in terms of responding to why we were obliged to pay this money but this Government will find, as the last one found, that public opinion can shift very quickly.  It is very volatile.</P><Col N="230"/>
        <P>It is in that context that I ask the Minister of State whether she agrees there is a very real crisis of leadership in the European Union.  Is there a need for Ireland to take a lead in the way it did in the past among like-minded nations in Europe to try to build some sort of an alliance for the smaller nations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what we are doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would be interested to hear the Minister of State develop that point.  The crisis we now face is not only a financial one but a political one.  It has great potential to do very real damage to democracy in Europe, on which the foundations of Europe have been built following the Second World War.  It is somewhat apposite that Senator Jimmy Harte made a reference to Hitler.  It was in somewhat similar circumstances in the late 1920s and early 1930s that democracy came under threat and we saw the rise of fascism and of the right in Europe, which is now happening, primarily because, as was said by some of the other contributors, the middle classes are now beginning to be hit more and more.  In such cases, they tend to drift more to the right.  Does the Minister of State have any view on that?  I know she has made public statements on governance and standards in government over the years both as a Deputy and, more recently, as a Minister of State.</P>
        <P>There is a very real difficulty for us from a democratic perspective.  Has the Minister of State any insight into whether these matters have been discussed by the Council?  Are they being discussed at the level at which she is operating?  Are they being discussed outside the immediate financial difficulties, namely, the eurozone crisis?  Is there a recognition in Europe that there could be a very real threat to the stability of Europe and the democratic institutions on which Europe has been founded?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their very interesting statements, their lively contributions and their questions so far.  First, I will address the two questions asked by Senator Colm Burke.  On supporting SMEs, I could not agree more with the Senator.  The Irish economic model is a good one to highlight the importance of SMEs because we have already seen the upturn in inward investment and exports.  That is what is driving the limited growth we will see this year.  It is expected that we will achieve 1% growth for 2011.  That is almost exclusively driven by exports.  It is the domestic level in which we are suffering a general degree of stagnation.  This is down to the challenges that have faced small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, over the past several years.  Even before the crash, the costs of doing business were rising every year with increasing amounts of bureaucracy strangling many SMEs.  This came into more focus over the past two years.  However, there have been reductions in certain costs for businesses, particularly labour costs, which have made us more competitive.  Ireland is now seventh in the world competitiveness rankings but we have much further to go.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The key issue for SMEs is access to credit.  The Government, through the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Perry, has put in place a commitment to underpin investment in SMEs in cases where the banks are not in a position to lend.  This will come into force soon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The European Central Bank, ECB, has a moral obligation to make available as much credit as is possible for viable businesses and projects in all EU member states.  This is a responsibility the ECB&rsquo;s leadership is now taking more seriously than perhaps it had in the past because of the degree of the crisis.  At the European Council meeting on 23 November, the Taoiseach made the specific request that the ECB would prioritise programme countries &mdash; Greece, Portugal and Ireland &mdash; which was agreed in the Council&rsquo;s conclusions.  While we do not have <Col N="231"/>the full details of this yet, it is a substantial commitment.  Already, officials from the Department of Finance are working with the ECB and other member states to see how quickly this commitment can be activated.</P>
        <P>In July, agreement was reached to relax the co-financing requirements for the drawing down of funding from the Structural and Cohesion Funds.  Obviously, the amounts involved for Ireland were much larger 20 years ago but these funds are still relevant.  Last Saturday in Cork, I discussed concrete proposals with the regional authority and chamber of commerce which could use Structural and Cohesion Funds.  The Minister of State with responsibility for SMEs,  Deputy Perry, along with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government through infrastructure projects, have roles to play in assisting businesses draw down from these funds and have a direct impact on the economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is anxious for the European Commission&rsquo;s Single Market Act to be implemented.  It is also a priority of the Polish EU Presidency which I know has suffered a certain amount of frustration when dealing with the European Commission to drive this project.  The Single Market Act is the single most important instrument available to the European Union to drive job creation and economic growth.  While it is easy for multinational companies to access capital and credit across borders, it is a major challenge for SMEs.  From visiting Paris and Berlin with Irish SMEs getting assistance from Enterprise Ireland, I have learned they cannot get access to venture capital or credit in other EU member states.  A very simple tweaking of the rules will make it easier for these SMEs.  The Single Market Act is on top of my agenda, as well as being at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s agenda.</P>
        <P>I am committed to the Seanad becoming more involved in dealing with EU legislation, a point raised by Senators Leyden and Mooney.  I spent my first six months in office prioritising the agenda of reputation-building in the European Union, restructuring how we handle and co-ordinate European affairs in government &mdash; in which we have made great strides in the past several months &mdash; and elevating the role of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in scrutinising European legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having been a member of the European affairs and scrutiny committees with Senators Leyden and Mooney, I believed the scrutiny committee needed to be abolished with the European affairs committee being the more appropriate body to co-ordinate the scrutiny of EU legislation.  I am disappointed, however, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs has not stepped up to the plate in this regard.  I will happily discuss with the committee better ways to implement EU legislation.  The sectoral committees must be the vehicle for detailed scrutiny because they have the expertise.  The European affairs and scrutiny committees are general committees and Members with general skills sit on them.  It is a pointless exercise having them deal with the minutiae of sectoral EU legislation.</P>
        <P>There is also a large role for the Seanad to deal with EU scrutiny.  I am not suggesting Members do not have much on their plates as they are very busy legislating.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not actually.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>We can make room.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an obvious role for this House to scrutinise EU legislation.  I have always advocated this and I will speak with the Leader and the Whip to ensure this happens.  It is important the potential of the Seanad, as well as the whole of Parliament, is fully realised.  I am more than happy to take up this cause.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is only one case of the Oireachtas issuing a yellow card against an EU proposal under the Lisbon treaty terms.  Other EU member state parliaments have had multiple instances of <Col N="232"/>this.  There is an onus on Members to utilise the mechanisms given to them by the Lisbon treaty.  It is not just about red-carding legislation but getting actively involved with the Commission.  Members, who are always welcome in the corridors of the European Commission and European Parliament, should meet with Commissioners and their officials to see how best our legislative and policy agendas can be synchronised.  Ministers, likewise, need to be more engaged with the Commission in this regard.  We can agree with that.  That probably answers Senator Mooney&rsquo;s first question as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State needs to establish a new relationship with the committees.  She will get into a turf war because they are already engaging in the process right now, but they are not engaging in it adequately as this House is suggesting.  They are currently engaging in that process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a positive step.  I cannot do the work of committees for the committees but I will happily engage with them.  It is also for the committees to ensure that their line Minister comes before them to discuss the issues.  If there is a policy issue that is of concern to a committee, whether it is something in the pipeline or coming forward in a tangible, legislative process, it is not for the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs to hold the hands of committee members and make them address it; it is for the committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the role of the Seanad in that context?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I am saying; the role of the Seanad is for Senators and the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges to decide and define how it wants the Seanad to operate in that regard.  There is nothing stopping the Seanad.  I am very supportive of that role being taken up by the Seanad.  We do not have any conflict.  We are <i>ad idem</i>.  I am happy to support the much greater and much enhanced engagement of the Seanad in the scrutiny of legislative proposals coming from the European Commission.  There is no question about that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with the Senator&rsquo;s sentiment on the political crisis in the eurozone and the overall context, and the question of public support for the project.  We clearly have a political crisis.  I have spoken about it many times since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  On the one hand some Members have talked about the unedifying intervention or interference in the democratic processes in sovereign member states, but on the other hand we want to see political leadership at European level.  One cannot isolate the two.  It is all very well to say that what is happening in Italy or Greece has nothing to do with us but at the same time it is very popular and indeed populist in this country to beat President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel over the heads with a stick when they try to get into action mode while at the same time criticising them for months for a lack of action.  There is a double standard of which we are perhaps all guilty.  It is clear that the engine of the European project has always been a Franco-German one.  That is what rose from the ashes of the Second World War.  We need that engine to maintain the political momentum and underpin the European project.  That is in all of our interests.  There is a fine line between that momentum becoming some sort of domination.  We must be clear about that.  That is where the institutional balance is so important.</P>
        <P>The problem with the current crisis is that it was never anticipated.  We do not have the mechanisms in place to deal with such a crisis so the French and German Heads of Government have stepped forward.  We have insisted that they step forward to take an active leadership role.  I was very disappointed with the lack of action from political leaders in the past eight months since my appointment and prior to that.  I was critical of it, but I am pleased that at <Col N="233"/>the eurozone summit on the 26 and 27 October we did finally see decisive action from Chancellor Merkel in particular.  I give her credit for that.  If there were one or two reasons as to why the banking federation agreed to undertake the 50% haircut on Greek debt, which was so important for us, it was because Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy demanded that they do so.  I for one welcomed that step and I am pleased that it happened.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That does not answer the question about how we go forward and how we deal with this very delicate balance in the future.  It goes back to the question of how we want to govern ourselves in the European Union, most particularly how we want to govern ourselves in the eurozone.  We have a big process of reflection to undertake.  We do not have the luxury or the time to do it right now with the crisis gathering around us like a storm.  We must deal with the immediate crisis with the instruments we have available to us but post this crisis, when we resolve the issue in the eurozone, in regard to the EFSF we must address the wider issue of governance.  I support entirely Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s comments on that, the ECB must be the backstop against contagion.  It is the only option.  I have blogged about that on my website and I have spoken about it in media interviews in recent days.  That is an essential element to the current crisis but when we move beyond that we must have a much broader reflection.  This country must not only participate in it but we must lead it.  I have been working on developing links with my counterparts and with key stakeholders in all of the member states about how we move forward and find solutions to the governance issue that challenges the European Union in the future.  However, now is not the time.  Between now and Christmas we must find a lasting and credible solution to the current financial crisis.  It is in all our interests to do so.  Our very economic existence is at stake.  I do not think that is to overstate the severity and the seriousness of the matter but beyond that we must reflect and have a process of engagement with each other where we ask how we want the European institutions to coexist in future with the member states, and how we find a way in which the small member states can be valued and encouraged and have a meaningful role in decision making at a European level alongside the big member states who we need because of their economic and political clout.  Those issues are important but I would not like to see us indulge in that type of discussion at this moment when we need a solution to the urgent and serious crisis we face.  It is a discussion for another day.  Perhaps I could return to the House for a good discussion about it when the time comes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Could we be assured that in backing what is the sentiment of the House in regard to discussing and debating European legislation the Minister of State would also promote the provision of resources for that purpose because it cannot be done in a vacuum?  Resources need to be provided if we are to take on that role.  It is not enough for the Minister of State to say that she supports the proposal and that it is the way to proceed; she also needs to fight the case in terms of resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to fight that case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her response to issues raised by me and Senator Leyden.  Given the volume of EU legislation that is coming through, one of the problems is that committees are under pressure.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and many issues at a national level are confronting it.  The one committee that is working effectively on EU changes is the Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture because of the big volume of funding coming from Europe for agriculture.  There is a need to bring items that are being discussed at European level into the public arena in this country.  Discussion in the Seanad would be a useful exercise, whereas it does not necessarily happen in committees.  Putting matters in the public arena at an early stage shows that constructive proposals are coming from Europe.</P><Col N="234"/>
        <P>I saw an appalling article in a newspaper in the past week.  We have 12 MEPs but the article said we had 13.  It did not get its figures right.  It complained about the fact that MEPs are getting &euro;225,000 to employ staff for research on work going through the Parliament and also to disseminate information to the approximately 1 million people each MEP represents.  That is less than 20 cent per annum per head of population in each constituency, which is less than one eighth of the cost of one newspaper per day.  That issue does not seem to be taken up by the media at all.</P>

	<P>I am delighted with the delegation of scrutiny of EU legislation to this House.  The Minister of State has a busy portfolio and the situation is tense in Europe currently.  She chaired a group and prepared a paper on the Lisbon treaty.  She put a tremendous amount of work into it.  The Cathaoirleach will be involved in the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The key legislation will be dealt with by the sectoral committees but there is a need for backup from the committee system &mdash; for example the Joint Committee on European Affairs could come to the House in support of the legislation.  That would be one way of dealing with it rather than duplicating the work.  The Joint Committee on European Affairs has its own role but it has not dealt with any legislation unlike what happened previously.  It would be a tremendous role for the Seanad.  Under the Lisbon treaty it was specifically intended that parliaments would have an increased role.</P>
        <P>I am open to correction but I understand a sectoral committee cannot refer or reject&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Therefore, there will be delegated responsibility.  During the campaign I remember attending a forum discussing the role of the Seanad, which is a great resource.  If we got one piece of legislation every few weeks at least we could show what can be done in this House in a detailed and comprehensive fashion.  Other committees would be agreeable in this regard.  I spoke to a colleague a while ago who told me there are approximately 60 Bills before the finance committee, and they are not receiving full scrutiny.  Only three or four have been scrutinised and the rest are being sent back without amendment.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister of State is here today and being constructive.  Going through what happened in the past will not help anything.

For far too long that has not happened and we have a wonderful opportunity to use this House and the committee structure to make our contribution at a European level much more robust.  I reiterate the <Col N="235"/>point that it is important we do not simply go down the road of scrutinising with a view to blocking legislation in a negative sense.  We should also look at the policy agenda.</P>
        <P>The European Commission is publishing its work programme this month and it will be out within a week or ten days.  Across every sector there will be an array of interesting and challenging proposals with opportunities for this House to feed into the process.  I would strongly urge that this would happen.  I will speak to the Whip and the Leader of the House, making known my support for that proposal, which seems to have all-party consensus in the House.  It is an excellent idea and I would love to see it happen.  I will engage with the issue again in the weeks and months ahead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me the opportunity to raise this issue of the cost of alcohol.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Shortall, and I am glad she has come before the House because she has a particular interest in the area.  The issue at hand is the price at which alcohol is being sold in many outlets across the country.  It arose as an issue following the abolition of the groceries order six years ago.  There was a suggestion at the time that alcohol would not be included in the measure and there would be a floor below which the price could not fall.  That did not happen.</P>
        <P>In the past ten years we have seen a sharp rise in the number of premises licensed to sell alcohol, and they now include petrol stations, supermarkets and convenience stores.  At the same time, and probably as a result of the economic climate, traditional pubs across the country have seen their numbers fall.  The issue was brought to the fore last week by the father of David Higgins, a young man who died tragically by suicide.  I heard the man on the radio last week and he attributed his son&rsquo;s death to the availability of cheap alcohol and all-night parties.  My home has students and my home town also has a university and Cork Institute of Technology.  Drinking at house parties before young people go to clubs has become very popular and such activity happens on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night.</P>
        <P>There is much alcohol available very cheaply and taking in all the supermarkets, the price of alcohol is amazing.  It is not unusual to get a can of beer for a euro or even less depending on the time of year or the type of loss leader that the supermarkets wish to promote.  There have been calls to amend the practice for some time, although I do not know what action is possible, there are issues of competition, for example.  There must be some way to introduce a control on the price of alcohol.</P>
        <P>Many groups are calling for this control, particularly the Vintners Federation of Ireland, although people might think that group would seek control of the price of alcohol because it is in competition with supermarkets and off-licences.  I have always maintained that vintners and licensed premises have a certain responsibility.  They do not want to lose their licences and can also see if somebody is taking too much alcohol and needs to be controlled.  We are all aware of those kinds of scenario.</P>
        <P>When somebody buys a lot of alcohol from a supermarket or off-licence and drinks it at home, there is nobody to tell that person that enough drink has been taken.  Drinking in a <Col N="236"/>licensed premises means the environment is controlled.  We must respect that.  I have examined supermarkets and garage outlets and young people could be selling the product.  That is not to say they are irresponsible but they certainly do not have the same interest in the welfare of those to whom they sell the alcohol.</P>
        <P>In the media today there is a report from the Health Research Board about the significant increase in health problems relating to alcohol.  We all know the social consequences.  Last week Alcohol Action Ireland called on the Government to tackle alcohol pricing Under the umbrella group, the ISPCC is supporting calls for minimum pricing to protect young people.  The Irish Cancer Society is seeking minimum pricing for health reasons and Barnardos is doing so in highlighting parental abuse of young people arising from alcohol consumption.  Research from the Rape Crisis network indicated that 80% of people investigated in rape files sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions had been drinking.  There are numerous examples of organisations supporting this position so I ask the Government to consider the issue and investigate what can be done to ensure this phenomenon is tackled.  We have seen its effects and it must be dealt with.</P>
        <P>The price of alcohol can be very high in some pubs, which might have an effect on the issue.  Alcohol is a drug that should be controlled and we are in a very dangerous position, particularly as we consider the effect on young people in society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising the issue, which is timely.  Apart from the report from the HRB, to which the Senator referred and which indicated we have alarming rates of alcohol consumption in this country, another report was launched this morning by the North West Alcohol Forum.  This report outlined the severe impact that alcohol consumption by parents has on children due to the lack of care and neglect that this leads to in many families.  These effects on young children can last for life.  The report also drew attention to the fact that a significant number of children are taken into care due to the drinking habits of their parents.  It is a timely debate and I welcome the increasing public support, not only as outlined by the various groups mentioned by the Senator, but in the general realisation that we have got to a point in this country where we have done enough damage to ourselves through the abuse of alcohol.</P>
        <P>Alcohol abuse has cost us very dearly, both in human and financial terms.  It has cost us about &euro;3.7 billion due to the huge burden on the health service, lost productivity, days away from work and the costs involved in child care for those children abused due to the abuse of alcohol.  We have no choice at this stage other than to address the problem in a comprehensive way.</P>
        <P>A steering group was set up to address the issue of alcohol abuse in 2009.  It is chaired by the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and representatives of different Departments, agencies and interests in this area.  That steering group recently completed its work.  The final touches are being put on the report and I hope to receive it in the next couple of weeks.  I will be bringing that report to the Cabinet in respect of proposals we will make to address all the aspects of the alcohol abuse problem in this country.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt it is a cultural problem and we all need to examine our attitudes and behaviour towards alcohol.  It is sometimes convenient to talk about alcohol being a problem that affects young people in disadvantaged areas or in particular marginalised groups, but the reality is that as a society, we all have a problem with alcohol.  We drink too much.  We drink more alcohol in this country per head of population than any other country in Europe.  We drink to get drunk more often than anybody else, and young people do exactly the same.  They <Col N="237"/>largely do what they see their parents doing.  For that reason, there is a real onus on legislators to address this problem.</P>
        <P>In recent years, the problem has got out of control, partly due to the boom and partly due to the relaxation of the licensing laws and the lifting of the groceries order.  The World Health Organization indicates that availability and price are two key factors in respect of controlling the use of alcohol.  For this reason, some of the recommendations coming from the steering group will be on availability, licensing and pricing.  This is not straightforward.  Personally, I am committed to introducing minimum pricing.  However, there are legal obstacles to that and I am awaiting legal advice.  There is some case law on minimum pricing for tobacco products, and I hope to get the legal advice shortly.  Our colleagues in Scotland published a Bill this week to introduce minimum pricing and in many ways they are far ahead of us.  It is also being considered in Northern Ireland.  If it is possible, I would like to see it.</P>
        <P>It is important to point out that minimum pricing is not going to penalise people who are moderate drinkers.  I have got some negative feedback with people saying that their only treat is a bottle of wine at the weekend.  Minimum pricing will not penalise moderate drinkers.  It will have a marginal impact on them.  It will have a significant impact on people who have a problem with alcohol and young people.  The drinking habits of young people are very price sensitive and alcohol is being sold at below cost in supermarkets.  Sometimes supermarkets take a hit on the excise duty and VAT.  One supermarket recently advertised two bottles of wine for &euro;5, yet the VAT and excise duty comes to more than that.  There is a price war taking place between the supermarkets at the moment and that has to be addressed.</P>
        <P>While people are concerned that they might lose the opportunity to get a bargain on alcohol, it is important to point out that this is a false economy.  While supermarkets are using alcohol as a loss leader, it means they have to recoup that money through groceries and so on.  People are paying for it in other ways.  Overall, we are all paying a big price as alcohol costs us &euro;3.7 billion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope that we have concrete proposals in the next few weeks, as soon as we have had an opportunity to consider the recommendations from the steering group.  I know there is strong support within the Cabinet to act on this and that there is cross-party support as well.  It is now time to deal with this national problem.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister of State be publishing the report of the steering group?  There have been reports published on the availability of alcohol and the licensed premises that can sell it.  That was never linked to planning regulations.  I have been on councils where we tried not to grant an application for an off-licence when there were many objections among the local community, but An Bord Plean&aacute;la overturned the decision because it is not a planning issue.  Hopefully the report will cover that.</P>

As there is a high level of cross-party concern about this, I am very keen that as many Members as possible have an opportunity to consider the recommendations and to suggest amendments.  I am very open to that.  The only way forward is on a cross-party basis, which I am determined to achieve.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to the House.  This is an all Kerry job.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="238"/>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Do not hold that against us, a Chathaoirligh.  Mayo will definitely rise again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for addressing this important issue, which was raised by our alleged friends in Europe in their continued attempt to harmonise our corporation tax rate with their level, thereby taking away our competitive advantage.  We are well aware that the French and the Germans want to bring more control and are using this European crisis to try to force members of the eurozone and the EU into a situation whereby the financial policies of Ireland and other EU member states would be controlled by a central finance ministry.  This has all the hallmarks of an attempt to create a federal state by the back door.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The EU made an attempt to bring in a constitution but this failed.  It then decided to bring about a constitution by the back door when it brought in the Lisbon treaty.  This did not have the backing of the majority of people, because it was not put before the people.  I am sure those in favour of a federal Europe are rubbing their hands in glee.  I think it was Dick Cheney who said that one should never miss the opportunity provided by a crisis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In view of the current situation, which is changing by the hour, I ask the Minister to address the issue of where Ireland now stands on the common consolidated corporate tax base.  We made a submission to Europe recently, which was the only submission made by this Parliament on proposed EU legislation.  Under the Lisbon treaty we are, as a Parliament, allowed to make submissions on forthcoming EU legislation, and the only time we have done so was with regard to the CCCTB.  I ask the Minster to update the House on where we are on this important issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who sends his apologies.  I thank the Senator for raising this important matter on the floor of the Seanad.</P>
        <P>Senators will be aware that the proposal for a CCCTB was published on 16 March last.  A CCCTB would essentially introduce new common rules for calculating company taxation across the EU and replace the universally accepted &ldquo;separate accounting with arms-length pricing&rdquo; method for allocating group profits across borders with a sharing mechanism under a system known as formulary apportionment.  This new sharing mechanism is essentially a formula which proposes that the individual taxable profit base of each company within an international group would be aggregated or pooled to form a consolidated tax base, which would be reattributed to those same companies based on their presence in any member state, that presence being measured by the scale of assets, employees, payroll and sales in any member state compared to the group as a whole.</P>
        <P>The Commission argues that a directive is needed to tackle tax obstacles that are barriers to the completion of the Single Market and place additional costs on businesses that trade across borders.  It is worth reiterating that the explanatory memorandum to the CCCTB proposal specifically states that there is no intention of extending harmonisation to tax rates and that each member state will be applying its own rate to its own share of the tax base.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s position on the CCCTB is that we remain sceptical of the proposal but we are constructively engaging in the policy and technical debate.  We are not alone among member states in being sceptical about the CCCTB proposal, but all member states are participating in the technical debate on the dossier.  As the Minister for Finance has stated on a number of occasions, despite our scepticism of the merits of the proposal, the Government&rsquo;s view is that it is vital that Ireland is represented in the debate, as it is only by actively engaging in the process that we can ensure all issues of concern are brought to the table.</P><Col N="239"/>
        <P>Our approach to translating constructive engagement into practice has involved a number of different aspects.  First, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are examining the Commission impact assessment in order to assess the potential impact of the proposal on the Exchequer position, and also to determine whether the proposal is rigorous enough to stand up to the requirements of a modern corporate tax system.  In support of our analysis, the Department of Finance commissioned a study on the budgetary and economic impact of the CCCTB on the European Union, which was published in January 2011.  This study, combined with the study on compliance costs commissioned by the Irish Tax Institute, IBEC and the Irish Banking Federation, provides important empirical information supporting Ireland&rsquo;s constructive approach to the CCCTB.</P>
        <P>Second, we are engaging in the European Council working party on tax questions as appropriate and when necessary.  As the discussions on the CCCTB are thus far only in the early stages of examination, our interventions have focused on posing questions and providing observations to the European Commission.  The third element of our approach is to engage with Irish business representatives and our EU partners on the dossier and examine how they consider the CCCTB proposal may affect them.  Engagement with our EU partners allows us to build a pan-European picture of the potential impact of the current proposal and areas in which there may be difficulties.  This last step will be important in the run-up to and during the Irish Presidency of the European Council from 1 January 2013.</P>
        <P>All member state Parliaments are entitled to scrutinise European Union legislation in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.  The Standing Order 103 Select Committee examined the CCCTB in May and determined that it was in breach of the principle of subsidiarity.  Members will be aware that the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in the treaties requires that the Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states but would be better achieved at Union level.  The select committee concluded that the EU failed to provide sufficient detail to allow national parliaments to fully assess the impact of the CCCTB; that the Commission had not established that EU legislation was justified as the best way to meet the broader objectives of the proposals and that actions by individual member states alone could suffice; that the plan would introduce a second parallel tax system within each member state, which would not improve the simplicity and efficiency of EU corporate tax systems; and that there was a concern that the proposal might suit larger member states more and did not adequately address the needs of new start-up SMEs.</P>
        <P>Nine member states, with a total of 13 votes, voted that the CCCTB breached the principle of subsidiarity.  This, however, fell short of the treaty requirement for 18 votes, which would have forced the Commission to re-examine whether the CCCTB was in conformity with the principle of subsidiarity.  The Vice President of the European Commission responded to the reasoned opinion of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 20 October last, maintaining that the CCCTB proposal deals with combating tax obstacles caused by the disparities among national systems in computing the tax base among associated enterprises and that the best way to tackle those obstacles would be a common framework to regulate the computation of the corporate tax base and cross-border consolidation.  It is maintained that these matters may only be dealt with by laying down legislation at Union level, since they are of a primarily cross-border nature, and that individual action by the member states would fail to achieve the intended results.  A copy of that response can be made available to all Members by the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office if requested.</P>
        <P>The European Council conclusions of 24 and 25 March 2011 created the euro plus pact for stronger economic policy co-ordination for competitiveness and convergence.  That pact, which was endorsed by all eurozone members plus Bulgaria, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, includes commitments on tax policy co-ordination.  As well as stating that the <Col N="240"/>development of a common corporate tax base could be a revenue-neutral way to ensure consistency among national tax systems, it also acknowledged the publication of the proposal for a CCCTB.  Further developments at political level took place in July 2011 when, as part of the overall package of measures agreed by the heads of state of the euro area to ensure its financial stability, we indicated our willingness to participate constructively in the discussions on the CCCTB draft directive and in the structured discussions on tax policy issues within the framework of the euro plus pact.  Then, in August, Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy issued a joint letter to President Van Rompuy making specific reference to the CCCTB, with both leaders seeking a commitment from member states to finalise the negotiation on the Commission&rsquo;s CCCTB proposal before the end of 2012.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s scepticism about the CCCTB is well known.  Our position is that we are opposed to tax harmonisation and, based on what we know about the CCCTB, are highly sceptical of it, but we are nonetheless willing to engage with the European Commission and other member states on the issue.  That engagement will include a detailed examination of all aspects of the proposal, including the issue of subsidiarity.  I look forward to a continued engagement with all Members of this House as that process develops in the coming months and years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, I was aware of the recommendation made to the European Union by the Standing Order 103 Select Committee of the D&aacute;il.  That we lost the vote there does not bode well for the future of the consolidated corporation tax base we currently enjoy.  Frau Merkel and Monsieur Sarkozy are writing common letters because they want this issue to be resolved before 2012.  They want to help their own financial situations to the detriment of Ireland.  It sounds like we are going down the road of a Europe dominated by two countries, France and Germany.  When the Minister meets his Cabinet colleague, he should remind him of the need to build a broad coalition with other countries that have expressed concern about this.  I ask the Minister to respond on this issue.  Does he agree that although we have won the battle on the corporation tax rate itself, the Germans and the French are proposing to get around the issue, in effect, by formalising the consolidated corporation tax base across Europe?  Essentially, Ireland will lose out in such circumstances.  Will the Minister comment on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have made our position quite clear.  It is obvious from the Minister&rsquo;s reply that we are trying to protect our corporate tax base.  It is the main incentive we offer people to set up in Ireland.  We cannot compete with countries like India and countries in eastern Europe in terms of pay.  If we did not have our corporate tax rate, which is our main advantage, we would not be doing as well with foreign direct investment.  We have spelled that out on several occasions as we have reinforced what the previous Government said on the corporate tax rate.  We have made where we stand on the rate quite clear to Europe.  We are engaging in this process because we have decided &mdash; I remember the discussion at Cabinet level &mdash; that it is better to be on the inside than on the outside.  We are engaging and reinforcing our point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have been and are very good Europeans.  It is hoped that the position we are taking in the interests of the survival of the euro means that Europe will not punish us in this respect.  Europe is well aware of our success in attracting American companies, especially Silicon Valley companies, to Ireland as a result of this incentive.  Our engagement in this process does not threaten our tax base in any way.  In fact, it allows us to reinforce our position.  We need to convince people that if we did not have this advantage, we would be in a much worse position at this time.  As we all know, any chance this country has of recovering is through exports.  If large companies do not come to Ireland to produce goods for export, we will be at a major <Col N="241"/>disadvantage.  I appreciate what the Senator is saying.  I am confident in the ability of the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, who have friends in Europe and an understanding of Europe, to protect the tax advantage we enjoy.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh for bringing this matter before the House.  Aramara Teo. is under the full ownership of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and I am not directly responsible for it.  This is a matter for the &uacute;dar&aacute;s.</P>
        <P>I am, certainly, aware of what is happening and I hope the &uacute;dar&aacute;s will find the best possible partner for the company.  I understand there is considerable interest in the company.  The seaweed industry has taken on a major significance.  There is much interest in it, especially from a scientific point of view, with developments in companies in Canada and elsewhere throughout the world.  There is a great opportunity here for a strategic partnership to ensure that the jobs are preserved and continue and that the company has a future.  Seaweed and its derivatives are becoming very popular.  Major scientific interest is developing in them, with considerable success.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter.  I will bring it to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, who is not here this evening.  He is in Donegal.  I will also bring the Senator&rsquo;s concerns to the attention of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter relates to delayed payments to farmers at this time of year.  This issue also arose in previous years.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has issued a charter and established a target of paying all farmers by late September of most years.</P>
        <P>Farmers face a particular difficulty this year because of the increased cost of raw materials, such as fertiliser and feed.  The cost of re-stocking has increased because cattle and sheep prices are high, land prices have risen and even the cost of removing dead animals has increased.  These costs generally accumulate at the back end of the year in September, October and November.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, a large proportion of farmers did not receive their payments this year.  The delays in paying the single farm payment and disadvantaged area payment relate to mapping irregularities within the Department, where maps provided by farmers did not correspond to the aerial photographs taken by the Department.  The disadvantaged area payments were also delayed because of the issue of the stocking densities.</P><Col N="244"/>
        <P>While I accept that cross-checks must be done and compliances met, I believe the system that was in place a number of years ago was fairer.  At that time, the farmer was paid for the actual land within the compliance of the map and if, for example, 5% of the land was not in compliance that percentage of the payment was retained until the matter was resolved.  Delaying a payment for a month or two puts a farmer under huge financial pressure.</P>
        <P>A possible solution might be to pay farmers who have no compliance issue at the end of September and that all other farmers, even where there is a discrepancy in their maps or photographs, would receive at least 75% of the payment owed to them.    This system should be adopted.  I appreciate that the officials in the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department are under pressure, especially at the back-end time of year when payments are due.  However, if that system were adopted it might ease some of the pressure on farmers who are struggling at this time of year.  I understand many of the payments have issued since.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I understand more than 100,000 applications were made and, of these, approximately 78,000 were paid out by the middle of October, but some 23,000 were delayed and this has caused a financial burden on farmers.  We are entering a time of year when farm organisations and farmers will be in talks with the Minister of State.  They were at the Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture today to discuss several important schemes and to outline the importance of farming, the Department&rsquo;s objectives and the Government&rsquo;s objectives under the Food Harvest 2020 Milestones for Success report, as part of which we are trying to increase our exports of dairy and beef product by 42% by 2020 over and above the average from 2007 to 2009.  We all support and fully subscribe to these objectives.  However, these targets cannot be obtained if we do not support agriculture in the forthcoming budget.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There will be unilateral discussions between Departments at Cabinet level and at Minister of State level in terms of which schemes are retained and which are to be considered for reduction.  However, if a stimulus is to be provided to the economy in any shape or form, it must be delivered through agriculture.  Let us consider agriculture and the Irish food industry.  They provide approximately 15% of the total employment in the State which amounts to almost 300,000 jobs.  Irish farmers spend almost &euro;8 billion per year on agriculture inputs and living expenses.  The majority of this is expended locally.  When a farmer gets a cheque in the post, he or she spends it on upgrading his or her yard or on new stock.  He or she reinvests the money in order that the money is being reinvested in the economy.  Figures from a recent UCD report commissioned by the IFA show that every &euro;100 of agricultural output creates and additional &euro;73 for the economy.  Effectively, every &euro;100 spent creates &euro;173 of expenditure in the local economy.  This should be borne in mind although it was not outlined in my question, which was more to do with getting the payments issued.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to outline the level of payments made, when farmers who have not yet received their payments can expect to get them and whether, in the case of farmers who may not have received their payments but who may have small discrepancies, at least some of the payments could be front-loaded.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am here to reply on behalf of the Minister.  On a personal note, I was up in the Senator&rsquo;s beloved Donegal on this day last week and I was shocked at the amount of potatoes that had to be dug.  On my way home I saw a combine machine in a field.  I saw such a situation in 1985 but I thought I would never see it again.  I realise the corn is probably lost but I hope the potatoes will not be lost.  I was there <Col N="245"/>with Deputy McHugh and I recognise the hardships of those involved.  I will take on board everything the Senator had said and I hope to provide an up-to-date position.</P>
        <P>There are no delays in payments to farmers under either the single farm payment, SFP, scheme or the disadvantaged areas scheme, DAS.  In the case of the SFP, the earliest payment date under the governing European Union rules is 1 December, while in respect of DAS there is no regulatory payment date.  However, it is generally recognised and acknowledged in the farmers&rsquo; charter that a payment target of late September in the year in question is the most realistic.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case of the single farm payment it should be remembered that while the earliest payment date provided for under EU rules is 1 December, I am particularly conscious of the significance to the wider rural economy of the single payment.  Earlier this year I successfully sought the approval of the Commissioner to have advance payments made as and from 17 October.  This is the earliest possible legal date for making payments since it is the start of the new EU financial year.  The issuing of these advance payments commenced on target and, to date, payments worth in excess of &euro;537 million have issued to 108,000 farmers.  Payments continue to issue, on a twice-weekly basis.  Furthermore, arrangements are well advanced to allow the balancing payment to start issuing as and from 1 December.  All in all, I am satisfied that expenditure under the 2011 SFP will reach &euro;1.2 billion by 31 December.  This will represent a strong performance by the Department in this area and it compares well with that of other member states.</P>
        <P>With regard to the disadvantaged areas scheme, Senators will be aware that payments commenced on target on 22 September and payments issued to those farmers whose applications had been confirmed as eligible for payment at that time.  I confirm that my Department has continued to pay individuals in the interim as their cases have become clear, with payment runs taking place twice each week.  This is normal practice and will continue on an ongoing basis as necessary.  While I am pleased to note that payments worth in excess of &euro;195 million have issued to date, representing of 89% of applicants, I remain confident that the full budget for the scheme will be exhausted by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>Suggestions have been made that the necessity to re-digitise farmers&rsquo; maps is leading to unnecessary and inordinate delays, resulting in payments being made later than would otherwise be the case.  While I assure the House and the wider farming community that I am committed to allocating such resources as are necessary to ensure the essential digitisation of applicants&rsquo; maps onto the Department&rsquo;s land parcel identification system, LPIS, I emphasise that any failings or shortcomings in the LPIS would leave the Department open to the risk of significant fines or disallowances from the European Union.  I am not prepared to take such a risk nor will I compromise the value of direct payments to Irish farmers.  Furthermore, sight should not be lost of the fact that the changes recorded on the LPIS in significant numbers throughout last year and again this year are necessary given the need to have all ineligible areas mapped.  Simply put, the position of any given farm must be reflected accurately on the LPIS.  To this end, therefore, these changes are long since overdue in the majority of cases.</P>
        <P>As ever, the generally excellent working relationship between my Department and the farming community greatly assists in the processing of these schemes.  Where in-house checks reveal anomalies in applicants&rsquo; applications, the necessary correspondence issues immediately.  By replying to all such correspondence as quickly as possible, farmers ensure the rapid resolution of issues, thereby allowing their payments to be made.  However, in the specific case of DAS payments issues arise each year in respect of the required minimum stocking density of applicants&rsquo; holdings and usually this affects in the region of 10,000 farmers.  These are cases in which my Department cannot confirm adherence to this requirement through the established <Col N="246"/>computer-based animal systems and, therefore, the individuals concerned are required to submit the necessary hard-copy evidence.  Obviously, farmers can only do so when they are satisfied that they have met this requirement for the requisite period of three consecutive months.  Therefore, there are DAS applicants who are not yet paid, not having yet satisfied this requirement, who will ultimately be paid.</P>
        <P>I fully appreciate the value and importance of these schemes to Irish farmers and I remain committed to ensuring that the maximum numbers will be paid at the earliest possible date.  Naturally, I am mindful of the over-riding necessity to ensure compliance with the governing EU requirements.  Ireland continues to be among the first of the countries throughout the EU to be in a position to make such payments and we should not lose sight of this fact.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Substantial payments are also taking place under the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS.  Under REPS 4, of the 30,359 participants more than 29,000 have been paid in full in respect of 2010 and are up to date with payments.  Approximately 1,000 cases in which penalties were incurred have yet to receive the 25% second instalment payment in respect of 2010 and these payments will issue in the coming weeks.  Queries in approximately 500 other cases are being resolved on an ongoing basis in consultation with the farmers concerned.  Arrangements are well advanced to issue payments in respect of 2011 and these payments are expected to commence later this month or in early December once all the necessary checks have been completed.  In the event of any queries arising from these checks, my Department will be in direct contact with the person named.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">In the case of AEOS I, a total of 8,773 applicants were admitted in 2010.  The scheme is more complex and difficult to administer than REPS and it took some time to put effective processing systems in place.  Following the completion of the necessary administration checks and withdrawals by approved applicants, the valid number of applications was reduced to 8,445.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To date a total of 4,605 applications have been fully processed.  Some 75% of the 2010 entitlement under AEOS I, amounting to &euro;3,095,086.88, has now issued and I expect payments in respect of the remaining 25% will commence shortly.  All outstanding cases are being processed and applicants have been informed where outstanding queries have arisen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Payment in respect of year two will commence in early December.  About 6,000 participants in the scheme have committed to undertake capital investments as part of their agri-environment options.  The majority of participants recently submitted their capital investment receipts and officials in my Department are processing these claims which are required as evidence of completion of the work before payment can take place.  Where farmers have not yet submitted these claim forms they should do so immediately.</P>
