      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, we discussed the independent review group&rsquo;s ratification of the previous Government&rsquo;s decision to proceed with the new national children&rsquo;s hospital on the Mater Hospital site.  I am pleased that the Cabinet has agreed with the decision of the independent review group and has decided to proceed towards seeking planning permission, with minor alterations to it.  Yesterday, I asked the Leader to ask the Government for a commitment to proceed with the project, one way or the other.  In a statement yesterday, the Minister for Health said the project would be considered as part of the review of the capital programme.</P>
        <P>The previous CEO of the HSE confirmed that &euro;450 million has been ring-fenced for this project under the four year plan, which is agreed.  Therefore, &euro;450 million in capital funding is available.  Yesterday, Senator Bacik said there will also be some private investment.  It is crucially important to give certainty.  No private investment or philanthropic donation will be forthcoming without certainty from Government that the project will proceed.</P>
        <P>The Government has said the capital programme is being reviewed, which is the Government&rsquo;s right, and that decisions will be made in September.  This House will rise at the end of the month and the D&aacute;il will rise a week sooner.  We have not had an opportunity to discuss the national development plan or crucial matters such as the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  I seek assurance from the Minister for Health that the &euro;450 million is ring-fenced in the four year plan, which is part of the troika deal.  This has been confirmed and I ask the Government to confirm that the money is there.  The Government should not use the capital programme review to delay this project.  Government cannot simply review everything.  It must begin to make decisions.</P>
        <P>This is not simply a matter of building the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  The merger of the three existing hospitals, and their management structures, must begin immediately.  If the Government proceeds with the project, which I hope it does, and the hospital is built by 2015, preparatory work on the management of the new hospital must start now.  The Government needs to tell the three existing hospitals that the project is proceeding and that they need to move very quickly towards starting to merge their own functions and to prepare themselves to move into the new children&rsquo;s hospital in 2015.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to confirm that the &euro;450 million is in place and to stop hiding behind the review.  The House needs an opportunity to discuss the Government review of the capital programme in general terms.  It will be too late to raise this matter again in September, when decisions have been made.  It is important that the House has a say in this.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, Senator Norris raised the issue of servicing the children&rsquo;s hospital site by public transport and particularly by metro north, which is another project that has been kicked into review.  We are told a choice must be made between metro north, the DART interconnector and the connection of the Luas lines, which is completely different from what was said in the run-up to the general election.  The capital programme needs to be discussed in the House before decisions are taken.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="245"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the announcement that Jerzy Buzek, the President of the European Parliament, will address the Seanad next Tuesday.  That will be an auspicious occasion. Group leaders will have a chance to ask Mr. Buzek questions and there will be an interaction with him on the floor of the House.  That is an important announcement.</P>
        <P>In the context of what Senator O&rsquo;Brien said, I call for a debate on the redress scheme and, in particular, on the shortfall identified by the Minister for Education and Skills.  He has pointed out that the religious congregations are more than &euro;300 million short of paying their fair share of the enormous cost of the scheme to the victims and survivors of abuse in industrial schools and other institutions.  The scheme has cost &euro;1.36 billion to date but the religious congregations have paid only one quarter of what is due.  There were serious concerns about the indemnity deal done in the dying days of the outgoing Government in 2002 but it is clear now that what has been offered by the religious orders falls far short of what is needed by the State.</P>
        <P>We will debate the funding for the national children&rsquo;s hospital. For example, the religious congregations could clearly offer money or land toward paying their share of the indemnity deal in the context of this hospital.  That has been signalled by the Minister.  A number of congregations made good money from the sale of property some years ago.</P>
        <P>I seek a debate on the revelations that the tabloid newspaper, the <i>News of the World</i>, was in the business of hacking the telephones not only of celebrities but also of the teenage murder victim, Milly Dowler, and the families of the victims of the London bombings in July 2005.  These are appalling and shocking revelations.  I commend reports that Aer Lingus and other companies are pulling advertisements from the newspaper as a result.  I call on those who read or buy the newspaper in Ireland to boycott it in light of these revelations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am boycotting it.</P>

	<P>I have never bought it in my life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It beggars belief that a newspaper could do this.  It is the most disgusting thing I have read in some time.  The <i>News of the World</i> boasts that it is one of Ireland&rsquo;s biggest selling Sunday tabloids.  It has a circulation of more than 130,000 copies and a readership in excess of 500,000 in Ireland.  Those readers should vote with their feet and not buy this newspaper in light of these shocking revelations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to yesterday&rsquo;s debate on the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the apparent need to conclude Committee Stage yesterday.  It is reported in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees, Senator van Turnhout and I, voted with the Opposition in a division on the passing of Committee Stage.  That is one way of interpreting what we did.  However, I discussed this with my colleague and the meaning of what we did was to vote in favour of the significance and crucial importance of the Seanad and its primary role in scrutinising legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators van Turnhout, Barrett and I could not discuss our amendments as well as another Fianna F&aacute;il amendment because Committee Stage was cut short.  I believe in the critical role of the Seanad, especially its role in scrutinising legislation and the additional scrutiny we can provide and, because of this, I prepared carefully for this amendment, which was the first I had tabled in the House, with legal research and opinion to support it and with the intention of raising two additional matters on Committee Stage that could have been the subject of amendments on Report Stage.  Senator Barrett had also prepared carefully.  We have managed to table our amendments on Thursday but without the <Col N="246"/>benefit of an exchange with the Minister.  I understand that we can only speak once on Report Stage under Standing Orders and, therefore, I am taken aback.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate we must have rules and procedures and that it may be necessary to rush legislation at times, I do not understand the reason for the rush with this legislation.  Was it necessary in light of my commitment as a Senator and law maker to carefully scrutinise legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of my contribution will echo what Senator Zappone said.  Today, the Troika is here.  One of the key parts of the agreement of 1 December last is an examination of the costs of doing business in sheltered sectors in Ireland, including legal costs.  That is what we were trying to debate yesterday in our amendments before they were guillotined.  The cost of doing business in Ireland report of last June stated that legal costs have not responded significantly to the recession.  They had increased by 19.9% since 2006 and they are high by international standards.  A key element in the restraint of such costs is the Taxing Master.  The Minister wishes to provide for a non-renewable five-year term for this post.  This will weaken the position of the person who controls costs, which are a serious problem.</P>
        <P>The alternative is to use the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994.  Flynn and Halpin, the authors of a research paper on costs incurred under the Act, say it, curiously, does not define &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; when it comes to deciding what legal fees are excessive.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has underestimated the extent of this problem and he should not undermine the role of the Taxing Master.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader impress again on Ministers the unintended consequences of guillotining legislation?  This is not about the ego of Senators; it is about the damage being done to the country.  Yesterday&rsquo;s debate should not have been curtailed because there were serious issues to raise.  The Minister proposes to lower the retirement age from 70 to 65 while retaining 70 as the retirement age for judges.  All the evidence, including the TILDA report, which the Government commissioned, suggests we are entering an era of later rather than earlier retirement.  The Minister did not know that later retirement is part of the IMF-EU-ECB agreement and he did not address the issue of excessive legal costs.  He proposes to undermine the officer whose job is to deal with these excessive costs, which are a burden on the economy.</P>
        <P>That was a serious mistake to make on the eve of the Troika&rsquo;s visit to check progress on the bailout agreement.  Will the Leader impress on Ministers that they must attend the House to debate and there are huge unintended consequences when they scarper off before the business has been completed, as happened yesterday?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I beg the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s indulgence regarding bondholders.  We have a pyromaniac in the D&aacute;il who stands up every second day and calls on the Government to burn the bondholders, namely, Deputy Pearse Doherty of Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>In September 2008, they were only sold to credit unions <i>in lieu</i> of perpetual bonds as part of a compensation deal by Davy stockbrokers and they were bought back yesterday.  A process was set in train by the former Minister for Finance to tender for those bonds to be bought back with only 20% of their value to be paid.  Of the 109 credit unions that have &euro;54.6 million invested in these bonds, only 59 voted to accept the 20% buy back proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Senator a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 43 credit unions, which had made a total investment of &euro;23.179 million in the bonds, did not accept it.  Under the proposal, they will now receive &euro;1 for every &euro;1,000.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to come to the House in order that he does not proceed with this because every credit union in the country will be brought to its knees?  Perhaps Deputy Doherty should speak to the staff of the credit unions in Ballybofey, Bundoran and Donegal towns because he wants to bring those credit unison to their knees.  Will the Minister for Finance pay 20% of the value of the bonds to the credit unions that voted against the proposal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Leader and the CPP on next week&rsquo;s invitation to the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek.  It is a positive move on the part of the Leader.</P>
        <P>I concur with the remarks of Senators Zappone and Barrett on yesterday&rsquo;s proceedings.  We pushed for a walk-through vote because certain amendments were not taken.  I understand the use of the guillotine but it is early in the session and we could have sat late last night to deal with the matter.</P>
        <P>I draw attention to the Defence (Amendment) Bill which is before the House today.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business on the basis that the Bill is again being rushed through.  I object to the taking of Committee and Report Stages of the Bill tomorrow.  For those who have not studied the Bill, it is an attempt to amend law in existence since 1952 to ensure that a particular military person is appointed a military judge.  That is the prime reason for it.  The same Bill was introduced by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern.  When an objection was made to the change, the Minister dropped the Bill <Col N="248"/>which has constitutional implications.  The Bill is most serious because one must have ten years experience practising as a barrister or solicitor in order to be appointed as a judge in civil or criminal law.  The Bill does away with that requirement as far as the military courts are concerned.  Military courts cannot be considered independently from other courts because there is also the right under the Constitution to have recourse to the High Court and the Supreme Court.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator&rsquo;s question relate to the Defence (Amendment) Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The reason I ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is only ordered for Second Stage today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but I highlight the issue because it might be too late tomorrow as the same thing that happened yesterday could occur today.  I ask the Leader&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not possible to move an amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to give a commitment.  I understand what you are saying, a Chathaoirligh, but tomorrow morning would be too late because the Minister will be prepared.  I seek a commitment from the Leader that Committee and Report Stages will not be taken tomorrow but would be taken next week, which would provide space for the preparation of amendments that I wish in particular to table.</P>
        <P>The Bill has ramifications.  It is like mutton dressed up as lamb.  Its implications go far beyond what is apparent in the Bill and I am deeply concerned about it.  The Bill has a fundamental flaw.  It is designed primarily to suit one particular individual, which is fundamentally wrong.  It also has constitutional ramifications.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Leader would give a commitment today that the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan cannot propose an amendment of that nature to the Order of Business because it is only Second Stage that is ordered for today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Leader can give me a commitment that Committee and Report Stages will not be taken tomorrow, I will withdraw my amendment but if he cannot I will push it to a vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the House to decide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik alluded to the disturbing reports from the UK about the alleged hacking of people&rsquo;s telephones by reporters.  I have no doubt we are probably inviting the wrath of the <i>News of the World</i> on our heads by raising the issue.  It is a powerful media outlet.  If the reports are true, it is appalling that the privacy of bereaved people has been breached in addition to the integrity of police investigations being compromised.  The newspaper has wide circulation in this country.  It boasts that it is the most widely circulated newspaper.  It is of concern that if such low ethical journalistic standards pertain in the UK, as media commentators have suggested, the practice might occur in this country as well.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik rightly called on people to stop buying the newspaper.  In the UK some blue chip companies have withdrawn their advertising from the newspaper.  I wish to go one step further in asking the Leader to liaise with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to ascertain whether the practice has occurred or is occurring in this country.  I understand that before action can be taken a complaint must be made.  However, given the <Col N="249"/>seriousness of the situation, I do not believe we can wait until such a complaint is made.  There are voluntary codes of practice among the media in this country and perhaps the Minister might explore them to see whether the practice is occurring.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with what was said by Senators Bacik and O&rsquo;Donovan.  I congratulate the CPP on the recommendation to invite Mr. Jerzy Buzek to the Seanad next week.  It is an excellent opportunity for the Seanad to engage with a senior politician from the European Parliament but I also welcome the fact that group leaders have an opportunity to ask questions and to engage with him.</P>
        <P>On that note I wish to ask the Leader whether progress has been made in the CPP on the Private Members&rsquo; motion passed in the House three weeks ago.  In light of the commitment in the programme for Government to overhaul the way politics and government works, the House unanimously put in place arrangements to engage directly with well-informed citizens and to invite them to the floor of the Seanad on a case-by-case basis.  The Leader said in a statement that the Seanad must &ldquo;reform or die&rdquo; so I know he is keen.  Could he outline the progress that has been made at the CPP and whether we will have an appropriate leader of civil society in the House?  July is a long month.  For the first time in 823 years, it has five Fridays, five Saturdays and five Sundays.  I look forward to seeing a member of civil society in the House before we rise for the summer.</P>

	<P>Following on from what Senator Tom Sheahan said, there was a postman in Haggardstown one Christmas who got fed up and burned his three sacks of mail.  He thought that would solve his problems and he went to the pub, but it created more problems.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett indicated that the troika &mdash; the three wise men &mdash; are visiting us again.  We must again address the bailout because leadership from Europe is required.  The Government is providing leadership.  We are meeting our targets and we are no longer the whipping boys of Europe.  We are showing how it can be done.  We are in a better negotiating position and what we need now is leadership from Europe based on the Lisbon treaty, not on what certain politician in Europe think.  Those of us in the centre who voted for the Lisbon treaty mark II, including my colleagues across the floor, will feel betrayed if we do not get the leadership required.  I cannot see how money costing 2.9% should cost us 5.9%.  I ask the Leader to inform the Minister for Finance that we all support him in his negotiating position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also very pleased that the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, will address us next week.  However, it seems to me that this is one of those occasions when we have got unnecessarily hamstrung in our own traditions and procedures.  It is quite clear to me that someone of that standing should address a joint sitting of both Houses in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  One only has to look at the Gallery to see how few Members of the D&aacute;il we would be able to accommodate for the presentation.  Mr. Buzek will not address the D&aacute;il, but I understand he will meet the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  When I raised the issue of whether it would be more appropriate for Mr. Buzek to address the Houses jointly, I was told that it was the tradition that such people would come to the Seanad, that previous Presidents of the European Parliament had done so and that normally the only people who addressed the D&aacute;il were Heads of State.  I am not interested in tradition.  I am interested in doing what is appropriate.  Given the challenges facing this country and the delicacy, sensitivity and importance of our European relationships, Mr. Buzek should address Deputies and Senators sitting jointly.  The obvious place for that to happen is in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik referred to the religious orders needing to pay their fair share of the cost of redress.</P><Col N="250"/>
      
        <P>She also noted how some of the congregations had made a good deal of money from the sale of properties in the past.  That latter point may very well be true, but what is regrettable here is the obvious breakdown in communications between the religious orders involved and the State.  There is blame on both sides.  The State is guilty of megaphone diplomacy.  Even references to their &ldquo;fair share&rdquo; suggested that some agreement had been made to a 50-50 division.  One could make all sorts of arguments about whether that is the right or wrong apportionment.  Clearly the religious orders are failing completely in their communications about this issue.  There is a major lack of information.  However, I would like to hear people such as Senator Bacik and others acknowledge that in the past there were also occasions on which properties were sold or given away at considerably below their market value in order to facilitate good things in the community.  That must be part of the accounting also.  I have a personal interest in this as I am a trustee of over 112 secondary schools, some of which trusteeships have come from some of the religious orders in question.  It is quite inappropriate to link in the issue of schools, which are there for the good of the community and supported by their communities, with the issue of the ongoing debate between the State and the religious orders about what is an appropriate contribution for them to make.  The State executed a deal with the religious orders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I also welcome the visit by the President of the European Parliament.

As a former Prime Minister of Poland, he is very well qualified to hold the role of President.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The issue I wish to raise comes under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality, although it is not covered by the Bill currently going through the House.  I refer to newspaper advertisements offering cash for gold.  I understand the Garda has serious concerns because people are turning up and cashing in jewellery without being required to produce any identification.  No records are being kept.  These items are melted down and the gold taken out of the country with no effort to find out where it came from, where it is going to or who is receiving cash for it.  There is no legislation requiring registration for people who are taking in these items or jewellery.  Many garda&iacute; have stated that items stolen in house break-ins have been sold for cash within 24 hours.  I ask that the Minister come to the House and explain to us his proposals to implement a proper registration process, so that the people who are putting up these advertisements are registered, that there is a code of practice to ensure that those bringing in items for sale must produce photo identification and that a clear record is kept of every item bought.  I ask that this be given priority.</P>

	<P>I join with previous speakers in welcoming the announcement that the President of the European Parliament will address this House next week.  Senator Bacik mentioned that group leaders would be able to make statements on the day.  I seek clarification on this.  While Sinn F&eacute;in is not a formal group in this House, on an occasion as auspicious as this, the Sinn F&eacute;in Party should have an opportunity to make an address.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that Senators Sheahan and D&rsquo;Arcy are listening to Deputy Pearse Doherty and the call from my party to burn the bondholders.  The burden on this State of billions of euro which is being borrowed from the IMF and the European Central Bank to pay back <Col N="251"/>bondholders is a noose around the necks of taxpayers.  In one of the exchanges yesterday of which Senator Sheahan spoke, the Minister for Finance admitted that the true cost of the bailout &mdash; the profit that will be made by our so-called friends in Europe &mdash; will be &euro;10 billion over the lifetime of the loans.  The Minister also acknowledged that there would be cuts in expenditure of up to &euro;4 billion next year.  We also had the announcement of the closure of the accident and emergency services in Roscommon.  Money is being taken out of public services and from the pockets of low-paid families and workers, yet we are paying billions of euro in profit to our so-called European partners, who are our friends.  I remind the Fine Gael Party that although it gave a clear pre-election pledge that it would work with its partners in the European People&rsquo;s Party in the European Parliament to secure a renegotiation of the bailout deal, that has not happened.  So much for having friends in high places in Europe.  If that is how our friends treat us, how would our enemies treat us?</P>

How will this session be conducted?  Will it simply be a presentation by the President or will there be an opportunity for Members of the House to engage in a question and answer session with him?  This is important in view of the questions that are emerging here every day and the importance of Europe in the day-to-day running of our lives.</P>

	<P>Thank you for your ruling, a Chathaoirligh.</P>
        <P>In the context of the contribution by Senator Zappone, we on this side of the House welcomed the decision by the Senator, along with the leader of the Independent Group, Senator van Turnhout, to oppose the guillotining of the Bill.  It occurred to me that the combined vote on this side of the House, coupled with the seven members of the Independent Group, would put the Government under severe pressure.  In fact, the chances are that we would win the vote.  While it is welcome that two Members of the seven voted with the Opposition, I put it up to the other five that when this situation arises again they might consider themselves as truly independent and not support the Government on every issue.</P>
        <P>Members on the opposite side claim public expenditure targets have been met.  Despite Exchequer returns at the end of June meeting those targets, one will note when one looks at them in more detail that public expenditure is being reduced while current day-to-day spending is increasing.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local <Col N="253"/>Government to attend the House at the earliest opportunity, and certainly when the spending review has been completed, to indicate which parts of the country will not receive roads funding?  It is inevitable that under the capital programme, funds for improvements to the county and secondary road network, which are in bad state as a result of recent winters, will be hit badly in the budget.  The Minister for Finance reinforced this view when he said it would be a difficult budget for next year.  These cuts will hit rural areas hard, apart from the major projects to which Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien referred.  It would be in the interests of the House and local authorities if the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government indicated here what are his plans to ring-fence expenditure for the improvement works for secondary and local roads.</P>

	<P>I deplore the use of the guillotine when dealing with legislation.  This is not the first time it has been used; it is becoming a regular feature in this Chamber.  I had great hopes of the new Administration but it is now beginning to exhibit all the very traits it so stringently commented upon when in Opposition.</P>
        <P>This morning we learned the Defence (Amendment) Bill proposes to institute a particular person.  This is a disgraceful abuse of legislation and should be exposed.  My friends and colleagues on the other side of the House supported me when I objected to a similar disgraceful move with the immigration and naturalisation Bill.  Can we please have the standards they adhered to then and advertised during the general election?  We on this side of the House will certainly hold Members opposite to these standards, just as we held the previous Government.</P>
        <P>This is our opportunity to save Seanad &Eacute;ireann but some Members continue to behave in this shabby way.  With its overwhelming majority, there are great temptations for the Government which could lead to arrogance.  I would be very sad if my friends on the opposite side of the House started to behave in such a way.  It is an early opportunity for us to serve them a little bit of a warning, therefore.</P>
        <P>There have been a series of good articles in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> detailing enormous property transactions involving religious orders in the redress scheme.  Many of these orders clearly made some use, as they were entitled to, of the property bubble.  However, even the meagre amounts of compensation set down in the Woods deal have not been met by these same orders.  It is most regrettable.  The victims of clerical abuse should be of the primary concern of all involved.  I welcome that Senator Martin McAleese has been appointed chair of the investigation into the Magdalen laundries.  The survivors of a similar institution, the Protestant-run Bethany Home, like the Magdalen survivors, have been excluded from redress.  Will Senator McAleese examine the possibility of including them?</P><Col N="254"/>
        <P>I was astonished to learn Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen is the trustee of 120 schools.  I would be interested if he could give us further information on this.  I have been a trustee for a small number of groups and charities but they never amounted to more than four at a time because of the question of proper guardianship.  I am sure there is an explanation but to be trustee of 120 schools seems a little excessive.</P>

Will the Leader invite the Minister to the House for a debate on how collectively we could contribute to and strengthen the legislation?  I compliment the Road Safety Authority on the great work it has done to reduce road traffic casualties.  However, any life lost on our road is one too many.

When I made it several weeks ago, the Taoiseach later also raised concerns about the way NAMA was selling property.  Given the enormous sums of money involved in the NAMA portfolio and the concerns that I have raised about how it is selling properties back to developers, it is important the Attorney General explains to the House if NAMA is in breach of the sale of State assets as set out in the NAMA legislation.

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The principal purpose of this House is to legislate.  That is what we did last evening when we debated Committee State of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011.  We had a very interesting discussion during the Second Stage debate on the Bill, particularly in the context of bankruptcy.  We were in the middle of the discussion on Committee Stage when the Minister was cut off in mid-sentence.  This occurred because the Leader proposed, and the House agreed, that a guillotine would apply.  In the 18 years that I have been a Member of the House, there have been very few guillotines.  In recent weeks, however, they have suddenly reappeared.  Those who are imposing them are the very individuals who objected on the few occasions when guillotines were applied in the past.</P>
        <P>If our purpose is to legislate, then a guillotine should not have been applied last evening.  I am incensed because some of the amendments tabled by Senators Zappone and Barrett &mdash; who did a great deal of work in respect of them &mdash; were not even reached.  As Senator Zappone outlined earlier, Members will only be allowed to speak once on each amendment on Report Stage.  If there is a danger to the existence of the House in the future, then it has been brought about by the actions of the House itself.  We must be careful to avoid creating further threats in that regard.</P>
        <P>I am a mild-mannered man and I do not become cross very often.  However, I did so last evening.  When we cut short the debate on the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011 it was to take statements on food safety, something to which I was looking forward.  However, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, came before the House and read into the record a document some 23 pages long.  Only three of those pages related to food safety.  The remainder referred to greyhound racing, betting legislation, forestry and everything else.  If the House is going to be treated in that way by a Minister or Minister of State who comes here to debate food safety, then I do not know what will happen.</P>
        <P>I am aware that Senator Reilly had prepared a great deal of material in respect of food safety and I was extremely impressed with what Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe had to say.  Last night we <Col N="256"/>were supposed to discuss food safety but instead the Minister of State read out a 23-page script, only three pages of which dealt with the topic in question.  I raise this matter because I am of the view that there is a danger that the current Administration is going to bring the House into disrepute.</P>
        <P>The final matter to which I wish to refer relates to what is occurring in the Horn of Africa.  We are experiencing difficulties in Ireland at present and we are always referring to how badly off we are.  A massive famine has developed in the Horn of Africa, which comprises Somalia, Kenya and a number of other countries.  Some 12 million people are in dire need.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I request that the Leader make time available, as a matter of urgency, for a debate on what is happening in the Horn of Africa.  It is over 160 years since Ireland endured the Great Famine.  We blamed others for not assisting us at that time and for not taking action.  However, we now know far more about what is happening elsewhere than people did about what was taking place in Ireland in the 1840s.  I urge the Leader to make time available for a debate on the huge famine which is currently affecting the Horn of Africa and which is worse than anything seen there since the 1980s.  The countries in the region are experiencing their worst and driest season since 1951.  Today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Irish Examiner</i> carries an in-depth article on this matter which is well worth reading.  People in this country should read it in order to remind themselves how well off they are compared to others.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Se&aacute;n Lemass once famously stated that all election promises are null and void once an election has been held.  It is more than likely that Mr. Lemass&rsquo;s tongue was firmly in his cheek when he said that.  However, the current Administration appears to believe he was serious because the parties which comprise it are literally abandoning every promise they made during the general election campaign.  In that context, I request that the Leader arrange for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, to come before the House in order that we might engage in a debate on transport.  As the Leader of the Opposition in this House, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, stated, there is complete confusion regarding the capital plans relating to Dublin infrastructural projects such as the interconnection of the Luas, the link-up with the DART or metro north.  No one seems to know what is happening.  In addition, nobody in Government is issuing clear statements on the matter.</P>
        <P>There is a need for a debate on this issue.  The same Minister came before the House recently and we had a fruitful and positive debate with him in respect of tourism.  I do not believe that the tone of the debate I am seeking will be all sweetness and light.  Having said that, I compliment the Minister for announcing yesterday that he intends to replace the current driving licence with a new plastic version that will be the size of a credit card.  That is a good development.  The current driving licence is awkward and individuals cannot be expected to have these documents about their person on all occasions.  Given that one is obliged to present one&rsquo;s licence to a garda on request, the new version will be most welcome.  In addition, it will be useful as a form of acceptable identification.</P>
        <P>When the debate I am seeking takes place, I hope the Minister will make a statement on the regulation of taxi ranks in our major cities.  People will have witnessed some very unedifying behaviour among taxi drivers squabbling as to who is first in line, who is next in line, etc., at a number of locations, particularly at the rank on Dawson St.  People who commute on the train from Kerry or Cork to Dublin will be aware of the ridiculous situation that obtains at Heuston Station.  There is a fine taxi shelter outside the latter but taxi drivers will not pull up to it and instead expect customers to walk perhaps 100 yards, sometimes in pouring rain, in order to get <Col N="257"/>into their vehicles.  There is a need to introduce a system of taxi marshals &mdash; similar to those which obtain the UK and most other countries &mdash; at railway stations, airports and other public buildings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to ensure that the House is granted an opportunity to engage in a degree of debate and, it is to be hoped, parliamentary oversight in respect of the development of the planned national children&rsquo;s hospital.  Everyone in the House and people throughout the country will be aware of the greater than usual level of national scrutiny that has obtained in respect of this specific and much-needed health infrastructure project.  We have been led to believe that there will be a formal announcement to the effect that the hospital development is to proceed on the Mater Hospital site.  This will cause pain to people who had other plans and will mean relief and joy for those who support the Mater plan.</P>
        <P>If the announcement to which I refer is made, it is essential that people should row in behind it and ensure that the hospital is built.  There has been ample opportunity for public debate on this matter.  It has been discussed by two Governments and several commissions.  I must admit that I might have reached a different conclusion regarding what should be the disposition of tertiary paediatric and specialist paediatric services.  However, there is a desperate need for the development to proceed.  It is important to realise that the people who have articulated opposing points of view are generally very well motivated.  These individuals are motivated by their own interpretation of where the development should take place and also, in many cases, not by self-interest but rather by a degree of loyalty to institutions they have helped develop &mdash; in very adverse budgetary and other circumstances &mdash; into centres which have achieved a level of expertise.</P>
        <P>There are a number of facts of which Members should be made aware.  Paediatric services in this country are desperately under-resourced.  Constructing a new building will not fix the problem.  The new building is needed.  There is a joke to the effect that Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, should be called Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, &ldquo;Crumbling&rdquo;.  This is because some of the physical plant it contains is so old.  There is no doubt that new physical plant is needed.</P>
        <P>A few facts must be borne in mind.  In this Republic there are five paediatric general surgeons.  In Northern Ireland, a jurisdiction the population of which is one third the size of our own, there are six such surgeons and in Scotland, the population of which is similar to that of the Republic, there are 22.  Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, has 80 full-time equivalent consultants, whereas Birmingham Children&rsquo;s Hospital has 200 and the children&rsquo;s hospital in Denver, Colorado, has 800.  The total number of staff in Crumlin is approximately 1,600 for a 250-bed complement.  In Birmingham Children&rsquo;s Hospital, a similarly-sized facility, there are twice as many staff &mdash; over 3,000.</P>
        <P>This information is important because it was alleged and suggested by members of the previous&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I am asking the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister our great concern regarding the development of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and also the need for oversight on the part of this House in respect of the plan.  There is a concern that, at a time of great financial stringency, we may well have a commitment to construct a new building at some stage while in the short term there will be ongoing underfunding and under-resourcing in respect of paediatric services.  Senator Cullinane referred to the average wait for a deaf child in the south east for an appointment with an ear, nose and throat, ENT, specialist.  The wait for such an appointment at Crumlin is nearly as long.</P><Col N="258"/>
        <P>The average child going for corrective spinal surgery in this country has 10&deg; extra curvature of his or her spine compared to international standards as a result of the appalling length of the waiting lists.  I spoke with the authorities at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, in the past 24 hours and they indicated their relief regarding the fact that the average waiting time appears to be coming down to 18 months.  Such a waiting time is completely unacceptable.  I would also like everybody to remember &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>In conclusion, I ask everyone to please remember that the total cost of Crumlin hospital is the equivalent of five days of the repayment of the bank bailout.  The total cost of the Crumlin hospital overrun, which led to the hospital having its services curtailed, was four hours of what we are paying for the bank bailout.  These facts must be borne in mind.  I ask the Leader to convey our interest to the Minister in the ongoing developments in paediatric services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the comments made by Senators Zappone, Barrett and O&rsquo;Donovan, all of whom had done considerable work on the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill debated in the House yesterday.  The propensity of the Government to curtail Bills is not limited to this House.  I was astonished to find out, when I complained to some of my colleagues that three or four Bills have been guillotined in this House, that the same thing is happening in the D&aacute;il.  This is dangerous and unacceptable, particularly when the Government has an unprecedented majority of 60 seats in the Lower House.  It is a recipe for disaster.  To the best of my knowledge, Bills were only curtailed twice in this House in the last term.  The second time it happened was in disgraceful circumstances where we were debating a freedom of conscience amendment to a Bill and the Green Party threw a tantrum and put pressure on Fianna F&aacute;il, who unfortunately acquiesced, to bring in a guillotine to close down the Bill.  The purpose behind that was so that the Green Party parliamentary party could have a press conference for the &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo; at the gates of Leinster House.  Those circumstances were appalling.  Unless the Opposition and the Independent nominees of the Taoiseach &mdash; I understand some of them are party members and will stand with their party &mdash; take a strong stand on this and unless the process is changed, we will end up with a terrible situation here.</P>
        <P>As a consequence, I propose an amendment to today&rsquo;s Order of Business.  I propose that we take only Second Stage of the Foreshore (Amendment) Bill 2001 rather than all Stages.  I am aware there is some urgency with the Bill, but unless a compelling reason is put forward by the Leader in response, I intend to press this amendment on the Order of Business.  It is bad practice to allow all Stages of any Bill to be taken on the same day.  In the past, the practice was for Committee and Report Stages to be taken on separate dates so that everybody could reflect on the amendments put forward on Committee Stage.  We need to get back to best practice with our system.</P>
        <P>Is the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the Committee on Members&rsquo; Interests of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to be taken with or without debate?</P>

	<P>In view of the fact it may be taken here without debate, I ask the committee to pay close attention to the fall-out of what happened on the last occasion.

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the proposed amendment to the Order of Business put forward by Senator Walsh.  On the issue of the capital budget for the HSE, will the Leader set time aside for debate on that?  The Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, said on 3 June, when he announced a &euro;20 million expenditure for a new accident and emergency and maternity unit at Wexford General Hospital that the people of Wexford want, demand and will get the highest standard of health care.  We can compare that to the situation where we  spent over &euro;10 million on a new accident and emergency unit for Roscommon just over nine years ago, but that unit will be closed from next Monday.  There seems to be one law for those who support the Labour Party and another for everybody else.  Unfortunately, Senator John Kelly was not elected to the D&aacute;il.  If he had been, I am sure the specific commitments given by the T&aacute;naiste on Roscommon hospital would have been honoured.  The Fine Gael Party is not honouring those commitments.</P>
        <P>I suggest to those coming from Roscommon to Dublin today to protest outside the D&aacute;il that they consider taking a High Court injunction against the Minister and the HSE to ensure that the services will continue after Monday, with a full review of the situation to follow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators O&rsquo;Brien and Crown raised the issue of the new national children&rsquo;s hospital and I take on board the points put forward by Senator Crown in that regard.  The Minister has stated that the Government is committed to the project and will now proceed to planning stage.  The project will proceed as outlined previously.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik, Mullen and Norris raised the redress scheme and the shortfall of &euro;300 million from the religious orders.  The Minister for Education and Skills spoke about that yesterday and I am sure the matter will be debated for some time to come.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik, Gilroy and Conway mentioned the despicable phone hacking carried out by the <i>News of the World.  </i>The data protection officer here has stated that we have adequate laws in this country to deal with any such instances.  I am sure the Minister for Communications will keep his eye on the matter and if there is a need for further legislation, it will be introduced.  What happened in the United Kingdom is despicable.</P>
        <P>Senators Zappone, Barrett and Mullen spoke about yesterday&rsquo;s Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I have endeavoured since becoming Leader to have some certainty with regard to the business of the House and to ensure particular times are laid out in the schedule of business for dealing with specific matters such as Second and Committee Stages of Bills.  I will put my hand up with regard to the Bill taken yesterday.  I thought two hours would be more than sufficient to deal with Committee Stage and when the first 17 or 18 technical amendments were agreed within 40 minutes, I believed the two hours would be more than sufficient.  However, when I returned to the House after attending another meeting, it was just before the guillotine was applied.  If I had been aware when we set out the business yesterday morning that the Bill would require more than two hours, I would have allowed more time for it.  I take the blame for that.  It will not happen again with legislation like that we had yesterday, especially Seanad Bills.  The Minister has undertaken that we will extend and have an open-ended discussion on Report Stage of the Bill.  The Minister will be here for practically the whole evening tomorrow when we will deal with both the Defence (Amendment) Bill and the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  He is prepared to stay here for a considerable time to deal with those matters and deal with the points that Members raise.  I will certainly put my hand up and say that we should have amended the order for the Committee Stage debate.  I was a minute late, and was not in a position to amend the time so that we could continue with the Committee Stage debate.  I will endeavour not to allow it to happen again, especially when Members are interested in discussing the Bills.  I realise that it takes time to prepare amendments that Members table for discussion on legislation.  Senator Barrett raised the question of legal costs and this is a matter that can be raised on Report Stage of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator Sheahan raised the problem with credit unions and bondholders and certainly Senator D&rsquo;Arcy gave a new meaning to burning the bondholder when he informed us of the situation in regard to the postman.  This matter must be addressed and we will endeavour to try to get the Minister for Finance to the House before we finish the session.</P><Col N="261"/>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan raised the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2011.  I understand that he has no problem with the allocation of two hours for the debate on Second Stage, but with the allocation of time for the Committee and Final Stages.  I will see what we can do on that tomorrow.  We will have Committee Stage tomorrow.  The Minister has agreed to stay in the Chamber as long as possible.  We will see if the Report Stage can be ordered for Friday, after the debate on the Health (Amendment) Bill, but I will have to discuss that with the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator MacConghail raised an issue for discussion at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  We met yesterday and we have agreed to have a special meeting next week to discuss the matters which he raised on the leaders of civil society coming to the Seanad and having a petitions committee.  That will be dealt with at next week&rsquo;s meeting of the CPP.</P>
        <P>Senator D&rsquo;Arcy raised the need for leadership and solidarity from our partners in Europe and everybody would agree with those sentiments.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator Mullen, I think it would be very appropriate that the President of the European Parliament would address this House.  It would certainly enhance the status of the Seanad.  What happens in the Lower House is not a matter for me.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke raised the question of cash for gold shops, where gold is exchanged for cash and the lack of identification and records from these establishments.  There have been robberies throughout the length and breadth of the country where gold seems to be the motive for the robberies.  I will certainly endeavour to find out from the Minister for Justice and Equality whether he intends to introduce legislation on these establishments.  I will revert to the Senator on the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames raised No. 2 on the Order Paper, the time that the President of the European Parliament will be in the Seanad.  Senator Mooney raised the question of ring-fencing of roads funding.  The word ring-fencing came into being during the term of the previous Government.  Many people got through those fences.</P>

We sympathise with the families of those who have lost their lives in Galway and those who died on our roads over the weekend.  We compliment the National Roads Authority and if legislation is necessary to increase penalties, that will certainly be brought in because the Government is totally committed to reducing the carnage on the roads and fully support the measures that the National Roads Authority are seeking to introduce.</P>
        <P>The matters raised by Senators Daly and Coghlan were aired previously and I do not wish to comment on them again.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn raised the issue of the debate on food safety.

        <P>The Foreshore (Amendment) Bill 2011 now brought forward will transfer all foreshore functions under the Foreshore Acts 1933 to 2009 to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government with the exception of the following: designated fishery harbour centres; activities which are wholly or primarily for the use, development or support of aquaculture; and activities which are wholly or primarily for the use, development or support of sea-fishing, including the processing and sale of sea-fish and manufacture of products derived from sea-fish.</P>
        <P>The Foreshore Acts 1933 to 2009 require that a lease or licence must be obtained from the relevant Minister prior to undertaking any works and placing any structures or materials in or on, or for the application of, or removal of material from, State-owned foreshore.</P>
        <P>The foreshore consists of the land from the high water mark to the 12 nautical mile limit and is 39,000 sq. km. in size.  In recent years, the size, scale and complexity of projects developed on the foreshore has changed considerably.  At one time foreshore consents covered primarily small piers and jetties.  Many members are from constituencies that are familiar with that.  However, in recent years, applications received concern major State and private sector infrastructure projects, such as municipal waste water treatment plants, large commercial harbour developments, gas pipelines and large-scale offshore wind, wave arid tidal energy projects.</P>
        <P>In order to deal with this increasing scale and complexity, it is vital that the development of these large projects accord with the development plans for the functional areas of the local authorities to which they are contiguous.

	<P>Thank you.  Balancing the impact of a development in one zone on the other zone is a major component of the impact assessment of any such projects.  At a higher level is it also essential to align and integrate the strategic development plans for both zones, whether at sea or on land.</P>
        <P>While it is acknowledged that some elements of the Foreshore Acts, first enacted in 1933 and often amended, require modernisation, it is important to note that, in relation to large projects, the assessment of environmental impact statements and the public participation and consultation elements are fully up to date and in accordance with all environmental directives.  Regulations in respect of the Foreshore Acts have been implemented under the European Communities Acts dealing with the environmental impact assessment directive, the public access to environmental information directive and the public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters directive.  Therefore, the Foreshore Acts are at this time in compliance with the Aarhus Convention.  I have just got a note saying a copy of the speech is <i>en route</i>, so I hope the Senators get it before I finish.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The administration of the foreshore under the Foreshore Acts generally involves two distinct components. First, the licensing of the activity or development on the foreshore is a regulatory role akin to the role of a planning department.  Second, the vast majority of the foreshore is State-owned and managed on behalf of the Minister for Finance.  Therefore, property management is a key role under the Foreshore Acts.  This role of property manager on behalf of the State can in very rare circumstances give rise to competing applications for the same area of State foreshore. The Foreshore Acts have always provided for this situation.  Sections 1 and 2 of the Foreshore Act 1933 stipulate that all decisions must be made solely in the public interest.  For this reason the 2009 Act made specific provision for co-ordination between Departments before any decisions on consents are made.  Both Departments <Col N="265"/>are deeply committed to the establishment of an efficient and effective structure designed to ensure that information on applications is managed in a co-ordinated fashion.</P>
        <P>The cumulative effect of developments, one on another in the coastal zone has been a major challenge for national governments throughout Europe leading the European Commission to issue recommendations in this regard.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In all countries this integration of the foreshore and offshore development process has proven quite difficult.  The Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Act 2009 amended the Foreshore Acts 1933 to 2009 to the effect that foreshore responsibilities were split between the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and what was the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, now the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It provided for a complex division of responsibilities for foreshore licensing between the relevant Ministers based on the nature of the application.  As a result, a significant element of the foreshore licensing function was transferred to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, while others were retained in my Department.  It is accepted that the wording of the Act is difficult for business to clearly understand and follow.  That outcome is not good for people who wish to do business in Ireland and develop our green and other energy sectors.</P>
        <P>The core functions transferred to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in 2009 included all energy-related developments including oil, gas, wind, wave and tidal energy on the foreshore; aggregate and mineral extraction developments on the foreshore; foreshore projects in respect of port companies and Harbours Acts other than development in a fishery harbour centre, including expansion or relocation of such port, harbour or development intended for commercial trade; all other foreshore projects other than those related to aquaculture, designated fishery centres and sea fisheries.  The transfer was effected to provide proper and effective co-ordination and consistency with a land-based planning process.  Provision was made in the 2009 Act for both Ministers to consult in respect of all foreshore applications received.</P>
        <P>This consultative approach has worked reasonably well and took effect on 15 January 2010.  In excess of 60 foreshore consents have been granted by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government since the transfer of foreshore functions in 2010 and a further 96 cases have been progressed through the formal foreshore application process in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Certain sections of the Foreshore Act 1933 concern the overall management of the coastal zone rather than the licensing of developments on the foreshore.  For example, section 6 of the Foreshore Act provides the means to prohibit the removal of beach material and section 11 of the Act provides for the removal of dilapidated structures on beaches.  In order to provide for the coherent management of the coastal zone under one administration, these and other coastal management functions were transferred in full to the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>As an island nation, the status of the sea fishing and aquaculture industry is hugely important from both an economic and social perspective.  In view of this, the future of aquaculture and sea-fishing related projects needs to be secured, given the often isolated locations of the coastal communities which these industries support.  The grant of a foreshore licence for an aquaculture project is currently an outcome of detailed consideration of the aquaculture licence application.  In certain circumstances an environmental impact statement must accompany the aquaculture licence application.  I assure the House that the licensing of aquaculture sites, including foreshore licensing for such sites, remains with my Department.  This is particularly important given <Col N="266"/>my Department&rsquo;s role in food production.  I have an ambitious approach to expanding the aquaculture industry in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I have decided to introduce this short item of legislation for various reasons.  These include the increasing number of applications being made year on year for foreshore consents to each Department; the need to facilitate a streamlined and clearly defined decision making process to ensure the ongoing and sustainable development of foreshore for the benefit of the State and future generations; the ongoing challenge for Government to examine existing procedures and practices with a view to eliminating red tape and unnecessary bureaucracy; the provision, where possible, of clearer and more easily understandable legislation, for those who have to use it; and developing a faster consent system, which we all want to see, in order to maximise the employment potential of the foreshore hopefully in a sustainable and green manner.  This also includes allowing the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to develop a streamlined process that will include linking the planning process to the foreshore process.  At some stage in the not too distant future, I want people who are applying for development on the foreshore and who must also apply for planning permission, to be able to make one application.  It is important that any perceived obstacles to achieving the above are removed and to achieve these objectives I am introducing this legislation before the summer recess to ensure that a clearer legislative framework is in place as soon as possible.  This new Bill will bring greater clarity to the management of foreshore matters which is very much in line with the thrust of the programme for Government.  Hopefully, it will help stimulate the sector and the economy and provide much needed employment in many rural areas of the country.</P>
        <P>I will now deal in greater detail with the sections of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for the transfer of all foreshore functions under the Foreshore Acts 1933 to 2009 from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The exceptions are functions relating to designated fishery harbour centres, functions in respect of activities which are wholly or primarily for the use, development or support of aquaculture, and functions in respect of activities which are wholly or primarily for the use, development or support of sea-fishing, including the processing and sale of sea-fish and manufacture of products derived from sea-fish, which remain with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>Section 2 provides for the amendment of the 1933 Foreshore Act by substituting a new section 1B in place of the existing section 1B, which was inserted by the 2009 Act.  The new section defines the functions to be carried out by the relevant Ministers.  It improves on the last Act.</P>
        <P>Section 3 provides for the preservation of certain continuing contracts and the adaptation of certain references to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in certain documents concerning the transfer of foreshore functions to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Section 4 provides for the saving and amendment of certain statutory instruments made by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on functions to be taken over by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Section 5 provides for the transfer of certain property and liabilities connected with the functions being transferred from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Section 6 deals with the effect of the transfer of foreshore functions of certain acts performed and documents which relate to the matters so transferred.  Section 7 provides for the substitution or addition of the name of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to any pending legal proceedings to enable those proceedings to continue.  Section <Col N="267"/>8 provides for the completion by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, in regard to functions transferred, of matters commenced by or under the authority of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>Section 9 provides that any foreshore function exercised in whole or in part by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government since 15 January 2010, including any consultation and other requirements under the Foreshore Acts 1933 to 2009, is deemed to have been exercised as if that Minister was the appropriate Minister for the purposes of the Acts.  Additionally, anything commenced but not completed may be carried on or completed by that Minister after the enactment of the Bill.  Section 10 provides for the Short Title of the Bill when enacted and a collective citation for the Acts as amended.</P>
        <P>This is short but important amending legislation that will copperfasten the transfer of specific foreshore functions from my Department to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, where the resources and personnel exist to do a good job.  I am introducing it now for the approval of the House in order to bring certainty and the utmost clarity to the administrative foreshore functions of the two Departments and to facilitate the ongoing work of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local  Government in integrating the foreshore consent process for major infrastructure projects with the strategic consent process operated by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as well as the wider planning consent process in the case of non-strategic projects.</P>
        <P>I have referred to merging planning and foreshore processes to simplify the application process for developments involving foreshore development.  A further reason is to assist in the further development of a strategic focus on aquaculture licensing by my Department in the months ahead.  I attach great importance to this as we try to move some of the larger scale aquaculture projects that may emerge in Ireland further offshore.  I also wish to complete this now in advance of the very busy autumn schedule for my Department and the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>I remind speakers that group leaders have eight minutes and all others have six.  Senator Brian &Oacute; D&oacute;mhnaill is the first speaker with eight minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is his first time in the Chamber and we are delighted to see him.  I understand he will return in a number of weeks to talk about fisheries and perhaps agriculture.</P>
        <P>The legislation before the House makes much general sense.  Its purpose is to simplify the administrative procedures associated with the whole process of foreshore licensing.  The 2009 Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Act to which the Minister referred provided for the process of co-operation between the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in regard to the administration of foreshore licences.  That Act, which amended previous legislation, provided for, as the Minister noted, consultation between both Departments and both Ministers.  Would it be right to assume that the co-ordination system established between both Departments at the time did not work as effectively as perhaps it should have?  Is that the reason for the introduction of new legislation now?  Perhaps the consultation between the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Agriculture, Fisheries and Food proved not to be as successful as had been anticipated, resulting in the introduction of this new streamlined legislation to try to fast-track the process.  If that is the reason, it is welcome.</P>
        <P>As I understand it, a foreshore co-ordination unit was established in the Minister&rsquo;s departmental office in Clonakilty, the purpose of which was to manage and co-ordinate the consultation process referred to under the 2009 legislation.  The applications received for foreshore licences were referred to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government <Col N="268"/>and the advice of the Minister&rsquo;s Department was requested when they related to marine or fisheries projects. The new legislation is probably a further step towards improving the entire process associated with foreshore licensing.  Recently I was interested to learn, arising from a parliamentary question in the other House, that currently 24 foreshore applications in respect of aquaculture or fisheries related projects are being processed in the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  Does that figure include all the other foreshore licences?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it does not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister might give us some insight into the level of applications being dealt with in regard to foreshore licences being processed at local government level, applications from councils for sewerage treatment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are approximately 90 under way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>That 90, added to the 24, makes just over 110 applications.  I note that of the 24 in his Department the oldest application dates back to 2004 and is currently being processed.  One dates from 2006, four from 2007, two from 2008, three from 2009, nine from 2010 and four from 2011 &mdash; a total of 24 under the Minister&rsquo;s departmental remit.  Under this legislation they will stay within his remit.  Perhaps he might provide an overview as to how we might speed up the processing of those applications.  If one considers projects that were under way in 2004, 2006, 2007 or 2008, up to eight years ago, finance was available to many of them at the time but now they may run into financial difficulties because of the delay in the processing of the applications.  I agree with the Minister that we must speed up the process but I would like him to express a view on how this will be achieved, in light of the new legislation before the House today.</P>
        <P>Equally, aquaculture is another massive area.  Although this legislation does not deal directly with aquaculture licensing it impinges on it.  As I understand it, within the Minister&rsquo;s Department the application figure for aquaculture licences is approaching 600, of which more than 300 are for first-time licences and approximately 270 are for renewal.  I understand there is a processing difficulty under the European habitats directive in respect of the special areas of conservation, SACs, and under the EU birds directive, the Natura 2000 sites.  I realise the Minister is new to the portfolio and has inherited many applications coming downstream but questions must be asked as to why almost 600 applications are not being processed more efficiently and effectively and within a quicker timeframe.  Perhaps there is a difficulty at EU level but if that is the case I would like to know what steps are being taken to address that anomaly or deal with that difficulty so that the very many applications for aquaculture licences to which the Minister referred can be fast-tracked and dealt with in a much speedier timeframe.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister they are vitally important in terms of employment creation potential.  There are approximately 2,800 people working in the aquaculture sector in this country and we could add many more jobs to that number if these projects were dealt with in a more efficient timeframe.  I know of a number of applications, from various parts of the country, that are still in the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  Unfortunately, the feeling among the applicants&rsquo; organisations is that they are not being dealt with promptly enough.  Perhaps the Minister might deal with that issue.</P>
        <P>Another issue referred to in the Bill is the function in respect of the fishery harbour centres.  Perhaps the Minister might refer to this in his later address.  There is the whole issue of development of fishery harbour centres and the plans his Department has in that regard within the <Col N="269"/>context of a report published a number of years ago, prepared by the Department and presented within it.  Unfortunately, however, as I understand it, very little of the report has been implemented in terms of the development potential within harbour centres.  I know the Minister recently visited one of the prime harbour centres in the country, in Killybegs, but unfortunately I was unable to attend that day due to another commitment.  That harbour centre is crying out for support, particularly from the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  I will support the Minister in every way to try to bring that support to Killybegs.  However, of the development plan initiated for Killybegs a number of years ago, not one aspect has been implemented even though there were very many excellent recommendations.  That leaves cause for concern.</P>
        <P>Regarding this legislation, I look forward to hearing further on points that were raised.  I assure the Minister that if this Bill can bring about improved efficiencies within the system and improved timeframes in dealing with applications, we will have no difficulty in supporting it on this side of the House</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister to the House.  I am delighted to see he has an interest in this area.  We discussed food safety in the Chamber yesterday and the possibility of creating more jobs and this must be our concern for the future.  That is what we should be dealing with in the future.  There is a great possibility for jobs in this area.  We have heard stories over the years about a great number of boats tied up in areas and people not having work.  I am aware the Minister was in Killybegs recently for an event I was unable to attend but I understand he had good news for those people.  That is very positive.</P>
        <P>This Bill follows on from the first Act in 1933, which was amended in 2009.  It transfers the areas for which the Minister has responsibility to the area of the environment, which will be dealt with by the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.</P>
        <P>The aquaculture sector must be examined.  There is huge potential in that sector and it would be important that any applications received in that area are processed as quickly as possible to allow people start producing in the area of aquaculture.</P>
        <P>Job creation is important also.  We learned in recent days that boatloads of fish caught in Irish waters are being exported to France and other countries for processing.  That is unacceptable.  We must process here any fish we catch in our own waters.</P>
        <P>An area that will be transferred to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is the development of wind and wave energy which has huge potential for jobs.  While I would have an interest in wind turbines on land, I am aware that wind and wave energy is vitally important.  At a time when we import &euro;6 billion worth of oil and fossil fuels from abroad, it is important that we begin to develop our own resources.</P>
        <P>We have had problems in the past in terms of our rich reserves of oil and gas.  We must make sure those reserves are harvested here and jobs created in that area because we will have problems into the future in terms of energy resources.  It is vitally important that all of those aspects are examined.  I will conclude to allow my colleagues deal further with the Bill.  I thank the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for attending.  I welcome this legislation for the clarity it provides.  In recent years we have seen that we are at a point now where our seas are being industrialised.  There is no other way of putting it.  It is a resource that has been lapping gently on our shores for hundreds of years yet it is only now that we are beginning to <Col N="270"/>realise the potential of the sea and the shore.  In so doing, I urge that we not race to exploit it because we have seen in recent years the dangers of exploiting certain areas on the land, particularly in regard to development.  We have over-developed many parts of our country and built in places that should not have been built upon, such was the rush and the enthusiasm to make money and to develop.</P>
        <P>While I support Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s views on the need for urgency regarding licences I believe we should be calm about that.  If there is a queue for licences we do not want to issue them to everybody willy-nilly just because we want the jobs.  The jobs must be sustainable.  The shores and the waters are easily damaged and easily polluted and if in our rush to do this we do not do it through joined up thinking, we will lose the very thing we see as holding much potential for the future.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation, particularly because of the interest in the environment and wind and wave energy.  Although there is evidence to suggest, and the ESRI is one of the organisations that has referred to this, that we should examine land wind energy first because it is more efficient and cheaper, it is nevertheless the case that over time we will look to develop wind and wave energy.</P>
        <P>I would have some serious concerns about the way in which some of the leases or licences were granted prior to this legislation being published.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of that.  We now have potentially the biggest wind parks if not in Europe then possibly in the world in Irish waters and it could be argued that some of those licences were handed out without the necessary scrutiny.</P>
        <P>I am delighted that this legislation may bring clarity and greater responsibility and accountability to that entire area because there is no doubt there will be a race to exploit it.  It is the next great thing, and it will not be simply about making Ireland energy efficient, as my colleague, Senator Comiskey, stated.  That is desirable but it will also be about making money.  The two companies that first built wind parks and established turbines have already sold on to other international companies.  We must believe and understand that we are operating in a global world.  If I understand correctly, one of the companies, General Electric, does not have permission to build turbines in waters off the United States yet it has turbines operating here.  That is something about which we must be cautious and any legislation that will bring us protection while also enabling us to move forward, build industries and create much needed jobs is welcome.</P>
        <P>We must also bear in mind that European Union environmental law is very strict.  Suggestions have been made that we are already behind in our response to certain aspects of the environmental impact assessment directives regarding what we have done.  We must bear in mind that whatever we do in the future we should be more aware of EU law because otherwise it will come back to bite us.</P>
        <P>I, too, would like to state the obvious regarding aquaculture and fishing.  These are areas in which we inevitably must create jobs.  That is particularly the case in more remote areas of the country where those jobs are very much needed.  While I welcome the fact that we would wish to grant those licences in a speedy and more efficient manner, and if the Minister can bring that to bear it would be welcome, I would guard against the sustainability of that.  The world&rsquo;s population is increasing.  We need more food, and fisheries will inevitably be more popular and sought to be exploited.  We must not lose the run of ourselves and give it all away or develop it in a way that does not sustain.  We have not been very good at understanding sustainability in the past 20 years.  This is the time when we need to do that.</P><Col N="271"/>
        <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House and for this legislation.  He referred to the utmost clarity.  I trust and believe this legislation is the start of that process of clarity and I am sure there will be more in the years to come.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Bill is being presented as a largely technical item of legislation intended to transfer responsibility from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>
        <P>We in Sinn F&eacute;in are aware of the obvious need for careful management of the seafront and the foreshore in numerous areas.  I appreciate the need for licensing and leasing for the facilitation of marine energy, including tidal power and other forms of power.  We appreciate in particular the need for careful conservation of the natural wildlife and delicate habitats which often exist on seafronts and for strong legislative provisions to provide for that and prevent undue malign interference with those delicate environments and pollution.</P>
        <P>I note the crucial importance of facilitating our marine industries of aquaculture and farming and our fishing fleet.  I welcome the fact that the Leader has arranged for a discussion on fishing which will take place in the coming weeks.  The Minister might return to the House at that time to allow us discuss those important issues.  In my own county of Waterford we have many fishing villages including Passage East, Dunmore, Ring and Helvick and I am aware of the impact the reduction in the fleet has had in those areas.  I look forward to a full discussion with the Minister on these issues.</P>
        <P>I will note some of the concerns I have about the Bill and perhaps the Minister will allay some of them.  I note most items relating to fishing and aquaculture will remain with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food but I must register my concern at the potential for confusion and difficulties.  What is the motivation for bringing forward the Bill in the first place?  I am aware the Government believes it will lead to clarification and I appreciate that clarity is necessary, but there is also a clear value in the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government being aware of seafront and foreshore issues.</P>
        <P>There will be a demarcation between the lines of responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Will these lines of responsibility be based on geography or activity?  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will have responsibility for some locations.  Will the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have responsibility for others?  I would like clarity on what the lines of responsibility will be.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about the potential for buck-passing between the two Departments.  Fishermen are concerned they could be sent from pillar to post and there may be confusion about which Department will deal with their concerns and which Department will have responsibility for their concerns.  It is an issue I was asked to raise by fishermen.  Will the Minister respond to this?</P>
        <P>I apologise for the fact that I had to leave when the Minister made his speech.  However, I have seen a copy of it.  My primary concern is the motivation for the legislation.  While the Government will argue for clarity there is a greater role for the Minister of the Environment, Community and Local Government to play in some of the issues I raised previously.</P>
        <P>Some of the issues I raised are of particular interest to fishermen and I know some of them will be discussed in the fuller debate we will have.  The Bill will divide responsibilities between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and I want to be absolutely certain that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will have responsibility for issues of concern to fishermen.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is extremely important that clarity is provided.  As someone who served on the board of the Port of Cork for ten years and who dealt with a number of issues regarding foreshore licences, we found at times there were delays because of the procedures that were in place.  It is important that applications are dealt with in a speedy fashion.  I am concerned about the lack of a specific timeframe in which to deal with applications.  We need to examine this because if there is no timeframe in which a specific decision must be made a matter can drag on for a long period of time.  A previous speaker referred to this.  The issue of foreshore licences will continue to grow.  Therefore, it is important that proper procedures are in place and the clear definition being introduced in the legislation is welcome.</P>
        <P>One of the problems with aquaculture is the interpretation by Departments of EU regulations, and there is fault on all sides from the EU to local authorities to national government.  I dealt with an issue in Cromane, County Kerry, where the mussel harvesting process was delayed because EU regulations were in place but the necessary preparatory work to allow it to continue was not done.  The process was closed down because it was not compliant with EU regulations even though the EU regulations were in place.  More than &euro;5 million in EU funding had been provided for basic research to be carried out in Cromane and other places but the information was not made available and the work was not done.  I understand some of the funding ended up being returned to Brussels.  We need to ensure we respond to EU regulations on aquaculture and set targets.  I know it is not possible for Departments to respond on the day they receive regulations but clear targets should be established on the timeline for those regulations to be implemented and complied with to ensure there is follow-through at local and national level.</P>
        <P>As someone who sat on the board of the Port of Cork, I remember wondering which Department we were to deal with on certain issues.  The Bill is welcome as it will provide clarity and people will know which Department has responsibility for a particular area.  One will not wait for a reply from one Department to be told one should be dealing with another.  I look forward to working with the Minister on aquaculture development.  It has major job potential and many people are very enthusiastic about getting involved but they need the necessary support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already welcomed the Minister to the House.  I would like to have two hours to debate aquaculture, fish farming and fishing and my five minutes will lapse too quickly.  I wish the Minister well in his new brief and I am delighted to see a Corkman at the helm for a change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To recount an anecdote, in 1986 we were trying to build a new pier in Ahakista.  The Minister&rsquo;s former colleague and my old adversary, the very colourful now retired Deputy P. J. Sheehan, held a meeting on a Sunday morning after ten o&rsquo;clock mass with the Minister&rsquo;s late father who was kind enough to invite me along as a local councillor.  Lo and behold, the pier in Ahakista was eventually built and it was a very important success story.  I use this anecdote to illustrate the point that Dunmanus Bay has a mixture of inshore fishermen fishing prawn, lobster, shrimp and a little mid-water trawling and there is much tension about the development of aquaculture in the bay, more so than in Kenmare Bay.  This follows the point made by Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe on trying to find a balance between the environment and fishing.  I fully support the fishing industry in so far as possible.  At present, there is an application for a large salmon farm in Dunmanus Bay and the inland fishermen from the Mizen and Sheep&rsquo;s Head peninsulas are unanimously opposed to further aquaculture licences in the harbour.  I hope a happy medium can be found and I asked the Minister to examine it at some stage.</P>
        <P>I fully support the concept of the Bill.  Bantry Bay used to be the capital of the mussel industry.  This came about in the aftermath of the Whiddy disaster when there was a huge loss <Col N="273"/>of life.  Between 100 and 200 people, including my brother and brother-in-law, lost their jobs as a result of the collapse of the industry in the area.  I was involved in a mussel harvesting pilot scheme established in Bantry.  We were a little green at the time and the original rafts for harvesting mussels were made of timber.  We did not realise that the rich waters in the area mean mussels grow and are able to be harvested much quicker than in Scandinavia.  Our rafts sank as a result, although progress was made later.</P>
        <P>As I pointed out to Fianna F&aacute;il Party Ministers when I was on the Government side, the aquaculture and mariculture sector is underdeveloped.  One of the reasons has been major delays of up to seven years in issuing aquaculture licences.  This issue needs to be addressed, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill pointed out.</P>
        <P>In some cases, it took three or four years to approve applications for foreshore licences in Bantry, Schull, Baltimore and Kinsale to facilitate the development of sewage treatment plants.  The sewage treatment plant in Bantry was recently opened by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, nine or ten years after I first made efforts to have the project progressed.  Despite funding being allocated in 1999, a delay in issuing a foreshore licence resulted in a six or seven year delay in commencing the project.</P>
        <P>I was interested to learn of the Minister&rsquo;s meeting with representatives of the French fishing industry regarding the possibility of processing in Ireland the substantial amount of fish French vessels take from Irish waters.  While this may not be directly related to the legislation, it is an important issue on which I hope progress can be made.  Leaving politics aside, if the Minister is able to create jobs in Killybegs, Dingle, Castletownbere, Baltimore or Cobh, it will be good for Ireland and the community in question.  I wish him luck in his endeavours.  I am glad to have squeezed in that final agus&iacute;n.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>Some may ask why a Senator from an urban area without a foreshore is speaking on this legislation.  As the Fine Gael Party spokesperson on the environment, I am pleased to speak on an issue with which I am familiar having been brought up near the seashore in Clifden.  When I was a child my father sold everything that moved and grew in the sea to France.  I am familiar with everything that grows offshore and on the seashore and everything that is produced from the sea.</P>
        <P>Given that Ireland has 1,448 km of foreshore, excluding inlets, overall management of our seas and foreshore is extremely important for sustainable economic development and the environment.  The Bill brings clarity to the 2009 legislation which transferred some functions from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This legislation will simplify what was a complex issue and avoid confusion.  This is a welcome development for everyone involved in the maritime industry.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposal to link the planning and foreshore licensing processes.  Something was amiss in this respect as applications for foreshore licences sometimes focused entirely on economic development and overlooked the planning, sustainable development and environmental aspects of such developments.  This is a welcome provision.  When will this linkage be established?  Clarity is one thing but it is important that this provision on planning is enacted.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the core functions that were transferred in 2009 to the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  These included all energy related developments on the foreshore &mdash; oil, gas, wind, wave and tidal energy &mdash; and aggregate and mineral extraction developments.  The use of an energy development process known as fracking is a relatively recent development.  While it is used in the United States and elsewhere, it has not yet been used here and little research is available on it.  Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe noted that <Col N="274"/>offshore licences for wind energy were not granted to some companies in the United States.  While we must be proactive in ensuring we have alternative sources of energy, we must also ensure we have access to all the latest research on extracting processes, whether onshore or offshore, including their environmental impacts.  I ask the Minister to brief the House on research on the process of fracking to extract energy sources.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for coming before the House.  Jobs are needed in our coastal communities.  The economic benefits of aquaculture are not spoken about sufficiently.  We should appreciate the work done on the coastline and its environmental aspects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba bhre&aacute; liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire; gu&iacute;m gach rath air agus &eacute; i mbun a chuid dualgas.</P>
        <P>As the Minister stated, this is the first time he has addressed the House in any capacity.  He is very welcome and I wish him the best with his brief.  The legislation before us is both technical and uncomplicated.  The Minister dealt with the various issues involved in the transfers of functions.  I note, in particular, his remarks about the different roles involved in licensing, property management and the protection of the public interest.  Environmental protection is also a key issue.</P>
        <P>I have a technical question for the Minister.  It is proposed to transfer functions under the Foreshore Acts to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, save certain functions in relation to harbours and aquaculture and the manufacture of products derived from seafish.  Transfers of departmental functions are generally carried out by Government order under powers contained in section 6(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939.  In replying to parliamentary questions on 22 March 2011, the Minister for Health and Children confirmed that in some cases primary legislation would be needed to proceed with the transfer of functions.  The Cabinet handbook sets out the circumstances under which primary legislation is required when functions are being transferred.  Chapter 1.23 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The transfer of statutory powers from one Minister to another is usually effected by a Transfer of Functions Order.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">If any change is to be made in the nature or manner of exercise of the power in question, amendment of the relevant legislation will be required and should be processed in the same way as any legislative proposal.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">It would not be appropriate to transfer a power from one Minister to another if this would result in the same Minister exercising powers that the primary legislation intended to be exercised by different Ministers.  This would require amendment of the primary legislation or some other arrangement which did not infringe on the intent of the existing primary legislation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As an aside, the House will later debate a Bill whose explanatory memorandum refers to the Minister for Justice and Equality consulting the Minister for Defence on a particular matter.  I look forward to hearing how this will work in practice.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to clarify the reason the legislation is necessary in light of the provisions and powers under sections 5 and 6 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939, principally the provisions of section 6(1)(<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>).  Under section 6(1), it &ldquo;shall be lawful for the Government, whenever they so think proper, to do by order all or any&rdquo; of a number of things.  These include, in paragraph (<i>c</i>), &ldquo;to transfer the administration and business of any particular public service or of any branch or part of any such public service from any Department of State to any other Department of State and to make all such transfers of officers and <Col N="275"/>property and do all such other things as shall be incidental to or consequential on such transfer of administration and business&rdquo; and, in paragraph (<i>d</i>), &ldquo;to transfer from any Minister having charge of a Department of State to the Minister having charge of any other Department of State any particular power, duty, or function vested by or under any statute or otherwise in the said first-mentioned Minister&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In this respect, I ask Senators to cast their minds back to the legislation passed in the House last week on the new Department of public expenditure and reform.  The explanatory memorandum to the Bill in question, the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2011, noted that &ldquo;a large number of remaining statutory functions which are appropriate for transfer to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be transferred by way of Transfer of Functions Order, which will be timed to commence immediately following the commencement of this Act&rdquo;.   These functions were by and large of an administrative nature.  The functions set out in this Bill appear to be of a similar nature.  It is not our role under the Constitution to hold the Government to account but it is sometimes our role to ask technical questions and I would be grateful if the Minister would explain why a transfer of function order was not chosen as a more appropriate route in this instance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  This is important legislation.  I served on Waterford Harbour Commissioners and the Port of Waterford Company for almost 20 years so I am fully aware of the difficulties that arose on many occasions with the granting of foreshore licences.</P>
        <P>The Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Act 2009 amended the Foreshore Acts 1933 to 2009.  It provided for a complex division of responsibilities for foreshore licences.  It is accepted that the wording in that Act was difficult for business to understand clearly and to follow.  It was not good for people who wished to do business in Ireland and wished to develop our green and other energy sectors.  That is an accepted fact.</P>
        <P>The word that has been used most in this debate is &ldquo;clarity&rdquo;.  This Bill brings clarity in response to all the questions that have been posed to the Minister.  It outlines the functions of the different Ministers, which is a good thing.  It is good for the legislation itself and for the people who will seek licences, irrespective of whether those licences are from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Clarity is the order of the day and I welcome any legislation that generates greater clarity.  I commend the Minister for bringing such legislation to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will address the questions raised as accurately as possible.  If I miss any, Senators should feel free to interrupt me to seek clarity.</P>
        <P>I will first respond to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, who comes from a constituency that has an enormous interest in fishing.  In fact, the economic survival of many of the communities he represents is dependent on fishing and the development of the port infrastructure that is already in place.  My Department intends to be ambitious in exploiting the opportunities that exist in Killybegs, in particular, in Greencastle in the other Donegal constituency and in all the small coastal ports in Donegal.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Senator&rsquo;s question about developing the six fishery harbour centres that the Department both owns and controls, I look forward to coming to the Seanad on 20 July when we can talk in more detail about what we are doing with those harbours.  The development plan for Killybegs is being developed by stakeholders in Killybegs working with BIM, my Department and Letterkenny Institute of Technology to ensure that we are sweating the assets there to the maximum possible effect in terms of getting stimulus into Killybegs and the wider <Col N="276"/>economy by using the infrastructure in which previous Governments have invested significant amounts of money.  Although this Government might not have huge resources to spend &mdash; it will have some &mdash; it can do a great deal in policy terms to exploit the potential that exists in fishing ports such as Killybegs, Dingle, Castletownbere, Rossaveal and so forth on the east and west coasts.</P>
        <P>Many people ask questions about aquaculture licences.  I will put the problem on the record.  We have not issued an aquaculture licence to anybody for two years.  Many existing aquaculture operators are essentially operating outside of licence.  That situation is unsustainable.  The European Commission brought a case to court, and won, in respect of the way Ireland has approached the issue of licensing aquaculture activity, be it shellfish or fin fish farming.  We are in the process of correcting that position, and we are quite a long way down that road.  As a result, the European Commission is not fining Ireland.  However, at any point in time it could choose to ask the court to impose fines for our approach towards aquaculture in the past, which was not acceptable under EU law.</P>
        <P>We are being required by the European Commission to put a gold plated system in place for aquaculture licensing.  Practically every harbour on the island has been designated a special area of conservation.  There are one or two exceptions, such as Bantry Bay, but the majority of the bays that are appropriate for the expansion of aquaculture are special areas of conservation.  This means that in order to give a licence for existing activity, in some cases, and certainly for expansion for new activity, and there are 520 applications for aquaculture licences, we are required to go through a process that also involves the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which has a heritage element as well, environmental impact statements and environmental impact assessments of the harbours concerned.  That is before we even go through the process of applying for a new activity.</P>
        <P>There is a process to be followed, which is incredibly frustrating, arduous and expensive, in assessing all these bays and harbours before we can even entertain the application for an aquaculture licence.  We are going through that process now.  We are targeting each of the priority harbours and there will be decisions by the end of the year.  Certainly there will be three bays by the end of the year which will have the facility to accommodate aquaculture licences.  However, in the context of all the bays we need to assess, clearly it is not acceptable that we will be doing this for the next four or five years before we deal with all of them.  I am working with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, who is responsible for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, to ensure we are doing everything possible to get decisions and assessments made as quickly as possible and in a way that is consistent with satisfying the Commission in terms of the standards it is imposing on Ireland.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, while we are dealing with this frustration, we are seeing aquaculture industries developing and expanding in other European countries even though, in many ways, we have better natural resources to exploit that potential in a sustainable way.  I take the point made by Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe.  This is not about just pressing ahead to make money and create jobs; it must be done in a way that is sympathetic to our environment and the other demands on our marine environment and harbours.  Ireland has a very precious resource.  We have responsibility for more than 2 million acres of water.  A total of 17% of Europe&rsquo;s seas are Ireland&rsquo;s responsibility so we have to manage that, particularly our foreshore resource, in a careful way but also in a way that exploits potential.</P>
        <P>Last year, we produced 12,000 tonnes of farmed salmon.  This is a hugely valuable commodity.  If we were producing three times that amount, we could sell it without difficulty because there is a demand for it.  Last year, Scotland produced 150,000 tonnes of farmed salmon.  Norway produces over 1 million tonnes of farmed salmon and within the next five years that figure will <Col N="277"/>rise to 2 million tonnes.  I do not recall which Senator made the point about our responsibility to feed the world but, at present, Europe imports 70% of the fish it consumes.  We cannot resolve that problem by increasing our domestic catch of wild fish because stocks will not sustain that.  The only way we can deal with it is by expanding aquaculture, and doing it in a way that is clever and suits Ireland&rsquo;s natural resources.</P>
      
        <P>That is why we are looking, for example, at moving some aquaculture activity a little offshore, maybe into the lee of islands in certain places.  I have asked the Marine Institute to look at appropriate sites where that type of development could be facilitated.  Moving activity offshore would also get it out of bays and avoid the sort of objections we saw, for example, in Dunmanus Bay.</P>
        <P>Much is happening in the aquaculture area.  That is why I am protective of keeping the decision making capacity on aquaculture in my Department.  We are developing a team with significant expertise in aquaculture, aquaculture licensing and the foreshore issues that go with that.  There is extraordinary potential to exploit, in a responsible and sustainable way, the natural resource we have around our coastline for the expansion and development of aquaculture.  We want the kind of synergies between licensing and foreshore that will be involved in doing that to stay in my Department.  I want to push that agenda.  I will talk to Senators further when I come to the House on 20 July.</P>
        <P>This is why we are not simply transferring all foreshore functions to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  That would have been the easiest thing to do, in terms of legal certainty and clearly outlining who has responsibility for what.  I have insisted, for good reason, on keeping the foreshore issues concerned with aquaculture, fish processing, the fishery harbours and the fishing industry, for which I have political responsibility, within my Department.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government supports this course of action.</P>
        <P>I hope this gives Senators a flavour of our frustrations regarding aquaculture licences, renewing existing licences and putting a proper and credible system in place that will avoid EU prosecution and fines and can allow an industry to expand and grow in the not too distant future, as opposed to five or six years time.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I welcome what Senator Michael Comiskey said about the offshore potential for renewables.  It is now very clear that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and not my Department, has responsibility for the foreshore in that area, and rightly so.  Most of the big offshore energy projects that will develop and emerge in Ireland will involve a planning element as well as a foreshore element.  It makes sense for the same team to deal with both.  Senator Colm Burke is right in what he says about the time constraint for the planning process but not for the foreshore process.  This obliges a project that needs planning permission and a foreshore licence to be treated in a totally disjointed manner, from a time point of view.  It is very difficult to finance such a development when one is dealing with two entirely different systems.  We need to create synergies between planning applications and foreshore applications so that we can streamline matters while maintaining a rigorous process that will ensure that the type of development being proposed is appropriate for the environment, the foreshore and the land based activity.  It makes sense for one Department to deal with all areas outside the fishing sector.</P>
        <P>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe is right to advise caution in pressing ahead with the sole focus on job creation and economic stimulus.  Environmental concern should not be lost in the frustration with aquaculture licensing and in the rush to build offshore energy apparatus that can provide, some time in the future, self-sufficient energy generation on this island.</P><Col N="278"/>
        <P>Senator David Cullinane&rsquo;s primary concern seems to be about the motivation behind the legislation.  I think I have answered that question.  We are trying to bring clarity and certainty so that when someone from abroad, or from home, wants to spend money developing a wind or wave energy or offshore aquaculture project and employ people in Ireland, the process of investing in Ireland is easily understood and does not cost an absolute fortune or take years to get through.  We have seen many examples that are driving investment out of the country.  The Bill goes a small way towards addressing that.  It provides clarity that has been absent in the past.</P>
        <P>I have outlined the lines of demarcation.  They are straightforward.  Aquaculture and fisheries and the foreshore that relates to those activities stay with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Everything else goes to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This has nothing to do with geography.  It is about the activity being proposed and the foreshore that applies to it.  This determines which Department deals with which application.</P>
        <P>Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of setting timeframes for foreshore licences.  I take his point and we will look at it.  It is quite a good suggestion but it is not dealt with in this Bill.  We may be able to do what he suggests by ministerial order, without primary legislation.  I will have to check that.</P>
        <P>I can relate to Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s stories from west Cork.  I know the pieces of infrastructure he refers to, and I am glad they have been built.  I have tied up at some of the piers he mentioned.  With regard to Dunmanus Bay, we are going to have to face down the arguments and balance traditional interests in and outside bays and harbours with new developments that may emerge in aquaculture and fish farming.  We must consider both views and I will have to make a judgment call, whether in Dunmanus Bay, Bantry Bay or elsewhere.  The Bill will provide a system that allows everyone to have their say and to put the facts and opinions on the table that can be the basis for a responsible and sustainable decision by me and my Department.  That is what I hope the Bill will add to the process.</P>
        <P>Senator C&aacute;it Keane described herself as an urban Senator who comes originally from Clifden.  Farmers often say to me they are surprised I became Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food because I come from a largely urban constituency.  Many people living in urban Ireland have their roots in coastal or rural communities and understand very well how they work.  I will come back to Senator Keane on the fracking issue rather than go into it in detail now.  Any substantial offshore activity requires an appropriate licensing and supervision process.  Fracking would be no exception.</P>
        <P>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen, rightly, asked for clarity as to why we are doing this the way we are doing it.  There is much transferring of functions in Government at present.  My Department is no exception.  For example, I have taken responsibility for marine leisure because I am trying to bring all marine activities under one roof.  I can do that without primary legislation.  I can transfer functions and the Cabinet can agree to such transfers under existing legislation.  Likewise, Departments are being set up from scratch and others are amalgamating and merging.  Those transfers can happen without new primary legislation.  This is a little different.  Existing legislation defines who is responsible for what, and we cannot disregard that.  Legislation dating back to 2009 specifically defines, or attempts to define, who is responsible for what with regard to foreshore applications.  In order to bring further clarity to the matter primary legislation is required.  Given that we are working from existing legislation rather than simply transferring ministerial responsibility that is not defined in law, primary legislation is required.</P>
        <P>That is the legal advice we have and it makes sense.</P><Col N="279"/>
        <P>In response to Senator Cummins, many people working on the boards of port companies over the past 20 years will understand the frustration surrounding foreshores, which have been a nightmare.  I am interested in trying to fix this not in blaming anybody for that.  We are trying to streamline the decision-making process relating to foreshore licences in order that it will be clear for the people who want to use that system to develop a project, whether that is in the ports of Cork or Waterford, an aquaculture site off the west cost or a wind energy farm on the Arklow Banks.  We want clear guidelines and legislation regarding who is responsible for what in order that we can then put pressure on the appropriate people to get the job done as efficiently as possible.  That is what this short, technical Bill is about.</P>

    <Title>Defence (Amendment) Bill 2011: Second Stage</Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to present this Bill to the Seanad.  It is the first item of legislation to be brought before the Seanad in my defence capacity.  Anyone seeking to join the Defence Forces chooses a very challenging and demanding career but one that is also very fulfilling and rewarding. Each member takes a solemn oath to be faithful to Ireland and loyal to the Constitution, marking them out from every other profession.  In addition, each member undertakes to obey all lawful orders issued by a superior officer and to submit to the unique code of discipline that is an essential ingredient of military life.  The men and women of our Defence Forces have from time to time been asked to undertake dangerous and difficult missions on our behalf, both within the State and while engaged in peace support or humanitarian missions abroad.  I do not need to remind anybody of the high regard in which our military personnel are held at home and overseas.  Indeed, our military personnel are widely admired for the outstanding commitment and professionalism they exhibit.  Ireland is currently contributing some 560 Defence Forces personnel to 11 missions throughout the world.  Also, approximately 150 additional personnel who have been on standby for rapid deployment as our contribution to the Nordic battle group were stood down at the end of June.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces are now planning and preparing for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Austrian-German battle group, which will be on stand-by for the second six months of 2012.  In November 2010, the UN requested Ireland and Finland to contribute a mechanised infantry battalion amounting to 500 personnel to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL.  The Defence Forces deployed an advance group of the 104th Infantry Battalion to southern Lebanon on 30 May 2011 and the main contingent deployed on 23 and 27 June 2011.  The Irish battalion, comprising 437 personnel, is based in sector west of the UNIFIL area of operations, centred on the major towns of Tibnine and Bint Jubyal and the blue line, which separates Lebanon and Israel.  The Irish contingent will be joined by the Finnish armed forces early next year to form a joint Irish-Finnish contingent.</P><Col N="281"/>
        <P>A contribution of 560 personnel to overseas missions is a very significant contribution in the context of the reduced resources available and reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to international peacekeeping and to the ongoing development of the Defence Forces.  Over many years our Defence Forces have continued to evolve through an ongoing process of modernisation, organisational restructuring, enhanced training and with significant investment in new equipment.  The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have spent the last decade progressively improving the quality of services provided to client organisations at home, to the security of the State and enhancing our peacekeeping capacity overseas.  Prior to the current economic difficulties, the modernisation agenda and the associated development strategy outlined in the White Paper on Defence in 2000, delivered significant efficiencies in the defence organisation.  Since 2000, new capabilities have been developed throughout the organisation, even though civil and military staff levels have been reduced significantly.  The Permanent Defence Force has reduced in size from 15,201 members in 1981 to 9,650 members on 31 May 2011, the latest date for which figures are available.</P>
        <P>The ability of the Defence Forces to continue to maintain the high standards demanded of them requires complete clarity with regard to the exercise of command authority, whether at home or abroad.  In order to maintain standards and rise to the challenges of a military environment and all of the associated tasks, it is important to uphold a chain of command that is clear and unambiguous at all times.  This is critical to the maintenance of unit cohesion and operational effectiveness.  The importance of upholding an independent, effective and efficient system of military discipline cannot be underestimated.  Discipline is the essence of a military force.  Commanding officers are  responsible for discipline within their units.  They exercise authority primarily through leadership and by inspiring the confidence, loyalty and trust of all those they command.  This is underpinned  by the legal authority given to commanders in respect of soldiers under their control.</P>
        <P>In that regard, it goes without saying that the Defence Forces must retain the power to enforce discipline through its own unique code of discipline within the military justice system.  This disciplinary code must support operational effectiveness.  It must be efficient and effective and above all else, it must be fair to the individual.  The system of military discipline is provided for under Part V of the Defence Act 1954.  Following the enactment by the Oireachtas of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2007, military disciplinary procedures were brought up to date in order to reflect developments and innovations both in Ireland and internationally and ensure that members of the Defence Forces have an effective and modern disciplinary and judicial system.  The 2007 Act created a system that reflects the civil legal process to the extent possible in a military environment.  The Act radically overhauled the procedures for the investigation, summary disposal or trial by court martial of offences against military law committed by persons subject to military law.  In summary, the 2007 Act provided for the summary disposal of charges against military law; the establishment and jurisdiction of the summary courts martial; the appointment of a courts martial administrator, a Director of Military Prosecutions and a military judge; the constitution of courts martial and membership of a court martial; matters of procedure before courts martial, including the award and execution of punishments and the suspension of sentences; and the establishment of a courts martial rules committee and the making of court martial rules.</P>
        <P>The first case to be tried under the new military justice system was held on 9 September 2008 in Cathal Brugha Barracks, Rathmines, Dublin.  Since then 39 cases have been heard before the military judge.  There are currently 22 cases awaiting dates for court-martial and in total there have been three appeals to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court.  The new military justice centre in McKee Barracks in Dublin was officially opened on 6 July 2009.  This facility <Col N="282"/>boasts a modern courtroom with built in digital audio recording system, waiting area, consultation rooms, and related administrative and office facilities.</P>
        <P>The Bill before the House is technical in nature and seeks to address a number of issues identified subsequent to the enactment of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2007 which need to be addressed to ensure the smooth and continued operation of the military judicial system.  As with any new system there is always a period of bedding down as an organisation adapts to new processes and procedures.</P>
        <P>The first of these issues concerns the provisions in the Act of 2007 relating to the posts of director of military prosecutions and military judge.  These provide that to qualify for appointment to these positions, a person must be an officer of the Permanent Defence Force who is a practising barrister or practising solicitor of not less than ten years standing.  These qualification criteria mean that there are limited qualified personnel in the Permanent Defence Force for these posts.  It is essential that those eligible for these important posts have the necessary experience to discharge the duties of the position.  However, the current criteria result in there being a very limited pool of officers who are eligible at any one time to compete for these posts.  Given the small pool of legal officers this issue is likely to continue into the future.</P>
        <P>In the context of the continued modernisation of the Defence Forces disciplinary and judicial system, in my view it is essential that competition exists for any appointment to either the post of director of military prosecutions or as a military judge.  One of the key elements of the Bill under consideration seeks to ensure that this will be the case.</P>
        <P>The second issue relates to the post of military judge.  Given the scale of the military justice system one military judge is deemed sufficient to undertake the case load that arises.  However, concerns have been raised that if an officer appointed as a military judge had a previous involvement in a case, is ill or absent or otherwise unable to carry out his or her functions, this may give rise to the need for the availability of an alternative judge.  For example, given the small cadre of legal officers there are significant possibilities that the judge might have knowledge of persons who come before him or her.  Such a scenario is not currently provided for under the Defence Acts and this Bill seeks to address the issue.</P>
        <P>The final  issue being addressed in the Bill relates to the fact that there are a number of personnel within the Defence Forces who are either qualified barristers or solicitors and use these qualifications as part of their day to day duties but who do not work within the Defence Forces legal service structures.  Although the Defence Forces are introducing more clarity in regard to job specification for such posts, which will make clear whether being a barrister or solicitor is a requirement for a particular job, the fact remains that some individuals have been undertaking such work over many years and some clarity needs to be brought as to whether this service meets the service requirements for appointment to the post of director of military prosecutions or as a military judge.</P>
        <P>To address the aforementioned issues, the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2011 provides for amendment to the Defence Acts 1954-2007 to expand the potential candidature for appointment to the posts of military judge and the director of military prosecutions to persons other than members of the Defence Forces and for an amendment to the powers of the section committee to determine a candidate&rsquo;s qualification for appointment to these posts.  In regard to the alternative judge, it also provides for the appointment of a Circuit Court judge to perform the functions of the military judge where the military judge is not available for whatever reason.</P>
        <P>I move to the specific provisions of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 1 outlines the definitions for the purposes of the Bill.</P><Col N="283"/>
        <P>Sections 3 and 4 provide that the committee established under section 184(D) of the Defence Act 1954 for the purposes of identifying candidates and informing the Minister of their suitability for appointment to the post of director of military prosecutions, may determine a candidate&rsquo;s qualification for the post.  In addition, the existing legislative provisions mean that there is an extremely limited candidature from within which the post of director of military prosecutions can be filled.  In this context sections 3 and 4 also provide for an expansion of the potential candidature for appointment to the posts of the director of military prosecutions to persons other than officers of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>

	<P>I hate to interrupt the Minister but am disappointed that the Members present do not have a copy of the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  This is the second time this issue has been raised.  We would like a copy of the Minister&rsquo;s speech to be circulated, either simultaneously with delivery or afterwards.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, it would be good if word went back to officials.  I realise people are very busy but this is happening with increased regularity.  As the Minister can imagine, we are in a much better position to scrutinise legislation if we have a chance to follow his speech, although he is, of course, very clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the difficulty is due to the fact that there are many new officials in the Houses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is understood.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>They are coming to terms with the exigencies of what is required.  I apologise that the script is being delivered later than anticipated.  I shall continue on sections 5 and 6 of the Bill, found in the latter part of the script.</P>
        <P>Sections 5 and 6 provide that the committee established under section 184(K) of the Defence Act 1954 for the purposes of identifying candidates and informing the Government of the suitability of those candidates for appointment to judicial office, may determine a candidate&rsquo;s qualification for the post of military judge.  As with the post of director of military prosecutions, the existing legislative provisions mean there is an extremely limited candidature from within which a person can be appointed as a military judge.  In this regard sections 5 and 6 also provide an expansion of the potential candidature for appointment as a military judge to persons other than officers of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
        <P>Section 7 provides that the Minister for Defence, having consulted the Minster for Justice and Equality, may request the President of the Circuit Court to temporarily designate a Circuit Court judge to perform the functions of a military judge under certain circumstances.  This would include circumstances where: no person has been appointed as military judge; a military judge appointed under the principal Act is ill, absent or otherwise unable to carry out his or her functions; and where a military judge cannot properly deal with a matter before him or her.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current position is that if the military judge is absent for whatever reason the military justice system simply cannot function.  This is a serious lacuna in the current law.  It is<Col N="284"/>essential that the system is capable of functioning at all times and, by providing for circumstances where a temporarily designated Circuit Court judge can perform the functions of a military judge, I seek to ensure that this will be the case, the problem having been properly addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sections 2, 8, 9 and 10 provide for amendments to section 2 of the Defence Act 1954, the Courts of Justice Act 1947, section 240 of the Defence Act 1954 and section 240(B) of the Defence Act 1954, respectively, consequent to the provisions of section 7.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 11 provides for the Short Title, collective citation, construction and commencement of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I also advise the House that on Committee Stage I intend to introduce amendments to the Courts-Martial Appeals Act 1983 to provide that a Circuit Court judge temporarily designated to perform the functions of a military judge under section 8 of the Bill may perform the functions designated to a military judge under the Courts-Martial Appeals Act 1983.</P>
        <P>I am very pleased to submit this legislation for the consideration of the House.  I firmly believe the changes to the Defence Acts 1954-2007 are both necessary and desirable in order to ensure that the military law justice system operates in a smooth, efficient and expeditious manner and continues to contribute significantly to the maintenance of discipline within the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing the views and contributions of Senators in their deliberations and reflections on the Bill and I commend the Bill to the House</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  As I outlined on the Order of Business I have some reservations with regard to the thrust of the Bill.  I am concerned that the Bill has been dressed up, so to speak, in an effort to get over a certain difficulty in which the Department finds itself.  I understand that in July 2010 the selection committee created under the Defence Act recommended a certain officer to be a military judge.  That officer was not appointed and there now appears to have been substantial legal doubts raised regarding this eligibility pursuant to section 184(J)(2) of the Defence Act that the individual was not, for the purposes of the Act, a practising barrister of not less than ten years standing.</P>
        <P>I listened to the Minister carefully set out his reasons, namely, that there are limited numbers of people available to practise as judges but I would point out that to the best of my knowledge, first, under the existing Act the President may appoint, on the advice of the Government, one or more qualified officers of the Permanent Defence Force to be a military judge or, second, an officer who is a practising barrister or a practising solicitor of not less than ten years standing shall be qualified for appointment as a military judge.  Those provisions are already in the existing legislation.</P>
        <P>It is a dangerous precedent that the Minister would use this legislation to allow for a particular individual&rsquo;s circumstances or, alternatively, broaden the scope of the position to allow people who have not the necessary experience, which is the normal remit, be appointed.  I understand that where somebody is appointed to a District Court or a Circuit Court he or she must have served a period of ten years service as a solicitor or barrister.</P>
        <P>I accept that a limited number of people are eligible for qualification as a military judge but the Minister could amend this legislation because military judges probably do not deal with cases on the same daily basis as District Court or Circuit Court judges in normal civil or criminal law situations.  I understand that if the Minister were to reduce the eligibility criteria to, say, eight years there would be a minimum of five personnel within the military service <Col N="285"/>available for consideration.  By doing that the Minister would still be allowing somebody with five, six or seven years actual practising ability in the courts to be considered.</P>
        <P>Regardless of how well qualified they are for their administrative positions, be it senior people negotiating with insurance companies or whatever, I would have grave reservations about somebody who has no court experience, be it military, civil or criminal, coming in and working as a judge in a given situation.  In that regard I have serious reservations about the Bill.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister and his advisers are well aware of the State (Walshe) <i>v.</i> Murphy, 1981 Law Reports, IR 275, in which the High Court ruled that at the date of his appointment as a temporary justice of the District Court, the first respondent had not been eligible for appointment to that office because he had not practised as a barrister for an aggregate period of ten years and also because he had not been a practising barrister.  That drunk driving case was struck down.  In essence, the judge had to succumb to the decision of the higher court and relinquish his judicial appointment, albeit a temporary one.  I have a serious concern in that regard.</P>
        <P>In his introduction the Minister mentioned the valuable work the Defence Forces have done and continue to do.  That goes without saying.</P>
        <P>I could only support the use of non-military personnel in exceptional circumstances.  To a certain extent this Bill is a copy of what the former Minister, Dermot Ahern, proposed 12 months ago with which I did not agree.  It did not come to light because there were question marks over the person who was suggested as being eligible.  If what transpires as a result of this legislation is that a difficulty with an appointment is got around and we bring in legislation to facilitate one individual or a number of individuals in the armed forces, that will have constitutional import and is an issue I will raise not alone in this House but outside it also.  I propose to table amendments for Committee Stage because this is a matter about which I am greatly concerned.</P>
        <P>I mentioned on the Order of Business earlier that it is proposed to take both Committee and Report Stages of the Bill tomorrow.  I accept that the way the business is ordered is not a matter for the Minister but I am sounding a word of warning that if that happens tomorrow I will object to it both on the Order of Business and subsequently.  If it is possible to take Committee Stage tomorrow and Report Stage as early as possible next week it would give us greater leeway in that regard.</P>
        <P>I had intended raising a number of issues but it is important that this issue be seen for what it is.  I note the Minister is making certain amendments to allow Circuit Court judges, in certain circumstances, take over cases where a conflict of interest arises.  That is fair enough but my contention is that the provision in this new legislation is already covered in a similar fashion in the previous Act.</P>
        <P>Were any representations made by the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality?  Is that appropriate or what weight would such representations have?  Is it appropriate that RACO would have any lobbying influence in terms of who should be appointed as a military judge or indeed any judge?  I would be deeply concerned if it transpires that RACO, through one source or another, lobbied people in this House or the other House on the appointment of a particular individual.  I hope it transpires not to be true.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware of any concerns expressed in the wider military community regarding the conduct of the selection process in 2010?  I understand, although I may be incorrect, that a number of submissions from retired members of the Defence Forces were made expressing grave concern at the manner in which this was handled and that it represented a further disturbing development.  Have such representations been made?  Have they been brought to the <Col N="286"/>Minister&rsquo;s attention?  What will be the response to those?  I will not name anybody but I am talking about very senior personnel who are now retired.  One very prominent individual who has now gone to his eternal reward expressed deep reservations that the mechanism by which this Bill is trying to achieve its purpose failed less than a year ago.  If that mechanism is being used to get around a particular difficulty, and the Bill is being dressed up in a number of other ways, it is seriously flawed and is likely to be challenged on a constitutional basis in another forum.</P>
        <P>There is a provision in the Bill to allow the Minister deal with this matter from among the existing personnel who have legal experience and qualifications.  By reducing the qualification period from ten years to eight or perhaps seven years, he would be including a number of qualified people and could have a system of application and interview.  That would be a far more appropriate mechanism for dealing with the difficulty facing him and his Department than using this legislation to advance the application of a particular individual, which I believe is a retrograde step.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has been with us on many occasions and is probably spending as much time here as in the D&aacute;il.  This is his first time here in his capacity as Minister for Defence, however, and he is, therefore, particularly welcome.</P>
        <P>Unlike my colleague opposite, I like the thrust of the Bill because it opens up matters and provides for the expansion of candidature for the posts of military judge and director of military prosecutions to persons other than members of the Defence Forces.  As the Minister stated, we may not always have military candidates who are properly qualified to fulfil the obligations of these roles.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I like the provision whereby the Minister for Defence can consult the Minister for Justice and Equality &mdash; himself in this instance &mdash; in order to request the President of the Circuit Court to appoint a Circuit Court judge to serve in certain circumstances.  These circumstances include a conflict of interest based on an appointee&rsquo;s previous involvement with aspects of a case to be heard, the illness of the military judge, and the lack of a military judge at a given time.  We should also consider the other reasons outlined by the Minister.  The Minister outlined very well the role and outstanding service to the State of the Defence Forces down through the years.  They have served the State very well and we all accept that.  They comprise fundamental pillars of our democratic society.  As the Minister stated, discipline is an essential part of military life.  For all these reasons, this Bill is timely.</P>
        <P>With regard to the serious points raised by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, I have every confidence that the Minister will deal with them adequately when responding to the debate.  Competition is essential when making appointments to posts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I would not want to see a closed shop or any restrictive practices creeping in.  This would be a considerably retrograde step.</P>
        <P>As the Minister outlined, the Defence Forces have rightly earned the respect and regard of the people over the years.  Around the world, Irish military personnel are widely admired for their outstanding commitment and professionalism.  They are highly trained and well equipped.  Our military personnel have consistently shown the highest standards of courage and discipline in responding to the call of duty.  From time to time, members of the Defence Forces are asked to undertake dangerous and difficult missions, in Ireland or when engaged in peace support or humanitarian missions abroad.  The Minister has outlined several of these.</P><Col N="287"/>
        <P>The ability of the Defence Forces to continue to maintain the high standard demanded of them requires complete clarity with regard to the exercise of command authority, be it at home or abroad.  For challenges and dangerous missions to succeed, the chain of command must be clear and unambiguous at all times.  This is critical to the maintenance of unit cohesion and operational effectiveness.</P>
        <P>Discipline is the essence of a military force.  Commanding officers are responsible for discipline within their units.  They exercise authority primarily through leadership and by inspiring the confidence, loyalty and trust of their subordinates.  Officers and non-commissioned officers receive a world-class military education that emphasises leadership, teamwork and a sense of responsibility for the welfare of the individual soldier.  As a result of the high standard of discipline, offences are rare.  We in these Houses have seen the result of the expert military education provided to the Defences Forces.</P>
        <P>It is important that legislation in the defence area ensures that whatever system of justice applies to the Defence Forces is compatible with all human rights provisions, domestic and international.  In this regard, it is important that the system of military justice be fair to all, including members of the Defence Forces who are charged and those who are charged with the Defence Forces&rsquo; management system of upholding discipline.  In addition, it is vital that all provisions be straightforward, fair and equitable for those involved in the process.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces must have the ultimate power to enforce discipline through their unique code of discipline in the military justice system.  The disciplinary code must support operational effectiveness and be efficient and effective.  Above all, it must be fair to the individual.  The maintenance of discipline is an integral component of an efficient and effective military organisation.  Expertise, experience, qualifications and independence must be recognised in the military justice system.</P>
        <P>This Bill will allow the Defence Forces to continue their strong tradition of integrity and will help to support the maintenance of discipline among their ranks.  A defence force strong on integrity is essential for the continued protection of the State.  It is also of benefit in circumstances where Defence Forces personnel serve with and under the remit of international bodies.</P>
        <P>Military law is a distinct legal system to which members of the Defence Forces are subject.  Most countries have special additional laws and often a legal system applicable to members of the military.  Military law deals with issues such as the procedures for military discipline, what constitutes a lawful command and obligations of service personnel.  It is important that military law be kept in line with civilian law and developments therein.  The openness and expansion referred to by the Minister are compatible with these concepts.  The thrust of the legislation in this regard is correct and I am happy to support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  He is very welcome.  I preface what I have to say to him by reminding him I am not in opposition.  What I am to say over the next few minutes, however, gives me no pleasure at all.  This is a very problematic Bill.</P>
        <P>The singer Meatloaf was famous for a song called &ldquo;Two out of three ain&rsquo;t bad&rdquo;.  Two out of three of the central proposals of this Bill ain&rsquo;t bad and I support them.  I differ from colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il based on the amendments I will table.  It is entirely appropriate to envisage and provide for a widening of the pool of eligible candidates for the posts of military judge and director of military prosecutions by providing that suitably qualified barristers with the required number of years practising as barristers, be they members of the Permanent Defence Force or not, should be eligible for consideration.  The enabling of the President of the Circuit Court to appoint temporary judges is entirely appropriate.</P><Col N="288"/>
        <P>It is in respect of the third aspect of the Bill, however, that a very serious problem arises.  I refer to the provision to empower the selection committee to make an assessment of whether a candidate is suitable for appointment.  It is seriously deficient in terms of transparency in that it is a question of the appointment of a judicial figure.  A back-story to this legislation, on which we have not been briefed today, raises the most serious of questions.  If the Minister has not been told the full back-story to this Bill, he should be very angry.  If Senators have not been told the full back-story, we have the right to be very angry.  It is not our role as Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; to be private investigators.  With the greatest of respect to Senator Coghlan, whom I like, it is not enough to say the Minister will no doubt address these matters satisfactorily.  This is not an Order of Business debate but a debate on important legislation on the way in which the Permanent Defence Force operates.  It is about, among other things, the appointment of judges, one of the most important decisions in which a democratic society can be involved.  The back-story which provides a context to what I am saying is very simple and it is that we do not have a military judge in place at present; that there was an appointment procedure; and that an appointment was made.  What is also part of the back-story is that it was communicated in writing to the highest levels of the Defence Forces by the highest appropriate level that there was a problem with the individual who had been deemed to be appointed and whose appointment was announced on the Defence Forces website.  It was pointed out that the person did not meet the statutory eligibility requirements.</P>
        <P>It is for this reason I have major concerns about the Minister stating in his speech, &ldquo;The final issue being addressed in the Bill relates to the fact that there are a number of personnel within the Defence Forces who are either qualified barristers or solicitors and who use these qualifications as part of their day to day duties&rdquo;.  He spoke about the need to introduce clarity on whether services of this type meet the service requirements for appointment to posts as Director of Military Prosecutions or military judge.  The Minister is speaking about it as though it were a matter in the abstract.  It is a horse of an entirely different colour for us to be required to consider such legislation in the abstract as though it were about ameliorating in advance some problem that might arise in the future, when what is actually the case is that a problem has arisen about whether the person who was appointed met the relevant selection criteria.  This legislation looks suspiciously like an attempt to cure the defect retrospectively.</P>
        <P>With all the talk about widening the pool and ensuring competition, the back-story to the legislation raises the suspicion that the provision is not simply about ensuring competition in the future but is designed to eliminate the competition in the present so as to allow, presumably, the appointment of the individual who, as things stand, does not meet the statutory eligibility requirement for the post of military judge.  The first issue I wish to raise is the sheer inappropriateness of coming before the House and not apprising us in full of the back-story, because it completely changes the context in which we must consider the proposed amendment.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan adverted to the fact that there was considerable lobbying by the representative association of commissioned officers.  I understand &mdash; in fact I know &mdash; that this organisation even obtained a legal opinion on the rights of the person who had been appointed.  The advice of the Attorney General was that the person might have a legitimate expectation to the appointment since the appointment had been announced and the job awarded.  The legal advice from Mr. John Rogers spoke about consideration being given immediately on whether a letter ought to be addressed to the committee and-or Ann Price of the Defence Forces personnel policy branch indicating plainly that the person in question contends the committee ought not to engage in any further deliberation as it appears to intend, but should rather desist from in any respect seeking to disturb the selection by the committee and the recommendation by the Government to the President.</P><Col N="289"/>
        <P>What is going on here with regard to the appointment of a military judge?  We are being told there is lobbying and pressure in the background and we are not hearing about it.  The Minister may not be to blame for the fact that a representative association might lobby on behalf of one of its members but how appropriate is it in the context of an appointment of a judicial figure?  I am also informed the Secretary General of the Department submitted a reference for the candidate.  How appropriate is this in the context of a judicial appointment?</P>
        <P>I hope Senator Coghlan is right and that the Minister will address these concerns adequately.  I reiterate the point that either the Minister has very good reason to be annoyed with his officials or the Defence Forces, or we have very good reason to be annoyed with him.  It is not acceptable to bring legislation such as this before the House when there is such a significant back-story which provides such a stirring context to what we must consider.</P>
        <P>I have asked a question and I will also ask whether this is a ready-up to facilitate the appointment of a particular individual.  I will now examine what is proposed to allow the curing of the defect.  Essentially, the position is that to be appointed to either of these roles a person must be a serving member of the Defence Forces and must have ten years experience as a practising barrister or solicitor.  I know the Minister will appreciate the appropriateness of keeping the solicitor in the frame at all times.  There is provision in existing legislation which allows for the consideration of a person who might not have experience as a practising barrister or solicitor but who has been ten years in a role for which it was a requirement that they be a barrister or solicitor, and this is entirely appropriate.  What is proposed is that the selection committee might consider the qualifications of somebody who is a barrister or solicitor but who has not practised in a role for which it was a requirement that they be a barrister or solicitor and deem that their role and duties somehow put them on the same level as the category I mentioned earlier, namely, the person who is in a position for which it was a requirement and that they might therefore satisfy the requirements of the appointments board.</P>
        <P>This raises a major issue of transparency.  It raises a questionable legal criterion for the office.  It is not transparent.  Is an accused person to be subject to someone with a degree of competence that has not been transparently assessed?  The legislation will still provide the requirement of ten years as a practising barrister or solicitor but it will allow the proposed selection committee to drive a coach and four through it.  Who will be on the selection committee?  In the case of the military judge, two out of three members will have been appointed by the Minister, namely, the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Judge Advocate General.  Major issues of transparency arise given that the Bill deals with the appointment of judges.</P>
        <P>I contend that it is not enough that we postpone Report Stage.  We need to postpone the legislation until there has been further and proper public consideration of what has been put before us today and until we as Members of the House have a chance to scrutinise it.  It is in everybody&rsquo;s interests that we do not have judicial review actions in the future in which it will be contended that a person is not suitably qualified.  It is certainly in everybody&rsquo;s interests that we should not have legislation coming before the House which, without the House been informed, has as one of its very significant purposes the desire to remedy a defect or problem that has occurred about which the House has not been informed.</P>
        <P>I apologise for going over time and for being so forcefully concerned about this matter but a serious issue has arisen.  This is not an Order of Business debate where one side tries to get one up on the other; it is a serious matter of probity.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesHeffernan"><NameTxt>Senator James Heffernan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join with previous speakers in welcoming the Minister to the House and thank him for his speech.  I would like to take this opportunity to give my continued <Col N="290"/>support and best wishes to all of our peacekeepers abroad.  Many of my friends have served abroad in places such as Chad and the Lebanon and I wish them continued success.</P>
        <P>As the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has outlined the legislation as it stands does not provide for persons who are not members of the Defence Forces to be appointed to the posts of military judge or Director of Military Prosecutions.  Hence the need to enact the Defence (Amendment) Bill which is before the House.  I contend that as is the case for any other job in the State, a person who is suitably qualified should be allowed go forward for consideration for the post.  In many workplaces an employer must go outside some of the criteria laid down to find the best candidate for the job.  This is a long established and widely accepted practice, particularly in the private sector.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes that by expanding the criteria beyond membership of the Defence Forces, the potential pool of talent available to the Department will be greatly increased.  In doing so, the Bill will make it easier for the Minister to make a more informed decision on who is best to do the job of a military judge.  I welcome this measure.</P>
        <P>The Bill gives power to the Minister to request that the President of the Circuit Court may temporarily appoint a Circuit Court judge to perform the functions of the military judge in circumstances where, first, no person has been appointed as a military judge, second, if a military judge is unwell and unable to carry out his work and, third, where a military judge appointed cannot properly deal with any matter before him or her by reason of the fact that he or she has a personal interest in the matter or personal knowledge of the facts or the parties that may prejudice the hearing.  Will the Minister provide an example of when this third scenario could come into play?  I would have taken as given that a person with a personal connection in a particular case would not be allowed to preside over the case.  Have problems arisen in this regard?</P>
        <P>A case which was reported at around this time last year caused me to wonder about this matter.  A trooper serving in a barracks close to me who had been in the service for 13 years arrived at work one hour late on 14 January this year, in the middle of what has become known as the &ldquo;big freeze&rdquo;.  As a result, she was fined and given a severe reprimand, the most serious judgment below a jail sentence or dishonourable discharge.  She was also asked to consider whether her future lay in the Army.  Another individual travelling with the trooper was also late but was not punished.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the back-story discussed by Senator Mullen.  I hope the Bill is not a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.  If it introduces a fairer and more transparent approach in the legislation governing the Defence Forces and the manner in which individuals are appointed to various positions, I will welcome it.</P>

    <Title>Defence (Amendment) Bill 2011: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Very serious allegations have been made by Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and Mullen about the provenance of this legislation.  I will not rehearse the details but in light of these allegations it is within the gift of the Minister and Leader to withdraw the legislation <Col N="291"/>rather than put it to a vote.  The saying, &ldquo;justice must be done and seen to be done&rdquo;, has long been applied to the courts system.  Justice is not being seen to be done in this legislation about which a serious allegation has been made, namely, that it has been drafted to benefit one individual.  It is not appropriate for Seanad &Eacute;ireann to be engaged in this type of legislation.  If we were criminalising one individual, the legislation would be known as a Bill of attainder and would be clearly unconstitutional.  It is also clearly unconstitutional, wrong and inappropriate to produce legislation to benefit one individual.  I do not know whether the Minister is in on this, as it were, or has been subject to lobbying or whether officials in the Department have been the subject of lobbying.  The full story must come out before this legislation goes further.</P>
        <P>The serious allegations that have been made include one that an individual was to be appointed last year to the position of judge and serious statements were made in a letter, which is, I presume, in the possession of the Department, questioning the qualifications of the person in question for the job.  Lo and behold, almost 12 months later, a Bill has been produced which covers the defect in law as regards the appointment of the individual concerned.  If Senators are involved in such a process, it would be unacceptable, inappropriate and a sad day for the Seanad.</P>
        <P>The allegations that have been made include that lobbying was carried out by a representative organisation.  This is highly significant in the context of an appointment because a representative organisation may represent some of those who may come before the military judge.  Legal opinion was given and suggestions have been made that a Fine Gael Party Deputy was in receipt of representations on this issue.  I do not know if such representations were passed on to the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s word is his bond but it has been shown recently to be flawed.  He came before the Seanad and failed to mention a letter he had received from Mr. Justice Smithwick in which the judge made much more serious allegations about the conduct of the Minister and Government than I had made in the House.  The Minister described my contribution on the issue, which was less serious than the allegations made by Mr. Justice Smithwick, as gross and exaggerated.</P>
        <P>I will not rehearse the statements made in the eloquent contributions we have heard, particularly from Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and Mullen.  I ask the Minister to please withdraw the Bill while a serious cloud hangs over it.  It is not appropriate that legislation on which one person is waiting should be passed as a public Bill of the Oireachtas.  If it is to legislate for a private matter, the Bill should be introduced as private legislation.  As Senator O&rsquo;Donovan stated, an alternative is available in this instance.</P>
        <P>There is more than one practising barrister with the experience necessary for the Defence Forces position in question.  I understand five individuals have eight years&rsquo; experience.  Therein lies the solution.</P>
        <P>As a solicitor who has not practised since being first elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 2007, I may not be qualified to apply for a judicial position as I would have a length of service disqualification.  I do not propose that the Minister change the position in this regard to suit me or others as it would be highly inappropriate to do so.  I hope he will address rather than dismiss the serious concerns expressed by Senators.  If he has been misinformed or is under-informed, he has an opportunity to withdraw the legislation and bring it before the House again when it is ready.</P>

        <P>The provision to open up all posts is a welcome development.  The previous speaker indicated that five candidates are eligible for the position in question.  This is a small pool of talent from which to choose for any job.</P>

	<P>I speak in the context of passing legislation for today, tomorrow and thereafter.  I have not been lobbied by anybody, nor am I available to be lobbied.  I am considering the legislation as it stands and it has the potential to ensure that applications for jobs are not the subject of a closed shop among a certain group of personnel but are opened up externally to people who are qualified.  I ask the Minister to consider the approach of all our universities which examine designations of acquired prior learning when considering qualifications.  This includes people who have acquired prior learning on the job, although they may not have the designated qualifications as laid down when a particular job was allocated.  This approach also applied to teachers in the old system where one had a jam system going on to the degree system and the whole evolution of degrees.  It has been provided for entrants into universities where acquired prior learning is maximised, particularly for mature students.  In addition to diplomas and degrees, acquired prior learning in a specific subject a candidate wants to study is given a certain amount of accreditation.  This important aspect should be considered in all legislation involving job applications, not only those pertaining to the judicial system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another positive aspect of the Bill relates to the appointment of a Circuit Court judge to perform functions when a judge is not available.  I am more than surprised that such circumstances had not been catered for previously and until now have been dealt with on an <i>a</i><i>d hoc</i> basis.  This is a positive feature of the legislation as it will be known who will fill the shoes of a judge who, through illness or as a result of a conflict of interest, must step aside.</P>
        <P>I have not been lobbied on this Bill on which I have made up my own mind.  It would not be appropriate to lead people astray by stating that every person who has made up his or her mind on the legislation has been lobbied.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment each and every member of the Defence Forces.  Their professionalism and expertise is recognised by all and the part they play in peacekeeping duties is praised throughout the nations of the world.  Another aspect concerns the ceremonial duties they carry out, which was clearly seen on the recent royal and presidential visits.  These made everyone proud of our Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of any back story or any history in this event.  It is important to say so because the body that nominated me to the Seanad is the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations.  RACO is part of that body and I had no lobbying from any individual or RACO in respect of this Bill.  There is no issue about the lack of transparency in this Bill.  It is a serious matter and one the Minister addressed in his opening remarks.  In his reply, I am sure he will address the concerns of Members.  Some Members will go to the press and make their views known on this matter, as is their prerogative.  I was asked that this Bill not be taken through all Stages in one day and I acceded to that request.  I was asked that Committee Stage and Report Stage not be held on the same day and the Minister agreed to this.  Committee Stage will be taken tomorrow and Report Stage will be taken on Friday.  The Minister has tried to facilitate the House in every way possible in the passing of this Bill.  I look forward to his <Col N="293"/>explanation of the concerns Members raised.  I hope the Members who made those remarks will be in the Chamber to listen to the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>

	<P>I thank those who supported the Bill for the comments they made.  I want to deal with the issues that arose during the course of this debate.  I begin from a basic principle.  I am sorry to note that Senator O&rsquo;Donovan is so interested in this matter he left the Chamber but no doubt he will return at some point.</P>

	<P>This is an area of the law relating to the military tribunal that has been floored for some period of time.  It required addressing for some time since the 2007 Bill was seen as inadequate.  With all due respect to Senators Byrne and O&rsquo;Donovan, it is an issue that my predecessor and his predecessor failed to address.  Both were Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers in a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administration&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>They refused to address this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>As a consequence, there are 22 outstanding cases to be dealt with before a military tribunal.  As Minister, I will not prejudge these cases, nor do I know the outcome of these cases but it is not right that individuals whose case may be before a military tribunal are left in a position of uncertainty.  It is not proper that the system of justice relating to the Defence Forces has been placed in limbo.  It is an atrocious and appalling scandal that the previous Government failed to address this matter.  I want to be clear about not having in place a military tribunal for a considerable period of time and the lack of alternative mechanism.  Senator Heffernan and others made reference to the fact that if the person who is the one and only military judge is unable to deal with a case for any of a broad range of reasons, we do not have a formal legal structure to address it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The legal structure provided for in this legislation formalises a position whereby a Circuit Court judge can be nominated to deal with the matter.  I am curious as to why Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and Byrne are so exercised by this issue.  I will come back to the points made by Senator Mullen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It seems that Senator Byrne and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, having not wanted to play Punch and Judy as their leader said on day one of this D&aacute;il, are simply punch drunk.  Senator Byrne cannot move five paces without gleaning a scandal around every corner.  I appreciate that Senator Byrne may be in some shock as to the electoral result he experienced and I appreciate that people need some time to come to terms with reality.  I wish to make clear to both Senators that this Government is not mired in the moral mess of his previous colleagues.  We tell the truth about these issues.</P>

Let us deal first with the issue of this Bill and then we can deal with the other issue raised in this House yesterday and today.</P>
        <P>I want to make a number of points clear so they are not open to misinterpretation.  RACO has made no representations about the military judge.  I have received no representations.  It is not an issue that has influenced me in any sense of the term in this legislation.  I am not aware of anything landing in the Department, nor have I seen any representations from any member of the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party in respect of any aspect of this legislation.  No representation from any party had any hand or part in my dealings with this legislation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation derives from when I entered the Department of Defence and inquired about what was happening with regard to the military tribunal, why we had paralysis, why cases were not being processed, the extent of the problem and why it had not been addressed.  The legislation derives from nothing else despite the view others may wish to take.  I made inquiries into this matter and I was advised there had been a competition for the appointment of a military judge.  Those engaged in the competition had difficulty in ascertaining whether an individual fell within the qualification for appointment.  Since that time, everything has been in a state of paralysis.  That is where the issue remains and that is why we currently have no military judge, no military tribunal, no cases being processed and a situation that is seriously inimical to the Defence Forces.  It does no good for the reputation of this State and I was determined to address it.  The procedures provided for will require a new competition to determine who should be appointed as a military judge.  There will be a competition and individuals seeking the position will be dealt with independently.  There was a suggestion that the Minister appoints the committee and controls it.  I cannot remember whether it was Senator O&rsquo;Donovan or Senator Byrne but one endorsed the other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was neither of us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mullen told me it was the Chief of Staff and the Advocate General.  The Defence Forces has its own legal structure.  I had no hand or part in telling the Chief of Staff how he should deal with interviews on a committee of that nature, or who should be selected.  I have no hand or part in telling that to the Advocate General.  As Minister for Defence, I have no intention of interfering with the independent deliberations of that committee, and never have had.  I do not know whether there is some history of Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers attempting such interference but I will tell the Deputy one thing for sure &mdash; this Minister will not engage in such interference.  There are individuals who will make a judgment as to who should be appointed, based on the criteria prescribed and having regard to the qualifications of those who come before them.  There is no ready-up.  However, we cannot maintain, for it is not sustainable, a situation where, first, there is apparent confusion as to what falls within the qualification criteria prescribed by the 2007 legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Where was the confusion about the qualification criteria?</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because of vacancies and inadequacies in the 2007 Bill.  Let us be absolutely clear about that &mdash; that is what we are doing.  My view, which I believe is correct, is that we should extend the pool of qualified people from which a choice can be made by the independent group who will make that choice.  I do not believe a choice between only five people, when we do not know whether all of them will apply for the position in any case, is adequate to ensure that a person of appropriate calibre is selected.</P>
        <P>I do not expect the two gentlemen on my right will accept anything I say but hope Senator Mullen will accept my good faith in this.  I appreciate he had concerns and am deliberately addressing them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to provide clearer criteria for eligibility and to widen the pool of individuals from which selection can be made.</P>
        <P>In the context of the contributions made, I reply, effectively, to that of Senator Mullen who dealt with the objective in question.  Perhaps it is a symptom of what has happened in the past in the context of advertising but in the Defence Forces there are individuals engaged in legal work who are qualified barristers or solicitors.  Some were recruited to the Defence Forces on the basis that to get a particular job they had to be a practising barrister or solicitor.  Others were recruited with that qualification and are doing work that a practising barrister or solicitor would engage in but are doing so within the Defence Forces.  By becoming eligible for consideration to appointment they can help to widen the pool of individuals with expertise in areas related to the working of the military courts.</P>

	<P>In the context of the proposal that we reduce the period to seven or eight years, I note that Senator O&rsquo;Donovan got this wrong on the Order of Business.  He suggested that in dealing with practising barristers and solicitors I intended to change the criteria from ten years of practising to seven or eight years. Earlier today, he seemed to have gone off on a rant, criticising me for doing that.  It now turns out that this was his proposal.  He actually stood up this morning and delivered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Minister got me wrong again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;a very articulate critique of his own proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the third time the Minister has got me wrong.  He should apologise.  He is confused.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me return to the substance of what we are dealing with and what is desirable in all of this.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan described the Bill as a dangerous precedent.  At least Senator Mullen had the decency to acknowledge two very important reforms contained in the Bill albeit he expressed reservations about an issue concerning which I hope we will have a friendly disagreement.  I believe extending the criteria is a good idea.</P>
        <P>I do not suggest we extend this to the wider court system but in the context of dealing with the military judge and military tribunal there are far too few people who are currently eligible for appointment and we need to extend the pool.  However, I also draw the attention of Members to the fact that in other countries it is absolutely normal, not simply in military matters but in wider court systems, to appoint as judges learned legal academics in universities, advocates who have never practised as lawyers.  Some very eminent members of the United States Supreme Court have been appointed in this way.  To be a good judge one does not have to be a good advocate.  Some very poor advocates become extraordinarily good judges and there have been some very good advocates who may have disappointed some of us when they were appointed to the bench.  One thing does not follow from the other.</P>
        <P>In this country we have a very narrow pool and focus when it comes to making appointments of practising barristers and solicitors to the Judiciary but there is a broad range of individuals from which selections can be made.  In this instance there is a narrow range of individuals and therefore what we must do is consider other individuals who have practical experience, the qualifications of barrister or solicitor and the legal expertise that makes them eligible for this appointment.  We will have an independent committee that determines this &mdash; it will not be the Minister.  The Minister will not select any appointment as military judge.  Ultimately, this will come from the committee that makes the recommendation.  That is the way the matter works.  When the committee makes the recommendation the Minister may formally make the appointment but I will certainly not go out independently on any kind of solo run as to who should be appointed.  It would be highly inappropriate for me to do so.</P>
        <P>In that context, I point out to Senators that, although small, this is an important piece of legislation.  It deals with areas where there are difficulties and anomalies.  The truth is that for too long the Department of Defence and the requirements of legal changes in that Department dealing with the Defence Forces have been Cinderella issues in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They are always put on the back list of legislation and not given the priority they deserve.  I thank this House for taking this legislation with some speed to facilitate our addressing an important issue.</P><Col N="297"/>
        <P>It was suggested to me that we might deal with this Bill all in one day but I understood absolutely that Senators would not wish to do that and we ordered Second Stage for today.  As Minister, I could not allow a situation to continue until next autumn whereby no military tribunal was functioning and an increasing number of individuals were waiting for their cases to be heard.  That was completely unsustainable.  It was urgent that this legislation become enacted before the August break.  When I was informed that Senators were unhappy that we take Committee and Report Stages on the one day it took me all of three seconds to state I had no difficulty in our taking them on a different day.  As I now understand it, we will take Report Stage on Friday.</P>
        <P>The issue in question is not about trying to pull a fast one on anybody.  The urgency of dealing with this is found in 22 outstanding cases that are in a state of stasis.  That is not acceptable.  It undermines the credibility of the juridical system to which the Defence Forces are attached and from which they expect a degree of performance consonant with the rights of the individuals who find themselves coming before a military tribunal.</P>
        <P>I hope that in that context I have addressed most of the issues Senators have raised, and that I have not omitted an issue.</P>
        <P>I hope also that I have addressed in a straightforward way the various allegations that have arisen from my right hand side but I want to refer to another one.  It is a great pity that in circumstances in which members of Fianna F&aacute;il are flaying around bereft of any issue of substance on which they can get any credibility because of the extent to which they have destroyed the country, they have decided to go after individual members of Government on a personalised basis.

	<P>I am replying to something the Senator raised.  Senator Byrne made a false allegation against me again this afternoon in this debate which mirrors an allegation he made yesterday.  The allegation is that I made some misrepresentation in this House during the debate on the Smithwick tribunal.  That is untrue, and he knows that.  I told this House, as I did the other House, the exact position as it pertained with regard to that tribunal and the exact position with regard to correspondence between myself and Judge Smithwick.  I informed the House that I had received&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>In his contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">He made it in his contribution.  It is of no relevance to this debate.  I informed the House that I had received correspondence from Judge Smithwick.  I informed this <Col N="298"/>House that he had certain concerns and I addressed all of those concerns in my contribution.  The suggestion is that I concealed the information from this House.  I did not because the letter I received from Judge Smithwick on 27 May 2011 was marked to me as being private and confidential, addressee only.  That is clear from the letter.  The reply I sent to him was marked &ldquo;Private and Confidential&rdquo;.  I had a concern that that correspondence be transparent and publicly available.  I was concerned it was not appropriate that the chairman of a tribunal communicate with a Minister for justice on a private and confidential basis.  My reply to him, if the Senator took the time to read it, queried whether we could make the correspondence public and indicated that as he had marked the letter &ldquo;Private and Confidential&rdquo; I assumed at that point not to do so and I raised the issue.</P>
        <P>On 1 June, the day that coincided with debates in this House and the other House, a letter was received in my Department from Judge Smithwick in which he made reference to him having no objection to what was described as &ldquo;our chain of correspondence being put in the public domain&rdquo;.  I replied to that.  The chain of correspondence did not conclude until, I believe, the third week in June and when it concluded within a reasonable time for conclusion it was put in the public domain.  It would have been entirely wrong of me to have published a selective bit of that correspondence.  I hope the Senator, now that he understands that, would have the decency to acknowledge it.</P>
        <P>I want to conclude on the Bill.  This is a short but important Bill.  It addresses a difficulty we have within the juridical system that applies to the Defence Forces.  It is a Bill that I would hope would not be controversial.  I regret that some have decided to create a controversy out of it.  It is a Bill that I hope will have Seanad support.  I am grateful to the Seanad for taking the Bill so rapidly after its publication.  I am grateful to this House for agreeing that we proceed tomorrow to Committee Stage, and I look forward to a more constructive discussion tomorrow from some Members of the House than we have had today.  I thank those who understand fully the Bill, its intent and for expressing their support for it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to the House.  I congratulate her and wish her well in her portfolio.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I sincerely welcome the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to the House.  I appreciate very much the fact that she has taken time to discuss this Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  I also welcome the Registrar General, Kieran Feely, to the House.  I thank my party for giving me time to bring the Bill to the House.  The Bill was passed in Private Members&rsquo; time in the House in 2006 or 2007 but due to difficulties with getting D&aacute;il time, it was not passed there.</P>
        <P>I will provide the House with some background on why I feel the Bill would be of assistance.  The country has approximately 2,100 legal practices.  These are individual solicitor&rsquo;s offices, each with a wills book which is retained by the practice.  The difficulty is that no record of a will having been made exists outside of the practice.  This is becoming a greater difficulty given the increased mobility of people because after having made a will, people move to live in a different town and the same link does not exist between a person and a solicitor with many clients as it did in the past between a person and a family solicitor.  A further complication has arisen since the Bill was first passed by the House as some legal practices have gone out of business.</P><Col N="300"/>
        <P>I have personal experience of constituents coming to me trying to find their wills which is why I suggest this Bill should be passed.  Jack Lemmon once said, &ldquo;death ends life, not a relationship&rdquo;.  The <i>Law Society Gazette</i> has pages and pages of advertisements from people searching for lost wills and hoping their loved ones made a will.  Many people make wills not knowing that sometimes they may not be executed.  We have a responsibility to ensure the citizens&rsquo; wishes are honoured and given the proper legal recognition they deserve.  Anyone, particularly solicitors, who have experience of the <i>Law Society Gazette</i> of June 2001 will know there are numerous advertisements seeking lost wills.  According to the old saying where there is a will, there is a way.  I hope there is a way with this Bill.</P>
        <P>The Bill will provide a clear statutory basis for the registration of wills by extending the civil registration system which will enable a person making a will, or his or her solicitor, to register the details of the custodian of the will, thus reducing the risk of a will remaining unknown or being found belatedly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill amends the Civil Registration Act 2004 and provides a clear statutory basis for the registration of wills by extending the Civil Registration Service.  The register of wills would be kept in the General Register Office in Roscommon, further facilitating decentralisation to Roscommon.  Having the register of deaths, births and marriages in Roscommon has been a tremendous boost to the town and surrounding areas.  It has also provided a great service to members of the public.</P>
        <P>The study found that 75% of people do not have a will, in other words, more than two thirds of adults have not written a will according to new research.  The survey for Irish Life also revealed that more than half of parents do not have the relevant legal documents in place and of the 75% who indicated they had not made a will, more than one third believed they were too young to make one and almost one fifth believed they did not need one.  These figures were reported in a newspaper article published on 24 September 2010.  The Registration of Wills Bill 2011 will give people confidence in the process of making a will.  In 2010, a small proportion of wills made &mdash; 11,625 &mdash; went to probate.</P>
        <P>I will outline some of the main provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 contains the usual provisions for a Short Title, collective citation, definitions and commencement.  Part 2 outlines the organisational structure for the administration of the register of wills.  Part 3 provides for the registration of wills.  Part 4 provides for miscellaneous amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004.</P>
        <P>Section 10 provides for the registration of wills by a registrar of any local registration authority.  Qualified informants may register wills at a convenient office by providing the required particulars of the will and signing the register in the presence of the registrar.  A qualified informant is the testator or his or her instructed solicitor.  The required particulars of the will are set out in the Schedule and include the name and address of the custodian of the will, the testator&rsquo;s signature, name, address, sex, date and place of birth and personal public service number, the informant&rsquo;s signature and name and address, the date of registration and the registrar&rsquo;s signature.  Subsection (3) provides that one or more wills, including codicils, made by the same testator may be registered or re-registered.  This means that if a person decides to change his or her will, he or she can register or at least indicate the location of the new will.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 11 provides that information held in the register of wills shall not be accessible to members of the public and or made available except as provided for under section 12.  This ensures the privacy of will records.  I emphasise that the will would not be held in the General Register Office but either by the testator or a solicitor&rsquo;s office or in another safe location identified in the registration.</P><Col N="301"/>
        <P>Section 12 requires the Registrar General or a member of his or her staff authorised by him or her to search the register of wills and provide a certified copy of an entry in such register at the request of an applicant on payment of the appropriate fee, provided the death of the testator has been registered or the applicant is the testator.  This means that a copy of the registered entry is only available to the testator or someone else on the death of the testator.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The further modernisation of the Civil Registration Service through the introduction of the Registration of Wills Bill 2011 is essential to ensure rights for those who made wills in this life and their beneficiaries.  In 1972, the Council of Europe made recommendations on the establishment of a European registration of wills.  Given current levels of mobility and the development of the European Union, this proposal could be considered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The difficulty I experienced when I had a similar Bill passed in the Seanad was that I was unable to secure time in the D&aacute;il.  In addition, registration and the General Register Office were transferred from the then Department of Health and Children to the then Department of Social and Family Affairs.  This created further delays and difficulties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Contacts with various Ministers and Departments and the outcome of cases before the courts may give rise to a requirement to introduce legislation.  I was aware of an individual &mdash; I do not propose to name him &mdash; who was confident his father had made a will but was unable to locate it on his father&rsquo;s death.  He visited every solicitor's office in his locality without success and felt very aggrieved that the last will of his father had not been made or his wishes had not been honoured because the will had not been found.  This occurs frequently and gives rise to considerable difficulties.  It is important, therefore, that persons who decide to make a will can avail of a central facility to register the will.  Some solicitors offices are highly conscientious in these matters and will make every effort to find out when a person who made a will died.  It is sometimes difficult, however, to locate people because the population has become highly mobile.  Someone from a rural area, for instance, could make a will in Dublin and, on his or her death, contact is not made with the family because the testator&rsquo;s solicitor is not aware that he or she has died.  A further danger is that will books and wills become mislaid in solicitors' practices.  The cost of storage has also become a problem, especially for solicitors in urban areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One cannot introduce a law imposing fines on solicitors who fail to register a will.  A voluntary approach based on persuasion must be adopted at this stage.  In that regard, the proposals in the Bill are interim arrangements.  At a certain point, however, the procedure should be that when a will is made a fee will be paid and the will sent to the General Register Office where it will be held securely and no one, other than the testator or, in the event of his or her death, the family of the testator, will have access to it.  This would allow families, on the production of a death certificate, to check whether a will had been made and access its contents.  This process will be slow but I hope at some point all wills registered in solicitors' offices will be held at a central location.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank my colleagues in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for permitting me to introduce this Bill in Private Members&rsquo; time.  I also thank other parties.  In 2006-07, when my party was in government, my earlier Bill secured cross-party support in the House.  I had hoped it would be introduced and passed in the D&aacute;il to allow its enactment.  Where there is a will, there is a way and I will seek to have the legislation enacted.  I extend my best wishes to the Minister who has a difficult Ministry.  I know she will do her utmost to make a great success of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the Minister has attended the House in person.  She is one of the more imaginative Ministers in the Government and has a great deal on her plate.  The functions of the General Register Office are not among the better known responsibilities of her Department.</P><Col N="302"/>
        <P>Senator Leyden&rsquo;s Bill is excellent legislation which deserves all-party support.  It is a shame that Ministers in the previous Government did not provide time in the D&aacute;il to progress it.  Their failure in this regard showed a distinct lack of imagination on the part of some albeit not all of them.  It is unfortunate that time was not available to discuss it.  When presented with logical, sensible legislation of this nature one has a tendency to ask why no one thought of it previously.  While I accept the Bill may give rise to some costs, the problem could be easily addressed by deciding not to commence the legislation until we can afford to do so or sufficient staff are in place.  Costs should not be cited as a reason for opposing the Bill.</P>
        <P>I speak as someone who worked in general legal practice for a short number of years before being elected to politics.  The drafting of a will is one of the most solemn tasks one can undertake.  It should be noted that anyone may draft a will.  Only last week, I received a call from my office concerning the drafting of a particular will five or six years ago.  The questions of who witnessed, wrote and took instructions on a will are extremely important.</P>
        <P>The Bill addresses the problems of lost, missing and unknown wills, which are more common than one would expect.  Every month, the <i>Law Society Gazette</i> features a long list of names of deceased persons whose relatives are searching for a will.  The legislation proposes to make the process more efficient by registering the execution of a will.  This does not mean a will cannot be changed or added to by way of codicil but simply that it will no longer be necessary for people seeking to trace a will to place advertisements in the <i>Law Society Gazette</i> or write letters to every solicitor in their town or region.  For someone in my position working as a solicitor in Drogheda, in fact, it would have been prudent to write to all solicitors in Dublin because it was a frequent occurrence for people living in the commuter belt area to deal with city centre solicitors on very personal matters that they might not wish to discuss with local solicitors.  That is a huge burden on solicitors and families and it would be solved by the enactment of this Bill.</P>
        <P>The fact that the Minister for Social Protection is present is probably due to the fact that the Bill proposes that this registration process be carried out in the General Register Office, GRO.  That is important although, frankly, I believe it could just as easily be done by the Property Registration Authority or another suitable body.  Senator Leyden has particular connections with the GRO as it is located in County Roscommon.  However, I understand there might be some resistance within the General Register Office.  If it is about resources, that is fair enough.  We know civil servants are under pressure and so forth.  Nevertheless, it should not be about resources but about the principle of the Bill and whether it is a good thing or not.</P>
        <P>I understand the Law Society might have had some concerns about it in the past but I do not know what its current position is.  However, speaking as somebody who is involved in this area I believe it would be excellent that if a deceased person&rsquo;s family comes to one&rsquo;s office and one does not have the will in the office, there would be a simple procedure, which could probably be carried out in the course of a day, to find out if there is a will registered elsewhere.</P>
        <P>It would also be a useful measure to tackle fraud with wills.  There is a certain element of fraud with regard to wills.  If somebody is drawing up a will fraudulently or forcing a person who is not of sound mind to write a will, and there are certainly allegations that this happens from time to time, they would be less likely to register the will.  It would never be mandatory but the fact of registration would, perhaps, give it some extra authenticity, even though the strict legal requirements for authenticating a will are set out.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In summary, I support this Bill as a worthy and necessary legislative measure.  If cost is given as a reason that it cannot proceed, a commencement date can be included so it would not necessarily have to become law immediately.  The Bill will assist more efficient legal practice <Col N="303"/>and will benefit families that are in a really difficult position going to see a solicitor after the death of a loved one.  It will also remove confusion and, indeed, would comply with our obligations under the EU-IMF agreement under which the legal services industry is to be deregulated further, made more accessible to the public and made more competitive.  The Bill would add to the competitiveness of that aspect of legal services, given that it is a huge element of legal practice in rural areas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Leyden for bringing this Bill before the House.  The Senator said that where there is a will, there is a way.  When I was first working as an accountant a venerable solicitor said something I never forgot, that where there is a will there are relatives.  It was written on a notice in the solicitor's office.  I am sure Senator Byrne appreciates that saying, given his professional experience.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge Senator Leyden&rsquo;s hard work and initiative in drafting the Bill referred to in the motion.  On the face of it, the establishment of a system of registration of wills would appear to be a worthy initiative.  As Senator Byrne said, there are some very good ideas in the proposed legislation.  However, it is my duty to bring to the attention of the House certain difficulties with the Bill that preclude me from expressing support for the motion at this point in time.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Bill was drafted against the background of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Convention on the Establishment of a Scheme of Registration of Wills, ETS No. 077, which provides for the establishment of national registration schemes and contains supplementary rules governing the international co-operation between the national authorities entrusted with registration.  Ireland has not ratified the convention.  The Registration of Wills Bill 2005 was introduced by Senator Leyden.  The Bill passed all Stages in Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 2006 but it fell on the dissolution of the Oireachtas in 2007.  The Registration of Wills Bill 2011 is very similar to the 2005 Bill in that it provides for a voluntary system of registration of wills by the General Register Office or GRO.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the time the 2005 Bill was introduced, the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform sought the views of the Law Society of Ireland.  The Law Society expressed reservations about the Bill on a number of grounds, both in terms of the day-to-day practical implementation of the proposed provisions and the infringement of certain legal principles.  The society pointed out that, as the proposed registration of wills is to be a voluntary code, it would have limited effect.  Proponents of a register of wills suggest that a number of wills go undiscovered or are even possibly destroyed each year.  Senator Leyden referred to some of the recent advertisements in the <i>Law Society Gazette</i>.  That results in the mistaken distribution of estates under intestacy rules or the terms of a prior will.  However, these problems would still exist under a voluntary system of registration.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Law Society was of the opinion that the most the Bill&rsquo;s proposed registration system would achieve would be to confirm that a particular will was registered on a particular day.  Crucially, it would not be conclusive that the will registered would be the last one.  That is an important difficulty.  A further concern is that registration of a will is not proof of its validity.  The Bill does not appear to address whether a will to be registered has been executed in accordance with the statutory requirements and is valid, nor would registration prove that the will was not made under undue influence.  Also, the register would accommodate the registration of holograph wills.  Experience over the years suggests that a large proportion of these wills do not comply with statutory requirements.  The society is of the opinion that, if the issue of the proper execution of wills is not addressed, this calls into question the veracity of information held in a public register, a concern shared by my Department and by the Registrar General.</P><Col N="304"/>
        <P>The Bill proposes that the General Register Office will have responsibility for the registration of wills.  Civil registration was introduced in 1845 for the registration of non-Catholic marriages and expanded in 1864 to births, deaths and Catholic marriages.  Registration of adoption was introduced in 1952 and civil partnerships in January 2011.  The data in the registers form a basic, continuous source of information about the population by providing a record of vital events relating to people and satisfying the need for evidence that has a bearing on rights, entitlements, liabilities, status and nationality.</P>
        <P>Civil registration is relevant to each of us at important stages in our lives, beginning with the registration of our births and ending when our deaths are registered.  Between those events, civil registration affects us directly, as in the case of marriage and civil partnership, and indirectly, when certificates are required for many of the services available in society, such as enrolling a child in school, obtaining a passport, taking up employment and claiming a social welfare payment.</P>
        <P>Each event registered under civil registration legislation has the benefit of an independent evidential basis.  This is particularly important.  Details of births are notified to the registrar independently of the parents.  Details of deaths are attested, either by way of a certificate provided by the medical practitioner who attended the deceased or a coroner&rsquo;s certificate.  Marriages and civil partnerships are evidenced by the signatures of the parties to a marriage or civil partnership, the witnesses and the solemniser on the registration form, details of which have been recorded by the registrar prior to the event.  As a result of this, the records of the General Register Office enjoy a high reputation for integrity and credibility both nationally and internationally and certificates of vital events are readily accepted as evidence of the facts recorded without the need for further investigation or inquiry.</P>
        <P>As the scheme of registration of wills as proposed is voluntary and therefore not comprehensive, it is unable to guarantee that a will registered is the last will and that it has not been amended, revoked or superseded, and its validity cannot be assured.  It is, therefore, difficult to see how the scheme as proposed can achieve its objectives.  In addition, I would be fearful that the good reputation enjoyed by our system of civil registration could be undermined.</P>
        <P>I am aware that Senator Leyden is seeking to be helpful in a situation where not enough people make wills and evidence of the whereabouts of a will is often scanty.  There is still some superstition connected with making a will and many people are reluctant to do so for fear that it might have unwarranted consequences.  For a scheme like this to work, much work would need to be done, particularly in addressing the issue of the last will and testament, which is the document that must stand for the purpose of the distribution of an estate.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators Leyden and Byrne for their kind remarks about the responsibilities I have taken on.  The additional pressures placed upon my Department, and on the public service generally, due to the current economic climate are severe.  I sometimes feel &mdash; and it is a compliment to the Department of Social Protection &mdash; that many people would like to hand over the general administration of Ireland to the Department.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Within the next year, my Department will take on responsibility for community welfare officers, F&Aacute;S, redundancy and insolvency payments, to mention but a few.  There is an onerous burden on the staff of my Department.  My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, would have to allocate the additional resources that would arise from the implementation of the proposed scheme.  To put it mildly, in the context of the <Col N="305"/>comprehensive expenditure review, of which Senator Barrett is more aware than the rest of us, that would take a great deal of thought and argument with people in Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s Department and the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>I regret to inform the House that, in view the reservations I have expressed concerning the scheme of registration of wills as proposed in the Bill, I am unable to support the measure.  The motion contains very good ideas but I cannot support the Bill at this point.  However, it does raise critical issues that need to be addressed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and agree with the sentiments Senators have expressed about the operation of her Department.  I rarely hear phone-in programmes that are critical of the Department of Social Protection.  They are often critical of many other agencies.  The Department distributes large amounts of money efficiently to a large number of people.</P>
        <P>I heard Senator Leyden&rsquo;s briefing last evening.  The Bill represents a good idea and I hope the Minister will consider it.  It would, at least, get over one step in the search for lost wills.  There might have been a subsequent will, as the Minister said, but one would at least know where to start.  There must be huge transaction costs for people who do not know where to start and I am mindful of all those advertisements in the <i>Law Society Gazette</i> trying to find lost wills.  Having the State involved might encourage more people to make wills and lead to fewer disputes about inheritance.  Like the Minister, I think there are good ideas here.</P>
        <P>We license television sets and dogs, for example.  Might it be a good idea for wills to come higher up the licensing scale at some future time, perhaps when the finances improve?  This might improve people&rsquo;s welfare throughout the country and lead to fewer disputes about lost wills.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and share the sentiments of other Senators in wishing her well in the challenging Department she holds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Leyden brought this Bill before a previous Seanad in 2005.  They say persistence distinguishes the strong from the weak.  Senator Leyden is persistent and is to be congratulated on that basis.  Senator Leyden and his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, and all legislators, need to be convinced of the use, practicality of application and understanding of how this Bill fits in the framework of succession and civil registration legislation.  A Chamber that passes a law that cannot be validly applied by the Judiciary or goes contrary to the principles of common law and evidence rules runs the risk of being judged as crudely as the legislation it passes.</P>
        <P>In Senator Leyden&rsquo;s words, endorsed by his colleagues, the Bill seeks to ensure that citizens&rsquo; wishes are honoured and given their proper legal recognition.  Despite the first reading of the Bill where it might, on the face of it, make eminent sense, it goes against Senator Leyden&rsquo;s stated intention.  There is an argument in principle that the last will and testament should be easily identified and sourced so that beneficiaries and other affected parties can enjoy the expedient administration of estates.  However, the Bill, as outlined by Senator Leyden and although well intended, falls short of what citizens and legal practitioners require.  This coincides with much of what the Minister said.</P>
        <P>One of the aims of the Bill is to provide a quick and legally certain record of the existence of a will.  The Bill appears to do that, but on closer reading it does not.  I suggest that my colleagues consider the 2005 and 2011 Bill side by side.  They appear identical.  However, the 2011 Bill has an additional section that strikes at the heart and original purpose of the Bill.  Section 13 is a new section in the 2011 Bill.  Unusually, it is not included in the explanatory memorandum.  Thus, the explanatory memorandum is deficient.  Can you advise, a Chathaoirligh, if this has any impact on the progress of the Bill through the House?  There is no explana<Col N="306"/>tory memorandum for section 13 of the 2011 Bill.  In fact, the paragraph on section 13 in the explanatory memorandum provided to Senators refers to section 14 of the 2011 Bill.  The new section 13 has, like some wills, gone missing.  I know Senator Leyden believes that where there is a will there is a way, but where is the new section 13 in the explanatory memorandum?</P>
        <P>On the basis that the Cathaoirleach is satisfied that the Bill should proceed today, section 13 confuses the very intention of the Bill.  For this reason, I will be opposing the Bill.  Subsection 13(1) holds that the registration or non-registration of any will shall not be evidence of or provide any presumption of the existence of a will, the validity or non-validity of a will, the execution or non-execution of a will or any of the particulars entered in the register of wills.  Subsection 13(2) confirms that the registration or non-registration of any will shall not be used to construe any will, whether registered or non-registered.</P>
        <P>If that is the case, what is the purpose or benefit of the Bill?  From my understanding of this provision and in the absence of a compulsory registration clause, the Bill merely provides a facility for those who choose to register their wills.  Registration will confer no legal basis for the existence of a will or no assistance in the construction of a will.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2005, the Law Society gave this Bill the thumbs down as it was dependent on voluntary registration.  Let us consider whether registration should be compulsory or voluntary.  Section 10 is concerned with the registration procedure.  The wording and workings of the Bill have not been properly thought through by the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators.  If registration is to be compulsory, where are the amendments to the Succession Act 1965 drawing attention to the fact that the validity of a will now requires registration?  For example, what if on a person&rsquo;s death bed he or she relates a new will or codicil?  Will it be voidable because of the lack of registration?  This issue was also raised by the Minister.</P>
        <P>Will solicitors have to run to Roscommon to enter their documents before death befalls their clients?  Sections 10(1)(<i>a</i>) to 10(1)(<i>c</i>) set out that the entry must be signed in the presence of the registrar.  It cannot be faxed, for example.  If registration is to be compulsory, how long after execution must it be registered?  Who pays the fee &mdash; the client or the State?  If registration is voluntary, does it not carry even less weight?  For example, if I voluntarily register my will of 2010 and decide not to register my will of 2011, what confusion will ensue?  If it is to be voluntary, can the costs of registration and administration for solicitors and the General Register Office be justified?  Does that not outweigh its narrow advantage?  While I accept that there is limited advantage, it is not definitive enough for matters as critical as one&rsquo;s final will and testament.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden should be congratulated on highlighting the issue of missing wills because that causes a great deal of distress for families.  However, I fear as currently constructed, there are serious gaps in how the register is being presented and envisaged.  The input of other stakeholders in the sector such as the Law Society, the Bar Council and Age Action Ireland would be beneficial.  I ask that the Senator take on board some of my observations and those of his Seanad colleagues and consider them for the reformulation of the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the Civil Registration Act 2004, during the previous Seanad it was brought to our attention that the deaths of Irish citizens who are temporarily out of the country and who die abroad are not registered in Ireland.  This has caused significant distress for a number of families and we were strongly lobbied about this during the previous term when Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was the Minister for Social Protection.  What is the Minister doing about this?  Those affected are only looking for a document that acknowledges their loved one was temporarily out of the country and died abroad in whatever sad circumstances in order that the death be registered in Ireland.  I agree a limit needs to be put on the time such individuals can be out <Col N="307"/>of the country for this purpose but when we were lobbied about this, one of the interesting issues raised was that those who died had live passports but there was no record of their deaths in this country.  That, in turn, raises the issue of passports being open to abuse.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would address this in her reply because it is an important matter for a number of families.  A major campaign called Bring Them Home was built around this on Facebook and elsewhere on the Internet.  I thank Senator Leyden for his well intended Bill but it needs to be elaborated on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister to the House.  I endorse all that has been said by the Minister and Senator Healy Eames regarding the motivation of Senator Leyden in bringing the Bill to the House and their hope the situation is regularised.  If the Bill does nothing else, it will alert the general populous to the fact that a substantial number of people do not make wills.  According to a number of solicitors who work in this area, a lost will might as well have never been made.  The consequence of a lost will can include family disputes, unnecessary inheritance tax bills and expensive tracing fees.  The only option is to contact every solicitor in the deceased&rsquo;s location to ask if he or she is holding a will.  It is a hugely time consuming exercise, which may not produce the desired result.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to a number of instances of the impact that this had, both emotional and financial, on people.  The 2009 case of Thorner <i>v</i>. Major in the UK is an example of the costly arguments that can arise when a will is lost.  David Thorner worked on the farm of his cousin, Peter, and was the main beneficiary of Peter&rsquo;s 1997 will.  The will, however, could not be found after Peter&rsquo;s death.  It took four years, Stg&pound;400,000 in legal costs and a great deal of distress for all those involved before the estate was settled.  David&rsquo;s solicitor, Stephen Gisby, believes that had the 1997 will been registered with a national wills register, his agony could have been avoided.  An associate of Mr. Gisby&rsquo;s, Karen Shakespeare, recently dealt with a case in which an elderly man had told his friends that his will benefited them because he had no close family.  After he died, his will could not be found and his friends believed it was accidentally thrown away when his house was cleared.  Eventually a tracing company located a wife from whom he had been estranged for more than 30 years and she took everything.  Ms Shakespeare said: &ldquo;It is extremely unlikely that this is what he would have wanted.  If his will had been lodged with a solicitor and registered, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been lost and his wishes would have been followed&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>According to <i>The High Court: A User&rsquo;s Guide</i>, published by Four Courts Press, if the original will has been lost, advertisements should be placed in suitable newspapers to try to find it.  A copy will is not normally acceptable in case the original was revoked, perhaps by destruction, but if a copy exists, the High Court may be asked to admit the copy to proof.  The solicitor or person who made the copy will must swear that it is authentic.  If no photocopy or carbon copy of the original will exists, someone with means of knowledge such as a person who has the original on computer disk may give evidence in order that the will can be reconstructed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I illustrate these cases to emphasise the consequences of not properly registering a will.  That is the primary motivation behind the Bill.  During my research, I discovered, much to my surprise, that a number of companies operate in this field.  One, in particular, claimed to have almost 2 million wills allocated to it and it has a sophisticated wills search system that connects solicitors throughout Ireland.  There is a fee for this.  If a will is lost, there is no national register and no way of tracing it.  The reason I mention this, apart from my surprise that there are alternatives where I had assumed initially there was none, is the fact that there is at least one tracing company, which has a voluntary system in place to which 2 million people have subscribed, gives the lie to the views of the Law Society and other worthy people that somehow this Bill is not acceptable.</P><Col N="308"/>
        <P>There is a need and a desire for a similar system to be put on a statutory footing.  That is the central argument Senator Leyden made.  In spite of the fact that there may be alternatives, there is a need for the State to intervene in this regard and while I accept, and Senator Leyden acknowledged, the severe limitations being placed on the Minister&rsquo;s resources, perhaps there are other unstated reasons this Bill has not been accepted.  There seems to be a consensus among those in the legal profession or those who would be obliged to implement such a register that for some reason or other this is not right.  Senator Leyden answered the questions, specifically in regard to the Law Society&rsquo;s objections going back to 2006.  I only put this forward as a supposition because commercial voluntary will registers exist.  I understand the Minister&rsquo;s reluctance.  This legislation should have been passed by the previous Administration.  Senator Leyden was ill-served by his party colleagues during that period.  There was sufficient time for the Bill to be passed through the D&aacute;il subsequent to the 2007 election, but it was not.  The arguments that have been put forward today are new and were not raised previously, as I am sure Senator Leyden would have addressed them in detail.</P>
        <P>I wish to depart slightly from the debate to take advantage of the Minister&rsquo;s presence.  Last week we did not get an opportunity to refer to the guidelines on habitual residence under the social welfare Bill.  The Minister has since issued guidelines.  I would be most grateful if Members of both Houses could be given those guidelines as it deals specifically with returned emigrants.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the issue and commend Senator Leyden on reintroducing in a persistent way the Bill which first got an airing in 2005.  It is important that we would debate Private Members&rsquo; Bills in the Seanad during Private Members&rsquo; time and that we would not confine ourselves to statements.  I have had two Private Members&rsquo; Bills introduced in the House: the Climate Protection Bill in 2007 and the Bill to prohibit female genital mutilation, which I am delighted was accepted by the Government.  The Bill has passed all Stages in the Seanad and is now before the D&aacute;il.  It is an important function of our role as Senators that we would debate Private Members&rsquo; legislation and that we would have an opportunity to tease out Bills in detail during Second Stage debates such as this.</P>
        <P>As the Minister said, this is a worthy endeavour.  We all agree with Senator Leyden&rsquo;s objectives in proposing the Bill.  I was not a Member of the House when the Bill was previously debated in 2005 and 2006 but I find Senator Leyden&rsquo;s briefing useful.  I fully accept a huge amount of distress is caused by the problem of missing wills.  Senator Leyden has helpfully reminded us of the numerous pages listing people searching for lost wills in the <i>Law Society <Col N="309"/>Gazette</i>.  He has also helpfully reminded us that 70% of people currently do not make wills.  I only made a will myself on the birth of my first child.  Many find such an experience suddenly concentrates the mind.  I was surprised by what an easy process it was.  As the Minister said, people often resist doing it or do not like the idea of doing it for many reasons.</P>
        <P>Probate law seems rather obscure to those who are not solicitors.  As a barrister rather than a solicitor, many of us in the former profession are fearful of probate law.  We do not understand it as it is a specialist area.  We approach it with trepidation.  For that reason I commend Senator Leyden on venturing into this murky area.  I compliment him on bringing forward the Bill.  However, having looked at the provisions in the Bill and listened to the Minister&rsquo;s speech, I am conscious that there are deficiencies in the Bill and the proposed scheme.  We all agree with the objective of trying to ensure a better system to avoid the great difficulty of missing wills or wills that are not known about.</P>
        <P>The Law Society&rsquo;s objections are particularly pertinent as it referred the matter to its probate administration and trust committee when the Bill was first introduced.  As the Minister said, the objections are very strong in terms of both practical objections and principled objections.  Given that the registration would be voluntary, it would have limited effect in remedying the existing problems with missing wills.  Crucially, the registration would not guarantee that the registered will would be the last will, nor would it guarantee that the will would be compliant with statutory requirements, in other words that it would be a valid will.  Those are strong points of opposition.  I note Senator Mooney&rsquo;s reference to a commercial company which is doing searches and with which 2 million people are registered.  Clearly, that could not be in this country where 70% of adults do not have a will.  Perhaps Senator Leyden knows more about that.  In itself, that is not a reason for a voluntary registration system to resolve the difficulties with missing wills because it could and would give rise to other problems.</P>
        <P>There is a further difficulty with the proposed scheme in the Bill in that the General Register Office, GRO, would be the repository for registration.  Again, the Minister outlined those issues fully.  The GRO is the register of certificates which are accepted as evidence of facts recorded such as birth certificates which have an independent method of registration beyond the person himself or herself or the solicitor involved making the registration.  Section 10 refers to the &ldquo;qualified informant&rdquo;, namely, the person who has made the will or his or her solicitor as being the person who would register the will.  Again, there would be a difficulty with that in terms of objective verification.  It would be significantly different from the other registration functions of the GRO.  We all share the objective that something should be done to address the problem but I am not convinced that the Bill puts forward the best method of doing so.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames referred to the difference between the 2005 Bill and this Bill, namely, the insertion of the new section 13 providing the registration or non-registration of wills would not be evidence or provide any presumption of the existence of any particulars entered in the register of wills.  I do not see that the provision addresses the concerns that have been raised about the scheme proposed in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since the debate was mooted I have tried to think about how one could best address the difficulties Senator Leyden has identified.  Until I read the Bill I thought the Probate Office run by the Courts Service was going to be the repository.  I can see however that there would be difficulties with that given that it already has clear statutory functions in terms of the administration of wills.  I apologise if my suggestion has already been investigated by others.  I do so with trepidation as I am not a member of the Law Society.  I wonder whether the Law Society would be a more appropriate repository for a voluntary scheme of registration of wills and if all solicitors were to sign up to a code whereby any will of which they had sight was then to be lodged with the Law Society.  Perhaps it is a large function for the Law Society to take on, <Col N="310"/>yet it seems to me the obvious place where solicitors could register wills.  It would at least mean that if every solicitor signed up to it one would know which would be the last will.  Clearly, it would not resolve the problem in the case of people who do their own wills but I think I am correct in saying that most wills are done through solicitors.  It would address in some way the deficiencies in the Bill.  I make the suggestion in an attempt to be constructive and to see how a voluntary scheme of registration of wills might best be carried out in such a way as to resolve the difficulty.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett put forward another proposal which led me to think that perhaps the Post Office could be used, as it registers dog licences.  I raise that in a somewhat less serious manner.  It would be worthwhile perhaps approaching the Law Society to see if there is a way of doing what I suggest.  The big issue Senator Leyden raised of the relatively low proportion of people who have made wills could be addressed by the Law Society through an advertising programme suggesting people should make a will, which would generate business for its members.  Something has been done already by the Law Society in that regard.  Such a scheme or programme of advertising of public information through the Internet or by other means would be a better way to ensure a greater number of people would make wills.  We will have to think about how we would overcome people&rsquo;s fear of mortality, which is the underlying reason that people are reluctant to make wills.</P>

	<P>I call on the Minister to forgive me for repeating some points already made.  I was attending a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children so I missed some of the earlier exchanges.</P>
        <P>Like previous speakers I support the intention behind the publication of the Bill.  I commend Senator Leyden on bringing forward the Bill.  However, I agree with some of the points of legal concern that were raised.  Perhaps the Minister could take those points on board and the Government could introduce amendments or a new Bill to address the issues.  I would support Senator Leyden in bringing the Bill before the House.</P>
        <P>It is clear to me that there are advantages to such a scheme, which would help prevent situations in which families are unable to locate wills, leading to frustration of the intentions of the testator and loss on the part of the intended beneficiaries.  As speakers have noted, it can be difficult to locate wills as their details may be recorded in no way other than in the books of the local solicitor.  It is desirable that there is a relatively comprehensive register of wills to which the beneficiaries or family could refer rather than trawling through the offices of various solicitors.  There are 2,300 practices in the State, so a way of avoiding this would be welcome.  In addition, there is a need for the registration of wills to be put on a statutory basis.  This is something that is long overdue.</P>
        <P>Section 11, which provides for the privacy of wills, is important.  Wills are documents that are produced in sensitive circumstances and the law of probate is littered with tales of families, as we can all testify to, in which there are divisions over testamentary gifts and fallings out over promises of gifts.  It is essential that the details of wills are kept as private as possible.  Centralisation of the actual wills, as opposed to the detail of the wills, would be a more dangerous and potentially controversial issue; however, this is not provided for in this Bill.  Provided the vital safeguards to protect privacy were maintained, it would be a positive addition to the administration of wills if it were adopted at some stage.</P>
        <P>I wish to take the opportunity to make one or two general observations in this area, which is a complex and intricate corpus of law in and of itself.  Senator Bacik spoke about the fear that some people have of making a will.  My wife, a year ago, was the one to suggest that we make a will, and I wondered why it was so important.  Now that we have two children &mdash; we <Col N="311"/>had a new baby last week &mdash; we must amend the will.  It was only when I spoke with the solicitor, going through the various questions that are asked about who would take care of the child if something happened, that the importance of wills was brought home to me.  We need to encourage as many people as possible to make wills.  The figures show that over two thirds of adults have not made a will, which is shocking.  This should be addressed.  The passage of a Bill similar to the one proposed here could provide an opportunity for people to write their wills.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A related area of law is that of wardship of persons who are deemed not to be capable, whether that capacity is related to the making of a will or the giving of consent to something.  This generally refers to those with intellectual disabilities.  The issue may have been raised earlier, but wardship is a 19th-century concept that needs modernisation.  The legislation is seriously antiquated and there is an urgent need for new legislation to modernise the area.  While the Mental Capacity Bill 2008 was a step forward, we are still largely covered by the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  A person who is a ward of court cannot marry, defend or initiate legal proceedings or transfer residence without permission from the High Court.  It is a totally black and white system which allows for the total loss of control of one&rsquo;s self and one&rsquo;s estate.  There are no grey areas.  The consequences for someone who is made a ward of court are major.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Due to the requirements that Ireland must satisfy as a signatory of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this is an area of law that we must reform.  I ask the Minister whether there is an intention to move forward and ratify the convention to which we are a signatory.  It is an affront to human rights to allow those with intellectual disabilities to suffer from such a system.  Inclusion Ireland and Amnesty International are among those that have called for new legislation.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier, I welcome the introduction of this Bill and commend Senator Leyden on its introduction.  I share the concerns raised by Government spokespersons about legal issues.  We have spoken a number of times over the last week about rushed legislation, and some legislation was guillotined in this Chamber.  Issues such as this are so important that we have to get it right, so if there are legal issues that need to be considered they should be considered at length.  We should not rush into introducing a Bill of such importance.  I hope, if the Government is to oppose this Bill, that it will introduce a similar Bill which will address some of the concerns that spokespersons from the Minister&rsquo;s own party and her coalition colleagues, the Fine Gael representatives, have raised today.  I thank the Minister for attending the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for setting time aside to deal with this matter.  I also thank Senator Leyden for introducing the Bill.  I agree with what the Minister said.  If I was asked to write a speech for her it would match what she said word for word.  As someone who has been in legal practice for over 25 years I am well aware of the difficulties that can arise when a will is lost, but I am not too sure whether this Bill is a solution to that problem.  When people make wills, the important thing they should do is to advise the executors that they have made it.  People are sometimes reluctant to make wills but, having made a will, they can also be reluctant to advise their executors that it has been made and where it is deposited.</P>
        <P>The reason many people do not make wills is that they think they have all the angles covered.  In the last 30 years it has become the case that most property and many accounts are held in joint names.  That is good and represents progress but it does not cover a situation, for example, in which two parents die in an accident, and that is where complications arise.  When people are thinking about wills they may think they do not need to make one because their property <Col N="312"/>is in joint names but that is one reason people should make wills.  We need to keep highlighting that issue.</P>
        <P>I came across a sad situation a number of years ago in which a will could not be located.  It was not my own office that had been acting for the person, who had property in Ireland and in the UK.  One of the problems was that property was disappearing from the house in the UK, so I sent my client over to the UK to get all the furniture out and sold.  In the course of cleaning out the house the client found an old handbag and in it, lo and behold, was a carbon copy of a will.  However, there was no evidence of its having been signed or witnessed.  In fairness to the person who found it, she was the one who lost the most after it was found because she did not receive as much as she would have in the case of intestacy.  I remember making an application to the High Court to have the document admitted into probate and it was, even though no signature was evident.  The interesting thing about the case was that the person who drafted the document would sign an affidavit only to the effect that he had drafted the document but not to the effect that he had witnessed the will being signed.  This was a case in which we found out the person&rsquo;s real intentions and the court accepted them.</P>
        <P>This Bill tries to address problems that occur in cases in which people have made wills, but this is not the way forward in dealing with this issue.  Much consultation is required.  In fairness to Senator Bacik, her proposal is something that might be considered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another issue is that of homemade wills.  There can be problems with these if people take short-cuts.  I remember an example from the Leas-Chathaoirleach&rsquo;s part of the country in which a parish priest made a will but did not want anyone to know he had made it.  The will was not properly done.  When we spoke with the witnesses who signed the will, we learned the only time they were in the priest&rsquo;s house together was when the woman was making arrangements for her wedding.  She thought the documents she was signing were related to her wedding.  Subsequently, neither of them would sign affidavits affirming they were witnesses to the will.  I am concerned about homemade wills and the procedure of registering them.</P>

	<P>That is what happens when one is in legal practice for 25 years.</P>
        <P>These concerns need to be examined.  The Bill, as drafted, is not the solution but it highlights the need for people to make wills.  As Senator David Cullinane emphasised, with more young families it is important guardianship and other legal effects are planned for in the event of a premature death.  I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s points about this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Senator Terry Leyden for introducing this Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  There has been some debate as to whether the Government will support it.  Senator Leyden would not argue the Bill, as drafted, is the finished article and accepts amendments need to be made to iron out the various issues raised by Senator Bacik and others, such as the voluntary nature of registration.  Senator Leyden also made strenuous efforts to have this Bill put through the Thirtieth D&aacute;il but to no avail.  It was a poor reflection on the previous Government that a practical measure such as this was not implemented.</P>
        <P>All Members agree on the need for wills to be registered.  It would be a positive step, resulting in less stress for families during the immediate aftermath of a bereavement.  The Government should support the Bill, as no alternative is in place or proposed.  Existing statutory bodies could look after the registration of wills and subsequent record-keeping.  As Senator Leyden stated, no information as to whether a will had been made would be released until the presentation of a death certificate to a solicitor.  This would give comfort to those making wills that <Col N="313"/>their business would be kept private.  The issue is not the line-by-line assessment of the legislation but the Government accepting this is the right course of action.  It should adopt this Bill rather than wait for the Law Society or others to produce another report.</P>
        <P>While only 30% of families have wills, registration would be some ease.  The heartache caused by lost wills adds to the anguish suffered by many families at a most distressful time.  I hope the Government will table its amendments, bringing in proposals from the Law Society, so this Bill can move to Committee Stage and a registration of wills system can be established for the benefit of all citizens.  I accept it will take time for such a system to become the norm.  While the legislation makes registration voluntary, that too can be changed in time.  The implementation of this legislation would not be a step in the wrong direction.  The Government and others can strengthen these proposals.  That would be a positive step.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>With so much good will shown to this legislation, I am reluctant to call a vote on it later.</P>
        <P>Senator Thomas Byrne made a good point on the cost of enacting this legislation.  I regard it as self-financing through charging for registration.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, was positive and fair to the legislation.  I accept she has enormous tasks to deal with in her portfolio.  Having to bring this legislation to Cabinet is probably the last thing she needs.</P>
        <P>Senator Sean D. Barrett welcomed the legislation and pointed out how many aspects of life involve registration such as car ownership and so forth.  It is important that if a person makes a will there should be some way of locating it.  Senators Fidelma Healy Eames and Ivana Bacik made excellent criticisms of the legislation.  It was my intention that such criticisms would be put forward as amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Paschal Mooney pointed out how some private legal firms already provide a service for the voluntary registration of wills.  Senator David Cullinane, now a young father, made commendable points about the need for young families to make their wills.  Senator Colm Burke outlined his great legal experience of dealing with wills, highlighting the intriguing situations that can arise.  He also made the point that a solicitor should inform a person if he or she is appointed the executor of a will.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister consider forwarding the Bill to the Law Reform Commission for its consideration?</P>

      <sTitle>Planning Issues</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware the Minister of State has just come from a meeting where this issue was being discussed.  I apologise, but I understood the Adjournment would be a little later.</P>
        <P>This issue concerns property that was built with planning permission under the planning Acts which must comply with Part V.  In order to comply with Part V, the agreement is that the developer must provide a separate piece of land to the local authority.  The problem that has arisen is that a property that is developed and fully finished is mortgaged with a bank which is not part of NAMA and the land that was offered to the local authorities is mortgaged with a different bank.  The problem now is that the bank that has the separate piece of land is not prepared to surrender it to the local authority.  Therefore, the receiver cannot comply with Part V and the local authority refuses to yield on it.  As a result, approximately 160 units are left sitting and cannot be sold because an engineer&rsquo;s certificate of compliance with planning cannot be furnished.</P>
        <P>Will the Government take a look into this issue?  I am sure this is not the only example of what is happening, but it is the particular case of which I am aware.  The requirement to comply with Part V is an important part of the planning process and I am not looking for it to be changed.  However, we now have a situation where developments do not comply with the planning Acts because of the changes which have occurred in the building industry over the past three to four years and there is a need to get NAMA, the relevant Departments and the local authorities to work together to move this matter forward so that we do not have properties lying idle because of not being able to comply with planning regulations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this particular case, nine months after the issue was raised with the local authority, it has still not resolved the problem.  It is for that reason I raise the matter.  It is an issue that must be resolved, particularly at a time when we are trying to resolve financial difficulties and to prevent the problem of property lying vacant and idle.  I urge that the matter be dealt with in a co-ordinated fashion so that we can resolve all such problems as early as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am not aware of the particular case referred to by him, but it is clear from his remarks that the issue may have a wide implication across many parts of the country where there are unfinished estates and housing units, apartments and the like which must be finished.  There are implications with regard to what happens where a development has, effectively, been put into NAMA, particularly in terms of Part V.  He has made a very valid point in that regard.  For clarity, I will read the note I have on this matter and we can then take the matter further through correspondence or discussion with me or the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>Among other things, Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 requires that up to 20% of land zoned for residential developments or for a mix of residential and other uses is to be reserved to meet social and affordable housing needs and to be made available to the local authority at the existing use value rather than development value.  In addition to the options of providing land, units or sites within the proposed development, agreements with developers <Col N="315"/>may include the transfer of other land within its functional area; the provision of new units on other lands within the functional area; the transfer of fully or partially serviced sites to the local authority or to an approved housing association; the payment of money in lieu; or any combination of these.  This encapsulates the Part V provisions that were part of the original Planning and Development Act.</P>
        <P>The fact that NAMA acquires a debitor&rsquo;s loans does not alter the debitor&rsquo;s statutory obligations with regard to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  There are cases where a developer has not completed a development and where the 20% Part V component has not yet been fulfilled.  This might cause difficulty in regard to the sale of the completed housing units in other parts of the development because the terms of the original planning permission are not yet met and the local authority is not in a position to issue a certificate of compliance.  Given the prevalence of unfinished estates, this is likely to be a widespread phenomenon.  However, NAMA debtors will be involved in only a minority of cases.</P>
        <P>The same issue arises, on a larger scale, in the case of developers who borrowed from non-NAMA banks, to whom the Senator referred.  NAMA is not in a position to provide funding to enable unfinished developments to be fully completed unless it can be shown they are commercially viable.  In the case of most unfinished developments, however, they are unfinished precisely because they are no longer commercially viable.  Nevertheless, each estate will be examined on a case-by-case basis by NAMA as part of its commitment to the Minister of State with responsibility for housing to examine options arising out of the report of the advisory group on unfinished housing developments.</P>
        <P>Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, has played a considerable role in the delivery of social and affordable housing since its introduction in 2002.  However, Part V was designed for a radically different housing market to that which exists in 2011.  In recognising that, we must consider how planning gain can continue to be captured while taking account of prevailing market conditions.  A full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, was announced in a new housing policy statement launched on 16 June.  Also announced in the policy statement was the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership, in the context of this review.</P>
        <P>NAMA is aware that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is reviewing Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and the agency will dovetail its approach with the outcome of that review.  In the interim, outstanding issues in regard to the fulfilment of existing Part V agreements may best be resolved on a case-by-case basis, with developers and local authorities coming to agreement on revised Part V arrangements.  In some cases, local authorities, as well as developers, will be unable to fulfil their side of Part V agreements, often for budgetary reasons.  NAMA engages with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government regularly on planning matters and the engagement to date has been constructive and productive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In general terms, and without wishing in any way to pre-empt the review, it is likely that a revised Part V will place a greater focus on the delivery of social housing supports, particularly where there is no demand for affordable housing.  I thank Senator Colm Burke for raising this important matter.  I will report to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government the substance of his remarks.  However, as I outlined in my reply, these issues are being worked through by NAMA on a case-by-case basis.  That process may not be as conclusive as Members would like, but the commitment has come from NAMA that this will be done in order that we ultimately attain some agreement from the process.  The Senator&rsquo;s points are well made and I thank him for raising them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="316"/>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  However, in the case to which I referred, a lack of demand for housing is not the issue and the development is located within a mile of a large urban centre.  It is not desirable to have such a development sitting idle, as is the case in other locations throughout the State.  I take on board what the Minister of State said, but my concern is that a timeframe be put in place to deal with these issues, rather than merely saying they will be dealt with.  I ask the Minister of State to seek to resolve this at an early date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully agree there is a necessity to complete unfinished estates where there is demand in an area, particularly built-up areas in which there are still employment opportunities.  Under the NAMA Act, the agency has power to borrow up to &euro;5 billion in working capital for the purpose of advancing new money to complete developments or projects where it is commercially advantageous to do so.  All approvals of working and development capital are subject to a credit decision-making process approved by the board of NAMA.  To the end of April 2011, the agency has approved more than &euro;800 million in new money advances.  For example, it advanced in the region of &euro;100 million to Google for the completion and sale of high-profile buildings.  NAMA has this capacity to provide working capital as a means of completing a development, but that can only be done on a case-by-case basis.</P>
        <P>In the case to which the Senator referred, there is a role for the local authority in pushing the issue with NAMA so that the agency is fully apprised of the circumstances.  Where it is commercially viable for these matters to come to a conclusion, my understanding is that they can and do come to a conclusion.  In the case the Senator highlighted, it is certainly a matter worth pursuing with the local authority and NAMA.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Shane McEntee, and thank him for taking this Adjournment matter.  There is an urgent need for funding to repair the pier at Helvick in County Waterford.  It was brought to my attention at a recent meeting between Oireachtas Members and the executive of Waterford County Council that an application for funding of &euro;1.2 million was made by the council to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 2009.  There are two aspects to the proposed redevelopment: first, the extension of a slipway at the pier to accommodate the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI, lifeboat; and, second, the necessity to repair the substantial damage to the pier.</P>
        <P>The main pier has become honeycombed at foundation level and the sea is passing under it.  A former engineer with the county council remarked to me that it is amazing the pier is still standing.  Weight restrictions are in place but there is an urgent need to address this problem.  I asked my party colleague, Deputy Michael Colreavy, to table a parliamentary question on this issue recently, which he did.  The issue goes back to 2003 and many Deputies and Senators have raised it in the past.  I received the same standard response which began: &ldquo;The responsibility for the maintenance and upkeep of the pier lies with the local authority.&rdquo;  That may be correct but, in this instance, we are talking about substantial damage, substantial remedial work and substantial costs.  Waterford County Council simply does not have the means to repair the damage.  All local authorities are strapped for cash and do not have the ability to borrow.  As such, the council requires support from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  It is unreasonable to expect the local authority to shoulder the cost of the necessary works alone.</P>
        <P>The director of services with responsibility for this area indicated to me that if the repair works are not carried out, the potential future cost of rebuilding a collapsed pier would be a multiple of what it would cost to carry out the remedial work now.  It makes economic sense <Col N="317"/>for the Department to initiate a joined-up plan with the local authority to provide the necessary funding.  It does not matter to the remaining fishermen in Helvick whether the funding comes from the county council or the Department; they simply want to ensure the pier is safe and will not collapse.</P>
        <P>As I said, there are two separate aspects to the work that is required and there seems to be some confusion in the response of the Minister to the parliamentary question.  He talks about a funding application which was sent to Waterford County Council in respect of the slipway repair.  The rib of the slipway had to be expanded in order to allow the lifeboat to launch in a straight line.  Essentially, that was the issue involved.  Waterford County Council carried out the work and paid for it with its own funds and those it procured from the CL&Aacute;R programme and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>The work has been done but the real issue at hand is the substantial damage to the pier.  I must stress that there must be proper co-ordination between the Department and Waterford County Council in respect of putting a plan in place to ensure that the necessary funding will be made available.  There will be no point returning to this matter in a number of years when more damage has been done and, as stated earlier, when we will be obliged to spend much more money to repair the pier.  That would not make financial or economic sense.  In addition, it would not make sense to the members of the local community who would suffer if the pier were to collapse.  I ask the Minister of State to address that issue and to contact the county council in the interests of ensuring that there will be some form of joined-up plan for the future between it and the Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  If he does not receive the answers he is seeking, I hope he will not leave the House frustrated as I did on many occasions when I was in opposition in the Lower House.  I will pursue further any issue about which the Senator is concerned but which is not addressed in my reply.  I read the reply before entering the House and it seems that someone missed the boat in recent years.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to deal with the issues raised by Senator Cullinane in respect of the pier at Helvick, County Waterford.  I wish to clarify the position with regard to the responsibilities of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food regarding the development of fishery harbours.  My Department is responsible for the day-to-day running, maintenance and development of the six fishery harbour centres.  These are located at Killybegs, Ros an Mh&iacute;l, Dingle, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are, however, numerous other fishery harbours throughout the country which are not in the ownership of my Department.  In the main, these harbours are in the ownership of the various local authorities and my Department is committed to assisting, where possible, their development and upgrade.  Funding for such developments has traditionally been provided under my Department&rsquo;s fishery harbours and coastal infrastructure development programme, subject, of course, to the availability of Exchequer funding.  Helvick pier in County Waterford falls into this category and is in the ownership of Waterford County Council which is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the harbour, as well as its maintenance and development.</P>
        <P>Waterford County Council has made a number of applications for funding under the fishery harbours and coastal infrastructure development programme in recent years.  In 2007, the then Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources approved funding for underpinning works on the pier which were to cost &euro;690,000, 75% of which was to be funded by the Department.  Unfortunately, due to delays on the part of Waterford County Council in the appointment of a consultant and the tender process, it was unable to appoint a contractor and complete the approved works and draw down the approved grant.</P><Col N="318"/>
        <P>Waterford County Council again applied for funding in 2008 under the Department&rsquo;s fishery harbours and coastal infrastructure development programme.  This application, in conjunction with all others received, was given full consideration and assessed with reference to available Exchequer funding and overall national priorities.  The funding application for Helvick was, however, unsuccessful on that occasion.  In 2009, my Department received a further application from Waterford County Council for funding under the fishery harbours and coastal infrastructure development programme for improvements at the pier, including the extension and realignment of the existing slipway.  The cost of this project was stated as &euro;300,000.  Regrettably, however, given the limited Exchequer funding available at that time it was not possible to fund any local authority-managed projects in 2009 and, therefore, the request for funding in respect of the pier at Helvick was not successful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In September 2010, my Department was in a position, with limited resources, to invite local authorities, including Waterford County Council, to submit applications for funding for projects costing a maximum of &euro;150,000.  No application was received from Waterford County Council at that time.  This year my Department invited local authorities to submit applications in respect of priority harbour development projects for inclusion in the 2011 fishery harbours and coastal infrastructure development programme in early May.  In light of the limited resources available and with the aim of maximising the number of individual projects that could be progressed, the maximum cost of each project was limited to &euro;150,000.  Waterford County Council submitted an initial application to my Department which identified the extension and repair of the RNLI slipway at Helvick pier to allow the launch of the rescue vessel at low tide as its top priority.  The cost of the project was stated as &euro;96,400.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following a short-listing of initial applications, my Department circulated detailed application forms to the various local authorities seeking additional information in respect of projects in order to assist in the further evaluation of the preliminary applications.  A detailed application form was issued to Waterford County Council in respect of Helvick pier and other projects.  The deadline for the return of these application forms was 10 June last.  No reply was received from Waterford County Council and, therefore, my Department&rsquo;s evaluation committee was unable to consider any Waterford County Council project for inclusion in the programme.  The local authority element of the 2011 fishery harbours and coastal infrastructure development programme has now been finalised and it is not possible at this stage to approve any funding for works at Helvick pier.</P>
        <P>I do not know if I have provided the information the Senator is seeking.  As stated earlier, however, it appears that someone missed the boat.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State referred to the ownership of the pier resting with Waterford County Council and indicated that the latter has responsibility for maintenance, which is fine.  However, this does not prevent the Department from providing grant aid.  The position is similar to that which applies in respect of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  That Department provides grant aid to local authorities to carry out remediation works to housing stock which they own.  It is not the case that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food cannot provide the funding.  However, it may be that it is not in a position to allocate funding at present.  The latter is a separate issue.</P>
        <P>There appears to be some confusion regarding the various applications made by Waterford County Council, particularly in the context of what it was seeking.  The Minister of State indicated that the 2007 application listed the total cost of repairs at &euro;690,000 and that the 2009 application listed it as &euro;300,000.  I am not sure, therefore, if we are referring to the same funding application.  There appears to be confusion regarding the repair works relating to the slipway <Col N="319"/>and the substantial works required in respect of the pier.  Perhaps some works were carried out by the county council in the period between 2007 and 2009.  I understand from discussions I had with the director of services at Waterford County Council that the new sum required in respect of the remediation works to be carried out on the pier is &euro;1.2 million.  That is a significant amount of money.  We must consider, however, what would be the cost if the pier was to collapse completely.</P>
        <P>I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply and I understand that he is required to return to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to discuss the matter further.  There is a need for a joined-up plan involving the Department and the county council because otherwise there is potential for an extremely difficult situation to arise in respect of the pier at Helvick.  It would not be good if the State were obliged to spend huge amounts of money to build a new pier.  We should invest the necessary funds now in order to repair the existing pier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As the Senator stated, there appears to be some confusion regarding the cost involved, which was initially estimated at &euro;690,000.  It appears that when the money was available, someone slipped up.  I ask that the Senator return to the county council and clarify all of these matters.  He can then approach me personally and I will meet him in the Department.  I am aware that money is scarce but if we can get to the bottom of this matter and avoid any mix-up, then perhaps we can start afresh.  I accept the Senator&rsquo;s point that if the pier collapses it will cost between &euro;2 million and &euro;3 million to rebuild.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I am seeking to obtain an update on the investigation into fraud at national car test, NCT, centres and to discover what the Department has done to ensure that no car passes the NCT fraudulently.  In recent days I was approached by a concerned individual who bought a car only last week which had passed its NCT one or two weeks prior to that.  When he brought the car home, he took it to his local mechanic who telephoned him a couple of days later and stated that there was no way it could have passed the NCT because several major parts needed to be replaced.  How could a car pass the NCT when that is the case?</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is obvious that an endemic problem remains in respect of car testing.  The individuals at NCT centres who are culpable in the context of passing cars which should not be passed are causing real danger by allowing potentially defective vehicles back onto our roads.  People are driving their families on roads on which they may encounter unsafe cars.  We see road safety advertisements every day about dangerous driving and showing us the human tragedies of car accidents.  What about dangerous cars?  This is an important issue.  Why must we wait for a &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; special?  What happens when the sensationalism and the spotlight die down after the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme?  It seems that the heat dies down but the fraud goes on.  What is happening to ensure our national car testing service is being properly delivered?  What monitoring takes place to ensure our cars are being properly tested so that people are not hoodwinked?  What happens to cars that have been passed fraudulently?  Two months since the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme was broadcast, this fraud is still going on.  I know this from the concerned person who came to me.  On the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme, the person interviewed highlighted the point that fraud was going on not just in the centres identified in the programme but nationwide.</P>
        <P>Are Applus+ Car Testing Service Limited, the company that runs the national car testing service, and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport reliant on programmes like &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; and people coming forward or are they trying to get to the core of these <Col N="320"/>issues?  Is it an active or passive investigation?  I do not want to be dependent on waiting for someone to come forward.  A person may be fearful for his or her job and the ramifications of coming forward.  At the time of the programme, Applus+ Car Testing Service Limited said it would vigorously investigate the allegations of fraud at its centres and that it had reported the matter to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Applus+ Car Testing Service Limited asked the State broadcaster to provide details of the allegations.  In a statement released at the time, Applus+ Car Testing Service Limited said the NCT is operated to the highest international standards and takes the issue of vehicle safety and fraud very seriously.  The company is supposed to be reviewing the tests to determine whether unroadworthy cars were passed.  If cars were passing this test up to two weeks ago when they should not have been, what is going wrong?</P>
        <P>There are wide-ranging and detailed concerns about the national car test and anecdotal evidence about the lack of consistency across the NCT centres.  This leads to people questioning the validity of NCT centres.  It will not help us to promote road safety.  We need the public to believe in the quality of the work done by the NCT.  Until this issue is resolved, that cannot happen.  I ask the Minister of State to address these concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take this debate on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  I know where Senator Reilly is coming from as I was involved in road safety for five years in the D&aacute;il.  Everyone worked hard to get us from having the worst record in Europe to being at the top.  The quality of our cars was a major issue.  Setting up the NCT caused us much pain but when one had the NCT test, one felt one had a roadworthy car.  Everyone was shocked at the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme but this is under the eye of the Road Safety Authority, headed by Noel Brett.  Gay Byrne has done a fantastic job in getting us to where we are.  The Senator may be happy with the progress outlined in the reply.  I propose the Senator keeps on the pressure because that is what politics is about.  He or she who shouts loudest gets results.  That is how it works.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Reilly for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to update this House on recent developments on the NCT.  The NCT is an important preventative road safety measure and ensures that cars, particularly older cars, are in a roadworthy condition.  It is important to remember that, under road traffic legislation, it is the responsibility of vehicle owners to ensure that their vehicles are in compliance with the law and are roadworthy at all times.  Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006, the Road Safety Authority has responsibility for the delivery of the NCT.  Since the start of 2010, operation of the day-to-day testing function rests with a company called Applus+, with which the RSA signed a contract following a detailed procurement process.  This contract requires the contractor to meet a number of specific performance standards in a wide range of operational areas including customer waiting times, customer satisfaction and test integrity.  It also sets out the penalties that can be imposed in the event that the contractor fails to meet the performance requirements set down.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a recent RTE 1 &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; television programme, allegations of fraud and corruption were made regarding the NCT and specifically the roadworthiness testing of vehicles being used as taxis.  In a follow-up programme, further allegations were made in regard to shortened test times and faulty equipment.  The RSA participated in both programmes and in all subsequent media interviews and broadcasts on these matters.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and his departmental officials have discussed the issues raised by the programmes with the RSA, which takes very seriously the allegations of misconduct relating to any aspect of the NCT service.  It is engaging with Applus+ on an ongoing basis on the investigation of the allegations made and the enhancement of systems and procedures for fraud prevention and detection.  The RSA is also in discussions with PricewaterhouseCoopers and AA Ireland, <Col N="321"/>which audit and supervise the NCT service on its behalf.  Following the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programmes, the NCT contractor Applus+ undertook an internal investigation and the outcome was that seven vehicle inspectors identified as a result of the programme were suspended.  Three have since been dismissed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In parallel with the action taken by Applus+, a Garda investigation is currently under way and Applus+ is providing all the information and assistance required during this investigative process.  In addition to these actions, Applus+ is also implementing a number of measures to address the issues raised by the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme.  While details of many of these measures must necessarily remain confidential, they include preventative measures and fraud detection measures based on following up on specific risk areas identified.  Some of the more public measures that have already been put in place include a confidential hotline and e-mail address, a signed declaration for all vehicles booked at test centres, including trade and taxis, identifying the presenter of the vehicle and recording the driver number and the garage represented, if applicable, posters in centres advising all customers that no valuables should be left in the car and measures to increase awareness that the presenter must produce a driving licence.</P>
        <P>Under its contract with the RSA, Applus+ was already engaged in the process of fitting cameras on every test lane and these are expected to be in place by the end of this month.  The second &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme alleged that test times had reduced dramatically due to the introduction of the productivity incentive scheme for NCT vehicle inspectors and that faulty equipment was being used to test emissions.  These issues were fully investigated at that time and were found to have had no foundation.  Results for 2010 and 2009 show little difference in pass rates.  In 2009 the pass rate for full tests was 51.5% and for 2010 was 51.8%.  The average test time has changed from 20 minutes in 2009 to approximately 19 minutes in 2010 as the productivity changes have taken place.  The proportion of tests conducted in 15 minutes or less remains unchanged since 2009.  Shorter test times are typically for younger, cleaner vehicles and in centres that have clerical or administrative support staff.  Abnormally short test times are monitored continually by the RSA and the supervision services contractor.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding allegations of faulty equipment, Applus+, as part of a comprehensive re-equipment programme planned under its contract with the RSA, proposed to deploy new gas analysers.  Following in-depth testing by the company the equipment proved unreliable in Irish conditions and the company decided to use an updated version of the analyser provided by the previous supplier, which is currently being deployed without a problem.  While responsibility for the deployment of equipment rests with Applus+ throughout the testing and deployment period, the RSA was kept informed of progress in this matter.  The RSA has informed the Minister that it is confident that the appropriate steps were taken by the company in testing the equipment and deciding not to put it into production so that the quality of emission testing was not compromised.  The RSA has also assured the Minister that it monitors the performance of the contract continuously and has frequent meetings with the contractor to discuss performance and any issue arising.</P>
        <P>In view of the seriousness of the allegations made by the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme, the Minister is glad to say that the RSA has acted swiftly and proactively and will leave no stone unturned in rooting out fraud.  Deliberate fraud by professionals is notoriously difficult to detect as has been demonstrated in other areas.  Notwithstanding this, the RSA has assured the Minister that it will continue to take every possible action to tackle these issues head on.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue and I hope I have addressed her concerns.</P>

	<P>Has Senator Reilly a supplementary question?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="322"/>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have two brief comments.  First, in regard to the RSA and the discussions with PricewaterhouseCoopers and the AA which audit and supervise the NCT service, I would be interested to find out further information on how they perform that audit and how they look for fraud.  I read that they use the same car, bringing it to all the centres to ensure the service is uniform.  My fear is that if officials who engage in fraudulent behaviour twig that this is the car in question they can advise another person in another centre to watch out for it and to be careful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As to the confidential hotline and e-mail address, last week there was a Private Members&rsquo; debate in the Seanad on whistleblower legislation.  I would be very conscious that the trade of mechanic is a very hard one at present because of the recession.  People are very afraid for their jobs and the accompanying ramifications.  Nobody wants to be the person who comes forward.  Are people covered if they do so?  I realise the process is confidential and may be anonymous but none the less if a person in a test centre makes allegations against his or her colleagues it might be easy to identify him or her as having ratted on them.  I hate that term but that is what will be said to the person.  Is the protection in place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>The NCT was set up to progress road safety.  There is no question about that purpose because of the number of faulty cars.  I can only put my hand on my heart and state that the Road Safety Authority under Mr. Noel Brett will do nothing wrong.  I have not spoken to him since the programme which was a major shock to everybody.   We know that 99.9% of our mechanics are the best one could get but, as in any game, there will always be one person who takes a short cut.  Anybody who knows anything should come straight out with it and not be afraid, as should the Senator if any matter is brought to her attention.  No mechanic in his right mind would allow a faulty car to go out, risking not only the life of its driver but that of any other person.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the Senator has information, I ask her to supply it to me and I will make sure that my Department returns to her on any question arising.</P>
