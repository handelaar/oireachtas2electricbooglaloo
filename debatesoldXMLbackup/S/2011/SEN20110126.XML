	<P>We see again this morning that the uncertainty with the Finance Bill is continuing, especially in the approach some of the Independent Deputies are taking.  This highlights the fact that we are in limbo, which I believe every Member agrees is affecting people&rsquo;s lives.  The sooner we move out of this state and get on with the general election and have a new Administration the better, as critical decisions are not being taken.  Families in negative equity are in dire need of assistance.  We need clarity from the banks on how they will approach the significant number of people who are finding life very difficult and concerned about their homes.  Families are also facing emigration.  Young people are emigrating, as are entire families.  Older people are experiencing serious cutbacks in home care packages, with which there is a crisis which has serious effects in communities.  The health service remains under severe pressure.  There are significant challenges for an incoming Administration, all politicians and communities and we must deal with them with energy and commitment.  The sooner the uncertainty in respect of the Finance Bill is removed and these issues are clarified the better.  In the meantime, we must get on with whatever work we can do in the final days of this Seanad.  There is a good deal of unfinished work, including the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights and the financial implications of the Civil Partnership Act which we are all keen to see dealt with in a finance Bill as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to pick up on some of the points made by Senator Fitzgerald.  Also, it is fair to make reference to the biased and cynical comments made about elected Independent Members in the news media this morning, comments which have been well supported by many parties.  The reality is that the issues raised by the three Independent Members <Col N="342"/>in the other House are of great concern to many ordinary people.  They have nothing to do with issues affecting Tipperary North, Tipperary South, Kerry South or Wicklow.  They include bankers&rsquo; bonus payments, an issue with which everyone in the House was in favour of dealing; the civil partnership provisions, of which the House was in favour and, especially, the student fees tax rebate.  These issues are of great concern and, with section 23, should have been dealt with.  The parties are entitled to take the position that they want an early general election.  I understand this, as that is democracy.  However, it is totally unbalanced and unfair to blame Independent politicians in the other House for raising issues about which ordinary people are concerned.  There should be a clear view on this matter.  I congratulate the Independent Members concerned in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for raising issues of great concern to the people to whom I talk, the same individuals who want us to take another week or two to deal with the issue of bankers&rsquo; bonus payments, as well as the other issues to which I have referred.  That we will be driving students out of college because of the loss of the tax rebate on student fees is a serious issue.  These are not matters for self-centred Independent Members but ones about which large parties should also be concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue raised by Angela Merkel in recent days is interesting.  She is now indicating that she and the European Union are prepared to support a reduction in interest rates for countries such as Ireland, Greece and other borrowers as long as it is accompanied by reforms in the system and restraint in our spending habits.  This is something for which I have argued here in recent years.  I do not see it as a loss of sovereignty for Ireland to buy into a safer, more dependable and trustworthy euro system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Fitzgerald is correct: the sooner the people &mdash; I was going to say &ldquo;ourselves&rdquo;, but we do not count in the same way as the people &mdash; are put out of their misery and an election is finally called the better.  It is somewhat odd to suggest it is regrettable that such questions as the civil partnership provisions in the finance Bill cannot be or are not being dealt with now.  It is strange to suggest they can only be dealth with by the Government now.  They could be dealt with quickly and expeditiously within a short period.  It is possible for parties other than Fianna F&aacute;il to bring forward legislation and run the country.  This will be possible and these matters will be addressed quickly by whoever is in government once the new D&aacute;il convenes, which is as it should be.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader address an issue raised in the House previously?  Will he give a report at this late stage or an indication on whether any progress has been made on the missing children&rsquo;s hotline?  I believe Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others have raised this issue.  Apparently, a number has been set aside by ComReg for this important facility.  If I am not mistaken, there is a European directive to the effect that such a service should be introduced.  Some 12 countries have done so but we have not.  The number is available, but no funding has been allocated by the Government to enable the facility to be made available.  I realise people have other things on their mind, but will the Leader give me an indication of where the matter stands with the Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Three Departments are arguing about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole may not be aware that the finance Bill which will go through the Houses is not the one that would have gone through otherwise.  A second Bill in which all of the issues mentioned will be addressed will be agreed and introduced early in the life of the next Government.  Many of the issues being addressed in the other House by Inde<Col N="343"/>pendent Members &mdash; Independent Members in this House, in particular, have a fine record &mdash; have been raised by my party in government and since it left and I am confident they will be addressed by way of amendment.  However, there is a certain cynicism attached to the last-minute bargaining and the debased currency that is Irish politics.  These issues are being raised in public, but what is taking place behind the scenes may be a different type of bargaining.  This is the type of politics of which we must get rid.  I admit to personal revulsion at the idea of some individuals promoting tax equity, given their own personal history.  That our political system is held hostage to the views of people with such histories and experience is not to our benefit.  I look forward to the other House making an appropriate decision and the Bill being debated fully and responsibly in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that, owing to a diary conflict, I am unlikely to be present to pay tribute to the leaders of 1916 in the presence of their descendents.  I ask the Leader to transmit personally my feelings that they were men of vision and chivalry.  They had a poetic vision of Ireland and gave us the extraordinary and wonderfully liberating Proclamation that Padraig Pearse read at the GPO.  I would be very pleased to support the creation of a national monument, especially as we move towards the centenary of the event and welcome the opportunity to say as much because there may be confusion about my views.  One newspaper published some contradictory material.  I had to contact those concerned and they made a grovelling apology and, I am glad to say, printed a retraction.  This spirit is still embodied in some Irish politicians.  I am thinking especially of Joe Higgins and about the very clear way in which he spoke out on behalf not only of the people of Ireland but also Europe against the inflictions of the banking system.  It is interesting he rattled Mr. Barroso who showed his complete lack of professionalism by going for the Irish people.  The people of Europe ought to take note of this.  It is not entirely unconnected that the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, has changed her tune and is now echoing what Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I have been saying in the Seanad for some considerable time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are different kinds of Independents.  Some are like those in this House who are independent not only of party political affiliation but also in mind and thought.  I am not sure that can always be said about the Independents in the other House.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that they are now raising issues of national importance.  That was not always so.  They certainly raised parochial issues in the past.  Looking at the track record, I join them in most of the issues they have raised now, but in the past there has been parish pump, self-interest and jockeying for their own electoral advantage.  I hold that in contempt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, Senator Norris.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Not all commentators were acid about them.  This morning Michael O&rsquo;Regan on Newstalk made the point that these are real issues which they were right to raise and, accordingly, should not be attacked for so doing.  Not all commentators were incorrect on this matter.  The record of the three Deputies in question should be kept in mind when judging the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have to laugh at the political posturing by individuals in both Houses in recent weeks.  Some are shouting they want an election but do not have the guts to vote for the Finance Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">They want the current Government to introduce it in order that they can have a clean slate, as they see it, when they get into power.  People must examine the sincerity of what was said by some politicians of all parties in recent weeks.</P>

	<P>Is the Senator claiming he would like to clean up his own Government&rsquo;s mess?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No interruptions, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt Senator Norris.  It has never been my practice to interrupt others if I can avoid it.  I am sick and tired of some of the stuff being put out by political parties which want to be in government but whose policies are diverse as Sunday and Monday.  There are others who have left government but now feel, because they are outside, they can play an independent role claiming this, that and the other could have been done.  Why did they not stay in government and do so if they felt that was appropriate course of action?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The House may debate the finance Bill on Friday.  There are several anomalies in the legislation, especially with regard to the self-employed.  Different rates for the universal social charge are proposed for the self-employed and PAYE workers.  Will one set of people be classed as lepers, namely, the self-employed, who have been classed as this by a number of groups for years, while a different category will be applied to the public service and other PAYE workers?  It is time the self-employed got a fair crack of the whip.  It must be remembered we will be depending on many of them to dig this country out of the economic situation in which it finds itself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senators Fitzgerald and Alex White that the instability of the current Government is demonstrated by the fact that we still do not know whether the Finance Bill will pass.  The Government clearly has no popular mandate and it is essential we have an election date as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The lack of clarity about the date does affect the everyday lives of those outside the political world.  Today, I received an e-mail from a constituent who pointed out the week beginning 21 February is schools half term.  Many parents with children in primary school have made arrangements to be away that week.  If the election does fall on that week, many people, especially parents of young children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>We will seriously consider deferring it for a week for Senator Bacik.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>All I am saying is the current political instability surrounding the election is causing enormous problems for people in their everyday lives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The solution we offered was to bring forward the motion of no confidence in the Government.  This had the effect of ensuring a general election before the end of February.  In terms of lack of clarity and instability, there were attempts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, from the other side of the House, there were deliberate attempts made by Senator Feeney and others to muddy the waters concerning civil partnership.  It was suggested those entering civil partnerships would be in some way prevented or delayed from doing so because amendments on civil partnership in the Finance Bill would not be made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true; I listened to Senator Feeney yesterday.  The Labour Party has given a categorical commitment that the amendments necessary to ensure equity between civil partners and spouses will be brought forward in the finance (no. 2) Bill by 1 April, even if the Finance Bill is passed without the amendments in question made this week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik has made her point.  I call on Senator Daly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Civil partnership ceremonies may go ahead as planned in April.  The chaos of the Finance Bill will not affect them and there will be no delays.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bacik.  I have called Senator Daly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I just want to tell Senator Alex White, in case he is inquiring, that I am Senator Mark Daly and have been a Member for three and a half years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to attend the House to debate the absence of legislative provisions in the finance Bill to deal with bankers&rsquo; bonuses?  I saw my colleague from County Kerry, Senator Coghlan, nod in agreement that these provisions were vital, yet they will not be contained in the Bill because his party will not allow it to happen in a timely fashion.  I look forward to them being introduced in this House at a later date, perhaps under the stewardship of Senator Coghlan who might be Leader then.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on amendments to the NAMA legislation?  Section 35 of the National Asset Management Agency Act, concerning the sale of assets under NAMA&rsquo;s control, requires that a code of conduct regarding the disposal of bank assets be drawn up in three months after enactment.  This was done but under the code of conduct all assets must be disposed of by auction or competitive tendering process.  This is not happening, however.</P><Col N="346"/>
        <P>There are numerous anecdotes, which I am sure colleagues have heard, about people who owe hundreds of millions of euro to the banks but who are illegally putting bids in on their own debt through third parties and offshore companies and buying it back at hugely reduced rates.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not always agree with Senator Bacik but I do on her point about the effect of political doubt and instability on everyday life.  It is important we get back to ensuring a Government is in place to rule this country soon.  I am not going to cast blame but <Col N="347"/>I am concerned we are already having the debate on the finance Bill on the Order of Business when it will be taken on Friday and Saturday.</P>
        <P>I refer to instability and doubt because Retail Excellence Ireland warned yesterday that up to 400 shops are likely to close this month alone because consumer confidence is waning.  Consumers, it seems, are saving their money, not spending it.  The reason for this is the current political doubt and instability.  Something must be done about it.  While talking ourselves into instability, we are leaving the opportunity for others to enter the market.  A chain of sportswear shops was recently bought by a British company which plans to expand it by opening another ten shops.  That means retailers outside the country can sometimes see opportunities here while we talk ourselves into more serious difficulties.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The Houses of the Oireachtas passed the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act in 2003.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is vice chairman of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which has been extremely successful and which has brought logic to the process relating to the making of awards in respect of personal injuries.  I am concerned with regard to a recent award of &euro;10 million in a libel case.  There appears to be a major imbalance in respect of those who suffer personal injuries &mdash; which may leave them invalided for the remainder of their lives &mdash; and those who are libelled.  Perhaps, in the near future, the House might consider some legislation that could bring balance to the situation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>These are the final days of the current Seanad.  Many of those present can look back with pride on some of the great debates which took place in the House in recent years.  I am particularly pleased that the Leader has made time available to take statements on the national monument at 14 to 16 Moore Street.  Everyone is aware that a relatively small number of men and women took a stand during the Easter Rising in 1916.  They did so against all the odds and in the face of the might of the British Empire in order that we could gain both our independence and control of our own destiny.  It is interesting that a small number of people have again come together in Dublin and established a committee, the purpose of which is to ensure that the Moore Street area will be properly protected and promoted as a national monument with links to the Easter Rising in 1916.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is particularly interesting about the committee to which I refer is that for the first time since 1916, the descendents of all the leaders have come together to promote the national monument at Moore Street.  That is a significant development.  I hope that during the statements to be taken later today, Members will bear in mind that we are dealing with such an august issue.  I cannot think of anything more appropriate than for Seanad &Eacute;ireann to discuss the events of 1916, the War of Independence, our identity as a people, the subject of from whence we came and the great vision those involved in the Easter Rising had for this country.</P>
        <P>This matter does not merely relate to the past, it also relates to the present and the future.  It is not possible to commemorate and celebrate those great patriots without seeking to emulate what they did, for the good of the nation, on the occasion of the Easter Rising.

	<P Just="Left">Senators on the Government side have been bleating about the difficulties they are experiencing this week.  I refer to the collapse of the Government and the issues that arise therefrom.  The reality is that the Government collapsed a long time ago.  However, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and the Taoiseach, have been in denial about that fact.  When the Green Party pulled the plug last November, it played along with the denial for some time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Those on the Government benches must just simply get over what has happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the gospel according to St. Eugene.  Senator Regan should keep taking the tablets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the urgent need to hold a general election, consensus was reached on the procedure relating to the adoption of the Finance Bill.  Those on the opposite side of the House have sought such a consensus for some time.  We are in something of a political vacuum because we do not know if the D&aacute;il will pass Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The urgent need for a change of Government cannot be underestimated.  In Washington on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, we will have the opportunity to begin rebuilding the image of this country in the United States.  Negotiations will also be taking place at the highest level in Brussels, when the European Council meets to discuss the rescue arrangements relating to the banks in Europe.  Effectively, the latter will involve a renegotiation of the EU-IMF bailout for this country and the interest rates relating thereto.  It is ironic that later today we will be taking statements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on the national monument at Moore Street and the 1916 Rising.  The EU-IMF deal represents, on the part of the current Government, the biggest sell-out in this country&rsquo;s history.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have continually stated there can be no renegotiation of the terms of the bailout.  We now know that a new Government, led by Fine Gael &mdash; in the best tradition of the Christian Democrats &mdash; and supported by its friends in Europe, can renegotiate the EU-IMF deal for the betterment of the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is a pity a few more Members were not available to hear the presentation given by Professor Karl Whelan at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs in respect of the extremely intricate but very dynamic workings of the European Financial Stability Facility, the European Financial Stability Mechanism and the IMF loan.  Professor Whelan discussed in great detail how these mechanism worked and how they differed from each other.  He also outlined the number of variables in the context of the interest rates which may ultimately be charged.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The key lesson I took from Professor Whelan&rsquo;s presentation is that Ireland must be at the forefront of the discussion and debate on this matter in the coming weeks.  I also gleaned from it that, as parliamentarians, we must have a full understanding of the opportunities in the context of obtaining lower interest rates than those which were originally envisaged.  I refer in particular to the interest rates relating to the &euro;22.5 billion available under the European Financial Stability Mechanism.  This is a complex matter but there are prospects with regard to having the interest rate relating to the mechanism reduced.</P>
        <P>I regret that the proposed meeting involving members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the President of the European Central Bank, Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet, on Monday next in Frankfurt has been cancelled.  I was looking forward &mdash; I am sure other members of the committee were in the same position &mdash; to making the most of the opportunity to which this meeting would have given rise.  What has happened in this instance provides an indication of how the current instability is affecting the day-to-day workings of the Houses and, consequently, the lives of ordinary people.  We should have taken the opportunity presented but we are no longer in a position to do so.</P><Col N="349"/>
        <P>It may represent a break with convention, but the Seanad should debate the issue.  The context relating to this matter is changing so quickly that Ireland cannot afford to be left behind in the period between polling day in the general election and the Seanad election.  There is an onus on us to remain abreast of what happens in respect of this matter, particularly as the likely financial impact it will have in this country is of such import.</P>

        <P>It is time we considered the disparity between the damages awarded in libel cases and those awarded in personal injuries cases.  Senator Quinn was right to raise this matter.  The House debated this matter in the context of what became the Defamation Act 2009.  I was one of those who proposed that we should consider leaving it to judges to make awards in cases of this nature.  The latter is certainly a suggestion that is worthy of further consideration.  While we are mindful of the responsibility of the media and the need to prevent abuses by its members in the context of people&rsquo;s reputations, we must also consider that it is not just in respect of the awarding of damages to people that the media can be held to account.  There are other ways of dealing with media abuses in this area.  I refer here to the imposition &mdash; on an independent basis &mdash; of fines and penalties on those who offend in this regard.  One of the things I greatly regret about the chaos of recent days, of which I spoke yesterday, is precisely the issue Senator Dearey raised.  I also attended that excellent presentation by Professor Karl Whelan.  Listening to him, it struck me that this is what we really should be about as legislators instead of having the pointless gamesmanship we have seen in the past week which has brought the business of the Oireachtas to a halt to all intents and purposes and brought our proceedings into disrepute.</P>

	<P>I will finish on the this point.  Mr. Maurice Manning, a former Senator, and Professor William Binchy attended yesterday.  They deserve to be complimented on their work but they also deserve to be supported by this House in asking those kinds of <Col N="350"/>questions.  It is greatly to be regretted that we are not in a position to ask the hard questions in the way we need to because of the chaos that has taken place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the points made by Senator Ellis.  Within an hour the general election may be called.  The one thing the people need at the time of the general election is honesty, and that honesty will be demonstrated firstly by what the Opposition does at this point and whether it will be true.  As Members have said, while the Labour Party in particular has stated that it is in the national interest to see the Bill pass, it is not voting for it.  There is a total incoherence in that argument.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It happens all the time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The people deserve that honesty and they should get it at this first point when the vote is taken in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand why Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government have decided to stick with it because they are only making a rod for their own backs as they go.  They will be brutalised in the general election when this happens because both major Opposition parties, while they recognise its importance, will say they did not do it.  That is very dishonest.  As a first step, I hope we will have a good, clean and honest debate where the Irish people will not be hoodwinked and will get the presentations from all the parties honestly about what can and cannot be done in the bind in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>I wish good luck to everyone from this House who is standing for election.  This morning, I heard a commentator who is an academic banking expert describe in an appalling manner all politicians, not just those who are politicians today but also those who are standing for election for the first time having decided their country needs them.  It takes courage to stand up and to face the electorate, especially in these trying times.  I again wish good luck to anyone in the House who is standing for election.</P>
        <P>Dr. Garret FitzGerald was always described as a national treasure.  In case we are not here again, I note that one Member who will not be back is Senator O&rsquo;Toole, who I like to think is a national treasure.  I pay tribute to the work he has done and I have no doubt it will continue.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I hope the finance Bill will survive in order that this House can have its usual calm, dispassionate and objective consideration of it on Friday.  Senator Daly made comments on bankers and banking.  I have always understood that our policy on this side of the House is quite clear in regard to conduct, ethics, the bonus culture and so on, so I do not quite understand the Senator&rsquo;s comments.  Senator Daly made a very serious charge in regard to NAMA and, if there is substance to what he said, there should be an investigation.  The Leader might respond while he still holds that position because serious issues are involved.  NAMA should be selling some of its asset portfolio, particularly in the Dublin region, to assist the market, which is not moving, and to establish a floor.</P>
        <P>I too welcome the fact the Christian Democratic-led Government that will succeed in this country, please God, will be able to deal with our problems successfully in Europe.  As has been said by other speakers, there are signs of a new dawning, awakening and enlightenment in Europe in regard to interest rates, which makes eminent sense.  It is as with the issue of landlords and tenants and the reduction in rents which is necessary to oil the wheels and keep business moving.  It is to be hoped that will happen.  I believe it will be good for the eurozone as a whole.</P>

	<P>It was with interest I heard Senator Quinn refer to the difficulties facing retail, and I wholeheartedly support his expressions in that regard.  It is an issue I touched on last November and December when I asked people to shop local.  We all see the growth in exports, which is very welcome, and we all know the country is becoming more competitive.  The one thing we need to do, however, is to show confidence in retail.  Each one of us has a role to play, as I said last November and December.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As we are at this stage of this Seanad, I ask the Leader if all-party agreement could be reached on two issues.  The first concerns the patients of the former surgeon Mr. Neary.  Wrongdoing was clearly carried out but I understand a small number of people are not accommodated in the redress compensation scheme, some of whom are excluded on a technicality due to the lateness of the claim.  I ask that there be all-party agreement that everyone who experienced wrongdoing under Mr. Neary&rsquo;s knife be accommodated.</P>

	<P>Second, a number of dedicated and committed employees of Aer Lingus are experiencing difficulty in reaching agreement with their employer, which is having a detrimental impact on thousands of commuters.  If we could reach all-party agreement on this issue, I would very much welcome it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesCarrollFF"><NameTxt>Senator James Carroll</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that the Minister for Transport would with urgency come to the House for two reasons.  The first and primary reason concerns the crisis that is developing at Aer Lingus.  I have received numerous representations from people in mid-Louth, south Louth and east Meath who are staff or customers of Aer Lingus and who have been caught in the middle of this row.  Ultimately, this problem will be solved but the breakdown in communication between management and staff will not lead to a positive working relationship in the future.  If the industrial relations mechanisms within the State are needed, I urge the Minister for Transport to act swiftly to get those in place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second reason I want the Minister for Transport to come to the House is to consider the issue of rail infrastructure for the north east.  There is an industrial rail line from Navan to Drogheda and many people have been in contact in regard to the idea of possibly developing this into a commuter line.  As a commuter myself, I believe the Minister should urgently examine this issue, coupled with the idea of reopening Dunleer train station, which is necessary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Most urgently, as other Senators have said, we could be in the last hour of the Oireachtas as we know it.  There is talk the Independents might not vote for the finance Bill in the D&aacute;il, which is of serious concern.  If Independent Members in this House have any influence on <Col N="352"/>Independent Members in the D&aacute;il, I urge them to put pressure on them.  Ultimately, we must get the finance Bill through the Houses for the good of the country; it is critical that it be passed.  Whether we are on the road within an hour and I am back knocking on doors in County Louth and east Meath within two or three hours, I still believe it is critical the finance Bill be passed for the good of the country.  I ask the two Opposition parties in this House to use whatever influence they have because I hope we will all be back in the next D&aacute;il and Seanad and we must have a strong and stable country.  I ask Independent Members in the D&aacute;il to act as strong Irish citizens for the good of all.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Yesterday I spoke about the importance of how we would conduct our campaign in the next general election.  We are in the dying days of this Seanad and I am sad that we must now try to defend ourselves and the Seanad.  It is said it is finished, but when I come into the House every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, I am delighted to listen to contributions from all sides.  Yesterday, for example, the Seanad passed the Student Support Bill, a fine legislative measure that was welcomed on all sides of the House and by students in third level education and their parents.  They were anxious to have this legislation processed quickly.  Many other legislative measures have been initiated in this House.  I am sad that the sub-contractors Bill initiated by Senator Quinn will not now be passed.  These are examples of the work done in the Seanad, yet we are abused left, right and centre by the media as being defunct and nobodies.  I ask all Senators to defend themselves.  This Chamber should be recognised; we need this House.  I also ask the media to be honest in the general election campaign and not to bring forward spin doctors or persons who will spin a line to encourage sales of their newspapers.  That is not what the country is about.  I urge Senators on all sides of the House to play an honest game of politics in the election.  We are trying to save the country and bring it back to normality.  I will do my part and ask everybody else to do his or hers also.</P>

I hope I can make this speech again on Saturday, but it has been a great privilege to be a Member of the House.  It has been a pleasure to work with you, a Chathaoirligh.  You have always been fair and generous.  I will not mention everybody, but the Clerk of the Seanad, Ms Deirdre Lane, has been very good to me from my first day.  As I do not wish to miss anybody, I will not mention every name.</P>
        <P>My colleagues, Senators Boyle and Dearey, have spoken about meeting in the interim between the conclusion of the general election and when the next Seanad election takes place.  That could be used as a time by Members to reflect on and consider how the Seanad functions.  Having served in this House, I believe the Seanad has great value for the people.  It is a great institution and we should tread very carefully in considering its abolition.  However, major reforms are required in both Houses of the Oireachtas and Senators could use the time available in the interim to lead that debate which would be very useful.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader outline exactly what he believes will be the timing arrangements for the sittings on Saturday and Sunday?  Many Senators are anxious to debate the finance Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom aont&uacute; leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; &Oacute; Murch&uacute; agus Norris ar son laochra na C&aacute;sca.  I support Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Norris on the designation of 14-16 Moore Street as a national monument.  Unfortunately, owing to a family bereavement, I will not be present this afternoon for the debate, but I echo their sentiments.  It would be an absolute shame if this monument was not preserved for the future.  It is a distinct part of our history.  In fact, I have just finished reading a tome on the 1916 Rising by Fearghal McGarry which offers a good elucidation of what happened during the withdrawal from the GPO to Moore Street, the fighting that took place, the personnel involved and the signing of the surrender document.  It is an integral part of our history, from which we all draw our spirit of service to the nation.  I appeal to the Government and the various State authorities involved to ensure the monument is preserved for the future.</P>
        <P>Like other Senators, I have received an e-mail from a person in Glanmire, County Cork who has been encountering difficulties in attempting to establish a youth caf&eacute;.  The motivation behind establishing it is to provide a facility for young people in view of the high incidence of suicide in the area.  Unfortunately, it is one of the great tragedies in our society in recent times that many young people who have life and everything before them feel they have no option, as a result of whatever malaise afflicts the psyche, but to take their own lives.  It is so sad.  We have a particular responsibility in this regard and I hope the incoming Government will develop a policy to tackle the weaknesses in society and address this terrible affliction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish you, a Chathaoirligh, and all other Members every success in the weeks and months ahead.  It has been a privilege to serve in this Seanad which has had the benefit of many fine contributors on all sides of the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I asked the Leader to make representations to the Taoiseach and I repeat that call today.  It is particularly valid in the light of the complex issues we have had to confront in this Seanad.  I am cognisant of the bank guarantee scheme and the fact that we have passed legislation that has been exceptionally difficult and budgetary provisions that have been harsh, yet everything was necessary.  In the light of the fact that we wish to have a full and frank debate on issues and policies, to move away from personalities, to keep this properly in the public domain and avoid a knee-jerk reaction, I again ask the Leader to request the Taoiseach to opt for the full time limit allowed under the Constitution for the general election campaign which I believe is 28 days, excluding Sundays.  This would give the people time to reflect on, consider and face the realities that the Government and country face, as well as their responsibilities for the future, before they vote.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Boyle, Norris, Ellis, Bacik, Daly, Regan, Dearey, O&rsquo;Malley, Coghlan, Carroll, Ormonde and &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in expressed their concerns about the passing of the finance Bill in the D&aacute;il.  It our intention to take Second Stage of the Bill all day on Friday and Committee and Remaining Stages on Saturday.  I hope to meet the leaders of the parties in the House immediately after the tributes to the late Seamus Dolan to finalise the timeframe colleagues require for their Members to speak on the most important legislation to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas every year.  However, I support the view of Senator O&rsquo;Toole that Independent Members, be they in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, have made an enormous contribution.  Freedom of speech is sacrosanct.  I support <Col N="354"/>Independent Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad being allowed to express their views and vote with the courage of their convictions.</P>
        <P>Some of the issues being rushed through the D&aacute;il will cause the hardest of hardships on families who have built up businesses over generations.  I am not too sure if the constitutionality of one of the sections of the Bill going through the D&aacute;il might not be challenged.  I certainly know of the hardship it will cause and the trust it will break with those who have invested in our country, from which we have benefitted in jobs, taxes and every other way.  This leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about the euro reforms and mentioned Chancellor Merkel&rsquo;s comments.  I look forward to debating that issue, if the electorate so wishes, in the next Seanad.  Senator Alex White asked whether there was any progress on the missing children&rsquo;s hot-line.  I will come back to the Senator on this and we have all supported it.  I thank him for bringing it to our attention again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Norris, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Walsh spoke about tributes to the men and women of 1916 who made the ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives in order that we could have our freedom to express ourselves in a democratic society.  I put a motion down this evening to ensure the house where the seven met on 29 April 1916 to take the decision to surrender would be preserved as a national monument.  It is not too much to expect that we honour and acknowledge those who gave their life for our freedom.  I know that the next of kin of all seven will be with us in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery for this evening&rsquo;s debate.  I am looking forward to it and I had no difficulty, for only the second time in my political career, in signing an objection to a planning permission, along with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and colleagues in the D&aacute;il, and calling for the preservation of 14-16 Moore Street as a national monument.</P>
        <P>Senators, Quinn, Mullen and Callely all expressed serious concern about consumer confidence.  On our return following the Christmas recess and following the heavy snowfall across the country throughout December, I said the retail sector was under serious pressure.  It was decimated in some cases.  I certainly would support Senator Callely&rsquo;s call that we should continue to shop locally.  I ask the Revenue Commissioners, county managers and local authorities to be understanding to the retail sector, who have been with us for generations with their families and who are now finding it practically impossible just to keep the door open, not to mind paying rates and other charges or penalties that are being levied on them.  It does not matter who is in government after the general election.  They will have to take a caring view of those who have made a massive contribution for decades and who are finding it impossible to survive for the first time since the 1930s.  Business is not there for making a living anymore, but it is just a way of life, as many people in the retail sector have told us recently.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Quinn, Ormonde and Mullen offered their congratulations on the success of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole, other colleagues and I worked very hard on the enterprise and small business committee between 2002 and 2007 to set up that board.  The chief executive office of the board, Patricia Byron, is doing a wonderful job.  The vice chairman is a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and Senator O&rsquo;Toole has done a great amount of work in this area.  I agree with the proposal that the balance of libel awards against the media should be examined when articles or stories are incorrect and a person is defamed.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome Mrs Br&iacute;d Dolan and her 22 family members who have come to the Chamber to acknowledge and pay tribute to a great Irishman and a great friend, S&eacute;amus Dolan.  It is with great sadness that I pay tribute to S&eacute;amus, who was the oldest retired Member of the Oireachtas.  S&eacute;amus, who sadly passed away last August, was older than the State itself.  He survived the Civil War at home and two world wars that changed the world.  He lived through the inter-continental destruction of the first half of the 20th century and the economic war with Britain that left an indelible mark on his generation.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus was born in 1914 and received a scholarship to attend Col&aacute;iste Caoimh&iacute;n in Glasnevin from the local national school and from there he went on to train in St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, Drumcondra, qualifying as a primary teacher in 1936.  He taught in Belturbet for six years and then in Killygorman for 45 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">S&eacute;amus was a great Irishman who was very proud of his country, its history and its language.  As a fluent Irish speaker, he took every opportunity to promote the language and its use.  He passed his love for Irish tradition and culture on to his family. Irish was the first language spoken in the Dolan household.  I heard S&eacute;amus speaking on the telephone during the later years of life.  It gave him a great lift to speak to his children in New York, who have been enormously successful, and in other parts of the world.  He promoted the language and culture at every opportunity and was very involved in the running of feiseanna, particularly in Belturbet.</P>
        <P Just="Left">S&eacute;amus was very interested in local history and was fond of recounting stories, particularly of local history in County Cavan and local folklore.  He was a great supporter of the GAA and was actively involved in two professional organisations, namely, the INTO and the Irish Farmers Association.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although he was only 12 years old when the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was founded, S&eacute;amus was a lifelong member of the party, having served it in every forum to which he was elected.  From his early years he was very interested in public life and became a member of Cavan County Council in 1950, where he remained until 1986, and held a place on many of the local authority statutory committees, including the VEC.  As a member of County Cavan Vocational Education Committee, he was a strong advocate of expanding educational opportunities and a strong supporter of third level education, in particular.</P><Col N="356"/>
        <P>We are all aware of S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s commitment to tourism, particularly its potential in the area he consistently highlighted, County Cavan.  We all remember him promoting the development of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal long before it was seen as a realistic project.</P>
        <P Just="Left">S&eacute;amus was proud to have been elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1961 as a Deputy for the Cavan constituency in which he served until 1965.  He went on to serve the people of Cavan and Ireland as a Senator from 1965 until 1982, but his greatest honour was still to come.  In 1977 he was elected Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, a role he performed with great dignity and pride until 1981.  During this time he represented Ireland with great distinction at many international conferences and in many parliaments.  He attended the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe before the establishment of the European Parliament.  He was chairman of cross-Border committees in the 1960s when such bodies were not as plentiful as they are today.</P>
        <P>Following his retirement from public life, S&eacute;amus remained active in promoting the Irish language, its culture and history.  He remained active on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il and worked in successive general election campaigns when the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith; the former Minister, Deputy Rory O&rsquo;Hanlon, and others benefited from his commitment and dedication.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus was truly a great Irishman.  He was very proud of his country, its history and language.  On my own behalf and that of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and all Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I extend our deepest sympathy and heart-felt wishes to his wife, Br&iacute;d, who was by his side many a time in this House and whom we all had the experience of meeting at election time, particularly during Seanad elections.  She was as good a canvasser as any I have ever met in my time running for election to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  S&eacute;amus and I fought an election on the one panel and, of course, won on that occasion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is lovely to see Br&iacute;d here today with her family, Br&iacute;d &Oacute;g, Anne, S&eacute;amus &Oacute;g, Sin&eacute;ad, Aodh, Ruar&iacute;, Shane and Turloch, as well as extended family members and friends of S&eacute;amus.  Go nd&eacute;anfaidh Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a anam.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to pay tribute to the late S&eacute;amus Dolan on behalf of the Fine Gael group in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I acknowledge the presence of his family on what is a sad occasion for them but also an opportunity to honour S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s contribution to public life.  I note also the presence of his constituency colleagues, Deputy Margaret Conlon; the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith; Deputies Rory O&rsquo;Hanlon and Seymour Crawford.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus had a long and distinguished political career which spanned this House, the D&aacute;il and Cavan County Council.  As the Leader stated, at 95 years of age, he was the oldest retired Member of the Oireachtas and had witnessed a great deal.  He had lived through the Civil War and two world wars.  Perhaps it was because he had lived through so many monumental events that he was such a thoughtful and reflective parliamentarian.  Colleagues on all sides of the House have told me of his diligence, commitment and common sense, traits which led him to being an effective public representative.  Whether it was serving the Belturbet electoral area on Cavan County Council, representing his county in the D&aacute;il or working as a Senator in this House, he made an effective and thoughtful contribution throughout his time in political life.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus was renowned for his love of the country, its history, culture and native language.  It is remarked on by those who knew him well that he used many opportunities in the Oireachtas to promote the national language.  There is no doubt that the greatest political honour bestowed upon him was his election as Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, a role in which he served from 1977 to 1981 and discharged his duties honourably and competently.  I extend to his wife, Br&iacute;d; <Col N="357"/>his sons, daughters, extended family, friends and supporters our sincere sympathy on his passing.  He had many years of labour.  He is now at rest.  He left this House and politics a great deal better as a result of his contribution.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P>Cuirfidh m&eacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh Bhr&iacute;d agus roimh an chlann ar fad at&aacute; anseo linn inniu, agus roimh a chomhghleacaithe d&aacute;ilcheantair, an Teachta Ruair&iacute; O&rsquo;Hanlon, an tAire, an Teachta Brenda Smith agus an Teachta Margaret Conlon.  T&aacute;imid anseo chun sl&aacute;n a fh&aacute;g&aacute;il agus raiteas a chur ar an taifead maidir leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ar son na t&iacute;re seo ag S&eacute;amus Dolan.  He was a Gaeilgeoir from start to finish agus aon uair a bhuail m&eacute; leis, bh&iacute; Gaeilge chun tosaigh aige and we always had a few words as Gaeilge.  Na focail mholta a bh&iacute;onn againn ag uaire mar seo, n&iacute;l siad chomh t&aacute;bhachtach agus an m&eacute;id at&aacute; ar eolas againn faoin fhear f&eacute;in agus an m&eacute;id at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ar son t&iacute;re aige le linn na blianta fada.</P>
        <P Just="Left">T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach cur ar an taifead an m&eacute;id at&aacute; d&eacute;anta agus bainte amach aige mar sin f&eacute;in.  Born in Fermanagh in 1914, I always thought S&eacute;amus had the same solid countryman&rsquo;s common sense approach to the world that I saw in the late Gordon Wilson.  They were solid as a rock and one felt one would not be able to turn them around easily.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus lived out the rest of his life in County Cavan, but before he went into politics bh&iacute; s&eacute; ina mh&uacute;inteoir n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta agus thosaigh s&eacute; ag m&uacute;ineadh i mB&eacute;al Tairbirt, &aacute;it ina raibh s&eacute; an-chairdi&uacute;il le cara liom f&eacute;in, Jimmy McArdle, a bh&iacute; ag an am sin mar vice president of the INTO during that period.  I would have come across him at the time and acknowledge his courtesy towards me when I was a young &mdash; I was young once before I became a national treasure &mdash; INTO activist in 1981.  He welcomed me to the Houses with a number of others and listened to our contributions.  I cannot recall the important issue we raised at the time.  It might have been the school entry age or one of the issues that arose in the early 1980s, but he gave us a great welcome, of which I was very appreciative.  Is cuimhin liom ag an bpointe sin san INTO bh&iacute;mid an-bhr&oacute;di&uacute;il ar fad mar nuair a bh&iacute; S&eacute;amus anseo mar Chathaoirleach ar an Seanad, in the other House, bh&iacute; P&aacute;draig Faulkner ina Cheann Comhairle.  The union had the Speakers of both Houses at the time, which was an important one for us.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus was elected to the county council on which he made a major contribution.  He went on to become a Deputy, about which others have spoken, then a Senator and, ina dhiadh sin, Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo a r&aacute; to his family, in particular.  As public representatives, we know it is not just about the commitment an individual Deputy, Senator, county councillor or Minister makes.  What we understand better than anybody else is that his or her family must also make a huge contribution.  Part of what we are doing involves thanking S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s immediate family &mdash; his wife, children and grandchildren.  We hope they will recognise the importance of the contribution he made which could not have been made without the support they gave him which was without limits and judgment.  We all know that, as public representatives, we stand to be criticised.  That is part of the political and democratic system and a good thing, but those of us present always recognise that even our most bitter political opponents make huge efforts, of which their extended families are part.  It is important that they recognise this and that the function of democracy will fall apart if there are not people prepared to put their names on the ballot paper.  S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s family facilitated him in that regard, for which we say go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh to Br&iacute;d, in particular, but also to his extended family.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will conclude with a personal word.  S&eacute;amus Dolan made a contribution as a teacher, politician and citizen.  I acknowledge the courtesy he extended to me as a young unknown INTO activist as well as the pleasure I got when I navigated my boat through the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, knowing the contribution of people like him to making it happen.

        <P>I am honoured, on this sad occasion, to pay tribute to a former Member of the House who graced this Chamber so well over so many years.  I agree with what others have said about the contribution he made to public life and to this Chamber and about his many achievements and interests.  It is a sad day but also a day to reflect on someone who gave so much of his own and his family&rsquo;s time to his county and to his country.  As we come close to the end of this Seanad, it is important that we reflect, not only on what we are doing here and what we hope will be done in this Parliament in the future, but also on those who have gone before us and who have made a contribution to the important work of doing the people&rsquo;s business.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On behalf of the Green Party-Comhaontas Glas, I extend my sympathy to the family of S&eacute;amus Dolan and acknowledge his achievements as a former Member of the House.  At a time when those of us in politics have shorter careers and the turnover of membership of the House is greater, those who were here before and for longer periods of time should have their contributions especially marked.  From what I have learned of S&eacute;amus Dolan and of those with whom he associated politically, his particular political interest was the need for Ireland to reach out to the wider world.  Coming from a part of the country where emigration was probably more marked than others, he worked both to achieve infrastructural improvements, as has been mentioned, and to further the role of Ireland as a contributor to international debate and organisations.  For that he should be acknowledged.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, we need to remember the contributions of past Members and to mark them, especially at a time when politics is at a low ebb and public affection for it is virtually non-existent.  We must acknowledge the contribution of Members who were here at a time when politics was seen to deliver more effectively, partly because of their efforts and the longevity of their involvement in politics.  They represent a degree of public sacrifice that is not understood or accepted in political life today and, therefore, the House should pay tribute to S&eacute;amus Dolan and those who worked with him in achieving for this country.

        <P Just="Left">I have been a Member of this House for nine years.  I am proud to be a Member of the House and I look forward to coming back here fairly soon.  During those nine years, I have waited for an opportunity to correct our national treasure, Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I am glad he has given me the opportunity to do so on this day, as we pay tribute to S&eacute;amus Dolan, who was born in 1914 in Gubaveeney, deep in the heart of west Cavan.  While I accept that it is close to the border of Fermanagh, and I welcome Mr. Gerry McHugh, MLA, who represents Fermanagh and South Tyrone in the Northern Ireland Assembly, we are proud of the fact that S&eacute;amus Dolan was born deep in the heart of west Cavan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to honour the distinguished career of the late, great S&eacute;amus Dolan.  He was a member of Cavan County Council for more than 30 years and served the people of the Belturbet electoral area with distinction before moving on to national politics in 1961, when he was elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Between 1965 and 1981, apart from a brief interlude, he was a Member of this House and achieved the highest honour any Member can achieve when he became Cathaoirleach, which entitled him to be a member of the Council of State and the Presidential Commission as well as other honours to which that office entitles its holders.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus Dolan was only 12 years old when Fianna F&aacute;il was founded, but he remained a loyal member of the party until his death in August of last year.  I recall, as a young boy, attending Fianna F&aacute;il meetings throughout County Cavan at which Senator Dolan was a prominent contributor.  He proudly showed a Fianna F&aacute;il membership card dating from soon after the party was founded.  At the last meeting he attended of the Belturbet comhairle ceantair, when he was accompanied by S&eacute;amus &Oacute;g and Br&iacute;d &Oacute;g, he again very proudly showed that membership card.  He was a proud Irishman, a great farmer and an excellent schoolteacher for more than 45 years.  He served the people of his locality, his county and his country with distinction.</P>
        <P>Again, I extend my sympathies to Br&iacute;d and to all her family.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have a distinction not shared by any other Member of the House.  I served with the late Senator S&eacute;amus Dolan and had the honour of supporting his candidacy as Cathaoirleach in 1977.  This is a sad day, and we welcome Br&iacute;d and the Dolan family to the House.  For them, this is the closing of a chapter.  His membership of the House, which lasted for more than 20 years, was as important to them as it was to him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">S&eacute;amus Dolan always saw himself as serving the ordinary, plain people of Ireland and looking after the people he knew, whether in Gubaveeney, Doobally or back in west Cavan.  The only sin he committed was to move across Glan mountain and go to teach in what west Cavan people call &ldquo;the other part of Cavan&rdquo;, which was something we all accepted, was one of my closest colleagues when I first came to this House.  Many a time he hauled me over the coals in a nice way, saying I was going a bit far and that I should take it easy because there were different ways of doing things than the way I was trying to do them.  I suppose we all come here with the exuberance and ambition to change the world.  We discover that we cannot change the world but we can help to make some small moves in improving society and the lot of the people we represent.</P>
        
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">S&eacute;amus Dolan was, first and foremost, a Fianna F&aacute;il man.  Fianna F&aacute;il was more important to him than any individual. It was the party he saw himself as representing.  It represented the ordinary people who voted for him and they showed that appreciation by the number of times on which they elected him to Cavan County Council.  They also elected him to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and in turn, he was elected by councillors, Deputies and Senators to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  He did a tremendous job as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and brought a level of dignity to the Chair that was equivalent to that brought by the present Cathaoirleach.  He brought reverence to the House, which was much different than it is today.  There probably was less rhetoric and more substance then and whoever conducts a review of the Seanad in future should look back to ascertain how it operated during his tenure as Cathaoirleach, because it operated in a different manner and with a different <i>modus</i>.  This is a matter that must be examined.</P>
      
        
        <P Just="Left">I wish to be associated with the tributes to S&eacute;amus Dolan, a former colleague and close friend, of whose knowledge and wisdom I have been a beneficiary.

He was a personal friend whose company I always enjoyed.  I always enjoyed meeting S&eacute;amus, Br&iacute;d and members of his family because there always was good humour and crack and of course Fianna F&aacute;il always was at the heart of the conversation.  Many speakers have referred to S&eacute;amus Dolan&rsquo;s loyalty to Fianna F&aacute;il, to farming and to his teaching career.  He spent 45 years as a teacher, 30 years on Cavan County Council, as well as a number of years as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, where he reached the highest post in this House, namely, that of Cathaoirleach.  It is a wonderful honour for any Member to receive from their colleagues and as Senator Wilson stated, S&eacute;amus Dolan represented the Seanad and the country at different forums with distinction.  He was a gentle, decent and kind man.  I express my deepest sympathy to his wife, Br&iacute;d, and to the immediate and extended family.  May he rest in peace.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to pay tribute to the late S&eacute;amus Dolan and to sympathise with his wife, Br&iacute;d, and the family.  Although I did not serve in this House with S&eacute;amus, I knew him quite well during the mid-1970s when I worked in Killeshandra, County Cavan.  I met him each morning as he came in to Reynolds&rsquo;s post office on the main street to purchase <i>The Irish Press</i>, which at the time we described as the truth in the news.  I then had a good interest in politics, which I of course retain, and he would tell me all that was happening in Dublin, as well as about some of the antics of the great Members from my native county.  We then would go across to Jim Hayes in the Royal, where we would have a cup of tea and I would hear about everything.  From that perspective, I knew him quite well and maintained my friendship with him right up to the end, as well as with his wife, Br&iacute;d, and his daughter, who accompanied him everywhere he went.  He continued to attend Ard-Fheiseanna right up to the end, demonstrating his wonderful interest in politics, in Fianna F&aacute;il and in his country, as has been stated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Earlier, I listened to either his grandchild or great-grandchild in the Visitors Gallery, who was making a bit of noise.  I recall that Jimmy Farrelly, who also died last year, told me that together with the late John Wilson, he was a great platform speaker and at a time without amplification or modern technology, they could be heard above everyone else.  Consequently, it was nice to hear that child cutting his teeth in the House by making a bit of noise.  Please God, the day may come when he will be a Member either of this House or the Lower House.  I again extend my sincere sympathy to Br&iacute;d and the family.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

Although I knew S&eacute;amus in his later years and was honoured to get an occasional letter from him expressing his opinions on foot of a political development either in my own life or in general, which always was much appreciated, he was more a contemporary of my late father, Joseph Mooney, who also served in this House.  During my growing years, S&eacute;amus already was a political legend.  As Senator Ellis noted, he came from western County Cavan, which those of us from Leitrim perceive as being a neighbouring parish to our county, and this meant we had as much pride in his local and national political achievements as we would have in one of our own.  He has left behind a distinguished record as a county councillor, a Deputy, a Member of the Seanad and ultimately as Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Everyone has pointed both to his longevity and to his lifelong loyalty to the party he represented and his pride in so doing.  He was a great inspirational figure to ongoing generations and, as Senator Carty remarked, it is wonderful to see his children and grandchildren present today.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Ag dul siar ar bh&oacute;ithr&iacute;n na smaointe, bh&iacute; daoine cos&uacute;il le S&eacute;amus &Oacute; D&oacute;l&aacute;in i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ann agus sheas siad an f&oacute;d in am an gh&aacute;tair.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go raibh an Ghaeilge n&aacute; an cult&uacute;r riamh i mbaol an fhad is a bh&iacute; daoine cos&uacute;il le S&eacute;amus ann.  Mar a thuigimid, t&aacute; st&aacute;das faoi leith ag an gcult&uacute;r sin i l&aacute;thair na huaire, ach n&iacute; bheadh an st&aacute;das sin chomh l&aacute;idir ach amh&aacute;in gur thug daoine cos&uacute;il le S&eacute;amus &Oacute; D&oacute;l&aacute;in faoi, gur dhein siad iarracht agus gur thug siad gach cabhair do ghach eagras a bh&iacute; ag saothr&uacute; an chult&uacute;ir Ghaelach.  Ag an Fleadh Cheoil sa Chabh&aacute;n anuraidh, bh&iacute; ainm Sh&eacute;amuis &Oacute; D&oacute;l&aacute;in i mb&eacute;al an phobail mar thug s&eacute; an-chabhair do Chomhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann nuair a buna&iacute;odh an ghluaiseacht sin siar i 1951.  Chabhraigh S&eacute;amus gach uair a bh&iacute; cabhair ag teast&aacute;il agus bh&iacute; a fhios ag na daoine a bh&iacute; ag freastal ar an bhFleadh Cheoil go raibh an sc&eacute;al sin amhlaidh.</P>
        <P>A few years ago, I had the privilege of being invited to Cavan to make a presentation to S&eacute;amus on behalf of his colleagues and friends.  On that occasion, I realised the great affection that existed there for S&eacute;amus.  It was evident that locally as well as nationally, people appreciated the great effort he had made down through the years.  It is important to state that it was not always easy to make those efforts and an element of selflessness and sacrifice always was required.  Sacrifice was required on the part of the family as well.  Having met Br&iacute;d and the other members of the family I saw they all worked as a team on all occasions.</P>
        <P>Later today we will debate the commemoration of 1916.  We all refer to the leaders of 1916 and the great men and women who participated in that great historic event.  S&eacute;amus Dolan was that type of person as well.  People of his generation made no apology for being Irish, having a distinctive culture of our own and taking a stand whenever it was necessary.</P>
        <P>Many tributes have been paid to him as a member of the Oireachtas and the role he played at national level in other forums.  I always think the impact any individual makes within his or her community is the greatest test of a person.  If one is a prophet in one&rsquo;s own land, one has done what the people require.  I have no doubt that in the future his name will always be remembered whenever our national identity is centre stage.  Is mian liom mo chomhbhr&oacute;n a chur in i&uacute;l don chlann.

I did not know him but I knew all about him because in the 1960s with my late father, S&eacute;an Ormond, he was contesting Seanad elections on the Labour Panel.  As they were both teachers their nominations were disputed and it was argued that as members of the INTO they did not qualify for the nomination.  However, the court overruled the decision and they both ran on the Labour Panel.</P><Col N="362"/>
        <P>I heard about his contributions many times at the dinner table.  I heard about his commitment to the Irish language, to education, through his role in the VECs, and to public life.  I heard many stories when I was a young girl and thought about them today.  I knew all about him in the early 1960s.  He had huge commitment to the party and never failed to give of his best to our party and country.  I am glad to be here to acknowledge the presence of his family.

	<P>Like Senator Ormonde, I did not know S&eacute;amus Dolan but I knew of him.  I heard so much about him over the years and I am sorry I never, to the best of my knowledge, had the opportunity to meet him.  I am speaking to encourage the next generation to take note of what is being said and feel pride in it, and also to record what is said for future generations.  The words used will be available to the family on tape and I hope they will be treasured and recognised as a memory of a man who was one of the creators of the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">S&eacute;amus Dolan was born in 1914 and was only six or seven when the State was established, although at that age he may not have taken note of the fact.  During the week I spoke to my mother in law who was born in 1909 and celebrated her 101st birthday a few months ago.  She was able to talk about when she was six in 1916 and can remember things about it.  S&eacute;amus Dolan may not have remembered the establishment of the State at six years of age but he was 12 years of age when Fianna F&aacute;il was established and would have remembered that.</P>
        <P>I was disappointed to learn from Senator Wilson that the other link I had to S&eacute;amus Dolan was incorrect.  I understood he was born in Blacklion in Fermanagh.  One of my earliest memories was my first ever visit to Croke Park for the all-Ireland football semi-final in 1943.  I went on my father&rsquo;s bicycle.  The match was Cavan versus Cork and as a six-year-old I was very enthusiastic about everything in Croke Park.</P>
        <P>My father came from County Down, which is why I had a link with the North of the Border.  He told me to cheer for the men in blue on the Cavan team because they were from Ulster and not to cheer for the men in red because they were from Munster.  I remember it well and when I later met a number of those who played on the teams I was able to tell them the story.  I learned about S&eacute;amus Dolan over the years but assumed he was from Fermanagh and that there was a link with my father on that basis.</P>
        <P>I am in the Chamber to learn even more and have learned a lot more today.  I want to encourage the following generations to remember the wonderful record S&eacute;amus Dolan established for the nation.  He put a lot of work into that life.  Tributes have been paid to him regarding the time he spent in both Houses.  His contribution to education and love of the Irish language are examples that we set for ourselves and we as a nation should remember and record them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I read a lovely O. Henry story many years ago about a woman who received an invitation to go to her funeral which was to take place in her house.  She was old, perhaps not as old as S&eacute;amus was, but when people arrived at the funeral she met them at the door.  They told her they thought it was her funeral and she told them she would not miss it for anything and wanted to hear the chat.  I am sure S&eacute;amus Dolan is listening to the tributes today.  He is not here but it seems a shame that we cannot pay tribute and congratulate a person, as well as talk about his or her memories, when he or she is still around.</P>
        <P>Br&iacute;d and the family should be proud of him, as we are, as somebody who gave his life to create the State we now have.  The contribution he made, whether to Fianna F&aacute;il, education, the Irish language or the government and legislation of the country, clearly set an example for many others.

	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to bring the Bill before the House.  It updates the law on begging in two respects.  First, it addresses the situation that prevails following the High Court&rsquo;s ruling that the previous law was unconstitutional.  Second, it deals with the relatively new phenomenon of organising and directing begging and living off the proceeds.</P>
        <P>I will begin with the High Court&rsquo;s judgment in Dillon <i>v</i>. DPP (2007).  The applicant was being prosecuted under section 3 of the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847.  He sought and was granted a declaration that the section was unconstitutional.  The court held it to be unconstitutional on two separate grounds relating to Articles 34 and 40 of the Constitution.  Article 34 concerns the operation of the courts, while Article 40 concerns personal rights.  The first ground was that the section violated Articles 34 and 40 by being too vague and imprecise, thus failing to satisfy the requirement that the law must be stated in terms that are certain, clear and precise when describing the behaviour and circumstances that give rise to an offence.  The court also held that the constitutional right to free expression and communication as provided for in Article 40 was being curtailed unreasonably by the section.  The conclusion to be drawn is that begging becomes an offence only when accompanied by actions or behaviours that interfere unacceptably with the rights of other persons.</P>
        <P>Apart from these findings, the judgment contains some useful commentary that has been taken on board in preparing the Bill.  The court stated unequivocally that &ldquo;an overall ban on all forms of begging is unconstitutional&rdquo;.  That remark is of central importance.  The court also said, &ldquo;nothing in this judgement should be construed as preventing the legislature making laws <Col N="364"/>controlling the location, time, date, duration and manner in which begging or the seeking of alms might take place and the age of any person involved in such activity&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The court accepted that legislation may set limits on the right to communicate, saying &ldquo;it is undoubtedly so, that the right to communicate and the right to freedom of expression can be limited in the interests of the common good&rdquo;.  It is clear, therefore, that begging can be controlled by law, provided that the law is certain in its definition of the offending activity and proportionate in any restrictions it places on what are, in other circumstances, constitutional rights.</P>
        <P>I will refer to a number of issues before dealing with each section of the Bill.  It is accepted that persons who are begging are often vulnerable individuals who may have, for example, health care needs or housing requirements.  However, it is also true that begging can create public order concerns.  In my capacity as Minister for Justice and Law Reform, I am obliged to ensure the maintenance of public order.  The Bill, therefore, addresses begging from that perspective.  In doing so, it is making no judgment on the persons concerned.  The Bill has no implications for the conduct of public charity collections which are regulated by, for example, the Street and House to House Collections Act 1962.  This will be the first Bill to set fines for summary offences by reference to a class of fine rather than a monetary amount.  Senators will be aware that this is a consequence of the Fines Act 2010.</P>
        <P>The legislation comprises eight sections.  Sections 2 to 4, inclusive, respond to the High Court judgment, while sections 5 and 6 deal with organised begging.</P>
        <P>Section 1 defines terms used in the Bill.  Wherever possible, the definitions are aligned with those contained in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  For example, the terms &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; and &ldquo;place&rdquo; have the same meaning in this Bill as they have in the 1994 Act.  This approach facilitates the operation of the law on begging as part of the general public order laws.  In defining &ldquo;begging&rdquo; the Bill draws a distinction between, on the one hand, the activity that constitutes begging and, on the other, the circumstances where an offence of begging is committed.  The activity can arise in a public or private place and it will amount to begging where the person who requests money or goods is doing so while not having a licence or permit as required by the relevant statutes or by-laws.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 2 provides for the offence of begging.  The section applies to persons of all ages and may occur in &ldquo;any place&rdquo;, either public or private.  The offence is committed when begging is accompanied by harassment, intimidation, assault, threats to any person or the obstruction of passage by persons or vehicles.  It is a summary offence subject to a sentence of up to one month&rsquo;s imprisonment or a class E fine which has a ceiling of &euro;500, or both.   An example will help to distinguish between the activity and the offence.  If a person who is short of change for a bus fare late at night asks another person at a bus stop for help in paying a fare, that person may be said to be begging but an offence is committed only if he or she threatens, assaults or intimidates the other person. </P><P Just="Left">Section 3 is significant.  It develops the possibilities presented by the remarks I quoted from the Dillon judgment to the effect that the Legislature may include restrictions in any laws on begging that are proportionate and that relate, for example, to the location, time and manner in which begging is carried on.</P><P Just="Left">Section 3 gives effect to the remarks by bestowing on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a power to give directions to persons who are begging in particular locations or circumstances.  Garda&iacute; will be able to direct the person to desist from begging and to leave the vicinity of that place in a peaceable manner. Each of subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) applies this power in particular locations.  Section 3(1) permits a garda to give a direction in any place provided he or she reasonably believes that the person is committing or has committed an offence under section <Col N="365"/>2 or where the begging creates reasonable fears for the safety of persons or property or for the maintenance of public peace.  It can be seen that this subsection can be applied in a variety of circumstances, including cases of begging on roadways or at busy junctions.</P>
        
        <P>Section 3(2) provides that a garda may exercise the new power where the person is begging &ldquo;at or near&rdquo; the entrance to a dwelling, an automated teller machine, night safe or a vending machine in, for example, multi-storey car parks.  I am sure this subsection will do much to address the concern and unease felt by many about begging at ATMs and similar locations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 3(3) provides that directions may be given where the person is begging &ldquo;at or near&rdquo; the entrance to a business premises while the premises is open for business and where the member has reasonable grounds for believing that the public is being deterred from entering that premises.  The subsection is designed to assist traders whose businesses are adversely affected by begging.  However, we must respect the judgment.  Therefore, in line with the judgment that the begging must be causing obstruction or intimidating potential customers, it must be causing or likely to cause people to stay away.</P>
        <P>Sections 3(4) and 3(8) apply to a person who is begging in a private place.  Either a garda, under subsection (4), or the owner or occupier, under subsection (8), may direct the person to desist and leave the premises.  Senators will know about the special status under the Constitution of a private dwelling; subsection (7) therefore provides that the Garda may exercise the powers to give directions in a dwelling house when he or she is there with the consent of the owner or occupier.</P>
        <P>Section (6) demonstrates a sensitivity to the particular features that can arise in this area &mdash; it requires the Garda to use clear language when explaining the effect of a direction to any person.  A person who contravenes a direction from a garda is guilty of an offence and is liable to a class E fine with a ceiling of &euro;500.</P>
        <P>Section 3 reflects our policy position that the nuisance created by begging should not, as a rule, result in prosecutions or, indeed, imprisonment.  Section 3 provides an alternative means whereby the Garda can address particular cases quickly, fairly and effectively.</P>
        <P>Section 4 sets out the powers a garda may exercise under the legislation.  A garda may arrest without warrant any person whom he or she reasonably suspects has committed an offence under sections 2 or 3.  A garda may also require a person to give his or her name and address.  Any person who fails to comply or who gives false or misleading information is guilty of an offence and is liable to a class E fine, with a ceiling of &euro;500.</P>
        <P>I draw the attention of Senators to subsection (5).  It provides that a person&rsquo;s address may be a place that the person regularly visits.  Similar to section 3(6), subsection (5) shows an awareness of the issues that we can expect in cases arising under the Bill.  It aims to facilitate persons who are without a permanent address, making it more likely that they can comply with the Garda&rsquo;s request for details of their address.</P>
        <P>In section 5 we are dealing with a very different aspect of begging.  It provides for an offence of organising and controlling begging.  We have heard anecdotal accounts of organised begging but legislative changes need to be based on firmer evidence.  The Garda was in a position to provide good information on the situation around the country.  Based on intelligence and observation, the Garda is aware that begging is being organised in Dublin and other parts of the State; the organisers rarely beg but the Garda is satisfied that the operation is directed and organised.</P>
        <P>An examination of the crime figures produced by the CSO suggests a fall-off in prosecutions for all types of begging, including of the more organised variety.  The absence of a specific offence of organised begging, together with the uncertainty in the law on begging in recent <Col N="366"/>years has contributed to this seemingly low level of prosecutions.  The number of prosecutions should not, however, be interpreted to suggest the absence of begging, including the organised variety.  The evidence is that begging, including the organised type, is happening and it is now time to respond.</P>
        <P>Section 5 is modelled on section 9 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993.  While prostitution, like begging, is not in itself an offence, the organisation of it is criminalised under section 9.  In this Bill we are adopting the approach taken in section 9 of the 1993 Act.  The new offence may be prosecuted either as a summary offence or on indictment.  Subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) deals with the summary proceedings &mdash; on conviction a class A fine, that is, up to &euro;5,000, or imprisonment for a term of up to 12 months, or both, may be imposed.  Subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) deals with penalties for conviction on indictment.  It provides for a fine of up to &euro;200,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years, or both.</P>
        <P>Organised begging is a dangerous and sinister activity, and a lucrative one.  The penalties proposed in the Bill are severe.  They make it clear that we consider organised begging to be just as reprehensible as any other form of organised crime.  The new measures will act as a deterrent to anyone contemplating such criminality in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>Section 6 creates an offence of living off the proceeds of organised begging and is aimed at disrupting the support systems needed by those who engage in the organising and directing of begging.  It too is modelled on the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, in particular on section 10.</P>
        <P>A person who is convicted under section 5 and is additionally found to be living in whole or in part from the proceeds of begging by another person is liable under section 6 to a class A fine &mdash; not exceeding &euro;5,000 &mdash; or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 7 amends the level of fines in section 247 of the Children Act 2001.  That section deals with situations where adults having control of children are prosecuted for allowing them to beg.  The amendments ensure that the fines in section 247 are higher than the maximum stipulated in section 2 of the Bill for the offence of begging, that is, &euro;500.  Accordingly, the fines are being raised from &pound;250 to &euro;750 for a first offence under section 247 and from &pound;500 to &euro;1,500 for a subsequent offence.  No other changes are proposed to section 247.  Section 7(2) makes that clear. In other words, section 247 is being retained in addition to the new measures in sections 5 and 6.  Some of the more serious cases arising under section 247 may be more appropriate to sections 5 or 6.  However, experience suggests that many cases under section 247 are in the realm of neglect rather than the wilful, organised use of children for begging.  It would be more appropriate to pursue such cases under section 247 rather than to treat them as a form of organised crime.  For this reason, section 247 remains relevant.  However, with the new sections 5 and 6 in place, we will be better placed to deal with the full array of cases that might arise.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Section 8 is a standard provision on the Short Title of the Bill and the collective citation of the public order Acts.  The citation underlines how the Bill is linked with the public order Acts.</P>
        <P>This short Bill adds to our criminal law in a number of respects.  It responds comprehensively to the position arising from the Dillon judgment.  It focuses in a proportionate way on the maintenance of public order where it is being challenged by persons who are begging.  However, as a result of the Bill, we can look forward to less reliance on prosecutions and imprisonment for begging.  We can, instead, look to the new, pragmatic approach provided in section 3 to ensure effective enforcement.  The Bill also provides the means to counter the problem of organised begging, making it clear that it is a very unacceptable activity.  I am pleased to commend the Bill to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the new Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Smith, and thank him for his expos&eacute; on the Bill.  As he indicated, it is a response to the High Court judgment in the Dillon <i>v</i>. DPP case of 2007, which itself very much relied on a New York city court judgment, Young <i>v</i>. New York City Transit Authority where it was found that to have a blanket ban on begging interfered with the constitutional rights of the defendant in terms of communication and association.  The decision in the Dillon case struck down the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847.  The decision raised a number of important constitutional and legal issues as to whether it was appropriate to outlaw begging.  The Bill does not outlaw begging <i>per se</i> but it does outlaw it when it is accompanied by other acts, namely, harassment, intimidation, assault, threatening behaviour or obstructing the passage of persons or vehicles.  In not outlawing begging <i>per se</i> and in ensuring that for an offence to be created or committed there must be such accompanying acts, the Bill is a proportionate response to the lacuna in the law which has existed since the Dillon case.  The legislation is necessary and I support it.</P>
        <P>I realise that in the D&aacute;il, amendments suggested by Fine Gael and other Opposition parties were accepted or at least reflected in Government amendments.  The Bill is tailored to a problem it is designed to resolve and it provides a balanced approach to it.  It deals with the most difficult issues concerning organised begging and begging undertaken with threatening and aggressive behaviour.  The Bill leaves a good deal of discretion to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is appropriate in the circumstances.  Clearly, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts were insufficient on their own to deal with this issue and this is why the Bill is necessary, given all the circumstances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When one discusses the issue of begging it is in the context of the fact that there is extensive homelessness and poverty.  Most people accept that begging in general is born out of necessity and there is no justification for outlawing it <i>per se</i>.  However, where it is accompanied by aggravating and offending acts that interfere with other people&rsquo;s rights, there must be a proportionate response.  The Bill provides for this and it has my support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the new Minister for Justice and Law Reform to the House and the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill.  When we are discussing the amendment of the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847 we may note without argument that the review and amendment of the law in this area is long overdue.  For years, we have been unable to enforce the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act in its true form because it is altogether out of date and does not reflect modern society.  The people of Ireland in 1847 lived in an entirely different world.  Issues arising from the Dillon case have resulted in a lacuna in the law that we are required to address.  In this regard we are here today to amend the law and to address the issues raised in the Dillon case.</P>
        <P>As the Minister and Senator Regan have remarked, we must remember always the vulnerable in society.  There have been many people during this recession who, unfortunately and through no fault of their own, have been thrown into poverty.  The Bill deals with the issue of begging in a compassionate way.</P>
        <P>I am keen to highlight the work carried out by the Simon communities, the Combat Poverty Agency and Merchants Quay Ireland.  They are among several groups in Ireland which have carried out great work and put in great efforts to take people off the streets and away from begging.  It is timely to mention the contribution these organisations have made to our society.</P>
        <P>It is clear that begging is sometimes organised by individuals who may not necessarily be homeless.  This is clear from going into the cities, from listening to &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; some weeks ago and from speaking to people who live in such cities as Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  I am from rural Ireland but I have spoken to people who live in cities and they maintain they are afraid to come into the cities at night.</P><Col N="368"/>
        <P Just="Left">Economic issues arise as well.  Shopkeepers and people with businesses in the main thoroughfares where begging takes place have a problem in trying to ensure their premises remain open and that they have a welcoming environment for people who wish to come into their shops and spend money.  It is necessary to consider this point as well.  The manner in which the Garda has been given powers to move and remove people who act unreasonably and violently is proportionate with regard to the act of begging.  The idea of using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut is unwelcome and this is a compassionate way of dealing with the issue.</P>
        <P>We will never have a full answer to anything in life but this law will help to deal with the matter in a more proportionate way.  It always struck me that it was necessary to do this because the Garda did not have sufficient powers. People who were convicted under the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act were brought before the courts and were getting legal aid, representing an additional cost to the State.  We must consider the whole picture and understand it is an improvement to make begging an offence when it is accompanied by unacceptable conduct such as harassment, intimidation or obstruction.</P>
        <P>The issue of begging by children is difficult to discuss.  It is terrible to see children begging on the streets.  A great deal of work has been done in this area in recent times, including the passing of the Children Act 2001 and the establishment of Leanbh by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in 1997.  These developments led to a considerable fall in numbers but the non-governmental organisation in question has become concerned about the rise in numbers in recent years.  There are genuine concerns about the exposure of children to bad weather, violence and drugs.  They are vulnerable and susceptible to all kinds of violence.</P>
        <P>There is no evidence to suggest that children are involved in organised begging but, at the same time, it is difficult to prove and it could be below the surface.  Parents should examine their own behaviour as well.  If parents are helping to organise begging for their own children, it is beyond contempt.  However, the Bill attempts to deal with the issue of moving people on in a compassionate and proportionate way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issues of homelessness and housing relate to a different area and a different Minister.  However, it is vital that we consider joining the dots between Departments at some stage.  For example, we are dealing with begging in this case but there is another side of the issue which relates to homelessness and poverty and this is dealt with by a different Ministry.  Therefore, things can fall between two stools and a lacuna may arise.  It may not be a lacuna in the law but problems may be caused by the way in which there is no seamless connection between Departments.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, people are intimidated by begging at automated teller machines, ATMs, and parking and vending machines.  It is welcome that the Garda now has the power to enforce the law and to move people ten metres away.  Sometimes people are bullied into giving money to beggars.  While many wish to give out of the goodness of their hearts and feel sorry for people, it must be done in a proportionate way.  This is something to which everyone is entitled.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note the remarks of the Minister regarding charities and the position taken that the Bill does not include people who seek to collect for charities.  However, what is the situation with busking?  Often, busking on the streets adds a certain charm and ambience, especially to Grafton Street or other main thoroughfares.  Does this classify as begging or does it fall into a different category?  Overall, I welcome the Bill, the long overdue amendment of the law and the measures to modernise the legal code.</P>

        <P>I brought up the topic of begging several months ago, following a letter I received from the owner of ten shops in Dublin 1 and 2 who felt threatened by the behaviour of beggars as he moved between his premises.  He also made the point that such behaviour affected business from tourists.  When I visited India, I was warned the sheer number of beggars on the streets would make me feel uncomfortable and advised to have small denomination notes to give them.  Once a comparatively small gift was given, one was not threatened by them.  The threatening behaviour of beggars here, however, is becoming an issue of concern.  Ireland did not have a tradition of begging to the extent now seen.  We have not been able to acquaint the newcomers who engage in threatening behaviour while begging with our traditions and practices in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Minister has explained how in the Dillon case the courts found an overall ban on all forms of begging to be unconstitutional.  I understand how this legislation will overcome this.  The question that arises, however, is the legislation proportionate to what is required.  Senator Regan referred to some of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  The Bill is balanced to ensure those persons, including tourists, who feel threatened by the behaviour of beggars will be accommodated.  The Minister has achieved a balance in the legislation which I support.</P>

        <P>The Labour Party recognises that the legislation stems from the Dillon case which the Minister explained and, as such, did not oppose it in the D&aacute;il.  Likewise, it will not oppose its passage in this House.  The offences provided for in sections 5 and 6 relating to living off the proceeds of and organising begging are welcome.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte raised several concerns when the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il.  Section 2 imposes the penalty of imprisonment for one month when someone is unable to pay a fine for begging.  This is contradictory to the Minister&rsquo;s policy in the Fines Act 2010 which the Labour Party supported.  In our penal policy document, A Fair and Effective Penal System, we argued imprisonment should be preserved as a sanction of last resort.  In this case, it would be more appropriate to provide for community service as an alternative punishment.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte inquired if begging was actually on the increase as the figures showed otherwise.  We all agree on the need to cover threatening behaviour and harassment while begging.</P>
        <P>Senator McDonald asked rightly if busking was covered by the legislation.  Chugging and begging for charity such as going door to door on a street are somewhat different and not covered by the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators Regan, McDonald, Quinn and Bacik for the welcome they provided in respect of the Bill.  At the conclusion of my initial contribution, I stressed a number of points relating to the legislation.  In the first instance, the Bill does not merely respond to the judgment handed down by the High Court in the Dillon case, it does so in a generous manner.  All the Senators who contributed to the debate echoed my assertion in this regard.  The Bill embraces the spirit of the judgment to which I refer and recognises that citizens have a right to communicate with each other and that a simple, uninvited approach from a person who is begging is not to be seen as a criminal offence.  That would be a disproportionately unreasonable response.  The Bill, therefore, clearly establishes that an offence of begging arises only in the event of the subject being harassed, obstructed or assaulted.  In other words, an offence will be deemed to have been committed in circumstances where the interference by one person with the rights of another is of sufficient seriousness to merit action by the law.  The Bill recognises there are several interests to be taken into account.  Traders have made their concerns known.  For example, Senator Quinn referred to the shop owner with 11 shops in Dublin 2 and his particular concerns.  Every citizen who wishes to go about their business without undue interference also has legitimate concerns.  This is especially so in circumstances where the person is operating an ATM or night safe.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, we are obliged to ensure the person who is begging is treated in a manner that is fair and that shows understanding and sensitivity to their particular circumstances.  None the less we cannot ignore the public order aspects which have been given coverage on radio shows and in other broadcast and print media.  We must deal effectively with the nuisance being caused.  The Bill strikes a reasonable and fair balance between all those considerations.  This is demonstrated most clearly by the arrangement in section 3 whereby garda&iacute; can direct those who are begging to desist and move on.  This approach represents a serious effort by the authorities to avoid having to prosecute those who are begging and, more especially, it seeks to ensure imprisonment is a very last resort.</P>
        <P>Turning to the other major aspect of the Bill, I have no hesitation in stating that when it comes to the pursuit of those who organise and direct begging, there is no question of taking a moderate approach.  Organised begging exploits weaker people, including children.  The so-called workers are often begging under duress and are not at liberty to leave.  This form of <Col N="371"/>begging brings hardship and in many instances severe pain.  We may not know the earnings but they are substantial.  Organised begging is without doubt a form of organised crime.  Much headway has been made in coming to terms with this ugly phenomenon in recent times, be it in regard to extra surveillance powers or anti-trafficking laws as well as improved police co-operation, whether cross-border or international.</P>
        <P>The proposals in the Bill are directed at another manifestation of organised crime and add to the armoury of powers available to fight this scourge.  All in all, this short Bill makes a very strong and valuable contribution to dealing with begging in all its manifestations.  I know Deputy Dermot Ahern, as Minister for Justice and Law Reform, was very conscious of the different proposals that were put forward by all political parties while this matter was debated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and he took some of those viewpoints on board in further work on the Bill.  I am grateful for the overall comment that it is a very positive and proportionate Bill dealing with a subject in which we want to ensure we achieve the correct balance.</P>
        <P>To deal with specific issues, Senator Lisa McDonald asked about the question of busking.  I understand that those engaged in busking may argue they are not begging since they are performing or providing entertainment, which is often the case, as we know.  As the Senator said, such entertainment can enhance an area and add colour to our streets.  Buskers, however, are expected to behave in an acceptable manner.  They must not cause obstruction or nuisance and they must comply with directions from a garda, for example, to move on where necessary.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 contains provisions on all of these issues and provides the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its members with the necessary powers for enforcement.  I believe the current law is adequate in this respect and that busking can add much of benefit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn referred to ensuring tourists to the country are not endangered or do not have cause to be afraid.  I welcome Senator Bacik&rsquo;s support for the Bill.  She raised several issues, including initiatives to reduce reliance on imprisonment.  The new Criminal Justice (Community Service)(Amendment) Bill is designed to increase use of these orders.  Judges contemplating a sentence of up to six months will be required to consider whether an order might be used instead.  The Fines Act 2010 will reduce use of imprisonment in lieu of non-payment of fines in order that prison becomes a last resort.  The new provisions require the sentencing judge to have regard to, first, ability to pay and equality of treatment, second, payment by instalment, third, powers to seize assets, and fourth, the possibility of imposing community service orders to replace the fine.  These are all designed to ensure alternatives to imprisonment.  With regard to civil debt, the law has changed to ensure prison is only used where the debtor will not pay rather than where he or she cannot pay.  There is renewed support for restorative justice projects in Tipperary and Tallaght, and Members may have read commentary on the value of this initiative which was first undertaken in County Tipperary.</P>
        <P>It was asked whether Barnardos&rsquo; concerns were addressed.  Barnardos issued its comments in January 2009 when commenting on the general scheme.  The Bill was not published until January 2010, just one year ago.  I am pleased to state the Bill took account of several points raised by Barnardos.  The level of fines was reduced and the concept of persistent begging, to which Barnardos objected strongly, was dropped.  Barnardos recommended that begging in itself should not be criminalised and that is the position in the Bill.  It also recommended that the Bill should focus on begging that is accompanied by harassment, which is the case, and section 2 establishes the offence in situations where there is harassment.</P>
        <P>Barnardos correctly states that legislation alone will not address the problem of begging.  I and Deputy Dermot Ahern, as Minister, have repeatedly stated this and the Bill is based on this notion in that it is limited to addressing begging when it presents as a public order matter.  This was the theme of all the contributions by Senators today.  I welcome contributions from <Col N="372"/>civil society, especially from bodies such as Barnardos.  We all know the great value of the work undertaken by Barnardos, not just in our capital city but in working with many people in deprived communities.  I served as Minister of State with responsibility for children for one year and worked closely with Mr. Fergus Finlay and other members of Barnardos who did excellent work in many communities where there is deprivation and difficult issues with which to deal.</P>
        <P>The Irish Human Rights Commission was also consulted.  In accordance with section 8 of the relevant Act establishing the commission, a copy of the general scheme was sent to it and its comments were invited.  The response was issued in December 2008 and this was received in good time to influence the drafting of the legislation.  The Bill was not published until January of last year and several of the commission&rsquo;s comments were taken on board.  It expressed concern about the concept of persistent begging, which was dropped.  The level of fines was reduced and the provision on the giving of the person&rsquo;s address has been revised in order that section 4(5) states that a place regularly visited may now be used as an address.</P>
        <P>The Irish Human Rights Commission saw begging in its wider societal context but the Bill has a limited focus and concentrates on the public order dimensions.  In so doing, it takes an approach that will be very different from what we might have known in the past.  Every effort will be made to deal with the problem without recourse to prosecutions, the courts or, more particularly, imprisonment.</P>
        <P>One of the final issues raised by Senator Bacik concerned the right of the owner-occupier of a private place to require a person who is begging at that place to desist from begging or leave that place.  While calling at houses is not an offence unless there is intimidation, under section 3(8) the owners can ask the person to move away.</P>

    <Title>National Monument at 14-16 Moore Street, Dublin: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to see that we have representatives of all seven signatories in the Visitors Gallery today.  This is an historic day in some ways.  I welcome them all.  It is my pleasure to give the Government position on this matter and to take some questions and make some comments at the end of the debate following contributions made by Members of the Upper House.</P>
        <P>The Government fully appreciates the historical significance of the site of the last military actions of the 1916 Rising leaders, Pearse, Connolly, Plunkett and MacDermott.  Their actions and self-sacrifice, the centenary of which will be upon us in just five years, laid the foundations for the establishment of the Irish State.  It was for these reasons that in January 2007, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Dick Roche, placed a preservation order on Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, Dublin under section 8 of the National Monuments Act 1930.  The purpose of the preservation order was to ensure the preservation of No. 16 Moore Street in the context of the wider redevelopment proposals centred round the former Carlton cinema site.  To achieve this, the preservation order also covered Nos. 14-17 Moore Street</P>
        <P>There had been uncertainty that No. 16 was the actual site of the 1916 surrender as there were indications that the street had been renumbered at some stage in the meantime.  However, the proposed redevelopment of the Carlton site brought the issue to prominence and prompted research into the matter.  I acknowledge the work of those groups who raised concerns about the preservation of the property.</P>
        <P>A report commissioned by Dublin City Council at the time pointed to No. 16 Moore Street as the building used by the leaders of the 1916 Rising as their headquarters after they had left the GPO.  The council believed that the fa&ccedil;ade of No. 16 was so badly damaged in the bombard<Col N="374"/>ment that most of the current fa&ccedil;ade brickwork probably dates from the late 1920s.  Internally, there is an original 18th century staircase and original fireplaces.</P>
        <P>The preservation order was made on the grounds that the buildings constituted a monument, the preservation of which was of national importance by reason of its historical importance as the final headquarters of the leaders of the Easter Rising.  The objective of the preservation order is to protect the monument from any danger of being destroyed, injured or removed.  The effect of the preservation order is that any works affecting these properties, including any excavation or ground disturbance within, around or in proximity to them, require the prior written consent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under the National Monuments Acts.  The Minister is statutorily obliged to consult the director of the National Museum of Ireland as part of the consent process.  It is an offence for anyone to damage, injure, remove, carry out, cause or permit work affecting the monument without the Minister&rsquo;s written consent.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that, although covered by a preservation order, Nos. 14-17 Moore Street are privately owned and not in State care.  The preservation order does not empower the Minister to carry out works or to oblige the owner to undertake works with the intention, for example, of replicating the structures that existed up to 1916.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been suggestions the existing preservation order should be extended to include the entirety of the terrace containing No. 16 and a wider area.  The historical significance of No. 16 as the final headquarters of the 1916 Rising was the determining factor in the decision to make the preservation order.  The inclusion of the entire terrace would not add to this significance, nor does its exclusion from the ambit of the preservation order in any way detract from the recognition and acknowledgement of the national importance of No. 16.  It is also the case that the planning approval given by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the redevelopment of the Carlton site provides for the removal of the buildings on Moore Street other than Nos. 14-17.</P>
        <P>As a prescribed body, my Department commented on the initial planning application for the Carlton site in May 2008 and identified a number of concerns relating to, <i>inter alia</i>, architectural heritage, height, demolition of certain buildings, impact on the character of the O&rsquo;Connell Street architectural conservation area and so on.  The Department&rsquo;s concerns have been addressed in the redesign of the project through the inclusion of a screen along O&rsquo;Connell Street to reinforce the street facade, the omission of the tall building element onto Henry Street, the overall reduction in height of the tallest element of the development and its relocation to the centre of the site where the visual impact from surrounding streets will be lessened.</P>
        <P>An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s planning approval in March 2010 in no way supersedes the preservation order on Nos. 14-17 and any proposed works affecting the latter buildings will require the Minister&rsquo;s consent under the National Monuments Acts.  To date, no application for consent for works to the monument related to the proposed major development of the Carlton site has been received by my Department.</P>
        <P>The proposed development of the site, in accordance with the permission granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, envisages the retention of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street.  Subject to ministerial consent under the National Monuments Acts, No. 16 is to be converted to use as a commemorative centre.  This is in accordance with the objective of the Dublin City Council development plan to have the building in museum use.  Nos. 14, 15 and 17 will be conserved and used as caf&eacute;s, shops or offices.</P><Col N="375"/>
        <P Just="Left">The planning permission specifically states: &ldquo;No works shall commence within the preservation order boundary of the National Monument at 14-17 Moore Street unless the prior ministerial consent to such works has been obtained in accordance with the statutory requirements of section 14 of the National Monuments Acts, 1930-2004&rdquo;.  This reiterates the existing protections afforded by the preservation order.</P>
        <P>In late 2010 the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government approved an application for consent for minor works to protect and maintain the fabric of these buildings.  These minor works are being undertaken by an established firm of conservation architects.  The works entail an investigation of the underlying condition of the fabric of the buildings to inform plans for any necessary refurbishment.  Any such refurbishment works would require the Minister&rsquo;s further consent, in which case the appropriateness of the works would be carefully considered by the Department, taking into account all potential impacts on this significant monument.</P>
        <P>More recently, there has been comment on the demolition of the wall of Nos. 17 and 18 Henry Place at first floor level to prevent danger to the public.  Nos. 17 and 18 Henry Place are not protected structures under the planning code, or national monuments, and the works in question took place outside the area covered by the existing preservation order.  I understand Dublin City Council instructed the site owners in April 2010 to carry out an inspection of their properties on Moore Street, Moore Lane and Henry Place-Lane because of concerns about the structural stability of these vacant properties.  On foot of discussions with the council, the site owners&rsquo; consulting engineers recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, the demolition of the wall of 17 to 18 Henry Place to first floor sill level to prevent danger to the public.  This was approved by Dublin City Council and the works were carried out on 18 December 2010.  The works did not impact on the area covered by the preservation order and, therefore, there was no obligation for ministerial consent to be obtained for them.</P>
        <P>The appropriateness of any proposed works will be carefully examined against the historical background if and when a development related consent application is submitted to the Department.  The Minister of the day will need to see the full extent and detail of the developer&rsquo;s proposal before being in a position to offer any comment on it in the context of the National Monuments Acts.</P>
        <P>The National Monuments Acts do not provide a vehicle for commemorating historical events.  The Department of the Taoiseach has established a 1916 Centenary Committee to make preparations for a major celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Rising in 2016.  I am sure that in due course the new Government will bring forward arrangements for the centenary of Easter 1916 to be commemorated in an appropriate manner which will permit all the people of Ireland to take pride in the remarkable generation that laid the foundations of the State.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed contribution and extend a welcome to the relatives of the signatories who are present to listen to the debate.  It is an important debate at this time, given the events that have taken place in the country in recent months.  There has been a great deal of discussion in this House of the role and nature <Col N="376"/>of our economic independence and sovereignty and the effect of the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank intervention.  That discussion has made some of us realise that if we take our sovereignty and freedom for granted, we do so at the risk of losing it.  There is no doubt that the people who were involved and lost their lives in the historic events that took place at the properties we are now discussing realised that to an extent at which we can only marvel.</P>
        <P>It would be unthinkable at a time when some of our independence has been compromised not to find a way of honouring the heritage of the people who gave birth to the idea of Ireland as an independent State and defined what independence meant for the country at a time of major difficulty, for which many of whom paid the ultimate price.  It would be unthinkable, regardless of the economic difficulties we face, not to do this.</P>
        <P>What would be unthinkable also is that when the ceremony of whatever nature takes place in 2016 to commemorate what were momentous events in the State the properties we are discussing were found to be in one of two conditions, namely, in their current state which would be to our shame or either part of or compromised in a commercial development such as is currently proposed, which would also be to our shame.</P>
        <P>In terms of what is proposed, everybody wants to find a way of ensuring the economic regeneration of the city centre and the capital street running through it.  It is the main thoroughfare of the city and in terms of the events that took place there, the properties we are discussing were the birthplace of the movement that led to the foundation of the State.  If we cannot find a way of balancing the imperative for economic regeneration with the urgent need to remember where we came from and the vision and ideals of the people concerned, we have not learned as much as we are telling ourselves we have learned.  The decision that will be made on this matter will test the commitment of the incoming group of politicians to the idea that we are more than just an economy but a society with a sense of history.  For all these reasons it is important that we find a way of moving this issue forward quickly.</P>
        <P>An event which took place recently which changes fundamentally the environment in which we will make those decisions is that the assets and the business organisation of the developer in question now play a significant role in the National Asset Management Agency.  The fact that the State will, therefore, play a direct role in decisions that will be made on their property, assets and loans opens the possibility of involvement of the broader considerations to which I referred.</P>
        <P>My party leader has met many of the people involved in the Save 16 Moore Street campaign.  The two Fine Gael councillors for the area, Councillor Mary O&rsquo;Shea and Councillor Ray McAdam, also met a representative of the group recently to communicate our desire to support this issue and find a way to progress it in a constructive manner.</P>
        <P>There are four areas we need to examine to find a way to do this.  The Minister of State defined clearly the history of the properties and the different statutory bodies playing a role in it.  He pointed out that the National Monuments Acts did not provide a vehicle for commemorating historic events, which is the case.  What the Government has done, which is important, is put in place a centenary committee that I hope will meet soon and frequently, to define the way we should commemorate this event.</P>
        <P>It is important that in the coming months we find a way of generating an agreed vision regarding what we want to happen in these properties, the way the role of these properties can <Col N="377"/>be reflected in the history of the State and the views of different people on how these events should be commemorated.  It is appropriate that a consensus in that area be quickly developed.</P>
        <P>The second aspect that is important is that a ministerial order regarding the development of those sites should not be given until that consensus is reached and people are clear on how the properties are to be developed.  It would be unthinkable for us to come close to the centenary of the 1916 Rising and find that the properties were either in their current state or hemmed in, compromised or part of commercial developments.  It is important also that if the ministerial order is not given &mdash; I do not believe it should be given &mdash; the city council which currently owns a number of lanes adjacent to the properties in question does not hand over ownership of these lanes to facilitate further development until we have come up with a proper plan on what will happen with the properties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I conclude by stating my views on what should be the proper plan.  It is self-evident and necessary that if we put in place a centre, a facility or a monument, it should clearly outline what happened in the properties, and the perimeter and area should reflect the location in which these events took place.  In any country in existence longer than our own &mdash; we must remember this is a young state &mdash; one will find many examples, as one would expect, of where momentous events that gave birth to the state are commemorated.  That is a given.  It is unthinkable the same would not to happen here.  It would not be acceptable to anyone if no centre, monument or form of museum that reflected these momentous events was erected on this site.  Nearly every political party in the State came from the events of 1916.  All of us have a clear interest in making sure we reflect this fact.</P>

        <P>We are here as Members of the Oireachtas and we would not be here only for the men and women of 1916 and all the other patriots who endeavoured to secure our independence and sovereignty and ensure we had control of our own destiny.  I am particularly pleased that we have present in the Visitors Gallery members of the Moore Street committee and relatives of the leaders of 1916.</P>
        <P>This is an historic occasion and I thank the Leader, Senator Cassidy, for acceding to my request to have statements on this subject with the Minister of State present.  I felt we were leaving all the hard work to a small group of people who were working, not on their own behalf but on behalf of the reputation of the nation.  These are people who come from different walks of life.  They started from a particular base, where they had to educate people as to the importance of the Moore Street area.  Many would not have been aware of its significance but for that committee.  I attended one of their meetings, where there was a capacity crowd.  It indicated to me that the committee had developed a momentum that would keep going.</P>
        <P>We accept that Nos. 14-17 Moore Street have been designated as a national monument.  However, as with all national monuments, the environs also must be taken into consideration.  For instance, the Rock of Cashel, where I come from, is a national monument but the environs are also preserved and must be taken into account when there is any development.</P>
        <P>Those who will be still alive in 2016 will feel very proud when they look back on the events of 1916.  I say this because at the 1916 commemoration that was held recently one could see an outpouring of emotion, gratitude and patriotism.  I can look back to 1966, when we saw exactly the same.  If, when we reach 2016, we have not done what is right with regard to Moore Street <Col N="378"/>we will have made a serious error.  History will not be kind to any of us who stay silent on this issue.</P>
        <P>I appreciate what the Minister of State has put before us, which is the <i>status quo</i>.  However, it cannot end there.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the appropriate Minister and to the Department of the Taoiseach that a meeting should be held within seven days between the representatives of the Moore Street committee, the appropriate Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and the Taoiseach.  That would give the committee members the opportunity to explain the devastation with which we are now faced in Moore Street.  It is clear that the prospective developer is going to appropriate more than 60% of that historic environment.  This is not acceptable.  It cannot happen.  The people do not want it.  I have no doubt that if a plebiscite were held it would be clear that the people would want the wishes of the descendants of the 1916 leaders to be respected.</P>
        <P>I am overawed by the sense of history that comes from having the relatives here.  How nice it was for me to meet the relatives, not just today but on previous occasions.  I know that every family of every patriot suffered because of that patriotism.  No patriot who sacrificed himself or herself for Ireland did not also see his or her family sacrificed in exactly the same way.  We owe it to these descendants, to the committee who have taken it upon themselves to be in the forefront of this campaign, to the nation and, above all else, to our own sense of respect and decency as a sovereign nation to ensure not an inch of ground in the Moore Street environment is in any way desecrated for whatever reason.</P>
        <P>I am certain there is cross-party support for this proposal.  That is absolutely vital.  The 1916 Rising preceded the disastrous civil war, when we split out energies and our focus.  We can all celebrate 1916 and commemorate it together.  I was glad to hear Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s contribution.  I have no doubt that the political will is there to do what is right at the right time in this regard.  What we say today will become part of the record of the Oireachtas and will be there for examination and for posterity.</P>
        <P>The area should not merely be preserved.  It could be developed into a historic attraction, and I do not use the word &ldquo;attraction&rdquo; in any derogatory sense.  In any part of the world when a self-respecting nation is commemorating its history it spares no effort to ensure it is done properly and authentically.  Our history has a connection with the whole world.  Other emerging nations from that era took the example of our people, where might did not succeed over right.  Right succeeded over the might of the British Empire.  So many other countries have the same history in order that when their people come to visit us and celebrate our achievements there is no place more they will want to go than to the historic sites.  Even if we think in a mercenary or commercial sense &mdash; I do not mean this as the lowest common denominator &mdash; what better achievement could we have or what better recognition of what the heroes and heroines did than to give an opportunity to people to visit this site?  I am not thinking of merely one small house.  If the out-structures have been demolished and the laneways changed we will not be dealing with the environment to which the people of the GPO retreated during Easter Week.</P>
        <P>I know the credentials of the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, and know his heart is in the right place.  I know he will take what we are saying in the right way and relay the message back.  I ask him to give us that urgent meeting.  We must not lose this opportunity.  If we do not avail of it we will regret it in years to come.</P>

        <P>I subscribe to the views outlined by the Minister of State and Senators Donohoe and &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  This area is of huge historical and cultural significance.  It is the foundations of the beginnings and birthplace of the Republic, so to speak.  Everything that can be done to preserve it must be done.  I welcome, therefore, the existence of a preservation order for Nos. 14-17 Moore Street.</P>

	<P>In common with all other Senators, I welcome members of the Moore Street committee and relatives of those involved in the 1916 Rising.  I subscribe to what was said.  I am glad the preservation order has been made and that the properties in question are considered to be a national monument.  As has been said, they are in private ownership.  I am not being definitive about this, but in view of what has occurred with the owners, perhaps the National Asset Management Agency might become involved.  We must take steps to ensure this is a high class interpretative centre and museum.  For that reason we should consider working towards transferring responsibility for the project to the Office of Public Works, which is the appropriate State agency to manage our built heritage and places of historic and cultural significance, which Nos. 14-17 Moore Street so obviously are, especially No. 16.  It is also important, however, that we protect and enhance the entire area and preserve its structures.  I urge the Minister of State to look into getting the best brains of the State, through the OPW, involved.  I welcome the fact the committee and officials from the Department of the Taoiseach will be involved in an early meeting that it is hoped will progress this work and any other work they think might be of importance in that regard. Many Irish people are unaware of the importance of this area to our history and are unaware that this is where the leaders retreated and where the last decisions were made before the surrender.  It is important, therefore, that they would be able to visit it.</P>
        <P>We should also consider how important this site might be from a tourism point of view.  It is in the centre of our capital city and could make a wonderful visitor centre, both for Irish residents and visitors to Ireland.  I look forward to seeing developments in that regard and hope much will be achieved and that everything will be in place before 2016 and the centenary celebrations.  I wish the committee and all the officials who will be involved the best.  We wholeheartedly support the efforts being made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is hardly a more important monument in the country than this, but there are many potential pitfalls around its preservation that could be wounding to our memory of what happened in 1916 if poorly handled.  An unseemly squabble for ownership of 1916 would not be appropriate when everyone can claim lineage to it.  I claim lineage to it which I will explain briefly.  My grandmother Peg Ginnity &mdash; a great lady &mdash; from Dromiskin was taught by Thomas McDonagh when she studied French and English in UCD, Earlsfort Terrace.  Before her death, she recalled distinctly the occasion of his last lecture to her class during Holy Week.  When he walked in, there were three candles lit on the lectern.  He said that three candles were unlucky and snuffed one out and proceeded with his lecture.  That was <Col N="380"/>the last time she saw him.  She related that story to me and I and my family cherish it because it gives us a sense of identity, longevity and connection with the start of the State.</P>
        <P>I know from families throughout the country that there are similar and far more profound and harrowing stories of courage and bravery to be told. For that reason, it is important that proper thought is given to this monument and that the issue is properly handled.  I support Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s call for an early meeting at the highest level on the matter and for the centenary committee to be involved.  The job of that committee is to appreciate the importance of the memory and history of the site and to honour it and do it justice.  The Senator also used the word &ldquo;desecration&rdquo;, a word normally associated with places of worship.  Memory is so sacred and precious that a missed opportunity or poor decision made regarding this site would be a form of desecration because the memories related to it are cherished and sacred.</P>
        <P>I support the fine ideas I have heard in terms of the OPW and the involvement of those whose grave responsibility it is to help us remember well.  They will help us remember in a way that will allow us repair some of the damage the nation feels at this time.  I heard a mental health expert speak on a radio show the other day and he urged people to get back into the clubs, the churches and whatever it is that sustains them or gives meaning to their lives or helps them hold themselves together at a time when so much is being atomised.  The 2016 centenary celebration will, if it is properly organised, help provide healing for us all as we seek to find a new identity and sense of belonging and ownership in the country.  There are contemporary lessons and gains for us in how this issue is addressed.  If done well, it will help preserve the memory and tell the story in a way in which no one will take a proprietary hold of it.  It is important that does not happen.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">While the physical structures on the site are unprepossessing, that is no reason for us to be snobbish about them or to show a lack of respect. No. 16 is a site where a seminal decision was made in terms of the history of the nation. It is worthwhile for the committee to look at how Berlin has preserved its memories, even very painful ones. There, the memories are interpreted in a way that does not hide or gloss over what happened but allows people to gain a sense of what happened. That sort of work has been done particularly well in Berlin. Context is everything and it is not just about the bricks and mortar of the two or three houses in question here. The context is important, the laneways, thestreetscape, the approach, the atmosphere, the ambience and the night lighting. These all matter. I commend the recommendations that have come forward through this worthwhile debate and hope they contribute to a proper, appropriate and respectful restoration and memorial of the people of 1916.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach agus roimh coiste Sr&aacute;id U&iacute; Mh&oacute;rdha agus muintir cheannair&iacute; &Eacute;ir&iacute; Amach na C&aacute;sca 1916.  It gives me great pleasure to give my strong support today to the conservation of this site.  However, I am angry because this should have been done years ago and we should not be talking about it today.  We have talked the talk.  Let us now walk the walk and do the job.  I support the call by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for an early meeting with the relevant agencies.  I know and accept times are difficult, but this project is so important that people are prepared, even in these hard times, to bring this project to fruition.  I am confident they are prepared to put their hands in their pockets and not leave them there.</P>
        <P>The leaders of the 1916 Rising showed great vision and courage.</P>
     
        <P>They led the way.  They knew they would not win in the short term, but they paved the way for others to follow.  My late maternal uncle, Geoff McDermott, was one of those who fought <Col N="381"/>for independence at the time.  Members of this House, the D&aacute;il and Dublin City Council and the entire population must come together with a common objective to bring the project to fruition.</P>
        <P>As we approach the centenary of the founding of the State which was down to the great vision and courage of the people concerned, it is time we stopped talking and started walking.  Let the commemorative committee and all of the agencies involved lead the way and put in place once and for all a monument by conserving the site and turning it into a tourist attraction.  We would all justly be proud of such a project because the people it would commemorate gave their lives in order that we would have a tomorrow.  We owe it to them.  Many have left the country &mdash; emigration is part of our culture.  I am a returned emigrant.  There would be no better reason to come to Dublin than to visit the site, if it was suitably preserved in a way that could be agreed by all of the agencies concerned.  Let us stop talking and do something about it because it is high time this was done.  We can all find ways and means to procrastinate.  There has been a policy of procrastination regarding the site.  It is past time all of the agencies concerned should have got together to work on a monument of which we could all be proud.  People would be prepared to make a positive contribution to the project and I am one of them.  It is time we stopped talking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the relatives of some of those who fought in 1916 and gave their lives for the country.  Thomas Davis who was from Mallow would be proud today that a fellow Corkman was elected leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  In his famous song, &ldquo;A Nation Once Again&rdquo;, he wrote the line, &ldquo;three hundred men and three men&rdquo; to describe how the Greeks had taken on the Persians.  As far as the British were concerned, Easter Monday 1916 was expected to be an ordinary day, but it turned into an extraordinary day in Irish history.  The men and women concerned took on an empire which was bigger than the Roman Empire, controlled the lives of 25% of the world&rsquo;s population and had command of one quarter of the surface of the planet.  They took on an army which, by the time the First World War had ended, comprised the Commonwealth nations and allies throughout the world, including South Africa.  The empire could mobilise an army of 17 million.  The odds against the men and women of 1916 were 11,000/1.  On that ordinary day these extraordinary men and women dealt a fatal blow to an empire which was larger than the Roman empire.  It marked the beginning of the end of British rule not only in Ireland but also throughout the world.  It gave others belief that they too could attain freedom.</P>
        <P>Last Friday, 21 January, was the anniversary of both the sitting of the First D&aacute;il and the beginning of the War of Independence.  I stated on the Order of Business that it was a sad reflection on the House that both events would go unmarked.  That is why we are struggling to preserve the buildings on Moore Street and still wondering what we will do with the GPO which is still being operated as a post office.  How is the headquarters of the 1916 Rising still a post office as we approach its centenary?  Last week I stated it was a sad reflection on all parties in the House that that was the case.  We have failed to commemorate the centenary of the beginning of the War of Independence.  The French have Bastille Day, while the Americans celebrate Independence Day on 4 July, but we do not even commemorate what happened on Easter Monday 1916 properly.</P>
        <P>The proposal to preserve 14-17 Moore Street is laudable, but Fianna F&aacute;il has been in government for a long time and it has failed to do this.  It is to the shame of my party that that is the case and we are still debating the issue in the dying days of the Government.  However, this is one of a number of proposals in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office which I hope will see the light of day.  I also hope the abomination of a proposal for the development of an area around Moore Street which signifies the last remnants of the Celtic tiger will not come to fruition, but I am afraid it <Col N="382"/>might through a failure of the Government to properly transform the area and the GPO.  There is a proposal from Cloughjordan regarding the establishment of a centre to commemorate Thomas McDonagh.  Deputy Blaney and I proposed that the Tricolour flying over the GPO should be replaced every day and that every year 365 schools receive a Tricolour flown over the GPO until every school had one.</P>
        <P>Boston has an innovative tourist attraction called the Freedom Trail, a red brick walking trail.  A line of paint guides people through all of the historic sites between Boston Common and Bunker Hill.  I helped to draft a proposal that was placed before Dublin City Council and that is in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office, under which we would develop a 1916 trail using green paint and bricks and taking in historic sites such as Wynn&rsquo;s Hotel where the Irish Volunteers force was founded, Liberty Hall, St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and the GPO, finishing on Moore Street where Padraig Pearse surrendered.</P>
        <P>It is a privilege to have the relatives of those who died in the Rising present.  I hope in the fullness of time and before the centenary we will honour their memory.</P>

I recall two years ago we had a debate on the relocation of the Abbey Theatre to the Carlton site.  I know the area well because I was a member of Dublin County Council between 1985 and 1989.

	<P>I support the proposal and want to ensure the preservation order is endorsed.  When I was a county councillor based in Rathfarnham many moons ago, Rathfarnham Castle was bought by a developer.  At the time we made a big push in the former Dublin County Council to prevent the developer developing the site.  An agreement was made that Rathfarnham Castle would be preserved and that a land swop would be arranged with the developer.  That is where it is at.  I hope members of Dublin City Council will think along those lines because we have an opportunity to preserve our national heritage.</P>
        <P>I welcome the family members of the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation.  I am delighted to be associated with the project which I wish to see brought to fruition.  I refer to the entire site, including the Carlton site and the relocation of The Abbey.  We have a golden opportunity to make it a national monument.  That would enhance the entire area.  As a former member of Dublin County Council and knowing the area so well I would be delighted to endorse the preservation order, which I hope will come to fruition and that we will be able to preserve the site.</P>

	<P>I speak in support of this serious and important matter raised by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; who tabled the motion.  I endorse what was said by Senators Ormonde, Glynn, Daly and colleagues on the other side of the House.  Most of us in this House are born to a tradition of the men and women of 1916.  I recently read a magnificent book published by the Office of Public Works which outlined in minute detail the experiences of four reverend gentlemen who were very much associated with everything that happened to the men and women of 1916 from the Easter Rising until their death.  There is no more important issue as far as I am concerned than to preserve the building in Moore Street.</P><Col N="383"/>
        <P>I am a Member of this House for approximately 30 years.  On only two occasions did I sign an objection for planning.  I spent my life trying to help families get planning permission in their places of birth in particular, but I had no difficulty in signing the objection when asked by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and other Oireachtas colleagues from the D&aacute;il.  I know the area very well.  I am a long time in business in the north inner city of Dublin.  My family runs a lot of businesses in the area.  Now is a timely opportunity for us as Members of the Oireachtas and guardians of the Constitution on behalf of the men and women who created and gave it to us to honour the men and women of 1916.  I have no difficulty in doing anything I can to help the Minister and the departmental officials who all wish to help with the important proposal before us.  Regardless of where we are after the next general election, in opposition or in government, I will support whatever moves are made in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The year 2016 is only five short years away.  It would be wonderful to celebrate the 100th anniversary with something meaningful being done on this historic site.  On 29 April 1916 these men had to make the most difficult decision in their lives.  They did it in the interest of saving the lives of many others.  In the course of their actions they gave their own lives.  To give one&rsquo;s life for that particular cause is the greatest sacrifice anyone can make.  Those men and women are the heroes.  Their actions have led to our commitment to public life.  My commitment to public life is very small compared to the sacrifices of the men and women of 1916.  I thank the committee for attending the debate.  It is uplifting to be present in the Chamber with the relatives of the men and women of 1916.</P>
        <P>Looking back on the past 30 years, the other important occasion on which I was moved was the re-interment in Glasnevin Cemetery of Kevin Barry and his comrades who gave their lives for this country.  We are very proud of what they have done.  We will never forget them and we hope not to allow future generations to forget them either.  I doubt many Oireachtas Members would have made the sacrifice they did in the name of Ireland.</P>

        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; vividly outlined the background and painted a picture that encompassed the views of many other Members who spoke.  I compliment him on that.  He suggested it would be appropriate at this time that the members of the Save 16 Moore Street Committee should meet the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  When the House suspended in the course of the debate I used the opportunity to progress the suggestion.  I am pleased to confirm that I have arranged for a meeting on Tuesday, 1 February between the committee, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Protection.  The time and location of the meeting will be conveyed to the committee in the coming days.  It is important the committee is closely involved in the work of the 1916 centenary committee with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Protection &mdash; I do not need to elaborate on his connection with the most important event in our history.</P>
        <P>I did not get an opportunity previously to refer to the contribution of Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on the re-interring of so many people from Mountjoy Prison and the important part he allowed my county to play in that event with the re-interment of Paddy Moran.  We very much appreciate that and the recent book written by his niece launched in Kilmainham Gaol.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Today&rsquo;s debate has been important.  Speakers have committed to the public record what they believe should happen.  Much thought and sincerity were put into what was said.  I hope the <Col N="384"/>meeting I have arranged for Tuesday next will be a step towards completing what will be an important event in 2016.  Nobody should feel excluded on account of anything that happened subsequent to 1916.  We should all reflect on the fact that what happened in 1916 preceded any of the other events, unfortunate though they may have been, and that we can all, as a free people, embrace the centenary in a wholesome way, irrespective of what political party or allegiance we have, and have a meaningful remembrance, whatever form it will take.</P>
