	<P>I have received notice from Senator Thomas Byrne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to discuss the position of Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan, particularly in the context of the accident and emergency and orthopaedic services on offer there.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is proposed to take No. 1, motion regarding the approval by Seanad &Eacute;ireann of the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2011, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion regarding the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, to be taken without debate; No. 3, motion regarding the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council regarding the mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters, to be taken without debate; No. 4, motion regarding the proposal for a Council decision on the signature of the agreement between the European Union and Australia on the transfer and processing of passenger name record data, to be taken without debate; No. 5, motion regarding the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Union and Australia on the transfer and processing of passenger name record data, to be taken without debate; No. 6, statements, questions and answers on agriculture and fisheries, to commence at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 2.15 p.m., with the statements and questions on agricultural matters to conclude no later than 1.15 p.m. &mdash; following the Minister&rsquo;s opening remarks questions will be taken in turn, with group spokespersons to be called first and the same format will apply during the subsequent discussion on fisheries; No. 7, Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2011 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at 3 p.m. and conclude not later than 5 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes and the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than 4.55 p.m.; No. 8, Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2009 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il</i>] &mdash; Report Stage, to <Col N="670"/>commence at the conclusion of Private Members&rsquo; business and conclude not later than 9 p.m., if not previously concluded; and No. 18, motion No. 4, Private Members&rsquo; business, to be taken at 5 p.m. and conclude not later than 7 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and his wife on the arrival of their new son, R&iacute;ain.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been adding to its numbers in recent weeks and should keep going in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach is due to attend tomorrow&rsquo;s emergency summit of EU leaders.  We wish him and the Government well in their endeavours in respect of this important meeting.  I am particularly concerned that European leaders have spent the past four months dealing with, in effect, a crisis in the eurozone.  They have been operating in a piecemeal fashion and we are no closer to a resolution.  I was concerned at the Taoiseach&rsquo;s indication yesterday that he has not held a single bilateral meeting in the four-month period since the Government was formed.  In other words, he has not met any of his European counterparts individually to put forward Ireland&rsquo;s case.</P>
        <P>We are consistently told that efforts are being made to secure a reduction in the interest rate on the bailout.  I have always maintained that the importance of such a reduction is greatly overstated, as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, acknowledged.  However, it is important that, rather than merely talking about it, we do our best to put the issue to bed.  I wish the Taoiseach well in his endeavours.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given that the Lower House is not sitting next week and will not sit this Friday to discuss the outcome of the European summit, will the Leader set aside time next week and invite either the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance or the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Chamber for a discussion on the eurozone crisis?  This issue will affect every citizen of the European Union, including the Irish citizens who we in this House represent.  Unless the Union moves with far greater haste than it has heretofore, we will have a crisis on our hands and no mechanism to deal with it.  This Chamber, and the expertise therein, can play an important role in this.  Time should be set aside next week to discuss the outcome of the European leaders&rsquo; meeting and Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for dealing with the debt crisis and a possible debt restructuring which must be on the table.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join in congratulating Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh and his family on their new arrival.  </P>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the new format announced by the Leader for today's discussion with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  A question and answer session has the potential to be far more productive than the traditional set-piece speech by the Minister. </P>
        <P>I welcome the appointment of Mrs. Justice Susan Denham as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  Mrs. Justice Denham has a great track record of reform and will be a popular and worthy choice.  It is also something of note that she will be the first woman to serve as Chief Justice in the State.  In the context of that welcome announcement, I ask the Leader for a debate in the next term on the proposed referendum on judicial pay about which there has been a great deal of controversy.  This House has a worthwhile role to play in debating the appropriate wording of the referendum proposal on reductions in judges&rsquo; pay.  I took a view when the issue was first mooted some time ago that it was not necessary under the Constitution to have an amendment in order to reduce judicial pay if it were done as part of a public sector <Col N="671"/>levy or tax.  Several lawyers agreed with that interpretation, but the then Attorney General took a different view, as does the current Attorney General.</P>
        <P>Given that a referendum is now promised, we must be careful to ensure the wording is tight enough to safeguard any abuse or singling out of the Judiciary.  There is not much public sympathy for judges in respect of the reported opposition to the referendum, but it is important that we get the wording right.  This House could play a useful role in debating the appropriate wording.  That debate might include a review of the 2009 Private Members&rsquo; Bill introduced in opposition by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, in which he put forward a much tighter wording than that currently being circulated.  This is an important issue regarding the separation of powers and the role of the Judiciary within State structures.  We must have a comprehensive, careful and informed debate.  This House is a suitable forum for such a debate and it should take place in early September.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I too take the opportunity to congratulate Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh on his new addition.  Here is another child whose rights we must fight for and I assure the Senator we will continue to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I echo what Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien said in regard to the European leaders&rsquo; summit.  I am extremely concerned, as are many citizens, at the way in which the European Union has dragged its feet and has not taken the necessary decisions to address the crisis.  The latest signals are not encouraging in advance of tomorrow&rsquo;s summit.  When the Heads of State meet at an EU leaders&rsquo; summit, we expect action.  We should send a clear message in this regard.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Ivana Bacik in congratulating Mrs. Justice Susan Denham&rsquo;s appointment as the first female Chief Justice in the history of the State.  She is an excellent role model and it is encouraging that the two most senior legal positions in the State are now occupied by women.  We are in safe hands for the future.</P>
        <P>We have taken a welcome step forward in the provision of a new national children&rsquo;s hospital with the Minister&rsquo;s approval of submissions of plans to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I was very much involved in the debate on the location of the new hospital and have come to the position that we need a national children&rsquo;s hospital and must put our full support behind it.  This House must do everything it can to support that process, notwithstanding the many obstacles that will undoubtedly be put in the way.</P>
        <P>I remind Members of the Private Members&rsquo; motion my colleagues and I will put forward this evening on the important issue of the social, personal and health education programme in schools.  This programme incorporates the relationship and sexuality education programme which, despite being a mandatory part of the curriculum, evidence suggests many schools are failing to implement.  I encourage Members to contribute to the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the congratulations to Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  One of the happy benefits of the new arrival is that the Senator will no doubt pass on his beautiful and fluent Irish, thus helping to underpin the future of our language.</P>
        <P>I also join other speakers in welcoming the appointment of Mrs. Justice Susan Denham as Chief Justice.  It is a remarkable advance and part of the incremental progress we have made since the election of Ms Mary Robinson as President.  I have known Mrs. Justice Denham since we were colleagues in Trinity College.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the Leader can assist me in respect of an issue of which I became aware only by coincidence when I visited County Kerry last weekend to see the former residence in Derrynane of Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, a man I admire greatly.  On Valentia Island I was approached by local people who are concerned about the closure of their local hospital.  I do not usually deal <Col N="672"/>with the issue of the closure of individual hospitals but this is a particular instance involving a small community facility.  I intend to raise the issue on the Adjournment, but there will be no coverage of that and it is an issue that needs to be covered.  Throughout the country and Europe, the system is being put above the people, which is the wrong approach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A report was commissioned by the former Minister for Health, Ms Mary Harney, on the impact of the fair deal arrangements on community-supported hospitals.  Before that, there were three categories of facilities, namely, private hospitals, State hospitals and community supported hospitals.  The latter were greatly disadvantaged by the decision to subsume them into the private hospitals category.  The facility on Valentia Island houses some 20 people.  I met every single one of them and was very moved to observe how the community is rallying around them.  They are all of considerable age, one of them being 100 years old.  If these people are transferred to three hospitals up to 100 km away, the community will be devastated and one of the last remaining institutions on the island will be removed by the Government.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;500,000 was recently invested in the hospital and the cost to the Exchequer of closing it will be twice as great as the cost of maintaining it.  It is an insane book-keeping exercise.  Are we going to put communities, like the community on Valentia Island, first?  Are we going to allow them to visit their older people?  Even people who have no relatives &mdash; there are very few of them &mdash; are accommodated within this community.  I saw it myself and was greatly moved by it.  I will raise the matter, with full facts and figures, on the Adjournment, but I am asking the Leader to give me some information on the status of the inquiry initiated by the former Minister, Ms Harney.  It would help me to make the case on behalf of an island community which deserves our support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With regard to Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s comments on the so-called bailout &mdash; this is not a criticism &mdash; in my young days in Haggardstown a bailout was when one got &pound;20 from a friend when one was stuck.  When one gave it back two or three weeks later, one gave the friend &pound;20, not &pound;26.  Our so-called bailout is a stitch up.  We must&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;get the interest rate reduced.  We must reduce it from 5.9% to the approximate cost of interest, which is 2.9%.  That would be an assistance.  Otherwise it is moral hazard.  The European Union must face the fact that it is part of the moral hazard or there could be worse down the tracks for it if it does not support the countries.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Dundalk Outcomers &mdash; the organisation of the gay, lesbian and transgender community in Dundalk that recently celebrated gay pride week in a series of events &mdash; for the manner in which this organisation has highlighted the concerns of and promoted the welfare of the gay, lesbian and transgender community.  These courageous people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No, this is very important.  I am addressing my remarks to the Leader.  If we are to establish a true republic in the 21st century, we need to support and affirm diversity and move away from the closed society which has caused so many problems for our country.  This organisation has asked me to pass on its members gratitude and admiration to the Members of this Seanad who have supported amendments on the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 in favour of equal treatment for civil partners and the taxation changes in the Finance (No. 3) Bill 2011.  This Seanad can be used as a forum for the new republic and I ask the Leader to bear that in mind when framing the debates in the Chamber.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with many of Senator D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s comments on Europe and on GLEN, The Gay + Lesbian Equality Network.  I told the IFA last night that last summer I indicated to GLEN that it surpassed the IFA in the professional approach it took to campaigning and lobbying.  While I have reservations about civil partnership legislation, I think the acceptance of diversity is good, but the primacy of marriage needs to be emphasised, in a society where values such as that are being undermined continuously and often unintentionally by the State acting in a way that leads to dysfunction in sections of society.</P>
        <P>I support the Leader and the other Senators who spoke on the Europe Union.  I mentioned last week there is a dearth of leadership in Europe, both in the economic and financial structures, including the ECB and also at political level.  It is unconscionable that almost three years into the most significant economic and financial collapse that we have seen in our lifetime, the greatest since the 1930s, we see the same replicated today.  We grew up learning in awe about how bad the 1930s were and the number of people of Wall Street who committed suicide as a consequence of the losses at that time.  There is a dearth of leadership in the United States and we should have a debate in this House on it.</P>
        <P>To think of the ongoing partisan politics in Washington in a situation where the American fiscal position is almost, if not, insolvent.  I think we should ask not just for a slicing of the interest rate, but a significant reduction.  There should be a small margin on the base rate.  As I said before, Mr. Michael Soden was the first person I heard indicating the depths of the likelihood of the collapse we were facing in June 2008.  He said recently that what we need is 20 to 30 year loans.  We need to articulate that.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Finance has not come to the House for a real incisive debate when we have the capacity and capability to enlighten it and to enhance the decisions and the approach of the Minister and his Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I too had the pleasure of attending the IFA showcase of Irish Food and the expo of Irish Food.  I am surprised that there are so many here this morning, it was so appealing.  The Taoiseach made an excellent speech at the showcase, he reminded us of the critical importance of the agri-sector and of artisan and small producers to the economic recovery.  At that event, Ms Darina Allen, who is from Cullahill, County Laois, made the point that everyone, particularly those of us in Leinster House, should try to support Irish producers and their produce at every opportunity.  I was also glad to see two Laois artisan producers, G&rsquo;s Gourmet Jams from Ballinakill and Rossmore Farmhouse Ice Cream from Rathdowney being part of the showcase.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do.  We learned of a downside at that function.  Many of the producers we met last night raised the shocking situation where many of them and others around the county are left severely out of pocket due to the closure and subsequent buy out of Superquinn by another company.  In fact, the estimates range from &euro;28 million up to &euro;100 million.  I call on the Leader to raise this issue as a matter of urgency with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, because more jobs will be lost this week, in what I believe was sharp practice and shoddy work.  Superquinn did not close down overnight.  This was a planned close down and the purchase and buyout was not something that happened over 24 hours.  In fact, 90 days credit was squeezed out of these small producers and I understand from talking directly to them, that some of them are owed anything from &euro;35,000 <Col N="674"/>up to amounts ranging into the millions.  They cannot sustain that.  Some of them are in tears today.  They are shattered because their own businesses will now go to the wall.  I believe the banks had a role to play in this because they clawed back what was owed to them over the 90 days.  If this kind of sharp practice continues it will put people out of business.  Most small Irish producers and companies cannot sustain that loss in terms of their cash flow.  It is wrong that cheques were issued to these businesses on Friday by people who knew they could never be cashed.</P>

	<P>The Senator has made his point.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator  &Oacute; Clochartaigh and his wife on their new arrival.</P>
        <P>I concur with previous speakers in respect of the calls that gave been made consistently for both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance to come into this Chamber.  We will be shortly going into recess but I hope the Leader of the House would reflect on the demands that have been made by Members from across the political spectrum and from the independent groups for either the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade or the Taoiseach to come to the House.  The EU summit is taking place this week.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the Italians, the Greeks and the Portuguese have done a far better job of negotiating on behalf of Ireland than the leaders of this country, which is appalling.  Perhaps it would be more appropriate if the ambassadors of those countries would attend the House.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill is before the D&aacute;il.  Bills have been tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il and I ask if the Government will support these Bills.  They were tabled because of the vacuum following the High Court ruling in respect of JLCs.  The previous Government introduced a similar Bill and, in consistent form, spoke from both sides of its mouth by introducing the Bill but leaving it on Second Stage.  There is a fear on the part of the trade union movement that something similar will happen to the Bills introduced yesterday in the D&aacute;il.  This is an important issue and we must protect vulnerable workers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The EU pensions directive has not been implemented by this State.  Like me, the Leader is from Waterford and he will be aware of what happened to the Waterford Crystal workers.  Thousands of them were left without adequate compensation and redundancy but also without pensions.  The failure of the State to implement the European pensions directive, and the fact that the previous Government supported the British Government in the Robins<i> v.</i> Secretary of State for Work and Pensions case is a disgrace.  Many workers may find themselves in the same position as the Waterford Crystal workers.</P>
        <P>The workers&rsquo; union, Unite, is taking the Government to the European courts and I hope it wins its case.  There is a strong legal argument to suggest it will.  In advance of that, the Government should do the decent thing by implementing the European directive and making sure the Waterford Crystal workers are properly compensated for what happened to them because of the failure of the Government to act.  I hope there will be time put aside to discuss the directive, its implications and the need for this country to implement the full terms of the European pensions directive.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do, and it concerns funding from banks.  Someone who contacted me this morning has secured a grant from BIM to expand his shellfish business.  This grant accounts for 50% of the sum yet he cannot secure the other 50% from the bank and so he cannot expand his business and create more employment.  I assure the Leader that BIM would not grant funding to the company if it was not viable.  However, the banks cannot see fit to match the funding.  I ask the Leader and the Minister to do everything they can to secure funding for small businesses that are creating jobs.  Something must happen soon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Whelan raised a related issue.  Is there a code of practice in place for receivers when a business goes into receivership?  I know of one business in my locality that has been in receivership for 15 months.  The business has not been closed for a single day in the time the receiver has been <i>in situ</i>.  Another business in my locality was closed down on the first day of receivership, two months ago.  Is there direction for receivers when they take over a business in terms of how they delegate and carry out their functions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join my colleague from County Kerry in seeking a discussion on Valentia hospital.  Senator Norris is welcome to come back tomorrow evening to attend a meeting in Valentia about the future of the hospital.  This boils down to the famous, all-powerful organisation HIQA that seems to write reports or, in the case of Roscommon, not write reports.  This is then used by the HSE and the Government to justify the unjustifiable.  Regarding Valentia hospital, HIQA has provided a timeline to meet standards that we do not need and that are too expensive.  It is like telling everyone in the country they can only drive a Lexus or a Mercedes.  The people of Valentia have a hospital that is fit for purpose and it does what it needs to do.  HIQA and the HSE want to close it down and reduce the number of beds.  Everyone must have a private room and every room must be <i>en suite</i>, even though most people are not capable of using the <i>en suite</i> facilities because of their age.  However, HIQA insists on it, showing there is no relationship between reality and practicality and standards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have no doubt Senator Sheahan will be at the meeting tomorrow night.  The hospital is necessary on the island as Caherciveen hospital has a reduced number of beds available because of HIQA.  Otherwise, people will be required to travel to Killarney, which is an hour and 20 minutes away depending on how fast or slow one drives.  We should have a plethora of Ministers available to us next week when they have finished their duties in the D&aacute;il and we look forward to seeing them all addressing these issues in the Chamber.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I congratulate Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh on the birth of his baby.  </P>
	<P Just="Left">On the Adjournment yesterday evening I raised the issue of the pan-European emergency telephone number for missing children, 116000.  The reply from the Minister of State was detailed and a commitment was given but without outlining a timeframe.  Perhaps the Leader can ascertain the timeframe for the number being introduced to this country. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with my colleague, Senator Sheahan, on his comments on the banks and the code of ethics and the code of practice for receivers.  I go further by saying we need to review company law in this country.  Examiners have been appointed to companies for justifiable reasons, in order to save jobs, and this has worked in a number of cases.  However, my problem is where there is a write-down of debt of some 85%-90% and after 12 or 18 months the company is profitable and the people who suffered the 85%-90% write-down get nothing.  The directors of these companies pay themselves bonuses and dividends.  There must be a review of company law.</P><Col N="676"/>
        <P>There should be an examiner system in this country and it has worked well but when a company returns to buoyancy and makes money, there should be a reasonable expectation that the company honours the debts written down by the examiner.  I would like the Leader to speak to the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the House that an important person in Irish medicine passed away this morning.  Professor James Fennelly was the first medical oncologist, founder of cancer medicine in Ireland, who I am sure treated the relatives of many Members of this House.  Not only was he the first but for 15 years he was the only medical oncologist in the Republic of Ireland.  I could not let the occasion pass without paying a brief tribute to the memory of this fine man and to pass on my best wishes to his family.</P>
        <P>I would also like to congratulate Mrs. Justice Susan Denham who brings to her new appointment as Chief Justice a wonderful curriculum vitae and track record.  I am not being ungallant but I note that she is in her 65th year and I am delighted to see further evidence, as we saw yesterday with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, of the folly of our current position of forcing highly talented and productive people in many areas of Irish life to arbitrarily step down from being productive members of society and become dependants of the State overnight merely because they have reached a chronological number.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health when he comes to this House for his much anticipated visit if he will devote a few minutes to the vexed issue of medical education.  I am sorry if I sound like a broken record on this issue but I refer to the accounts in the newspapers this morning of a fitness to practice hearing of the Medical Council in which a young doctor from a European medical school, who was noted by her senior colleagues while at work in a hospital in the jurisdiction of our Republic to have exhibited evidence of deficiencies in basic medical knowledge and when subjected to an informal assessment was found to have gross levels of deficiency, such that the Medical Council has sanctioned that doctor.  The full scale of the sanctions are not yet known.  I do not wish to appear to victimise this individual doctor.  The failure is not the doctor&rsquo;s; it is ours.  We are about to embark on this great experiment of bringing in hundreds of foreign doctors to a new and as yet untrained acute assessment system to plug the gaps in a country whose health service has more medical schools per head of population than any country in Europe.  If we are to deal with the many problems of our health service it is essential that we deal with the fundamentals of health service reform in the term of this Oireachtas and not in some putative future Oireachtas when there could be a different Government.  Also, we must finally turn the focus onto the need to fundamentally reform medical education and training in this country.</P>
        <P>I join my colleagues in congratulating our other colleagues on the new arrivals.  It is wonderful.  Nothing is more important than having children.  One of the unanticipated truths of the peace process was the notion that we all now believe we should make love, not war.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Last week we had a very good debate on the unfinished housing estates which are a blight on the countryside throughout the length and breadth of the Twenty-six Counties.  During that debate a number of issues were raised by me and other colleagues, including a question on the number of those estates that are owned and run by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  The answer was 28, and a number of colleagues and I urged the Minister to make contact with NAMA to ensure it provided funding to secure those estates on a health and safety basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Willie Penrose, who kept his word and within a few days ensured that NAMA provided over &euro;3 million to clean up the mess in those 28 estates and secure them for the families and their children living in them.  The Minister of State took this House seriously and ensured that the views of the elected representatives in this House were heard.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I thank Members for their kind words.  I will send their good wishes to Mali and the children.  We have had a good deal of negative discussion on the area of health but I want to thank all the staff in the University College Hospital Galway who treated us fantastically in the past few weeks.  They were very much under pressure but the front line staff were fantastic and treated us in a wonderful way.</P>
        <P>That was juxtaposed at a meeting I attended last night, and this refers to a question I want to raise with the Leader, when I met a group of parents of children with special needs.  It brought home to me how lucky we are that we have healthy children.  The frustration being experienced by those parents requires a specific debate on the area of special needs but the conundrum the Leader might find himself in is in regard to the Minister he should ask to come into the House.  That is the problem for those parents.  They are trying to deal with a number <Col N="678"/>of organisations, including State and semi-State run organisations and voluntary groups.  They are dealing with the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health, county councils, etc.  They are frustrated and are at the end of their tether.  They told me terrible stories of mistreatment, treatment not being made available, promises broken and a quality of service that is not up to scratch.  I call for a specific debate on the area of special needs and disability.  I ask that it not be included as part of a broader debate on health issues because it is an area requiring specific discussion.  I am aware there is a great deal of expertise in this House on that area so ba maith liom glaoch ar son sin.  Ba mhaith liom freisin, mar an duine a d&rsquo;iarr go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ann maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; iascaireachta, f&aacute;ilte mh&oacute;r a chur roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht inniu.</P>
        <P>I am grateful that we will have the debate later on fisheries but I am disappointed the debate will be limited to an hour because there are many issues in the area of fishing.  That is the reason I called for a specific debate on it.  It remains to be seen whether an hour is long enough for the debate but if it turns out that it is not, we should allot more time to debate the wider range of issues that will be highlighted.</P>
        <P>I welcome the debate, however, and the new format.  It is welcome that the CPP is taking a number of ideas on board and trying different things.  I hope it will give all Members of the House an equal opportunity to take part in the debate and ask questions because the Sinn F&eacute;in delegation found it difficult at times, even with an ever-increasing mandate, to contribute at the end of debates when our time is limited.  We hope today will show that the format can be changed and things can be improved.</P>
        <P>We were promised at one stage that we might be allowed bring forward a Private Members&rsquo; Bill during this term.  I ask the Leader to clarify whether that will happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have raised the issue of acmhainn&iacute; n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha, natural resources, with the Leader on a number of occasions, and I am aware he has a full agenda of issues.  However, given the review being carried out on the licensing of gas and oil operations off the west coast, the issues associated with the Lough Allen basin and the issues arising over wind and wave energy, it is really important that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources be invited to the House in order that we can ascertain Government policy and determine how to ensure the natural resources of this country are used to the benefit of every citizen, agus gur f&eacute;idir linn a chinnti&uacute; go mbeidh na hacmhainn&iacute; n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha at&aacute; againn a &uacute;s&aacute;id ar mhaithe leis na p&aacute;ist&iacute; at&aacute; ag teacht an&iacute;os agus na gl&uacute;inte at&aacute; ag teacht in&aacute;r ndiaidh.</P>

	<P>Given that the two days we are to sit next week are the last two before the recess, I plead with the Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, to invite the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, to the Seanad next week.  The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Dinny McGinley, promised and the Taoiseach hoped this would be the most efficient Seanad ever.  As far as I am concerned, the most crucial issue in the country is that of jobs.  I have spoken about this non-stop.</P>
        <P>During the last recession, when Connie Doody and I started up Lir Chocolates, I saw how people were transformed when they moved from unemployment to having a job.  It is not just a question of money but about social intercourse and meeting people every day.  I saw people&rsquo;s self-confidence change in a matter of months when they were able to do a job successfully.  I understand from experience of not having a job what this is like.</P>
        <P>With regard to the points made by Senators Whelan and Sheahan on the Superquinn issue, we should have questions and answers on companies going into liquidation.  As I stated yester<Col N="679"/>day, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, is coasting on the good export figures.  The harsh reality, however, concerns what is happening to the suppliers of Superquinn.  So many domestic retail businesses are closing down and are in jeopardy because they do not have access to cash to keep running.  This is the harsh reality.  In general, we have a dynamic, capital-intensive export industry but the service and retail industries that do not export, because it is not part of their business, are in dire need of cash.  I want the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to advise the House on what he is doing to secure cash flow.</P>
        <P>I want to hear the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, state whether he is fighting passionately to renegotiate the terms of our own.  When my husband and I were young, we probably spent too much of what we borrowed from the bank.  We had to return to the bank and renegotiate to have the interest rate lowered.  I recall the great relief when it was lowered.  Imagine what it would be like for Ireland if its interest rate were lowered and the term of its loan were lengthened.  The rate and the term are holding us back.  Ireland is not Greece, Portugal or Spain and has a dynamic export sector, but it will have a very flat, dying domestic sector unless the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Finance take this issue by the scruff of the neck.</P>

We will, however, be very busy with legislation for a couple of days.  A considerable volume of legislation is being placed on the Order Paper of the House, and legislation is our first priority.  If it fits in with the schedules of the relevant Ministers, we will try to have them here.  Tuesday and Wednesday of next week will be fairly packed with legislation, however.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik called for a debate on a judicial pay referendum.  We can consider this during the next session.</P>
        <P>Senator van Turnhout referred to the support process for the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  We all agree that we must proceed with the project at this stage.  I note the Senator&rsquo;s comments on the SPHE programme.  The Private Members&rsquo; motion in this regard will be taken this evening.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to Valentia Island and fears over its residents&rsquo; county hospital.  I note his points in this regard and believe it appropriate that he is to raise the matter on the Adjournment at a later stage.

        <P>The HIQA requirements present a problem for practically every residential home and nursing home.  If, however, something went wrong in any of the hospitals or homes, we would all be up in arms in the House, but I agree the questions asked and red tape put in place by HIQA seem to be excessive.  I say this as one involved with a residential home in my city, Waterford.  The volume of red tape, the questions and vetting procedures are such that if every i is not <Col N="680"/>dotted, everything comes back to one.  While HIQA has a very difficult job to do, the issue of red tape will have to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Senator D&rsquo;Arcy referred to the bailout.  We are certainly learning an awful lot about Haggardstown in the House.  It seems to be a very interesting place.</P>

        <P>Senator Walsh called for the Minister for Finance to be invited to the House.  He was here yesterday but, on foot of the leaders&rsquo; discussions, he may be in a position to come here next week.  I am not sure.</P>
        <P>Senator Whelan referred to the IFA function.  We all agree the function last evening was a wonderful showcase for Irish food and food producers.</P>

        <P>I take on board Senator Whelan&rsquo;s points on Superquinn and the difficulties arising from its sale for suppliers and small businesses.  It is presenting great difficulties for the producers involved.  I hope some kind of settlement can be made to assist them.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane referred to the industrial relations Bill and the EU pensions directive.  Waterford Crystal workers were treated shabbily, and that is putting it very mildly.  I am sure the union is taking the Government to court over this, as the Senator stated.  I am sure we will be addressing this after the judgment.</P>
        <P>Senators Sheahan and Conway referred to the availability of credit.  I hope Mr. John Trethowan of the Credit Review Office will get involved in these issues and that the people suffering from a lack of credit will go to him to try to sort out their problems.  I stated yesterday the Minister for Finance had written to the banks seeking a report on a quarterly basis on the amount of credit they are giving to small businesses.  Credit for small and medium-sized businesses comprises the lifeblood of our economy.  I have no doubt this matter will be pursued by the Government.  The need for changes in company law is noted.</P>
        <P>Senator Crown called for a debate on the reform of medical education.  He referred to Professor James Fennelly who was the first and only medical oncologist in the country.  Many families throughout Ireland are very thankful to him for his work in this area over many years.  We are all grateful to Professor Fennelly and join in expressing our condolences to his family on his sad passing.</P>
        <P>Senator Wilson called for a debate on unfinished housing estates and his point is very good.  The point was made in the House to the Minister on the need for NAMA to provide funding for these unfinished housing estates.  I join with him in complimenting the Minister on grasping the nettle and ensuring NAMA will provide more than &euro;3 million to upgrade and finish unsightly unfinished housing estates in several areas of the country.</P>
        <P>I am sure we all join Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh in complimenting the front line staff at University College Hospital Galway.  He also called for a debate on special needs and disabilities.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, was in the House yesterday and he has agreed to return early in the autumn to speak on education and skills and spend a couple of hours taking part in a similar type of statements and questions and answers session which we will have today with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coveney.  We <Col N="681"/>shall see whether the hour suffices for the session with the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  If not, we can re-examine it.</P>
        <P>I understand the point Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh made about Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s speaking time but while it may have missed being included on possibly one or perhaps two occasions, if one looks at the record one will see it has had more speaking time than any other group in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator White called for the Minister for Finance to attend the House next week along with other Ministers, including Deputies Bruton and Reilly.  As I stated, legislation is our first priority but we will endeavour to bring some Ministers before the House.  I am not confident it can happen but we will see what we can do.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Does the Minister have a copy of his speech?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I have a speech with bullet points but I will speak in more general terms rather than reading a script because Members will find that more useful.</P>
        <P>I would like to map out the overall context in which I am planning an ambitious expansion of the food industry, increasing primary food production and adding value to raw products before they are exported from Ireland.  All of the growth in the food industry will be accommodated by increasing exports.  Up to 85% of all food currently produced is exported and we must persuade consumers or major purchasers to buy it.</P>
        <P>Food Harvest 2020, one of the good programmes put in place by the former Government, was drawn up by stakeholders in the industry including farmers, processors, large food companies, academics, my Department and its agencies.  This report has more credibility than some documents written by Departments because it is realistically based on what is commercially feasible, providing a good blueprint for growth and expansion in the food sector.  Food Harvest 2020 proposes to increase food output by 33%, although my personal view is that is an understatement of what will happen, and to add value to that food product in the region 40%.  If achieved, a significant number of jobs will be created in addition to wealth creation within the foodsector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The food sector is a good news story for the economy.  While there are some immediate pressures on many of the small food companies,  of which I hold an optimistic view, because of what has happened at Superquinn, there is a strong market outside of Ireland that we need to plan to service.  The economics underpinning this are simple.  In 1960, the world&rsquo;s population stood at 3 billion.  By 1990, that figure was 6 billion and now it is just under 7 billion.  Each week 1.5 million extra people are on the globe and they need to be fed.  Populations are moving from self-contained rural locations into urban ones and demanding to be fed in a different way.  Diets are shifting from being carbohydrate-based, such as rice and pasta, to protein-based, such as meat and dairy products, foods Ireland is good at producing.  These global trends in food demand will create many opportunities for protein-based food-exporting countries.</P>
        <P>Ireland, however, could miss the boat.  In the dairy sector due to the milk quota system in place since 1984, New Zealand has overtaken the entire EU in milk trading.  In 2000, New Zealand had 19% of the global dairy market while the EU had 38%.  In 2012, New Zealand will have 27% of that market while the EU will have 24%.  In 1983, New Zealand produced the same amount of milk Ireland did.  Now, it produces three times more, some 16 billion litres, while Ireland produces 5.3 billion litres.  This highlights the growth potential in this sector.  Such growth in dairy output did not happen without some pain, however.  Supports for the dairy industry in New Zealand were removed overnight, causing much pain in the industry.  We need to learn lessons from this so that when the EU removes the milk quota in 2015, it will be able to provide for the transition.  It will be a new opportunity for growth and expansion for the dairy sector in volume and value terms and we must ensure we avail of it in a way that keeps the family-farm structure intact.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is an ambitious project, which we have a blueprint business plan to deliver, agreed by the industry and policymakers.  I am trying to provide the  political leadership to set quarterly targets to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s food sector is on the pathway to growth.  It will mean the dairy industry must prepare for significant expansion in volume production.  It is important the beef industry does not become the by-product of the dairy industry, particularly if suckler cow herds are not supported.  There is a danger as the excitement grows in the dairy sector that male calves will simply become its by-product.  Currently, half of the beef herd comes from the dairy sector and the other from suckler herds.  That balance must be keep intact to ensure Ireland <Col N="684"/>can target the high-end premium beef market abroad; that is the market at which suckler herd beef, as opposed to male calves from the dairy sector, is targeted.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P>We are trying to up-skill dairy farmers to ensure their farms are efficient and profitable within existing resources and the straitjacket of the quota system.  We have expanded and supported farmer discussion groups at which dairy farmers are paid to meet and share information on best practice about eight times a year.  The preliminary results of these meetings have been exciting.  The dairy farmers in question have seen between 2% and 5% improvement in their farms&rsquo; profitability, a significant figure in one year.  We want to put a similar discussion model in place for the beef sector.  When it comes to efficiency there can be a chasm between a good and not-so-good beef farmer.  While beef prices are strong, many of the suckler herd farmers are losing money and relying on grant payments &mdash; be they single farm payments, disadvantaged area payments, suckler cow premium scheme etc. &mdash; for their income.  We must move on from this.</P>
        <P>Regardless of what sector is in question, the Department is increasingly moving into the realm of trade.  I am trying to open up new business opportunities and trade partners for Irish agribusinesses.  Already I have promoted lamb exports to Jordan.  In the autumn, I will visit North Africa to open political doors for the expansion of an Irish dairy company there.  Several weeks ago, we signed a basic trade agreement with China and hope to be signing a memorandum of understanding on food trade.  My Department is not just responsible for agriculture and primary food production but also supports and assists the expansion of food trade between Ireland and other countries.  Last year, we sold &euro;3.6 billion of food to the UK.</P>
      
        <P>We also imported food worth &euro;2.7 billion from the United Kingdom, much of it liquid milk from Northern Ireland.  This valuable trade relationship with our nearest neighbour allows food producers to tap into a large population which this country lacks.  Ireland, North and South, is an island of 6 million people which produces sufficient food to feed 36 million people.  By 2020, we intend to produce enough food to feed 50 million people.  In light of population increases and demands for a different type of diet, an issue to which I alluded, I do not envisage any problems with market demand.</P>
        <P>How does European agricultural policy fit in with the issues I have raised?  Regardless of whether we like it, food production and farming are reliant on European policy.  For this reason, the Food Harvest 2020 plan must be in sync with European policy.  This gives rise to a number of dangers as limitations being imposed on Ireland could rein in the potential for growth and expansion in Food Harvest 2020.</P>
        <P>I propose to speak for a few moments on the Common Agricultural Policy because farmers would like to know what the current position is and what are the potential threats and opportunities of the CAP.  Until about six months ago, most people believed the budget available in the European Union to support the Common Agricultural Policy would be cut dramatically.  There was a strong political view, one I have never shared, that spending 40% of the European Union&rsquo;s budget on agriculture and the food industry did not make sense in the context of the many other challenges the Union faced.  The agricultural budget is the Union&rsquo;s only economic sectoral budget.  All other EU budgets provide support for domestic budgets, for instance, in research and development, regional policy, infrastructure development and so forth.  The European Union&rsquo;s agriculture budget is different, however, as it supports an industry by promoting food security and production in the EU.</P>
        <P>There has been a political realisation in Europe that the issue of food security, namely, investment to ensure the continent can feed itself in future, has moved up the food chain &mdash; Senators should excuse the pun.  Europe&rsquo;s reliance on food imports to feed consumers is <Col N="685"/>unsustainable.  For example, it is not sustainable to continue to import 70% of the fish consumed in the European Union.  Many of the countries from which we currently import will experience food crises in the not too distant future.  Events, such as the decisions by Russia and Argentina to effectively ban exports of grain and beef, respectively, will be repeated elsewhere.  Food producers in both countries are now required to supply the domestic markets before exports can take place.  The number of such cases will continue to increase in future and we will have more bilateral trade agreements such as those signed between Brazil and China.</P>
        <P>The assumption that Europe can simply import its additional beef requirements from Brazil does not make sense when one examines trends in the beef trade.  The European Union must move on from its luxury position of being able to produce as much food as it likes in a sustainable manner and import the rest from wherever it is available, whether chicken from Thailand or beef from Brazil.  The reason Europe must move on is that there will be competition to access food resources and food producing countries will have options available to them as to where they can sell their food.  We should not assume Europe will continue to enjoy current levels of buying power and dominance in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>This is the reason the Common Agricultural Policy is much different from the policy being debated ten or 15 years ago when the purpose of the CAP was to deliberately limit supply to keep prices for European food produce high.  That was the correct approach at the time given the higher cost of producing food in the European Union where traceability, animal husbandry, disease control and other standards and regulations are much more stringent than elsewhere.  The higher cost of producing the quality food we, in Europe, insist on having forced the European Union to create an artificial internal market for food in terms of price and value.  While this has been a successful approach, the economics of food have changed as a result of demand being driven up and food prices outside the European Union.  In some cases, external food prices now exceed food prices in the EU.</P>
        <P>The debate continues to focus on identifying how we can maintain price stability in the European Union to ensure primary producers are paid a fair price for their produce, the Union contributes to feeding the world and sufficient food is available for the population of the EU as it finds it more difficult to access food products on other markets.  The debate has changed owing to a growing realisation of the importance of food production.  Countries such as Ireland, which exports 85% of what it produces, predominately to other European countries, will have an important role to play in meeting the food security challenge facing the European Union.</P>
        <P>On 20 June, the first draft of the financial perspectives &mdash; essentially the European budget &mdash; for a seven-year period beginning in 2013 showed that the allocation of funds for the Common Agricultural Policy will remain more or less intact.  I would love to claim credit for this decision and say the new Government changed the position of the European Union on retaining the CAP budget.  However, it is the bigger picture that is changing the way in which the CAP budget is perceived.  Taking inflation into account, the budget will reduce in real terms year on year.  However, under the current proposals the amount Ireland will receive under the Common Agricultural Policy in terms of single farm payments and under the second pillar, which consists of support schemes such as the Leader programme, will be maintained in each of seven years covered by the CAP.</P>
        <P>I am reasonably pleased with the draft financial perspectives.  They are a good starting position.  Ireland will make a strong case for increasing the CAP budget, taking account of inflation, through the period of the next CAP and while an agreement to this effect has not yet been reached, we will fight for that position.  If an agreement on the draft financial perspectives for the Common Agricultural Policy had been done six or eight or 12 months ago, the starting <Col N="686"/>position would have been significantly worse because at that time the amount allocated for the Common Agricultural Policy was expected to be reduced by 25% or 30%.</P>
        <P>I will briefly refer to a number of issues arising from the Common Agricultural Policy and Senators may ask for greater detail in the question and answer session.  As there are many more member states in the European Union than at the time the previous policy was agreed, demands are correctly being made to have the funds available under the CAP redistributed.  In other words, some countries are doing much better than others under the current Common Agricultural Policy.  Central and eastern European countries, in particular, are demanding equalisation and refusing to agree a budget for the next CAP until such time as equalisation is provided.  There will, therefore, be a redistribution of funds from countries which are doing well from the budget to countries which are not doing so well because they have only recently joined the European Union.  Ireland agrees that this change is necessary and has done considerable work to produce an equation which would enable the Commission to measure how countries are faring in terms of the first pillar, that is, the single farm payment, and the second pillar, that is, other funding provided under the CAP.</P>
        <P>Essentially, what we have been proposing is that one should calculate single farm payment on the basis of eligible area.  This country is more or less on the mean or average payment.  It was slightly under it according to a calculation some months ago but more recently it was slightly over it in terms of current pillar one, single farm payments.  It does not appear that we are facing any significant shift out of this country to compensate countries that have not done as well traditionally.  That is good news, and it is testament to the good work of the economists in my Department who have worked hard to convince the Commission on how best to calculate who is doing well and who is not.</P>
        <P>The second and more sensitive issue for this country is redistribution of funds within member states.  A lot of countries now argue that we should forget the history of how single farm payment has been calculated and distributed and that we should simply give a payment on the basis of hectarage.  In simple terms, one would get a certain amount of money per hectare farmed to support one&rsquo;s income to reflect the fact that producing food in Europe is more expensive than producing food in other parts of the world.  That would cause considerable problems for this country because the way in which single farm payment has developed and is now calculated is based on previous headage payments, area payments for arable farmers and premium payments received by farmers.  The most productive farmers in this country generally get the most in terms of single farm payment.  One would see a significant redistribution of money from the productive agricultural areas in terms of yield per hectare to the less productive parts of the country in terms of supports.  Perhaps some people want that but it will generate a big debate within the agricultural community.</P>
        <P>What we are seeking at the moment is flexibility.  Once a national envelope of funds is decided by the European Commission, we seek that the Government be able to decide the most appropriate way to spend the money within the country to pursue the goals we have for agriculture and food production in terms of expansion, growth and added value as well as its social responsibilities to keep people on the land in parts of the country that do not have the capacity for growth and expansion, such as large parts of the disadvantaged area in the west, north west and south west.  I would like to have the flexibility to do that.  It would be totally inappropriate for the European Commission to decide how money is redistributed in this country.</P>
        <P>The other controversial element of the Common Agricultural Policy debate is what is called a &ldquo;greening element&rdquo;.  What the Commission is currently moving towards &mdash; we will see the colour of its money at the beginning of October when we have a draft document to consider <Col N="687"/>&mdash; is that single farm payment would be broken into two payments, that people would get two thirds of their payment automatically and they would get the remaining third as long as they were abiding by certain environmental standards for farming.  The Commission is developing an insistence on sustainable farming that is sympathetic in terms of climate change and sustainability arguments.  What we do not know currently is the threshold that will be put in place for farmers to meet in order to get their full payments but it appears that what many farmers currently do will qualify them for the payment.  For example, if one is a dairy farmer, a percentage of one&rsquo;s holding may have to be under permanent pasture because that is a good carbon sink.  If one is an arable farmer one may be required to have a rotation plan or a break crop between wheat, barley and other cereals, which is what many farmers do already.  What we have said to the Commission is that it should bring its greening proposals forward but it should keep them simple, make it simple to understand and simple for governments to enforce and it must also ensure it is not too expensive from the perspectives of time or bureaucracy for farmers or business people.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the time.  It is 12.15 p.m. and I wish to provide for a full hour of questions and answers.  The opportunities for this sector, despite the challenges we currently face for many food suppliers, is a very exciting one.  We have a basis for growth which has been put in place over many years.  We have some of the best food companies in the world with bases outside of this country.  They already have a foothold in many markets that can be the basis for expansion and growth in those markets.  We must build on that to ensure our primary producers, as well as the food companies that employ so many people, are given the opportunity to exploit the extraordinary growth in demand for the kind of premium foods we can produce on this island.  That can be a real driver of growth in the economy because of the number of people employed and the communities it supports.  We are talking about more than 200,000 people in that regard.</P>
        <P>I will speak in more detail about the fishing sector and the opportunities for seafood in due course.  I invite questions on the food and agrifood sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many questions to be asked.  The format we are adopting is a good one.  I thank the Minister for affording us the opportunity to ask questions in this format.  I will be as brief as I can.</P>
        <P>The Common Agricultural Policy is crucially important post-2013 to Irish agriculture.  The first goal that must be achieved is a guarantee that the envelope will be at least as great as the current envelope and that we get our equal share of that based on what we have achieved from 2007 to 2013.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the Commission giving member states more of a role in deciding how the budget is dispersed internally within member states.  Would it not be a good opportunity to give more scope to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to support areas that require additional support and areas that are not as viable?  There may be benefits <Col N="688"/>attached to working with the farming organisations.  I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s view on that.  Perhaps he could provide an update as well on the ongoing discussions at the European Council of Ministers meeting and whether he foresees further discussions on the decision on the allocation for each member state.</P>

As the Fine Gael spokesman on agriculture in the Seanad I wish to refer briefly to the 2020 strategy and the Common Fisheries Policy.  I compliment the IFA on its food showcase last night.  It was a lesson for all of us on what we can do with Irish agriculture and food products.</P>

	<P>We are all on a learning curve.  Senator Comiskey is the next person to ask a question.  I apologise for interjecting but he should ask a supplementary question to the one asked by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill.  The Senator is the next person to ask a general question. I am seeking a supplementary question to the question Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked. The Minister will reply to that and we will then move on to another question.  Senator O&rsquo;Neill indicated that he had a similar question.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My questions relates to the future of the CAP.  The Minister recently had a meeting with Commissioner Ciolos.  Perhaps he would give us as much information as he can about that.  I am aware that as some of the information is sensitive, he cannot give us all of it, but could he give us an idea of what is emerging with regard to the CAP?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the CAP and the new agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, will the Minister explain why organic farmers are being treated differently, and less favourably, than other farmers, given that the organic farming scheme is not on a par with AEOS and thus not comparable?  Why does Ireland currently only have 1% of its land dedicated to organic farming when there is an EU-wide emphasis on organic farming as a sustainable and responsible production method?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I compliment the Leader on putting this format in place.  Questions are preferable to people making speeches; we will learn more.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the CAP and certain disadvantaged areas.  Will it be the Minister&rsquo;s policy to defend the payments in those areas?  In the eastern part of Ireland and even Cork, where the Minister and I are from, farmers receive larger payments.  Will those payments be defended or will there be a change whereby some of them could be moved to the disadvantaged areas?  The Minister referred in his statement to the 2013 to 2020 period.  Agriculture is the only sector in <Col N="689"/>the world that has not received an increase with inflation but the costs have increased in terms of fertiliser, fuel and other requirements.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement that he will try to get an increase related to inflation.  Perhaps he will comment on defending the payments in different areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">To deal with the last question first, we want to ensure that it is Ireland that decides how single farm payment money is distributed in future.  My preference would be to ensure that we keep payments as close as possible to where they are at present.  There is an argument, which has some currency, around consideration of recoupling some payments or some element of single farm payment, particularly in the beef sector.  I believe that suckler beef farming, in particular, needs support more than some other sectors at present.  We are examining whether it makes sense to make the case for the partial recoupling of some payments to support the beef sector.  However, the Senator can rest assured that I am certainly not advocating a wholesale redistribution of funds from one part of the country to the other.  That would cause carnage in Ireland and would mean the productive sector would be unable to reach the potential that it is being planned to meet.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s question about the financial envelope, we know what the starting position is.  It is a good starting position, given the context of where we are coming from.  When I was a Member of the European Parliament people were talking about halving the agriculture budget; therefore, the starting position is good.  We must ensure we can build on that.  There is also a series of other funds outside the CAP envelope that is available to the food sector in terms of research and development, exploiting new markets, research on climate change and food security, which is a huge issue on which I would love to answer questions.</P>
        <P>The basic CAP envelope is for single farm payment, pillar 2 money, regional development, rural development and so forth.  There is also a research budget, which is in a separate category.  It is a substantial budget that is now available to the agrifood sector.  It is time we started talking about the agrifood sector rather than talking about farming in isolation from the food industry.  We are successful in this area.  Whenever I speak, I talk about being a Minister with responsibility for agriculture, food and the marine.  This is a food industry that collectively must expand and grow.  When farmers produce a litre of milk, they must do so with the consumer in mind.  When they produce high quality beef cattle from a suckler herd, they do it because they will get more money because a consumer in some part of the world will pay more money for that meat.  This is about everybody in the food supply chain understanding that we need to be better than any other country at producing food because we must find a home outside Ireland for all the extra food we produce.  We do not have the luxury that other countries enjoy of having big domestic markets.  It is important to emphasise that point.</P>
        <P>We will know the Commission&rsquo;s CAP proposals in early October.  As regards the flexibility the Senator said was necessary, my view is that the initial draft is likely to contain a set payment per hectare and we will have a hell of a job changing that.  That is my anticipation at present but we are making strong representations to the Commission on that issue and I believe it understands our position.  There is a view among many new member states that historical payments such as single farm payment are almost a dirty concept, because they developed in a way that could never be possible in those states given that they did not have historical payments.  This is also about the education of some member states which were not historically part of the CAP.</P>
        <P>I met the Commissioner, Mr. Dacian Ciolos, for breakfast yesterday with a number of other Ministers.  He is a very approachable person and I believe he has a good understanding of agriculture in Ireland.  He is a slightly quieter than some of the other Commissioners, and does <Col N="690"/>not operate with the type of ego many of the Commissioners have.  However, he is actually quite effective and the proof of that is the result of the budget debate within the Commission.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames spoke about AEOS versus organic farm schemes.  AEOS is not about organic farming.  It is about encouraging commercial farmers and farmers who are farming on hillsides, such as in constituencies like the Senator&rsquo;s.  It is about giving them a payment in recognition of a change in farm practice that is in the interest of the environment.  The calculation of AEOS payments is based on the financial cost to the farmer of changing his farm practice to protect the environment.  Whether we take the route of supporting organic farming is a separate argument.</P>
        <P>Schemes such as the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and AEOS are about persuading farmers, whether they are involved in intensive production or farming in commonage areas, to farm in a way that is environmentally friendly.  We put the set of rules in place regarding the targets they must meet to get their payments.  Those rules must be approved by the European Union because 75% of funding for AEOS comes from the EU.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the organic policy is not as favourable financially as the AEOS.  That is my point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and we do not get as much money from the EU for it.  With regard to the 1% of land in Ireland being organically farmed, I would like to see that increased but that will be a commercial decision for farmers.  The price premium one can get for certain organic products, although not all products, will drive an interest in a certain amount of organic farming and I am happy to encourage that.  I believe I have answered most of the questions on the overall Food Harvest 2020 targets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the destocking of commonages which took place in 1998 and which, in many cases, was not necessary.  A review is taking place and I wonder if it could be speeded up in order that farmers in those areas would have an opportunity to get stock back on to the hills before the breeding season starts this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Michael Comiskey.  I refer to the gorse fires in west Donegal and other areas earlier this year.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, visited the areas and conceded that if sheep had been on the hills, the grass would not have been as attractive for fires.</P>
        <P>Traditionally, farmers who were asked to destock from the hills were paid &euro;240 per hectare under REPS.  They are now paid a fraction of that, &euro;75, under the agri-environment options scheme.  Can it be increased to &euro;150?  What attempts are being made in Europe to reach agreement on that?  Are there ongoing discussions to seek that agreement?  Will the agri-environment options scheme be reopened in 2012?  Regrettably, the budget was cut a little this year, even though it was provided for in the 2011 budget.  Some 10,000 places were agreed under the national recovery plan but we will not go over that ground.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="691"/>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief and will not be tempted into a debate on the agri-environment options scheme by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill because I know many other Senators want to ask specific questions.  A commitment was given in the budget last year for a new AEOS with a budget of &euro;50 million, which was not budgeted for.  That is a fact.  What was budgeted for was &euro;34 million, which was the cost of AEOS I.  I have had to put an AEOS II in place, on which we will spend approximately &euro;22 million or &euro;23 million, and I have had to finance that by making savings elsewhere.  They are savings people will see around budget time.  Some of them are pretty unpalatable but that is the reality.  It is important to put the record straight.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the destocking of commonage, it is important to state that understocking commonage areas can be as damaging to biodiversity, which is what drives this, as overstocking.  Hillsides in Ireland, as in other parts of Europe, rely on livestock in order to keep certain species down and to ensure weeds do not take over.  In some parts of the west what was previously grazeable farmland for hill sheep or hill cattle is now unfarmable because of understocking.</P>
        <P>That is why we are in the middle of an assessment of commonage areas to look at appropriate stocking rates.  The likely outcome of that is we will encourage farmers to increase stocking rates on hillsides, in some cases quite significantly.  I hope they will be able to do that and that may be a qualifying criteria for some of the payments which they may be eligible to draw down next year.  They may be required to increase stocking rates to encourage active farming and the responsible management of quite a sensitive environment on hillsides and mountainous commonage land.</P>
        <P>As regards increasing the AEOS payment for eligible land from &euro;75 to &euro;150, which was also a promise made previously without any grounds in terms of getting agreement from the Commission, I initially said that because I wanted to maximise the number of people who could get on to the AEOS, I would keep the payment at &euro;75 rather than increase it to &euro;150.  I have since met the IFA and a number of the farmers concerned and I said I would look at it again, which we are doing, in the context of our overall expenditure review.  If we are to prioritise giving a little bit more money to commonage areas, which are mature and are eligible for increased payment, and, most important, if we can get sanction from the European Commission to increase that payment, because 75% of it comes from it &mdash; even if I wanted to do this next week, I could not do so because we do not have that sanction &mdash; we will look at that in the context of the overall budget in terms of where we are trying to take agriculture and what areas we are trying to support even with the limited, shrinking budget.  That is as open as I can be about it.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for agreeing to be the canary in the mine in regard to all of this.  We had hoped for Minister&rsquo;s questions to be a routine part of our work.  I refer to the impasse in regard to Leader funding for small food projects such as those we saw in their magnificence last night in the Shelbourne Hotel and previously at a Tesco function.  I know there is an impasse and that it is difficult but I have been asked about it over and again by various companies, specifically in regard to the so-called food tent at the ploughing championships which appears to have fallen victim also.  The Minister expressed enormous support for the food industry, which is very welcome, but the specialist food industry must also have support.  In a sense, this seems to have arisen almost by accident.</P>
        <P>I refer to the environmental impact assessment.  I received the Minister&rsquo;s briefing note this morning, specifically in regard to the reduction of drainage from 20 hectares to 0.1 hectares.  There is much concern among farmers in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is primarily on food production.  I welcome the Minister and I am delighted to take part in this debate.  The food production side is always of great concern to me.  I am a chef by trade &mdash; that is my background.  I am a small producer in Shannon.  I do not have time to find markets or to access the world market so who gets it to the world stage to showcase it in terms of tasting, sampling and identifying a market?</P>
        <P>In a pre-budget submission, the ICMSA identified a trillion dollar market in the US for ready meals.  Do we have somebody over there saying the American market wants 100 million pizzas next year and that this what we need to get to the market?  Who is doing that work?  Have we a co-ordinated research and development facility from a food perspective?  Are there marketing people and chefs involved in identifying the markets and perhaps putting ready meals together?</P>
        <P>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh&rsquo;s background is in fishing.  We have a fantastic organic food product but we need one group or agency to co-ordinate things from when something is caught at sea or reared on the land, prepared by a chef, put into a package and brought to the market.</P>
        <P>If there is a trillion dollar market, such as that identified by the ICMSA, we need to know what people in America are looking for and what product we need to send there.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, I have no doubt that the largest employment creator in this country over the next five to ten years could be our food sector if we do things right.  That will be done under the Minister&rsquo;s stewardship.</P>
        <P>Is there one group getting the product from the small producer, to which Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe referred, or the major producer, taking it to China, showcasing it and creating a market for the producer who does not have the capital or time to do that?  We have the product but we need to get it to the market.</P>

	<P>I am coming to the question.  What struck me was how important it is to taste test before one purchases and how important it is to let the country know what is available, both domestically and internationally.  Is Bord Bia doing something like that?  Why would it not do so at our ports of entry?  It could be done on a smaller scale than I have outlined.  Last night, I met a chocolate manufacturer who does not sell to shops but has a wonderful product.  This links with what the two previous speakers said.  </P>

These are causing major concerns in the agriculture industry.  I accept that this is an EU directive, but I ask the Minister to try to gain a derogation on what is proposed.  The directive will have major implications for drainage of wetlands, removal of hedges and ditches or even opening a gap.</P>
        <P>Senators Tony Mulcahy, and Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe spoke about food production.  During the week, we saw Superquinn being taken over by Musgraves.  Three major supermarkets now own 70% of the grocery retail market.  Will the Minister make sure that multinationals will not further squeeze Irish agriculture?  Certain supermarkets have demanded hello money, etc.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  I hope the Minister will put sanctions in place to ensure that Irish food stays on supermarket shelves.</P>

Can the Minister outline the area of land above which an application for consent must be made if a farmer wants to restructure his holding, carry out land drainage or remove field boundaries? Can he give a commitment that the new legislation will not add further compliance costs and bureaucracy to agriculture?</P>
        <P>Can the Minister explain how further growth and expansion of the sector, as set out in Food Harvest 2020, can be encouraged if measures in the proposed legislation will encourage farmers not to carry out on-farm improvements?  Can he explain his understanding of wetlands, as defined in the proposed Planning and Development (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2011 and outline how his proposed regulation will impact on farmers?  Will farmers who want to cut turf on their own bogs find themselves in the ridiculous situation, if the proposed planning and development regulations are introduced, of having to apply to their local authority for planning permission and submit an environmental impact report, which may cost outrageous amounts of money?</P>

Can the Minister clarify that there will be matching funding in order that all the money available from the European Union for Leader programmes will be drawn down?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is the Minister happy with the cohesion process and the way the Leader programme is being delivered by companies throughout the country?

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will try to deal with the questions on an issue by issue basis.  I cannot go into detail on environmental impact assessments and the land reclamation amendment in the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that is coming forward, because the detail is not agreed yet.  There is much concern among farm organisations, and rightly so.  There is also much frustration in my Department, rightly so, because we are being forced to reduce thresholds significantly from where we have been in the past.  We have shown much good faith in an effort to satisfy the Commission.  It is the Commissioner for the Environment and not the Commissioner for Agriculture who is seeking this.</P>
        <P>New thresholds will be applied for removing ditches, draining wetlands and increasing field size by removing boundaries.  They will be outlined in the new section to be inserted in the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  We do not have an option, or I should say we do have an option.  We can do nothing and get fined about &euro;4 million a day.  That is the option.  We will not win a court case against the Commission on this issue.</P>
        <P>It has been suggested that we seek a derogation.  We have already looked for more time.  The Commission has taken a hard-line approach to the issue, which is regrettable.  Agriculture has been dragged into an environmental issue, rightly so, because farmers have a responsibility for the environment.  What is being asked of my Department is unreasonable but we need to put something in place to ensure that we meet thresholds that will result in Ireland avoiding EU fines.  That is the vulnerable position we are in.  We are not in a strong negotiating position.  That is unfortunate but it is reality.</P>
        <P>I have been trying to keep the threshold as high as possible.  I have tried to keep the length of ditch as long as possible before a Department inspector must give sanction.  A departmental inspection would not cost anything but I have also tried to keep the length of ditch as long as <Col N="695"/>possible before an environmental impact report is required.  That might cost thousands of euro and failure to do so might criminalise a farmer.</P>
        <P>Much of this is already required of farmers under cross-compliance if they are to draw down single farm payment.  What is being proposed is what I have outlined be extended into law and that it would be illegal to remove a ditch without following due process.</P>
        <P>I agree that the thresholds need to be changed.  However, the extent to which it is being demanded that thresholds be reduced is not appropriate.  I wish to make clear that no one is seeking planning permission or even a departmental inspection in respect of opening a ditch &mdash; as in opening a gateway.  I am not happy with regard to the thresholds we are being asked to implement.  However, our hand is being forced to some degree in respect of this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The position on Leader programme funding is complex.  Essentially, most of the funding from the European Union comes under pillar 1, which relates to the single farm payment.  Pillar 2 funding relates to rural development programmes.  There are different annexes within pillar 2.  Under what is traditionally described as annexe 3, we were able to provide financial support predominantly to small food companies in order that they might expand and grow, explore markets and undertake research and development in the context of developing products such as cheeses, yoghurts and ice creams and in respect of establishing micro-breweries, etc.  Our goal in this regard is to promote food entrepreneurship.  The provision of this funding has proven to be quite successful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of the Leader programme structures in place are very good, while others are not.  We should be careful in the context of uttering generalisations regarding how Leader programme funding is managed.  Some of this funding is managed very well by those who understand their communities and the people who live in them.</P>
        <P>Supporting food-based projects is no longer possible under annexe 3.  In other words, even if we provide co-funding we cannot fund food projects under annexe 3 to pillar 2.  If we are going to fund food projects under rural development funding, we are obliged to use annexe 1.  Annexe 3 is predominantly delivered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, even though my Department draws down the funding from the European Union.  Annexe 1 funding is all drawn down and delivered by my Department.  The targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, are funded under annexe 1.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These schemes provide capital grant aid for poultry and pig farmers to allow them to upgrade their units to meet new animal husbandry standards set down by the European Union.  They also provide grant aid for dairy farmers to upscale their facilities in advance of 2015.  Furthermore, they provide grant aid for sheep farmers to allow them to put in place new pen and collection facilities.  In other words, the funding provided is aimed at upgrading rural agricultural infrastructure to improve animal husbandry and food production.  I will not be taking any more applications under TAMS until I know how much money I will have to spend next year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we are going to fund food projects through the Leader programme, we are going to be obliged to do so under annexe 1.  There is already a commitment of funding relating to the latter under TAMS.  We are trying to identify a way whereby we can switch from annexe 3 to annexe 1 in order to that we might be in a position to fund food projects.  We are also seeking to discover which Department would be the appropriate one to provide matching funding in order that we might draw down moneys under annexe 1.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Traditionally, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has always provided matching funding in respect of food projects.  However, annexe 1 funding is managed by my Department.  There is an element of toing and froing involved between the two Departments.</P><Col N="696"/>
        <P>I am only too conscious of how important this matter is for many small food companies which are only starting out and which would have anticipated, in their business plans, obtaining funding through local Leader programmes.  The companies are now discovering that such funding has stalled.  We are trying to resolve the matter and we are hoping to achieve some form of resolution in the coming weeks.  We cannot allow matters to drift any longer than that.</P>
        <P>On food production and the question of who is responsible for identifying markets, we need to move away from the fairly simplistic idea that one person produces the food and that it is another&rsquo;s responsibility to identify a market for it.  We must begin from the other perspective and try to identify what consumers want and where they want it.  We must also identify the premium product that is demanded in respect of which the producer can obtain a premium price and then try to discover how this product can be produced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a change in attitude among food producers, particularly those in the dairy sector.  This change is being driven by price but also by the necessity of identifying new markets.  It is being assisted by the co-op sector because farmers actually own co-ops which buy and then need to sell on milk.  It is not just about milk, however.  It is also about all the other sectors.  There are only approximately 17,000 dairy farmers in Ireland but there are 128,000 farm families.  Dairy farmers, therefore, constitute only a small minority.</P>
        <P>In the context of the food we are producing, Bord Bia has a responsibility to carry out a great deal of consumer research in respect of establishing what consumers want and where they want it in order that we might meet the demand.  It has been doing a good deal of strategic thinking in this area.  Matters under consideration include hosting beef tastings in Germany, which has been happening a great deal in recent months; implementing a carbon labelling scheme for beef here, in which respect it has been anticipated that consumers will want to see evidence relating to the carbon footprint of the beef that is being produced if they are going to be obliged to pay a premium for it at some point in the future; seeking to attract representatives from the primary production and processing sectors and major companies such as Kerry Group, Glanbia, etc., in order that they might brainstorm in respect of the markets that need to be targeted; and, before returning to me, seeking resources to focus in on certain areas and identify where offices need to be established. In many ways, Bord Bia is driving the business plan relating to Food Harvest 2020 from a strategic point of view.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That brings me to the point Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised in respect of the high level implementation group for Food Harvest 2020.  I chair that group, which has already met on three occasions if not more.  As stated, we are setting targets for the short as well as the long term.  We have already revised the targets for the beef sector.  Food Harvest 2020 contains a target whereby the value output relating to beef coming from Ireland should be increased by 20% by 2020.  We have already upgraded that target to 40%.  We asked the beef subgroup that is attached to the Food Harvest 2020 implementation group to examine the position relating to the beef industry and to return with revised recommendations because of our view that the 20% target to which I refer was not very ambitious.  The subgroup did so and produced a detailed document which forms the basis of its revision of the target relating to beef.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A great deal is happening in the context of the hands-on implementation of Food Harvest 2020.  The latter is a set of targets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is more than that.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="697"/>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It contains a great deal of background information which makes the targets to which I refer credible.  It also provides business plans in respect of how those targets might be achieved.  We are trying to implement Food Harvest 2020, as well as upgrading it on a quarterly basis.  We are seeking to upgrade it because markets and prices change.  One of the reasons we altered the target relating to beef from 20% to 40% is because we have already achieved a 10% increase in the output value of beef because the price of the latter has increased.  As the price of food rises, so too does the value of exports.  This means that targets must be revised upwards.  If there were a collapse in prices, we would be obliged to revise targets downwards.</P>
        <P>Food Harvest 2020 is a living document.  The advantage is that everybody buys into what it envisages.  It does not matter if it is Glanbia, Greencore, Kerry Group, Dawn Meats or some other company, everyone subscribes to it.  When we held a conference on Food Harvest 2020 in recent weeks, every player in the food industry in Ireland was present, with the exception of a small number who could not, for predominantly valid reasons, be there.  That conference was a phenomenal success.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Next week I will be launching Food Harvest 2020, one year on.  This will allow us to review what we have achieved in the first year and to identify whether we are on target and to indicate the targets that have been upgraded since the original document was put in place.  As a result, people will be able to see how Food Harvest 2020 is developing on a month by month, year by year basis.  There has already been movement in respect of approximately 90% of the 217 requirements contained in Food Harvest 2020.  It is a living, working document which drives the policy direction of the Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If it is acceptable to Senators, I will not comment on the turf debate.  That is the area of responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, rather than me. It is being driven by the European Union and, unfortunately, Ireland is seen as a country with which the Union must take a hard line in terms of turf-cutting. Having said that, the problems in this regard are sometimes exaggerated in that we are talking about a relatively small percentage of bogs in respect of which significant restrictions are being imposed. </P>
      
        
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P Just="Left">The financing of the food sector is a problem, just as every small and medium-sized enterprise in the State is experiencing problems.  We have spoken to representatives of several banks about financing for the food sector and farming.  There must be a dramatic investment programme, both on farms, which is covered by the capital programmes, and also within food processing.  As I said, there has been no investment in dairy processing in terms of volume increase since the mid-1980s when we began operating within the straitjacket of milk quotas.  The EU must plan for and finance a dramatic investment programme to deal with the increased volumes of milk that will come its way, perhaps before 2015 and certainly after it.  Likewise, the investment programme for poultry and pigs units, because of the increase in standards being imposed by the European Union, requires significant investment.  We have provided matching funding for much of that investment, but the problem is that producers cannot access bank funding.  However, there is an increasing acknowledgement of these realities among both Irish-owned banks and foreign banks, including RaboDirect, which is one of the largest agricultural banks in the world and is seeking to increase significantly its share of the Irish market.  I expect to see funding made available for viable agricultural projects.</P>
        <P>As regards small food companies, as in other sectors there is huge frustration with the banking system at the lack of credit and overdraft facilities and the other factors that are a significant <Col N="698"/>impediment to growth and expansion for businesses.  I will not solve the banking problem today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>This new format of debate is excellent and one we should encourage.  However, it might not work so well if we did not have a Minister like the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, who seems to be well on top of his brief and is willing to respond to our questions.  I am impressed by much of what he has said today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is in an impossible situation in respect of one issue, an old hobby horse of mine which I have raised on many occasions.  The Minister spoke about consumers driving agricultural production.  However, I will present a hypothetical situation in order to illustrate the difficulties that may arise.  Suppose I come to the Minister as an entrepreneur who wishes to open a food processing factory.  I see myself importing chicken from Thailand, because that is what suits me best, and the other ingredients from South America and Africa.  As a person in the food processing business, I want to get into the added-value food area, and importing these foodstuffs is what best suits my business objectives.  I suspect that such a person would not receive a great deal of encouragement or enthusiasm for his proposition from any Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>However, the reality is that there is great potential in added-value food production.  It does not have to be Irish food, which is a different business altogether.  For this reason, there must be a decoupling of food and agriculture within the Department.  To illustrate my point, I remind Members that when McDonald&rsquo;s opened its first restaurant in Ireland some 20 or 25 years ago there was an outcry that the company was using Dutch potatoes.  The Minister at the time, and many others, howled in outrage that a company looking for business in Ireland should be offering chips which came from Dutch potatoes.  The company responded, just as the Minister has said, that it was a question of pleasing its customers, for which purpose these particular potatoes were more suitable than Irish potatoes.  For the first few years of its operation in the State, McDonald&rsquo;s only used imported potatoes from Holland.  Gradually, however, to address this problem, Irish farmers changed their processes in order to produce the potatoes McDonald&rsquo;s wanted and the company subsequently switched to using Irish potatoes for their chips.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a separate business to be explored, offering huge job opportunities, in the added-value processed food business, which need not necessarily be based on Irish produced products.  However, the Department has an impossible task in this regard.  As I said, I doubt that any Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would have a positive response for anybody who approached it with a view, for example, to opening a factory to produce chicken products, soups and pizza toppings to sell around the world using imported foodstuffs.  There would be little enthusiasm for the proposal because the foods being used are imported.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not arguing that the encouragement of value-added food processing projects based on imported foodstuffs should be our sole objective but there is an opportunity to develop and support food businesses which are independent of Irish produced food.  How will the Minister find a way to overcome that problem?  Perhaps he can reassure me that there is no clash of interests in this regard and that the types of ventures to which I referred would be welcomed by the Department.  The Minister used all the right words and phrases, like &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; and <Col N="699"/>&ldquo;consumer driven&rdquo;, but I am concerned that he will be unable simultaneously to support Irish produced food and value-added food processing ventures.  How will he solve that problem?</P>

	<P Just="Left">On the same issue, I welcome the recent passing of legislation to extend country of origin labelling.  On Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s points regarding added value along the food chain, my concern is that the longer the food chain, the greater the chance that something will go wrong.  If a commodity is travelling through several countries and value is being added along the way, there is a greater risk to the consumer by the time he or she purchases that product.  Does the Department propose to take any further action in regard to country-of-origin labelling, particularly in respect of substantial transformation?</P>
        <P>In regard to poultry, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland carried out a survey in December 2008 to examine the quality of raw chicken sold loose in butchers and other retailers.  It found that 8% of this produce had no sell-by date and in 23% of cases, the use-by date was unrealistically distant if the product were to remain unspoiled in the consumer&rsquo;s fridge.  The survey also found that imported poultry is often flushed with carbon dioxide to extend its shelf life artificially.  Is any action proposed to be taken to ensure information is readily available to consumers in respect of raw poultry products which are sold loose?</P>

	<P>On the same issue of food supply and food demand, one of the largest companies in the country is Coca-Cola, based in Ballina, which buys in all its caramelised sugar product from France.  None of it is manufactured in this country.  There must be a joined-up approach, under the leadership of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and including Enterprise Ireland and all the relevant State agencies, with a view to establishing a research and development facility within the State which would support farm organisations, producers and those who may wish to establish food industries from incubation right through the product development chain.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is great potential in this area.  One of the largest companies in the south west is seeking to purchasing a plant worth &euro;200 million in the United States in order that it can import a particular raw material.  We must examine how some of these raw materials can be produced in Ireland.  For instance, there is no reason that we should be importing casings for the sausage meat industry.  There are immense opportunities to be exploited but it requires a joined-up approach and a research and development facility focused specifically on the food sector in order to ensure we can cater for consumers&rsquo; needs from what is produced in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In the case of the fishing industry, 220,000 tonnes of fish are landed into Ireland, but 68% of that is exported.  It gives an example of where we are.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The contributions from Senators Feargal Quinn and Pat O&rsquo;Neill pose the question of achieving a balance between produce sourced inside and outside Ireland.  There are significant benefits, including jobs and so on from Senator Quinn&rsquo;s suggestions but, equally we must ensure we take care of our own producers.  Tesco was slaughtering 50 Irish organic cattle and they then began to source the cattle in Argentina, reducing the number of Irish cattle to one or two a week, now the number has increased to 30 per week.  Has the Minister considered imposing certain limits on multinationals, that they use 70% Irish produce and 30% sourced abroad.  We need to find a solution in order that there is respect for the home producer and at the same time respecting entrepreneurship.</P>

	<P>There are a series of topics that we have not had the chance to cover, for example, a soft landing for milk producers, the threat of superlevy fines.  If Members have specific questions, I invite them to e-mail me and I will try to give as full an answer as I can.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In response to Senator Quinn, ultimately we must give consumers what they want, because they have the buying power and they spend money.  If given the choice and all else being equal, consumers want to buy Irish produce, not always because it is Irish and that is a growing driver for choice, but because they associate it with quality and a food production system they <Col N="701"/>understand.  Some people do not care where food comes from, if it looks good and it is cheap they will buy it.  That is a market that needs to be catered for and we need to ensure that consumers are given food at a price that is competitive with prices in other parts of the United Kingdom and Europe.  There is a growing sophistication on the part of consumers, and research backs this up, in that they like to know what they are buying and where it comes from.  In time they will be asking more questions around issues such as its carbon footprint and what farm it comes from.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some products are being sold with a code on the packaging which people can enter on a website and get information on the farmer who produced the food.  That is taking it a little bit far, but there is a growing awareness and knowledge of the food chain among consumers.  This will continue to grow as information becomes available.  Take the example of McDonalds, which is the largest buyer of Irish beef, with the possible exception of one of the major supermarket chains.  One in six burgers consumed across the European Union is made from Irish beef.  In case people think I am biased, it is the same in Burger King.  The fact that it is Irish beef  is displayed in every shop.  Consumers are reasonably happy with these products.</P>
        <P>The ideal scenario is that we grow the percentage of Irish produced food in Irish food outlets and in retail stores because it is the best and most competitively priced food available.  That needs to be the primary driver, rather than trying to impose quotas on multiples.  Imposing quotas of having to buy two thirds Irish is no way to build a food industry.  One of the reasons Ireland should be able to do this is that 85% of everything we produce needs to beat the competition based on other people in other countries saying we must buy our own homegrown produce.  That is the case whether it is Irish beef in Germany, Irish lamb in Italy or Irish seafood in France.  They are the largest markets for our produce with the exception of the UK.  People eat Irish mussels in Paris because they are the best mussels.  Organic Irish produced farmed salmon is the most sought after salmon in the European Union.  I will talk about fish later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to concentrate on encouraging but not forcing the home market to buy Irish food.  However, that misses the point that the home market is only 15% of the food market, the other 85% is about being competitive enough to compete abroad and win market share and be better than other produce on the shelf, in the factory or in the restaurant in order that consumers actually chose it.  Our aim is to be the best at what we do.  Let us consider what New Zealand has achieved.  It has made some mistakes, but in terms of its growing market share, it has succeeded because it produces quality food at competitive prices and it does things well.  That is the case with its entire food chain.  It is not just farmers, it is also food companies, co-operatives, etc.  That is what Ireland needs to be about.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We do not have enough pigs to meet the demand in the Chinese market.  If we had pigs on every acre at a stock rate that would be unacceptable to the European Commission, we would still not be able to feed Beijing, never mind all of China.  In the pig and poultry markets we need to decide what segments of the market we are targeting to give us added value and premium prices so that pig producers get more from what they produce.  We are not in the volume business and we cannot compete with other parts of the world in terms of mass production.  We have family farms and we can improve economies of scale by getting farmers to work in partnership, but ultimately food produced in Ireland is about a premium product that it can command more on the supermarket shelf because it is special.  This involves traceability and husbandry and other matters we can promise.  The Irish brand is about a promise.  That is why Chinese consumers in Beijing are choosing New Zealand or Irish infant formula.  They do not trust the infant formula produced in the dairy industry in China because of scandals of the past.  We need to build on the hard earned brand and the promise that gives Ireland a stable <Col N="702"/>and safe reputation for producing food.  The evidence is that consumers will pay a little more for that if we target market cleverly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the home market, we must be competitive with imports.  Our relationship with the UK is a good example.  Not all Members were present in the Chamber when I said that last year we exported &euro;3.6 billion of food and imported &euro;2.7 billion.  That balance is pretty good for 4 million people but we are still importing a lot of food.  If we are concerned about food excellence and giving consumers choice, we must import products we cannot produce competitively or products we are not good at producing.  We must concentrate on what Ireland is good at and for which Ireland can put a premium brand in place in terms of selling abroad and finding new market share.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is an idea that we do not have research facilities for food but that is incorrect.  The week before last I launched a significant research project on cheese that is co-sponsored by Teagasc and the Irish Dairy Board.  It is located at Moorepark, outside Fermoy.  In Clonakilty, seafood research and seafood added value is another example.  We have given grant aid to the fish processing sector.  We are doing a great deal to add value, skill and intellectual capital to the food sector by how we spend money.  I am encouraging more private sector involvement in research programmes and development programmes for food.  Partly this is because we cannot afford to do it all ourselves due to shrinking budgets, but also because it is in the interests of the private sector to do so.  I will launch an exciting dairy project with Glanbia in September.  It involves upskilling farmers on running a business from a financial and accounting point of view as well as farming.  That is the kind of partnership we need to create with the private sector, which should be co-funded.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want the brewing industry to form discussion groups in place for malting barley farmers, just as we have done for dairy farmers.  This will ensure we are producing malting barley efficiently.  The benefit to the brewing sector, including Diageo and Heineken, is that it will have a stable supply.  We seek the same situation in respect of beef.  If we are to set up beef discussion groups, which I want to do to upskill the farmers, I want co-financing from the big beef processors.  It is in their interest to do so and I will demand it because the State cannot afford it anymore.  This concerns creating partnerships on research, developing an industry, fulfilling targets under Food Harvest 2020 and everyone contributing and benefiting.  This relates to finance and intellectual capital.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will be as brief as possible on fisheries in order that we have as long as possible for questions but there are significant matters happening in fishing and I would like to give a broad outline to Members.  Yesterday, I was in a European Council meeting debating the initial draft produced by Commissioner Damanaki on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.  I should have said that Ireland is in a hugely influential position on the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy because the timeframe for getting agreement on both will spill over into the Irish Presidency in the first half of 2013.  The aim of the EU is to have a deal done on both by the end of next year but everyone recognises it is unlikely that target will be met.  Budgets have been set in anticipation of this.  Ireland takes the Presidency of the EU for the first six months of 2013, which gives us a fantastic opportunity to be the dealmakers on the Common Fisheries Policy, the Common Agricultural Policy and the financial perspectives for the overall EU budget.  It is a great opportunity for us to restore our reputation as a country that can put positive deals in place as opposed to being associated with the difficulties the EU has.</P>
        <P>Yesterday was the opening debate on the Common Fisheries Policy after much shadow-boxing.  On a bilateral basis with Commissioner Damanaki in public and in private, I have set out some of the concerns we anticipate from the Irish perspective in respect of the Common Fisheries Policy.  Some of those concerns remain, even after the debate yesterday, and I will set out one or two of them that are significant.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner is planning to reform fundamentally how the fishing industry operates across the European Union.  She wants to change the way in which quota is allocated.  At present, quota is a national asset and it is up to the Government, in consultation with the fishing industry, to allocate quota in a way that best suits the coastal communities, the fishing industry and the protection of fish stocks.  If we do not protect fish stocks, we will have no fishing industry in the years ahead.  Each year, we fight for our share of quota in December and the Government allocates quota to fleets in a complex negotiation structure with the industry.  There is a reasonable degree of certainty and consistency from the perspective of the fishing industry because cuts in quota are always anticipated before the December discussions.  The Commissioner is saying there are too many boats in fishing fleets across the EU and we do not have the quota to satisfy demand.  The proposal is to give quota to boats and allow them to trade quota among themselves.  In other words, if somebody wants to get out of fishing they can sell or lease on the quota allocated to them to another boat owner.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner wants to see the industry consolidate into smaller numbers of bigger boats which will be easier to manage in the future.  She states that a quota will only be able to be transferable &mdash; she is calling them fishing concessions but essentially they are quotas &mdash; <Col N="704"/>within member states.  That makes some sense from an economic, efficiency, stock management and business point of view but it does not make much sense in terms of the other elements we need to protect as politicians or in terms of keeping fishing communities viable and intact because what we will see in Ireland is consolidation into two or three fishing ports.  The others will be unable to survive, be they the onshore businesses around processing and adding value, or the fleets themselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Of much more concern to me is that the Spanish fishing industry, which is the biggest in Europe, has a fleet that is too big for its quota and the Spanish want to be able to buy quota from elsewhere to meet demand for catch.  My big fear, and the fear of my Department &mdash; there are many well informed people in my Department who understand the industry very well &mdash; is that we will not be able to limit the transfer of quota to boats within the member state and that we will see the transfer of what was Irish quota in the past out of Ireland into Spanish, French, Dutch, British fleets and so on.  As a result our ports will never see those fish.  That would be the start of the end of the Irish fishing industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are very concerned that the Commission has not put in place safeguards we believe are credible to ensure the transferability of quotas within member states and that quota does not move out of Ireland.  It is something about which the industry is also very concerned.  I am very concerned about, and I have been blunt with the Commission on this aspect.  It will be a major point of debate and disagreement in the next 18 months or so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, we have some allies.  We have managed to convince both Germany and France that transferring and essentially privatising quotas is not such a good idea because once it is taken out of state control as a state asset, control is lost and cannot be retrieved.  The Commission is saying that if we want to get quota back from someone they have to be given 15 years notice.  That makes no sense.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Quota in Ireland is a national asset.  Nobody owns it, including trawlermen.  We own it as a State.  We allocate it to our fleet.  There are flaws in the system but it is a better option for us to continue with a system or a revised system along a similar model to what we have currently than change to a system which lets the market decide who gets quota.  In that scenario people with the most money will buy up quota from elsewhere.  The transferability of individual transferable quotas, ITQs, or individual transferable concessions as the Commissioner now refers to them, poses great threats to the Irish industry and we must argue for a change of tack on that issue.</P>
        <P>The second issue on which I strongly agree with the Commissioner but not her approach is that of discards.  We have an indefensible position whereby hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fish are being caught, killed and thrown back into the sea because fishermen do not have quotas to catch them.  A number of different problems arise in that regard.  There are what are called juvenile fish, in other words, fish that are not marketable because they are not big enough to sell but they are the same species as one has a quota to catch.  In some fisheries we catch up to four or five juvenile fish and kill them before we can land one marketable adult fish.  That makes no sense on any level in terms of stock management or anything else.</P>
        <P>The second problem with discards is that one catches in mixed fisheries another fish for which one does not have a quota to catch.  For example, if someone has a quota to catch haddock and whiting in the Celtic Sea and they are catching cod in their net in that mixed fishery, which they will do, but they do not have a quota to land cod they have to dump cod over the side.  That is happening as we speak because there is a huge increase in cod numbers in the Celtic Sea.  We have adult, marketable, valuable fish being thrown over the side and at the same time we are talking about trying to reduce the number of discards.</P><Col N="705"/>
        <P>The Commission is proposing that, over time, we will ban all discards.  Trawlers would have to land everything they catch on shore.  That makes some sense for what I would describe as clean fisheries.  If someone is only catching one species and they over-catch on a certain catch it makes sense that they land the extra.  They do not get paid for it but they are forced to land it.  At least they know it is being caught.</P>
        <P>The position on mixed fisheries is more complex.  They cannot land everything they catch because they do not have a quota or they may be catching fish that are outside of quota and protected.  We must have much more discussion with the industry on the way we deal with the discards issue but we must do something fundamental in terms of changing the current scenario where I would estimate up to 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes of dead fish are thrown over the side each year in Irish waters.  We catch approximately 1.2 million tonnes of fish each year.  There is probably more than that caught but there is a quota to catch that number.</P>
        <P>We are working with the industry and the industry is responding to put in place pilot projects on discards, particularly in what is called the biologically sensitive area, which is the Irish box off the south coast of Ireland.  We will be examining pilot projects on discards in fisheries such as, for example, monkfish, megrim and hake.  We have already agreed with the French a pilot project to allow juvenile fish escape in the cod, whiting and haddock fishery in the Celtic Sea.  France has signed up to that.  Yesterday in the Commission, outside the discussion on the Common Fisheries Policy, we got agreement in principle from the Commission that it will increase the total allowable catch for cod in the Irish Sea this year.  It will revise the quota as long as we put the juvenile fish escape measures in place, which is a square net at the back of a trawled net to allow juvenile fish to escape.</P>
        <P>The industry is leading with these initiatives.  Fishermen are often painted as people who do not care about discards or stock management and who are only in fishing for the immediate and short-term quick buck.  My experience of those in the fishing industry is that they are much more sophisticated than that.  They have put in place stock management programmes that have worked, and cod in the Celtic Sea is one of the good examples of that because it was the fishing industry which asked for what are called set-aside areas at sea where there would be no fishing to allow for breeding, growth of fish and so on.</P>
        <P>Other issues arise around the Common Fisheries Policy.  These include the regionalisation of decision making; ensuring that fish imported into the European Union are produced to the same environmental standards that we have here to ensure we do not put our people at a disadvantage; and a series of other issues that I do not have time to get into now but on which I will answer questions if Senators wish.</P>
        <P>In terms of what we are doing as regards Food Harvest 2020, the fish sector plays a major role in the expansion of the food industry.  Senator Quinn spoke about landing non-Irish produced fish into Ireland.  That is being encouraged.  We had practically the entire French fishing industry in Clonakilty recently and we told them that the highest quota for white fish in Irish waters is in French hands.  They are catching huge volumes of fish.  They predominantly take all that fish back to France to get processed.</P>
        <P>Most of the French fishing industry is owned by French multiples, which are big companies rather than family owned vessels.  We decided that we would bring the processing sector from all the ports in Ireland as well as many of the harbour masters to meet French fishing interests in Clonakilty to try to encourage them to land fish close to where it is being caught, which is here in Ireland, because the current price of fuel means it is very expensive for them to steam back to France every time they fill up their hulls.  If we can do that, we can have an impact on the volume of fish landed in Ireland.  Some 240,000 tonnes were landed here last year although 1.2 million tonnes are actually caught in Irish waters.  The jobs in the fishing sector are in <Col N="706"/>processing.  If we can double the volume of fish being landed in Irish ports and have those fish processed, graded, packaged and marketed here, there will be very exciting potential for towns such as Killybegs, Rossaveel, Dingle, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and all the other fishing ports that are important and have fish-processing facilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My final point on the potential for growth concerns aquaculture.  We had a brief conversation on this during our debate some ten days ago.  If one considers how the world, not just Ireland, will be fed in ten years and what other countries are doing to provide seafood to their populations, one will note that Europe is way behind.  We are still putting wild sea stocks under considerable pressure by trying to catch as much as we can within the limitations.  In most countries outside the Union, however, large populations are being fed on farmed fish.  China consumes 93,000,000 tonnes of fish each year, 75% of which is farmed.  In the European Union, only a fraction of what we eat is farmed, yet most of the fish we import is farmed.  Some 70% of what we consume is imported.</P>
        <P>Some countries are making significant progress expanding aquaculture and fish farming.  Scotland, for example, produced 150,000 tonnes of farmed salmon last year and this volume is growing.  Ireland produces 12,000 tonnes.  Norway produces 1 million tonnes of farmed salmon and aims to produce 2 million tonnes in five years.  Unless Ireland does something about this, it will be producing only 12,000 to 14,000 tonnes, despite our extraordinary natural resources which suit aquaculture.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have a big stumbling block to get over, namely, the fact that practically all our harbours and bays are in Natura scheme areas, or special areas of conservation.  We must go through a long and difficult process even to licence aquaculture, but we are examining in an ambitious way the possibility of facilitating aquaculture outside the bays.  I refer to offshore aquaculture which can produce very large volumes of high value fish for markets with very strong demand.  We are working with the Marine Institute, BIM, my Department and the industry to make this happen.  I hope there will be some announcements on how we can proceed in an environmentally responsible and sustainable way in the early autumn.  We must work with the fishing industry rather than against it when addressing the question of fish stocks.</P>
        <P>I will take questions at this stage because I do not want to speak for too long.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the Minister is present to touch on this issue because the proposals of the Commissioner last week will do nothing for Irish fishermen.  The Irish stance needs to be very strong.  If the Minister is strong in his negotiations and wears the green jersey, we will support him every step of the way from this side of the House.</P>
        <P>I will refer to the Common Fisheries Policy review and the proposals of the Commissioner last week, and ask questions thereon.  The mandatory transferable quota rights being talked about would be detrimental to Irish fishermen.  Giving quota rights to big companies would do nothing to protect the smaller fishermen around Irish coasts.  I hope the Minister will fight tooth and nail against the suggestion of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Greater regionalisation was promised by the Commission but we now know from the Commissioner&rsquo;s report last week that she is diluting the promises and going nowhere near meeting the promise to have the regionalised plans required by the industry.  A one-size-fits-all approach will do nothing for the coastal communities and smaller fishermen around Irish shores.  I hope the Minister will deal with this in a very strong manner with the Commissioner.</P>
        <P>I partly welcome the establishment of a separate regime for smaller fisheries.  However, the proposals in the Commission&rsquo;s report give no recognition to boats under 15 m in length.  Considering that over 80% of the Irish fleet comprises boats under 15 m, we need special recognit<Col N="707"/>ion for our smaller vessels.  I hope the Minister will fight on behalf of 80% of the Irish fleet in his negotiations with the Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The question of trade sanctions needs to be dealt with at European level and I acknowledge the European Parliament is dealing with it.  My colleague, Mr. Pat the Cope Gallagher, MEP, is working hard to introduce trade sanctions on the fishing of mackerel by the Faroe Islands and Norway.  Those two countries have allocated to themselves over 300,000 tonnes of mackerel that they fish, which is 47% of the catch within the European Union that is regarded by scientists as safe.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is the Faroe Islands and Iceland.  Iceland is negotiating with the European Union and the Commission with regard to accession and supports.  Trade sanctions must be brought to bear on both Iceland and the Faroe Islands.  I hope the Minister has some light to shed on this.</P>
        <P>I am glad Councillor David Alcorn, who is from the coastal community, is present today to hear this debate and the Minister&rsquo;s response.  An alarming statistic, on which the Minister has touched, is that 88% of the fish caught within Irish waters are caught by foreign boats.  This means Irish boats are only catching approximately 12%.  Considering all the restrictions within the European Union, this is having a detrimental effect on our industry.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have touched on three or four questions and have two final ones.  Will the Minister consider replacing the criminal sanctions system applicable to minor fisheries offences with an administrative sanctions system to bring Ireland into line with other European countries?  Will he consider reopening salmon fishing on a restricted, managed basis for island fishermen on a pilot basis over 24 months in order that the industry can prove itself and carry on from there?</P>

	<P>I was hoping we would confine our remarks to questions and that we would have a maximum of three minutes for questions.  I will be very brief.  The Minister has addressed questions on Commissioner Damanaki&rsquo;s proposals relating to discounts and transferable quotas.  He might address also the Hague preferences pertaining to the whitefish fleet.  When will he be announcing decisions on the allocations for and management of the mackerel fishery, in respect of which there is to be a quota increase of 10%; the boarfish fishery, which involves a new quota species; and the Celtic Sea herring fishery?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of my former colleague from the fishing community, Councillor Alcorn.  I congratulate the Minister on his jobs initiative in Killybegs six weeks ago.  It was launched in conjunction with LYIT, Donegal County Council and various agencies.  Is this predicated on our maintaining our national quotas?  If quotas are split up, plans for the jobs initiative in Killybegs could be compromised.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill on the privatisation of quotas.  It is the wrong approach and it is against the ethos of the European Union to split up national quotas and place them in private ownership.  This allows any company throughout the world to manipulate the stocks.  Regarding the Faroe Islands and Iceland, does the Minister agree that whatever needs to be <Col N="708"/>done must be done to bring this issue to a head as otherwise there will be a free-for-all in the north Atlantic?</P>
        <P>An increase in fish farming is the way forward.  I was in France recently and I noticed Norwegian fish being marketed in the larger supermarkets.  Irish fish is just as good and this is an opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The issue raised by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill is ironic.  We are speaking about the privatisation of the fishing industry on a Europe-wide basis whereas for many years the Government in which he was involved privatised Irish quotas.  Will the Minister examine this issue as it is within his remit?  A total of 87% of the Irish quota is fished by 23 boats, mainly based in County Donegal as it happens.  If this were to be redistributed in a more equitable fashion there would be more work in Rossaveel, Castletownbere, Dingle and other processing plants.  Most of the fish caught by these ships is not processed in Ireland.  This issue is completely within the Minister&rsquo;s remit as it concerns the Irish quota.</P>
        <P>What options are available to us given the Europe-wide nature of the quotas?  Under the Lisbon treaty have we handed over our power of veto on the individual transferable quotas issue?  If Spain, Portugal and other countries gang up on us what can the Minister do?  Ireland is a small country and we do not have many friends in Europe at present.  Has the Lisbon treaty scuppered our chances to veto an issue such as this?</P>
        <P>I am based in Connemara and I speak to fishermen every day.  What is being done by officials in the Department to criminalise fishermen is scandalous and needs to be addressed immediately.  It appears the way sanctions have been put in place by the Department regarding catches and paperwork criminalises people for making very small administrative mistakes.</P>

	<P>How will the new Common Fisheries Policy benefit fishing communities and the aquaculture industry in Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In the interests of brevity I will keep my contribution to questions.  Will the Minister examine harbour dues because I believe there are anomalies throughout the country as anything between &euro;15 and &euro;300 is charged per night by various harbour masters?  How many applications have been made for the renewal of aquaculture licenses and for new licences?  The Minister cannot be blamed with regard to the operational programme for fisheries, which was to run from 2007 to 2013 but has not yet been put in place, as it is now 2011 and he has been in office for only a couple of months.  The blame for this must lie with the previous Administration.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister that fishermen are the best people to preserve fish stocks because they do not want to make a killing one year but have no income the next.  Does the Government hold quota kilowatts and tonnage?  My understanding of the discussions on the Common Fisheries Policy is that the EU wants to hand back decision-making to national governments to tailor local conditions.  Would this enable the Government to allocate tonnage and kilowatts in its jurisdiction?</P>
        <P>A member of the Sneem Fishermen&rsquo;s Co-op is in the Visitors Gallery.  The Minister received communication on an issue concerning this group and I ask him to re-examine it.  These men borrowed &euro;340,000 on the promise of a grant of &euro;109,000 from BIM and the previous Administration which they never received.  I understand from the Minister&rsquo;s reply it cannot be dealt with retrospectively but in the interests of good will, fairness and natural justice something should be done for them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryBrennan"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  As a new Senator I have not heard many Ministers speak with such enthusiasm, commitment and gusto.  The Minister has great knowledge of his brief.  I have complimented him previously on his performances on radio and television.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the need to upskill farmers throughout the country.  I have a question about shellfish farmers whom I watch from my back door.  I am the Member of the Oireachtas who lives closest to the water; I live on the water.  My son is a shellfish man and I wonder about the laborious methods they use.  Is upskilling available for shellfish and oyster farmers?</P>
        <P Just="Left">As an island nation we have opportunities in the shellfish industry to export throughout Europe, because what is being done is only a fraction of what could be done.  The area in which I live is a designated shellfish area but there are effluent discharges from Northern Ireland and the towns on the lough.  What can be done to minimise the discharge into the waters of important designated shellfish areas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Earlier the Minister highlighted the huge potential in the food and dairy industries to generate economic activity.  How many jobs are directly associated with the fishing industry?  How does the Minister see this number increasing in the coming five years during the lifetime of the Government?  Where does he see the real potential to grow economic activity, add value and, ultimately, increase employment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">To answer Senator Mullins, I have a figure in my head but I do not want to give him the wrong information.  However, I can tell him that seafood produce sold out of Ireland is worth approximately &euro;700 million and we want to increase this to more than &euro;1 billion by 2020.  This is a very modest target and we will be significantly above it if we do what I hope to do with regard to aquaculture and foreign landings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As we see stocks improve and recover it is hoped the allocation of total allowable catches to our fishing fleet will also increase.  If one adds up the processing and aquaculture sectors and the fishing industry as we understand it, the on-sea industry, we can create thousands of jobs.  It is important not to oversell this, but we are discussing coastal areas and thousands of jobs in coastal communities would be hugely valuable.  The Killybegs jobs initiative project is part of this.  This was not my initiative.</P>
      
        <P>I was approached by a number of business people and representatives of the KFO, the county manager, Letterkenny IT and BIM who said they could do something to create a significant number of jobs in Killybegs and add to the town being a driver for the Donegal region.  They asked for policy support and not money for a number of initiatives and some of them are under way.  They have had follow up meetings since then.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to individual transferable quotas, ITQs, but my views in this regard are well known.  I am sure the Commissioner sees me as a problem child in this regard but I am not reassured by what I have been told and I am concerned at any new system that would require countries to facilitate the transfer of quotas between boats.  There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that people have been waving cheque books in Castletownbere and fishing ports on the Bay of Biscay seeking to buy quota to get ahead of the policy.  That is worrying and it is not the direction we should take in the CFP.</P>
        <P>I agree with greater regionalisation.  The proposals on regionalisation do not meet the expectations that followed the Green Paper published a number of months ago.  There are also a number of problems with the approach to regionalisation adopted in the draft report.  For example, if we manage fish stocks in the western waters, who enforces the rules if the Commission does not?  Regionalisation raises practical problems on which we need more compre<Col N="710"/>hensive answers.  With regard to decision-making on stock management and recovery plans, more regionalisation is needed in terms of the input for the management of the stocks in Irish waters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to mackerel fishing, I rarely deliberately target countries outside the EU for criticism and it should not be done lightly but the attitude that Iceland and the Faroe Islands are taking to targeting mackerel stocks is disgraceful.  The EU has worked hard in the past ten years to build up this hugely valuable stock.  It is the most important stock for the domestic fishing sector.  Mackerel fishing is worth &euro;3 billion to the Union.  The stock has increased and it has been one of the success stories of stock management.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P Just="Left">It has increased to such an extent that the feeding grounds of mackerel have expanded into Faroese and Icelandic waters and the response from the Faroe Islands and Iceland has been to try to fish as much of it as they can in as short a period of time as they can because it is so valuable.  A tonne of mackerel is worth between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,300 whereas most white fish cost &euro;300 a tonne.  Mackerel is caught in massive volumes by our fishermen and those of other states.  In the past few days a Peruvian registered vessel, the <i>Lafayette</i>, which has the largest processing capacity in the world, entered Faroese waters.  There is so much mackerel being caught in these waters that they cannot process it.  They have had to bring in floating processing factories such as the <i>Lafayette</i>, to catch as much as they can before this madness is stopped.</P>
        <P>All the international scientific study of mackerel stock suggests not more than 600,000 tonnes of the fish should be caught this year but more than 1 million tonnes will be caught.  The Faroe Islands previously had an agreement with the EU and Norway &mdash; Norway is the good guy here working with the Union &mdash; under which approximately two thirds of the quota was transferred to the Union and less than one third to Norway with 5% retained by the islands.  The Faroe Islands and Iceland have both applied to themselves a tonnage of 150,000 each in mackerel out of a supposed catch of 600,000.  In other words, they propose to give half the catch to themselves.  That is an act of hugely irresponsible stock management and it will butcher a valuable resource from which everybody should gain.  The implications for Ireland are massive because, as a result of what is happening, when I visit Brussels in December to renegotiate next year&rsquo;s mackerel quota for our fleet, we are likely to experience a significant reduction because of what is happening in Faroese and Icelandic waters when it should increase as the stock expands.</P>
        <P>What is happening is unacceptable and the Union has tried diplomacy for 18 months to resolve this issue but that has not worked.  Iceland and the Faroe Islands are ignoring the entreaties.  There was an attempt to reach a deal a number of months ago but people walked away from the table.  I proposed at last month&rsquo;s Council that the Union impose trade sanctions on Iceland and the Faroe Islands.  Initially this would involve a ban on all imports of mackerel products.  If nothing happened as a result of that, we would ban the importation of all pelagic species, including fish meal, into the Union and we would scale it up if there was still no response after that.  I secured support from the vast majority of members around the Council table and from the Commissioner who said that by October she will have proposals to introduce sanctions.  We are making progress but, unfortunately, where the Union is concerned, the wheels move slowly and, in the meantime, our stock is being damaged.  We are taking the issue seriously.  Ireland has only so much muscle but I have led the debate on this at EU level and I have been as proactive and aggressive as I can because that is required.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator Cummins, because of the good news story that is mackerel, we hope to have an increased quota for this year, which will be allocated in the autumn.  The decision I had was whether I should reopen the allocation of the stock between the pelagic fleet and the polyvalent fleet, which is a contentious issue.  That is something on which I must make a <Col N="711"/>decision.  I am slow to take on too many reviews at the same time, particularly when we do not know the potential mackerel quota reduction in December.  We could go through a difficult process that splits the fishing industry to allocate a 10% increase in mackerel quota this year and then end up with a 10% reduction in December and find that the process was undertaken for nothing.  I am cautious about doing that because it is contentious.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope there will be a decision on boarfish within the next ten days.  We are trying to ensure people who have a track record of catching boarfish and who have helped to develop this aspect of the industry and the science relating to what I hope will be a valuable stock in the years ahead will get preferential treatment but that a decent quota will be available for boats that want to experiment with this stock to ascertain whether it would be viable for them.  This is the first year we will have quota for boarfish and we will have 22,000 tonnes.  We are trying to get the balance right but people will always disagree.</P>
        <P>Celtic Sea herring is also a good news story.  We are likely to secure an increase in quota and we do not face the same time constraint as we do on boarfish and mackerel.  Early autumn will be decision-making time on herring.</P>
        <P>The issue of moving from criminal sanctions to administrative sanctions is addressed in the programme of Government.  A former Deputy and party colleague, Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, drafted legislation to do that when he was in opposition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Advice has been received from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office but introducing such legislation is not as easy as we hoped.  It is still a commitment in the programme for Government and we are exploring legal ways of overcoming these difficulties.  It will not happen as quickly as we would have liked, however.  We will work with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office to make some progress on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are 23 very large vessels in the pelagic fleet, most of which fish out of Killybegs, that catch large amounts of mackerel and herring.  Their owners have invested significant sums of money to be in that position and provide an efficient way of catching, processing and selling fish.  Killybegs is an efficient operation.  Mackerel catches are allowed for other vessels.  The quota is split between the pelagic fleet and others by 87:13.   I have an open mind on examining a more effective and equitable way of allocating quota.  However, I do not want to be putting people out of business at the same time.  It is not as simple as the suggestion of sharing out the quotas more evenly.  Some vessel owners have economies of scale they need to meet to pay for their machinery.  The polyvalent fleet is the largest and it is allowed a small part of the pelagic catch.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Reviewing the Common Fisheries Policy will force us to deal more creatively with issues such as discards, which are unacceptable.  It will require us to be more constructive to achieve a sustainable yield from existing fish stocks and ensure they are not reduced.  This is about managing the stocks to ensure there is a fishing industry in the future.  Developing and expanding aquaculture will be a significant element for the first time in the CFP.  I hope we will be able to secure financial assistance to develop aquaculture in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is an issue around harbour dues which is being reviewed.  My Department owns and operates six fishing harbours which are commercial operations.  We need to listen to the argument of those who claim the dues are too high while ensuring the harbours pay for themselves.  This is about balancing commercial reality.  These harbours are not the same as privately run ones which are run commercially and we need to take the public good into account when setting harbour dues.  However, we need to have a return from them.  The purpose of the review of harbour dues is to get consistency across all six departmental ports.  Rents charged on properties in these ports are also another issue.  An independent arbitrator will decide on what a fair rent is for these premises.</P><Col N="712"/>
        <P>Is the Government holding back on fish quotas?  They are often held back to cover by-catches.  For example, when allocating the 22,000 tonnes of boar fish quota, 5% will be kept for by-catches.  If a fisherman did not catch a specific species but caught some boar fish, that 5% will cover his bringing them ashore rather than discarding them.  These reserve quotas are used before the end of year, regardless.</P>
        <P>I cannot give a commitment on the Sneem fishery without examining it in more detail.  I hope Senator Sheahan will give me more details about it later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There seems to be a misunderstanding about salmon fishing which I do not control.  There is an anomaly around the management of inland fisheries which includes salmon.  It comes within the remit of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It is a call for the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, not me.  I met the fishermen in Donegal who had lost their pots after a storm.  I have sympathy for their arguments but we need to be careful that by reopening a salmon fishery we do not set a precedent.  Once it is done for one community, there will be an avalanche of applications from other communities pleading special cases.  Why should those on the Aran Islands be treated differently to those living in Allihies?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Bord Iascaigh Mhara is responsible for training in the fisheries sector.  There is a staffing problem with training deckhands and skippers.  I am not sure what courses are available for upskilling fish farmers but I will get in contact with BIM about it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That has nothing to do with the Lisbon treaty.  The Common Fisheries Policy will be decided at Council and I hope we will achieve unanimity in agreeing it.  In the meantime, the way Ireland has always done its business in the European Union is not by voting against proposals.  Under qualified majority voting, QMV, we have three votes at Council.  The way to get things done in Europe is to build alliances around an argument and win it.  That is why we are speaking to the French, Germans and other member states concerned about what may happen as a result of implementing ITQs.  One looks for big partners around which one creates a coalition to win one&rsquo;s argument.  There are those member states which want to go down the ITQ road.  Europe is not about taking a stand, refusing to budge and losing a vote and then claiming the structures are unfair.  It is about using the existing mechanisms to win the argument by getting a majority behind it.  Ireland has been good at achieving this both in the European Parliament and European Council.</P>
        <P>Ireland, a country of 4 million people, has influenced the direction of the debate about the review of the Common Agricultural Policy, which affects 500 million people.  This shows we are punching way above our weight in influencing major policy decisions.  We will continue to do this with the Common Fisheries Policy.  I will probably spend every second week until the middle of 2013 or perhaps even later outside the country meeting Ministers from other member states, as I try to put together deals and persuade the Commission it is making a mistake, while also offering it an alternative.  I will not threaten to vote against the CAP or argue that the structures of the European Union are undemocratic because one does not get anywhere in the EU by engaging in that type of grandstanding.  One must win the argument and that will be my focus.  I am fortunate to have an excellent Department with many smart officials who know how the European Union system works.  They have done a great job in positioning Ireland as one of the key players in shaping the Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy.  I hope that following 18 months or two years of discussions we will, in early 2013, <Col N="713"/>achieve an acceptable outcome which will secure unanimous support and for which Ireland will be the deal-maker.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2011 is a short but important Bill.  The Bill contains three important electoral reforms.  It amends the terms of reference of a Constituency Commission in section 6(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Electoral Act 1997 by providing that the number of Members of the D&aacute;il, subject to the relevant provisions of the Constitution, shall be not less than 153 and not more than 160.  It also amends section 39(2) of the Electoral Act 1992 to provide that steps are taken to hold a by-election to fill any vacancy if the D&aacute;il has not so moved within six months of the vacancy occurring.  It also provides for amendments to the Electoral Act 1997 to provide for a reduction in the spending limit at a presidential election from &euro;1,300,000 to &euro;750,000 and for a reduction in the maximum amount that can be reimbursed to a candidate at a presidential election from &euro;260,000 to &euro;200,000.</P><Col N="714"/>
        <P Just="Left">The three measures are separate and distinct.  They are all important features of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to push ahead with much needed electoral reform.  I will turn first to the proposal to reduce the number of Members in the D&aacute;il.  Our position is clear: we want to reduce the size and the cost of government.  The programme for Government has identified a &ldquo;clear need for our political system to embrace change, share the burden and lead by example&rdquo;.  Under the heading &ldquo;Political Reform/Change must start at the top&rdquo;, the programme for Government states, &ldquo;the political system cannot ask others to change and make sacrifices if it is not prepared to do the same&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of commitments are made in the programme, including to significantly reduce the size of the Oireachtas and to reduce the number of Deputies following the publication of the 2011 census of population.  The proposals in the Bill regarding the terms of reference of a constituency commission respond to the commitment.  The preliminary census results were published by the CSO on 30 June.  These results show that this country has a higher than average level of parliamentary representation.  With a population of more than 4.5 million and a combined D&aacute;il and Seanad of 226 Members our parliamentary representation level is one Member to 20,271 people.  That is out of line with other similar sized countries.  For example, in New Zealand the ratio is one Member to 35,000 people and in Denmark it is one Member to every 30,500 people.  It is worth noting that both of these countries have unicameral parliamentary systems.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amendment to the terms of reference of a constituency commission set out in the Bill will give a commission the option to recommend a set of D&aacute;il constituencies based on a minimum of 153 Members and a maximum of 160 Members.  While the provisions in the Bill will alter the terms of reference of a constituency commission the overriding constitutional provisions relating to the number of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and equality of representation will remain unchanged.</P>
        <P>Article 16.2.2&deg; of the Constitution provides that D&aacute;il representation &ldquo;shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty thousand of the population.&rdquo;  Article 16.2.3&deg; provides that &ldquo;The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.&rdquo;  Applying the constitutional provisions to the new population figure the minimum number of Deputies that can be recommended by a constituency commission, subject to enactment of the Bill by the Oireachtas, will be 153.  The maximum number will be 160.  Therefore, depending on what the commission recommends we will have a reduction in D&aacute;il membership of between six and 13 from the current number of 166 Members.</P>
        <P>There are eight possibilities in the range being given to a commission.  It is important to give this flexibility to a commission as it should assist it in adhering to the other terms of reference set out in the Electoral Act 1997.  These include avoiding the breaching of county boundaries as far as possible, ensuring that each constituency returns three, four, or five Members and endeavouring to maintain continuity in the arrangement of constituencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to note the savings that will be realised by reducing the number of Members.  The McCarthy report on public service numbers and expenditure programmes estimated a saving of approximately &euro;3 million with a reduction to 154 Deputies.  The estimate gives a good indication of the annual costs that can be expected to be saved by amending the terms of reference of the constituency commission in the manner proposed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The timing of the Bill is important.  The CSO published preliminary results for census 2011 approximately three weeks ago.  The publication of the results triggers the establishment by <Col N="715"/>me, as Minister, of a constituency commission.  I intend to formally establish the commission once the Bill has been enacted.  This will ensure that the commission will be working on devising a set of constituencies based on the reduced number of Deputies.  One of the key elements of the work of the constituency commission will be the consultation process which the commission must undertake.  The provisions of the Electoral Act 1997 require a commission to allow at least three months for the making of submissions to it.  With the commission commencing work on the basis of preliminary census data, greater time is now made available than in the past for consultation with interested organisations and individuals.  This will ensure a fuller opportunity for political and wider public input to the revision process and I urge people to avail of the opportunity to engage with the process when the commission invites submissions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The commission must complete its work not later than three months after the publication by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, of the final census results.  When the commission has presented its report to the Ceann Comhairle, it will be a matter for me to bring forward legislation to address the recommendations of the constituency commission.  This is likely to be in the autumn of 2012.  Constituencies that are enacted at that point would have effect only after the dissolution of the current, 31st, D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill also contains an amendment to the 1992 Electoral Act relating to the holding of D&aacute;il by-elections.  The amendment proposed ensures that steps are taken to hold a by-election to fill any vacancy if the D&aacute;il has not so moved within six months of the vacancy occurring.  The current provision relating to D&aacute;il by-elections requires the Ceann Comhairle to instruct the Clerk of the D&aacute;il to issue a writ for the filling of the vacancy as soon as the D&aacute;il so directs.  However, there is no timeframe within which the D&aacute;il must act on filling the vacancy.  This can and has led to some extraordinarily long delays in filling D&aacute;il vacancies, often for political expediency.  Recent examples include the 538 day duration of a vacancy in the Donegal South-West constituency, with Dublin South and Waterford not far behind at well over 300 days each.  Delays of this duration are simply not good enough in a parliamentary democracy.</P>
        <P>We must ensure that people are fully represented in the D&aacute;il even if this means taking measures to prevent Governments in power using their majority to further political objectives by blocking the filling of vacancies.  The people have a right to full democratic representation in their national parliament.  Preventing this, as has been done on a number of occasions over the years, only damages the reputation and integrity of Irish political institutions.  I spoke on this theme in the D&aacute;il just over 12 months ago when I introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill to address the situation.  Of course that Bill did not receive majority support so it never came before this House.  We ended up with the ridiculous and costly solution of citizens taking their case to the courts.  We should not have the situation again in the future where people must go to the courts to ensure that a by-election is held.  I am, therefore, taking the opportunity presented by this Bill to address the by-election issue directly.</P>
        <P>Specifically, the amendment I propose in this section is for a continuation of the existing arrangement during the six month period following the occurrence of the vacancy &mdash; namely, that the D&aacute;il, in its discretion, can direct the Ceann Comhairle to instruct the Clerk of the D&aacute;il to issue the writ at any time.  However, if the D&aacute;il has not availed of the opportunity during that six months, at the end of that period the Ceann Comhairle will be obliged to direct the Clerk of the D&aacute;il to issue the writ.</P>
        <P>This amendment will bring greater certainty to the process of filling vacancies.  While it will constrain the currently unfettered discretion of the D&aacute;il in this area, I believe a period of six months within which the D&aacute;il will retain that discretion is more than reasonable.  Providing for a shorter period within which the D&aacute;il would be obliged to act might be considered too restric<Col N="716"/>tive.  On the other hand, a longer period could not be justified when consideration is given to the general points I have already made regarding the people&rsquo;s right to full democratic representation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The third measure in the Bill seeks to reduce spending limits and the amount of expenses that can be reimbursed to a candidate at a presidential election.  As Senators will be aware, a presidential election is due to be held in 2011.  It must take place within the 60 days before the expiration of the term of office of the outgoing President &mdash; in other words, between 11 September and 10 November 2011.  It is, therefore, timely that the matter of the spending limit and the level of reimbursement of election expenses to apply to candidates be considered.</P>
        <P>The measures contained in the Bill will have the effect of reducing the maximum amount that can be reimbursed from the Exchequer to a presidential election candidate from &euro;260,000 to &euro;200,000.  The spending limit at the 2011 presidential election and all subsequent presidential elections is also to be reduced from &euro;1.3 million to &euro;750,000.</P>
        <P>The reduction in the reimbursement payments will save the Exchequer money that can be put to better use elsewhere.  While we do not know at this stage how many candidates are likely to contest the 2011 presidential election, were three candidates to qualify for a reimbursement payment at the maximum rate, the total saving would be &euro;180,000.</P>
        <P>In regard to the reduction in the spending limit, the cost to candidates of running a presidential election campaign would be reduced by up to &euro;550,000 per candidate.  While this will not save the Exchequer money, the reduction is of symbolic significance in reducing costs associated with the election of the President of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Candidates will have to run their respective election campaigns with reference to the reduced spending limits and moderate their election spending accordingly.  I remind Senators that the &euro;750,000 expenditure is a target which does not have to be met.  Political parties and candidates seeking election to office should lead by example.  This is only right given the times we are living in.</P>
        <P>The Bill makes provision in primary legislation, through the Electoral Act 1997, for the setting of the maximum payment that can be made to a presidential election candidate in respect of the reimbursement of expenses.  It sets out the qualifying criteria and the administrative arrangements for the making of payments.  The Bill replaces the existing provisions in the Electoral Act 1997, which required that arrangements for the reimbursement of election expenses be put in place by regulations made by the Minister.  SI 442 of 2004 had set the reimbursement level at &euro;260,000 and also specified the related administrative arrangements.  This statutory instrument is now repealed and its provisions are replaced by a new section 21A in the 1997 Act.  This new section largely replicates the administrative arrangements that were included in the statutory instrument.  The significant change is in respect of the maximum amount that can be claimed.</P>
        <P>The Bill will also have the effect of consolidating the legal arrangements for the payment of election expenses to candidates at a presidential election into primary legislation in the Electoral Act 1997 where there are equivalent existing provisions that apply in respect of elections to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Currently, a candidate who receives votes in excess of one quarter of the quota at a presidential election can claim a reimbursement of election expenses up to a maximum of <Col N="717"/>&euro;260,000.  After this or any election, an application is submitted through the Standards in Public Office Commission with payment being made by the Department of Finance through the Central Fund.  The same key qualifying criterion of receiving one quarter of the quota will apply under the revised provisions as will the administrative arrangements for submitting an application for payment.  There are similar arrangements in place for D&aacute;il and European Parliament elections.</P>
        <P>Section 21(2) of the Electoral Act 1997 made provision for the level of reimbursement to apply at a presidential election to be set by regulations made by the Minister.  These regulations came into effect on 14 July 2004 and first applied at the presidential election scheduled to take place in 2004.  In the event, President McAleese was returned unopposed and no claim or payment for the reimbursement of election expenses was made.</P>
        <P>With the spending limit at a presidential election being reduced from &euro;1.3 million to &euro;750,000 as part of this Bill, it is appropriate that the level of reimbursement of expenses be reduced also.  While there was no provision for the reimbursement of election expenses at the last contested presidential election in 1997, by applying the relevant qualifying criteria, three candidates would have been able to claim a reimbursement.  If three candidates qualify for the reimbursement, this would amount to a saving of &euro;180,000 in the current year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The programme for Government refers to the application of spending limits at a presidential election in the following terms: &ldquo;We will introduce spending limits for all elections, including Presidential elections and constitutional referendums, including for a period in advance of scheduled Local, European, General and Presidential elections&rdquo;.  At a presidential election, the agent of each candidate is required to furnish a statement of election expenses to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  This statement must be submitted within 56 days of polling day and must include details of the candidate&rsquo;s spending at a presidential election.  When running their campaign and submitting a statement of election expenses, candidates will now be required to stay within the revised spending limit of &euro;750,000.  It will be an offence for an election agent or candidate to exceed the spending limit.  This change will send out a strong signal that those involved in public life are committed to moderating their own expenditure, thereby showing a positive example to others.  Reducing the election spending limit is of symbolic significance in demonstrating the willingness of those involved in public life to scale back their own spending on elections.</P>
        <P>The existing section 53(1) of Part VI of the Electoral Act 1997 provided for the spending limit to apply at a presidential election to be specified by an order to be made by the Minister.  The order setting the spending limit at &euro;1.3 million was signed on 14 July 2004.  As I mentioned, President McAleese was returned unopposed in 2004 and, as a consequence, there are no data publicly available on spending at previous presidential elections.</P>
        <P>However, much has changed in this country since 2004 when the current spending limit was set and there is a clear case for its substantial reduction.  To do this requires that a change be made in the primary legislation.  That is why I propose to amend the Electoral Act 1997.  Bearing in mind the current economic circumstances facing the country, it is important that we lead by example and moderate our election spending.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will now outline briefly the specific contents of each section in the Bill.  Section 1 contains definitions.  Section 2 inserts a new section 39(2A) into the Electoral Act 1992.  The new provision provides that where, after a period of six months from the date of a vacancy arising in the D&aacute;il, the D&aacute;il has failed to direct the Chairman of the D&aacute;il to instruct the Clerk of the D&aacute;il to issue the writ for a by-election, the Chairman shall so instruct the Clerk as soon as is practicable.</P><Col N="718"/>
        <P Just="Left">Section 3 amends section 6(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Electoral Act 1997.  The amendment revises the terms of reference of a constituency commission which will now be required to recommend D&aacute;il constituencies based on a number of Members between 153 and 160.  The number of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann recommended by a commission will still be subject to the limits set out in the Constitution.</P>
        <P>Section 4 deletes the provisions currently in sections 21(2)(<i>a</i>) and 21(4) of the Electoral Act 1997 that enable the Minister to put in place regulations to provide for the reimbursement of expenses to a candidate at a presidential election.  Revised arrangements are being made in section 5 of the Bill, which will insert a new section, section 21A, into the Electoral Act 1997.</P>
        <P>Section 5 provides that the maximum amount that can be reimbursed to a candidate at a presidential election is &euro;200,000.  It makes provision in primary legislation, through the Electoral Act 1997, for the setting of the maximum payment that can be made to a presidential election candidate in respect of the reimbursement of expenses.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides that the spending limit at a presidential election shall not exceed &euro;750,000.  It makes provision in primary legislation, through an amendment to the Electoral Act 1997, for the spending limit to apply at a presidential election and replaces the existing section 53 of the 1997 Act.  Section 7 provides for consequential amendments to the Electoral Act 1997 arising from the provisions in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill.  Section 8 contains standard provisions of a general nature dealing with the Title, construction and citation of the Bill.</P>
        <P>It is very important that the reduced spending and reimbursement limits would apply to the presidential election this autumn.  To do this, the Bill needs to be enacted before the summer recess.  We have been facilitated by Oireachtas Members and by officials in scheduling this Bill for passage through the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and I appreciate those efforts.</P>
        <P>Senators will know that the Government has outlined an ambitious programme for constitutional and electoral reform.  The programme for Government commits to a radical overhaul of the way Irish politics and government work.  It set out a wide-ranging series of commitments to this end, a number of which are within my areas of responsibility as Minister.  I am committed to working with my Government colleagues and all Oireachtas Members to implement these measures in full.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and compliment him as being one of the few Ministers who appears in the House when legislation relating to his or her Department is being taken.  As he outlined, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2011 contains three important electoral reforms.  It amends the terms of reference of a constituency commission in section 6(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Electoral Act 1997 by providing that the number of Members of the D&aacute;il, subject to the relevant provisions of the Constitution &mdash; I will come back to this &mdash; shall not be fewer than 153 and not more than 160.  It also provides for the amendment to be made to section 39(2) of the Electoral Act 1992 to provide that the writ for a D&aacute;il by-election shall be issued within six months of the vacancy occurring.  In addition, it provides for amendments to the Electoral Act 1997 to provide for a reduction in the spending limit at a presidential election from &euro;1,300,000 to &euro;750,000 and for a reduction in the maximum amount that can be reimbursed to a candidate at a presidential election from &euro;260,000 to &euro;200,000.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister stated that the Government wished to reduce the size and cost of Government and the programme for Government has identified a &ldquo;clear need for our political system to embrace change, share the burden and lead by example&rdquo;.  He went on to state, under the heading of political reform, that change must start at the top.  I fully agree with that.  The <Col N="719"/>programme for Government states that &ldquo;the political system cannot ask others to change and make sacrifices if it is not prepared to do the same&rdquo;.  I also agree with that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister also stated that a number of commitments have been  made in the programme, including one to reduce significantly the size of the Oireachtas and to reduce the number of Deputies, following the publication of the 2011 census of population.  However, what the Minister did not say is that the Fine Gael manifesto stated clearly that Fine Gael in government would reduce the number of Deputies by 20.  This was a populist and cynical proposal which, by virtue of what the Minister has said here today, the Fine Gael Party had no intention of carrying out.  It also, of course, said that they would reduce the numbers of Ministers of State, which clearly did not happen.  Now the Minister proposes to reduce D&aacute;il membership to between 153 and 160, depending on what the  commission recommends.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister why the Government is not proposing to hold a referendum to reduce the number of Deputies by 20, as Fine Gael committed to do in its election manifesto.  The census results that were published on 30 June indicate that our population now stands at 4.5 million, an increase of 400,000 when compared with census 2006, which recorded Ireland&rsquo;s population at over 4.2 million.  Census 2006 confirmed that for the first time, our population rose above 4 million people since 1871.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My party is not in favour of reducing the number of Deputies and we will be opposing this measure.  We proposed, during the general election, a total reform package, not a piecemeal approach.  We proposed a single-seat constituency arrangement, supplemented by a list system which allowed for gender balance.  We also proposed an idea whereby if a member of the D&aacute;il was asked to serve in government an alternate would be placed to do his or her work as a Deputy.</P>
        <P>We have a very different system of governance in this country.  Our electorate, as the Minister is well aware, expect to meet their Deputies and Senators on a regular basis.  Deputies must hold multiple constituency clinics on a weekly basis and the electorate expect them to be there.  In England, our closest neighbour, Members of Parliament are elected to single seat constituencies.  Constituents are lucky if their MP visits the constituency once a month, I believe the average is about six times a year.  That system would not work in this country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to reform local government and give councillors back the powers the Oireachtas has taken from them.  My party is as guilty of that as any other.  I believe political reform should start with local government.  Is the Minister proposing to reduce the number of county and city councillors to be elected at the next local government election?  If the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, my party will oppose that.</P>
        <P>What are the terms of reference of the constituency commission?  I refer in particular to county boundaries.  The last commission was asked to adhere to county boundaries where possible and practical.  This resulted in County Leitrim being divided.  West Limerick is now part of Limerick and another part of Limerick went into Kerry North.  Other counties were also affected, such as south Offaly, east Carlow and north Waterford.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference should be changed in this regard and the commission should adhere to county boundaries.  There should be positive discrimination towards rural Ireland and we should look at four, five and even six seat constituencies where practical.</P>
        <P>I understand that the make-up of the commission is a judge, to be nominated by the Chief Justice, who will chair the commission, the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, the Clerk of the Seanad, the Ombudsman and the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Why is it necessary to have the Secretary General on this commission?  I suggest that there should be two independent members appointed &mdash; I could furnish the Minister with a few names &mdash; and that the Secretary General should not be a member.</P><Col N="720"/>
        <P>I welcome the amendment to the Electoral Act 1992 relating to the holding of D&aacute;il by-elections. The proposed amendment will ensure that a by-election to fill a vacancy in the D&aacute;il has to be moved within six months of the vacancy arising.  Throughout the decades, my party, the Minister&rsquo;s party and others have been responsible for delaying by-elections when it suited us.  I very much welcome this measure and I will fully support it.  The Minister referred to the court case that preceded the Donegal South-West by-election.  Is the Government persisting in appealing the High Court decision regarding the holding of the Donegal South-West by-election to the Supreme Court, in light of the proposed legislation?</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposal to reduce the spending limits and the amount of expenses that can be reimbursed to a candidate at a presidential election.  The Minister is proposing to reduce the maximum amount that can be reimbursed by the Exchequer to a presidential candidate from &euro;260,000 to &euro;200,000 and the spending limit from &euro;1.3 million to &euro;750,000.  I would propose reducing the figures to &euro;150,000 and &euro;500,000 respectively.</P>
        <P>We will be tabling a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  They will be practical and I hope the Minister will consider them.  We will not oppose Second Stage because the Bill contains a number of measures with which we agree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his comprehensive overview of the Bill and its contents.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on this important Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The publication of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill illustrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing improvements, something that has been long overdue.  In this House and in the D&aacute;il, we have become public representatives at a time when the public perception of politics in Ireland is at an all-time low.  Many people have lost trust in politicians and in our political system.  That does not come as a surprise to us.  It is a poor reflection on our democracy and civic participation that many people are largely unaware of the work done in either House, particularly the Seanad.  This should not be the case.  This is why reform is necessary.  I am very much in favour of the amendments proposed to reduce the number of Deputies by changing the terms of reference of the constituency commission, introduce a six month time limit for holding D&aacute;il by-elections and reduce the presidential election spending limits.</P>
        <P>By comparison with other European legislative chambers, Ireland is neither over-represented nor under-represented.  Generally, Legislatures in smaller European countries have more MPs per head of population than larger countries.  Nine countries, including Denmark, Finland, Belgium, Latvia and Sweden have a member representing between 15,000 and 35,000 of their respective populations.  Clearly, the scope is very wide and there is no consensus in comparative European terms as to the precise or ideal population to parliamentarian ratio.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Article 16.2.2&deg; of the Constitution states:  &ldquo;The number of members shall from time to time be fixed by law, but the total number of members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty thousand of the population&rdquo;.  That figure is the present constitutional benchmark and, based on the preliminary census results for this year, there could be a reduction of 13 Deputies.  However, that figure is subject to the final results of the latest census when they become available.  While the exact figure in respect of the reduction in the number of Deputies is undoubtedly important, we must not become too sidetracked and over-focus on one particular aspect of a wider political reform agenda.  The word &ldquo;reform&rdquo; has become widely used in Irish politics in recent times, particularly in the past few months.  This is definitely a very positive move for our democracy.</P><Col N="721"/>
        <P>The Government has tabled more political reform proposals than did the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments which held power for the previous 14 years.  There is an appetite among the public for change in the political system.  Fine Gael has recognised that and has responded to what the public wants.  It is difficult to engage in a debate on political reform without discussing the role of local government.  Some might claim that the latter should be the subject of a separate debate.  However, I am of the view that it is key to any discussion about reform in politics.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The role of local government is one that is under review by the Department.  The Minister indicated in the Lower House two weeks ago that the key objectives of the local government review include devolution of greater decision-making to local level, strengthening the powers and functions of local authorities, enhancing the development and leadership role of local Government and strengthening its structures.  The devolution of powers to local government is a much needed step if we are to make our political system more efficient.  It has also been suggested that the reduction in the number of Deputies can facilitate an individual Deputy in focusing on his or her national and legislative role.  In turn, this will encourage the devolution of powers to local government.  This would be a very healthy development that has been required for some time.  The work of Deputies and Senators is often very constituency-concentrated and too much of our time is spent focusing on local rather than on national issues.  We often forget that our primary role, as elected representatives at national level, is as legislators.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In his submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution, Professor David Farrell, in the context of the proposal to reduce the number of Deputies, advocated the creation of slightly larger constituencies of at least five members.  When one considers this idea, it makes sense.  The rationale behind the proportional representation single transferable vote system is that all parties, including the smaller ones, have an equal chance of their candidates being elected.  Political scientists such as Michael Gallagher, have discovered that the larger the district magnitude, or the number of seats per constituency, the more proportional will be election results.  In this regard, it seems logical that in reducing the number of Deputies we elect, we would consider constituency size.</P>
        <P>In the context of the second proposed amendment of the Bill, I would also welcome the introduction of a six-month time limit in respect of the holding of D&aacute;il by-elections.  We must never have a repeat of the events of last year, when a High Court ruling had to be handed down before the previous Government would take political responsibility for holding a by-election.  This was one of the many failings of the previous Administration.  What occurred was profoundly anti-democratic.  The six-month limit is a sufficient period in which to fill a seat that has become vacant.</P>
        <P>The third proposed amendment concerns presidential election costs and expenses.  The proposal to reduce spending limits for the presidential election from &euro;1.3 million to &euro;750,000 is a positive move.  Although it must be acknowledged that election costs can be high, there is no good reason why presidential candidates, as individuals, should run up bills that are excessive at a time when we are all conscious of our expenses.  It is not just presidential election spending that needs to be reduced.  We are spending more than should be the case at all elections &mdash; local, national and presidential.  I hope the Government will be in power for a five-year period.  During that time we should put a plan in place to reduce the wasting of financial resources on posters, advertising and other unnecessary election material.  I urge those responsible to ensure that inroads are made on this issue in the next couple of years.</P>
        <P>Every Member of the House is aware of the expense involved in running for elected office, be it to institutions such as town councils, the national Parliament or the European Parliament.  Political parties and candidates are funded through individual, corporate or union donations <Col N="722"/>governed by standards in public office, SIPO, regulations.  We must give careful consideration to the entire area of political donations.  It must be borne in mind that a complete ban on political donations would mean that candidates would be obliged to rely on their own resources in the absence of State funding.</P>
        <P>It is in no one&rsquo;s interest that participation in elections is only available to those who have personal wealth to fund extravagant campaigns.  Regardless of the model of funding upon which we decide, we must be conscious that if we are to ban donations, the State will inevitably be obliged to provide increased resources to fund elections.  It is time to have a proper debate on what it means to have State funding for political parties in our democracy.  Ireland is a democratic Republic and it is important, therefore, that an open and transparent debate should take place on this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The debate on the future of the Seanad is ongoing and further developments are awaited in respect of it.  We must consider reform proposals on how the House conducts its business.  Such a consideration is taking place and a number of significant changes were introduced to Standing Orders in recent weeks.  In a welcome innovation, the Minister for Agriculture, Marine and Food came before the House this morning and took part in a question and answer session which lasted a couple of hours.  The session was quite a success.</P>
        <P>Political reform must permeate all levels of representation, from town councils to the office of the President.  There is no need for cynical responses from any quarter on the matter of reform.  What is required is a positive, proactive approach from all parties.  If we are to strive for a fairer and more efficient political system, we must change it in such a way that is conducive to equal and proper representation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no harm in bringing forward reform in pieces, particularly when one considers that it is only summer and we have already done quite a lot.  It is to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government&rsquo;s credit that we are putting the Bill, which is a mechanism of reform, through the House in order that by the time the next general election takes place, the legislative position will have been amended.  It took courage to bring this legislation forward.  The Government could have waited but it did not do so.  It decided to act.  That should stand as the hallmark of the current Administration.  When Senators and Deputies canvassed during the recent election, the word &ldquo;change&rdquo; was on the lips of almost every member of the electorate.  Change is easy to discuss but extremely difficult to introduce.  Even the smallest of issues attract opposition.  Not least among such issues is that which relates to reducing the number of Deputies.</P>
        <P>I welcome the speed with which change is being introduced.  We are all too acutely aware of how important change is to those who voted in the general election.  Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the fact that people wanted change and were keen to see it occur.  It is difficult to <Col N="723"/>find ways to facilitate change.  In such circumstances, the move to reduce spending on presidential elections is welcome.  Let us be honest; it costs money to become involved in politics.  A few moments ago there was a little girl in the Visitors Gallery who was wearing a T-shirt with a big red heart on the front of it.  Perhaps she will run for the presidency one day.  The truth is, however, that if she has a great deal of talent and no money, she will not be able to gain election.  Money is one of the biggest barriers to becoming involved in politics.  Any reform we can introduce in the context of reducing the amount of money that can be spent on elections is welcome.  Reform is particularly welcome in the spirit in which the Minister intends it, namely, that the Government must show leadership at a time when there is little enough money available and that it should take all necessary steps to ensure that spending is reduced.  I welcome what is being done in this Bill because money is a barrier to people moving into politics, particularly as it costs money to gain election.</P>
        <P>I am not naive enough to suggest that candidates can gain election in the absence of funding.  The latter is simply not possible.  It costs money to travel throughout one&rsquo;s constituency or around the country.  The electorate must decide whether, in the future, candidates should travel about in battle buses and use rosettes, balloons and confetti during their campaigns &mdash; as is the case in the US &mdash; or whether they should continue to adopt the more basic approach which has obtained up to now.  We are slowly developing a process for the running of elections which is becoming more Americanised.  Every time we do that we are acquiescing to the idea that running an election is extremely expensive.  That is a cause for concern.  I welcome the fact that this proposal will reduce the amount candidates can spend in an election and perhaps bring us back to a more basic form of campaigning.  Having said that, candidates have a responsibility to ensure the electorate is well informed.  People who present themselves for election to public office are obliged to inform the public of their intentions and what they stand for.  We must bear in mind that meeting that obligation costs money.</P>
        <P>Reform in this area has been introduced in a piecemeal fashion.  The Standards in Public Office Commission sets the rules regarding the conduct of elections, but those rules are retrospective in that there is no policing of expenditure during the course of an election.  That is a problem because although the limits are set, there are some who breach them and find ways around them.  There is no way, for example, that a concerned member of the public can report such breaches at the time they are made.  The Standards in Public Office Commission does not perform that role.  Although it is probably not possible to make provision for such a role in this legislation, it is something we might consider at a later date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the proposal to ensure by-elections are held within six months of a vacancy arising.  This sensible amendment to the existing legislation will prevent the type of political point-scoring that occurred last year and ensure Government parties cannot defer a by-election for the purpose of shoring up their own parliamentary strength.  Such behaviour is an abuse of the Constitution.</P>
        <P>The proposal to reduce the number of Deputies in the Lower House is welcome.  Contrary to the generally held view, it may well be the case that in a European context, Irish voters are neither under nor over-represented.  The data can be interpreted in many different ways, but we are certainly not as out of step with Europe as some would have us believe.  When one includes Senators and councillors and the personal way in which politics is conducted in Ireland, it is clear that one is never far from a public representative.  We need to reduce the number of public representatives in total.  This legislation is the first step in a process which should also include reform of local government.</P>
        <P>It is has been argued that a reduction in the number of Deputies will mean there is less likelihood of the Executive being held to account.  That is true, but it is a far cry from suggesting <Col N="724"/>that the reduction will give rise to insufficient numbers of Deputies to perform that role.  While it is a very important task, the fact that there will be fewer Deputies does not mean it cannot be done.  On that basis, it is a rogue argument.</P>
        <P>The point has also been made that there will be fewer Deputies to perform important parliamentary work, particularly committee work.  However, the reality is that less is usually more, with smaller groups often showing greater efficiencies than larger ones.  People find ways of being more efficient when their numbers are reduced.  That type of efficiency will ultimately lead to more work being done.  Although it is always difficult to tell a certain group of people that their numbers will be reduced, as is happening often these days, we will achieve more efficiency, in this context, through a reduction.  It will undoubtedly cause problems for sitting Deputies, but no Deputy owns his or her seat.  If we genuinely want more efficient and cost effective governance, a reduction in the number of Deputies is an important step in achieving it.  Greater efficiencies will be found and there might even be an increase in the output of work from the Oireachtas.  However, it is important that the reduction is implemented fairly and that equitable representation is ensured across the country.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for facilitating the speedy passage of these welcome proposals through the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  As a former Member of this House, it is good to see that his distinguished political career continues to flourish.  There is a long history of controversy and disagreement whenever electoral amendment Bills come before either House because they relate to a sensitive issue for politicians.  This Bill is no different in that regard.  I support much of what my friend and colleague, Senator Diarmuid Wilson, said, but I disagree entirely with Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s reference to justifying piecemeal legislation.  I did not see any particular reason for rushing this legislation.  The Minister, quite correctly, has triggered the obligation on any Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, once the preliminary census results are released, to establish an independent electoral commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is my understanding that Article 16.2.2&deg; of the Constitution specifies that the total number of Deputies shall, under current census data, be not less than 164 and no more than 168.  There are references throughout the Bill to the effect that its provisions are subject to constitutional provisions.  Am I incorrect on this point or is the Minister going to act on the provisions of the Bill, once enacted, by triggering an increase in the constitutionally specified limit on the number of constituents per Deputy, which will allow the provisions in the Bill to be implemented?  It is interesting to note that the Minister&rsquo;s own constituency now has the highest number of people per Deputy, at 27,598, with a national average of 26,749 and Senator Diarmuid Wilson&rsquo;s constituency of Cavan-Monaghan having the lowest number, at 24,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator suggesting that part of Leitrim should go into that constituency?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am coming to that.  It was also interesting to discover that Laois, because of its extraordinary increase in population, now has sufficient numbers for four seats.  This suggests either that Laois-Offaly will end up as two three-seaters or that Laois will have four seats of its own.</P>
        <P>County Leitrim has had a sorry history in the area of constituency amendments.  It has been sundered by successive electoral commissions and by various Governments before that, prior to the establishment of the independent commission system.  Every commission that has been established thus far has given an undertaking that county boundaries will be protected, with <Col N="725"/>the let-out clause that this principle will be adhered to &ldquo;in so far as is possible&rdquo;.  A great deal of controversy was generated by the decision to split Leitrim and both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael made submissions to the then commission in regard to the division of the county.  I strongly disagreed with my party&rsquo;s position on this issue.  I do not know what happened in terms of the consultation process in Fine Gael, but there was no such process in Fianna F&aacute;il.  If that is letting out State secrets, I do not care.  Nobody was consulted and I do not even know who took the decision.  It seems to have been presented at a Cabinet meeting as a <i>fait accompli</i> and subsequently became policy.</P>
        <P>The legacy of that is the deep psychological scars in the county, apart altogether from the emotional element of it.  I hope the Minister will tighten up the terms of reference of the electoral commission in order to ensure a more concrete consideration of the protection of county boundaries than a requirement that they be preserved &ldquo;in so far as is possible&rdquo;.  There is no question that we will be under threat, with the Minister indicating that there will be a reduction in the number of county councillors.  This suggests that Leitrim will, at some point, find itself merged with another county.</P>
        <P>I do not understand the rationale for permitting no more than five seats per constituency.  In the early years of the State larger constituencies were the norm, with Sligo-Leitrim having seven seats in the 1920s and 1930s.  What was so wrong with that?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and he probably did so for nakedly political reasons.  Just because something has become practice does not mean it should not be reviewed.</P>
      
        <P>I know it is set in stone, but I think it is worth looking at in the context of the terms of reference of the boundary commission and maintaining county boundaries.  There may be a way around it.  Should counties Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon become a six or seven-seater constituency, at least there is a county identity and the feeling is that people would vote in line with the county boundaries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is there a possibility, or is it even on the radar that the dual mandate could be restored?  I believe this is an antidemocratic measure, not in the interests of efficient government, and it should be open to discussion.  Senators from all sides have spoken on efficient government.  With a reduced number of Deputies, and the reduction in the number of committees, yet with the enormous number of committee mandates, I cannot see that there will be more accountability in the Government, if this Chamber is abolished.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to the Bill, which is the first step in reforming the Oireachtas and the local authorities.  Many would have campaigned in the last general election &mdash; I certainly did &mdash; on the need for reform because if we are not <Col N="726"/>prepared to change, we cannot ask others to change.  Never before has there been such an appetite for reform among the electorate and the Oireachtas members.  Everybody wants to see change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not just about cost cutting.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, stated: &ldquo;The McCarthy report on public service numbers and expenditure programmes estimated a saving of approximately &euro;3 million with a reduction to 154 Deputies.&rdquo;  This is not an insignificant amount but it is more about efficiency of services. In my constituency, comprising four electoral areas, there were five D&aacute;il Deputies and two Senators, a total of seven members of the Oireachtas. Quite often one could have up to 14 public representatives at some of those meetings, which was an inefficient use of resources. I would not agree with the criticism of the Bill as piecemeal legislation; it is a start and I am sure we will see much more from the Minister. I know his reforming zeal and he is sharpening his knives and getting ready to move across the board. </P>
        
        
        <P>There are three issues covered in the Bill, the first relating to a reduction in the number of Deputies, which will become relevant now that the census has been produced and the constituency commission is to be established.  The terms of reference of that commission will reflect the elements of the legislation when it is enacted.</P>
        <P>The presidential election will take place in a few months, in either October or November, and we are well on the way in that campaign.  Some candidates have been established.  The spending limits will be relevant to their campaign.  The by-election can take place at any time.  It was an absolute disgrace in the previous D&aacute;il that the people of counties Donegal and Waterford and South Dublin were without representation for a long period.  I acknowledge that the then Senator Pearse Doherty took a case to court that ensured the people in Donegal had their by-election.  We will have legislation in place that by-elections will be triggeredin a period of six months, if the writ has not been moved.  That is an important step for democracy.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
<P Just="Left">I was very pleased to see that the population has increased beyond expectation to 4.58 million, which is the highest it has ever been since 1851.  We have one Deputy per 27,000 of population.  The figure I would have had in my head is that we had a Deputy for every 20,000.  We can push it to one Deputy for every 30,000 people and I think it is important to introduce such efficiency across the 43 constituencies we have at present.  We do not know how they will end up after the next commission.  At the last census the percentage of population living in Leinster was 54%, again we saw an increase in the greater Dublin area and in Leinster.  In the Cork area we lost one seat as a result of the last census and we are down to 19 seats.  I have a suspicion that we will lose another seat which I see will go to the east.  Similarly, in the Kerry North-Limerick West constituency, one seat went to the east.  Looking at where D&aacute;il seats are gives a quick picture of population density and where it is based.  It will be tricky for the commission.  It is important to keep five-seat constituencies and I am not averse to six-seat constituencies.  They have proven to support smaller parties, which gain seats in larger constituencies, and it is important to have this in our PR-STV system to ensure representation across the board and that smaller parties are not frozen out.  I have much more to say but I see the Acting Chairman is looking at me.  I know we will have an opportunity for discussion with the Minister on Committee Stage tomorrow and on Report Stage.  I welcome this Bill and it marks a progression on the road of much needed reform of our representative system.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and acknowledge that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government attended the Chamber on <Col N="727"/>a number of occasions when issues concerning his portfolio were being debated.  That is important and should be welcomed.  I look forward to the support of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for the Waterford constituency remaining a four-seat constituency.  For that to happen, part of occupied north Waterford must be brought into the Waterford constituency.  There is a proposal that everything from across the bridge to Rosbercon and New Ross should be within the Waterford constituency for it to remain a four-seat constituency.  I am sure the Acting Chairman agrees with me.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>We must ask ourselves whether the reforms we intend to implement are designed to make institutions more democratic and inclusive, to make sure we have better representation, to ensure we have more women in elected positions and in power and to make sure we have effective governance.  Effective governance is the most important point.  Considering the economic crisis that has been building up for the past ten years, one of the charges levelled against the political system is that it was asleep at the wheel and that there was insufficient accountability and scrutiny.  We saw that in the context of the political system and the regulatory system.  Many people argue we have a deficit of proper accountability and scrutiny in this State.  For those reasons, I am somewhat sceptical about the proposals of this Government in the Bill.  The Minister will not agree with me but this is part of an election gimmick, something promised by the Taoiseach and the Government in the run-up to an election.  He went down the populist road by proposing to abolish the Seanad, cutting the number of Deputies by 20 and abolishing a number of local authorities.  If we follow that path, we will end up with less scrutiny.  If we abolish this House and have fewer Deputies, there will be less scrutiny and oversight.  Following that with fewer councillors and a weakened local government system will make a bad situation worse.  If the Government was serious about reducing the number of Deputies and ensuring there was an enhanced system of governance, it would start by improving local government.  It should not reduce numbers but give more powers to local authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the arguments for reducing the number of Deputies is cost.  Sinn F&eacute;in has made proposals for reducing the salaries of Deputies and Senators and doing away with the expenses and allowances available to Chairmen of committees and Whips.  I was informed last week that, as a Member of this House and as someone who served on a local authority, I am entitled to claim &euro;23,000 when I reach the age of 50.  I hope I will be a Member of the Lower House at that stage but other Senators are over the age of 50 and have received the payment.  They can leave the local authority on election to this House, receive a generous salary along with expenses and allowances and also receive a payment from a cash-strapped local authority.  These are the issues the public want us to deal with.  If it is a case of saving money, let us start with those expenses.  We should start at the top and properly reform the system to do away with the outrageous expenses that were available to politicians.  These were put in place in a different era and we are in a different place now.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have tabled a number of amendments and I will get to the substance of our proposals later.  Like previous speakers, I support four-seat, five-seat and six-seat constituencies.  The worst thing that could happen is if we move to a two-party state.  From my perspective, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party are one party.  There is little difference between them, as we see in the programme for Government.  It is a case of continuing the policies of the previous Government.  We need political diversity in this country and if the Government parties consider reducing the number of Deputies and abolishing this House, they will take away the independent voices in this Chamber.  I refer to people appointed by the Taoiseach who add value to this House, such as Senator Crown, who has a strong background in health and can bring a <Col N="728"/>different perspective to the Chamber.  If that was lost, it would be a sad day for the country, the democratic system and the idea of empowering the institutions of the State.  For those reasons, I oppose the Bill.</P>
        <P>I have been told by the Leader of the House that the changes we propose to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges require changes to Standing Orders and that this was not possible.  Standing Orders seem to be very precious to the Leader for some reason and, in keeping with that, I call for a quorum.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators on all sides of the House for their contributions to the debate.  The comments focused both on the Bill and, as might be expected, the electoral agenda generally.  In the time available it is not possible for me to comment on all the points made.  I propose to respond to some of the issues raised and further discussions will take place on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>I welcome the strong support evident during the debate for the measures in the Bill.  Those provide for the holding of D&aacute;il by-elections within six months of a vacancy occurring and a reduction in the spending and reimbursement limits that apply in presidential elections.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Different views were offered in the debate on the proposal to change the terms of reference of a constituency commission to provide for a reduction in the number of Members in the D&aacute;il.  Many speakers were very supportive.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, stated that the political system cannot ask others to change and make sacrifices if it is not prepared to do the same.  The reduction in the number of Deputies is a first step along the path of electoral reform.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The programme for Government commits to a radical overhaul of the way Irish politics and Government works.  It sets out a wide-ranging series of commitments to that end.  The Minister is committed to working with his Government colleagues and with all the Oireachtas Members to implement these measures fully.</P>
        <P>The Bill before us deals with three specific issues which will bring about real and meaningful change but that is not all.  In addition to the Bill before the House, on 8 June 2011 the Minister published the general scheme of the Electoral (Amendment)(Political Donations) Bill 2011.  Provision is made in that Bill for the restriction of corporate donations, a reduction in the amount that can be received as political donations, and a reduction in the thresholds for declaring political donations.  Political parties will now also be required to submit their annual accounts to the Standards in Public Office Commission for publication.</P><Col N="729"/>
        <P>The new legislation includes a provision that political parties will face a cut of half their State political funding if they do not have at least 30% female and 30% male candidates at the next general election.  That will then rise to 40% after seven years.</P>
        <P>In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reform the way legislation is debated and implemented, the Minister will publish the general scheme and invite public input into its contents.  We can look forward to debating that Bill in the House in the autumn.</P>
        <P>The proposal to abolish the Seanad was signalled by the Government parties prior to the general election.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to put that question to the people in a referendum.  Work is proceeding in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department on the preparation of proposals for such a referendum.  The D&aacute;il and Seanad will have an opportunity to fully debate the legislation when it is published.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer briefly to concerns raised by some Senators regarding specific recommendations.  Senator Wilson and Senator Mooney discussed the fact that the county of Leitrim is split between two constituencies.  Senator Wilson referred to the decision of the last commission on the Kerry-Limerick region.  We must bear in mind that constituency formation is not a perfect science.  People do not always live in the areas that would enable constituencies to be drawn up which meet with general approval.  The overriding constitutional requirement of equality and representation means that breaches of obvious boundaries are unavoidable in certain circumstances.</P>
        <P>In the revision process somebody&rsquo;s interest must inevitably be affected.  That is the price we must pay for our electoral system which has generally served us very well.  I have no doubt that when the next commission issues its recommendations some people will be unhappy.  The general consensus, however, is that the job should be instructed to an independent commission.  That being the case the commission should be allowed to do the job in the way that seems best to it within the terms of reference given to it.</P>
        <P>Difficult choices have been made in the past and will be made in the future.  It is open to anyone to make a submission to the commission and having considered the options, the commission will make its decision.  The Senators or I might make a different choice but we cannot fault the commission for that.  It carries out its task in accordance with the mandate given to it.</P>
        <P>During the course of the debate many Senators referred to the need for real reform of local government.  I strongly agree.  I am happy to say that a range of work relevant to local government reform is under way.  The Minister recently established an independent implementation group to progress the relevant recommendations of the local government efficiency review in areas such as shared services, procurement, value for money, and audit.  He has asked the group to build on the extensive efficiencies achieved by local authorities in the past two years or more and to focus on key recommendations that will remove cost and yield earliest financial savings for the benefit of the sector and the community.</P>
        <P>In terms of structural reform, good progress has been made.  The Government recently decided to implement the main recommendations of the Limerick local government committee involving the creation of a single local authority to replace Limerick city and county councils.  That historic decision will lead to the first major change in local government in years.  It will bring about a more cohesive and better integrated system of local government for Limerick city and county, with the potential to provide better value for money, eliminate duplication and free up financial and human resources for critical projects such as the revitalisation of Limerick city centre.</P>
        <P>The Minister is also considering wider proposals to renew and develop the local government system.  Key objectives in this regard include devolution of greater decision making to local level, strengthening the powers and functions of local authorities, enhancing the development <Col N="730"/>and leadership role of local government, and strengthening its structures and funding arrangements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Relevant proposals in recent reports, including the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes and the local government efficiency review, will be taken into account in the development of policy in this area.  The Minister will also publish a policy statement on local government that will outline Government policy in this area in line with the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>I stress again the Government&rsquo;s commitment to electoral and political reform.  This Bill is a first step in that reform agenda.  I thank the Senators again for their contributions.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes that:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the social, personal and health education, SPHE, programme, incorporating relationships and sexuality education, RSE, has been a mandatory part of the curriculum in all primary and junior cycle post-primary schools since 2003;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />all schools are obliged to have an agreed school policy and a suitable RSE programme in place for senior cycle students;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />a recent forum in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in on Working Together to Promote Positive Mental Health, attended by representatives of the relevant stakeholders including young people, highlighted the need for schools to play their part in this crucial aspect of growing into adulthood;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />this forum pointed to the centrality of the RSE programme for promoting positive mental health in our young people and that the effective implementation of such a programme in all schools was critical to the development of active, fully rounded and responsible citizens;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />forum participants pointed out that in some schools the senior cycle was dominated by the examination system which often had a distorting effect on the priority afforded to the social, personal and health development of the pupils, thereby contributing to a poor and inconsistent delivery of the RSE programme;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the quality and inconsistency of the implementation of the SPHE programme in some of our schools and, in particular, the narrow focus of the RSE programme being experienced by many senior cycle pupils has given rise to concern;</P>
        <P LI="1">and calls on:</P><Col N="731"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the Minister for Education and Skills to give serious and sustained attention to redress this imbalance and to ensure that our education system responds to all of the developmental needs of each individual pupil.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I am pleased to introduce this motion, which deals with the difficulties being experienced by some of our school pupils with the quality and consistency of their schools&rsquo; implementation of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, programme and the relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programme.  The object of the motion is to highlight the collective responsibility we have to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s education system is playing the best part it can in assisting our young people to have a solid foundation for the emotional, social, psychological and physical aspects of growing up which adequately covers education about relationships, human sexuality, sexual health and mental well-being.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Both the SPHE and RSE programmes have been mandatory in all primary and junior cycle post-primary schools since 2003.  In addition, all schools are required to have an agreed policy on SPHE.  The SPHE curriculum at primary level is designed to foster, in an age appropriate way, the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child.  The junior cycle SPHE curriculum builds on this at second level.  For senior cycle students, all schools are obliged to have an agreed school policy and a suitable RSE programme in place.  It should include in-depth coverage of issues such as relationships, accepting sexual orientation, pregnancy, family planning, contraception, responsible parenthood, implications of sexual activity, sexually transmitted diseases, as well as sexual harassment and assault.</P>
        <P>When done well, SPHE provides students with dedicated time and space to develop the skills and competences needed to care for themselves and others.  It provides them with the information and insight to make informed decisions about their health, personal lives and social development.  The old way of seeing health as merely the absence of illness or disease has today been overtaken by a much broader view in which physical health is just one element along with emotional, mental, spiritual, social and sexual health.  Adolescence makes huge demands on all these aspects of health, and all are very relevant to the SPHE and RSE curricula.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, figures given in the 2009 D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g survey show that, in the respondents&rsquo; schools, almost three quarters of senior cycle pupils did not have RSE classes in that year and in 85% of these schools RSE was not timetabled as a class.  It may shock Members to discover that recent studies and surveys reveal that the priority issue for our young people is their mental health.  I had the privilege recently of attending a useful forum in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in entitled Working Together to Promote Positive Mental Health. It focused on young people and some very inspirational people of diverse ages shared their life experiences, allowing us to drill deeply into aspects of the mental health of our young people.</P>
        <P>Many participants pointed to the centrality of the RSE programme in encouraging positive mental health in our young people.  All acknowledged that responsibility for mental health does not lie solely with the statutory mental health services but that the consistent and effective implementation of SPHE and RSE programmes has a critical contribution to make and at an important juncture in young lives.  It must be acknowledged that considerable good work in SPHE and RSE curriculum development has been done, and continues to be done, by the Department of Education and Skills.</P>
        <P>Our cadre of teachers is nationally and internationally recognised as being of the highest calibre with a huge commitment to the holistic education of pupils.  The Department provides regular professional development for teachers, supported by guidelines and other resources.  Schools have access to the National Educational Psychological Service and post-primary schools have access to guidance counsellors.  The SPHE and RSE programmes are evaluated by the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate as part of its whole school evaluation process.  However, despite <Col N="732"/>these very positive factors and for whatever reasons, the quality and consistency of the delivery of these programmes remain a matter of serious concern.</P>
        <P>Some experts point to barriers to implementation that arise, such as lack of a pre-service qualification for second level teachers in RSE in particular, the personal discomfort of some teachers when dealing with matters of sexuality, concerns with regard to possible conflict with the ethos of the school, lack of consistent co-ordination or leadership within schools or the dominance of the school academic examination system, as being among a range of reasons for the problems that persist.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This House has a role to play in ensuring that, alongside their vocational and academic training, our young people&rsquo;s education for life is sensitive and sympathetic to their whole human development in order that they can enter adulthood with the coping skills and personal resilience buffers which sustain good mental health.  Serious and sustained attention is now needed to redress contemporary imbalances and to ensure that our education system is implementing consistently and effectively the SPHE and RSE curricula which were designed to meet the development needs of each individual pupil.  I hope the House will see merit in supporting the motion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion.</P>
        <P>I will focus my remarks on the post-primary cycle in particular.  Section 4 of the rules and programme for secondary schools requires schools to have an agreed policy for relationship and sexuality education and a suitable relationship and sexuality education programme in place for all students at both junior and senior cycle.  That statement is taken from the Department&rsquo;s website.  However, is this the case?  That is the reason we are discussing the issue this evening.  Do we know for a fact that all schools are complying with this requirement?  The reason we put down this motion is to alert ourselves and the public to a requirement and necessity for us all to be vigilant as sexuality is becoming increasingly mediated by the Internet.  At junior cycle, the RSE programme is part of social, personal and health education, SPHE.  It is the responsibility of the school board of management to ensure that a RSE programme is made available to all students.  As Senator Martin McAleese outlined, the aims of SPHE, as part of the curriculum, supports personal development, health and well-being of young people and helps them to create and maintain supportive relationships.  This is a part of the junior cycle and RSE is taught within this module.</P>
        <P>An excellent report was published in 2007 by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and the then Department of Education and Science on RSE in the context of SPHE.  It was an assessment of the challenges to full implementation of the programme in post-primary schools.  It was carried out between November 2004 and January 2006 and it is still the most comprehensive study of relationships and sexuality education conducted in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is clear and unequivocal is the importance of school-based relationship and sexuality education.  It does not negate the role of parents or families but, according to previous studies, Irish teenagers strongly support classes that deal with relationships and sexuality.  The aim of <Col N="733"/>RSE, according to policy guidelines, is to acquire a knowledge and understanding of human relationships and sexuality through processes which enable them to form values and establish behaviours within a moral, spiritual and social framework.</P>
        <P>The programme does not seek to tell young people what they should think, say and do in their sexual lives but it seeks to foster students&rsquo; personal and sexual development holistically, with reference to the range of social and societal influences that can have an impact on how young people think and feel about their personal, romantic and sexual relationship.</P>
        <P>The research in this study found that in Ireland, there is a lack of confidence among young people in the school-based sex education to which they are exposed, if they are exposed to it at all.  A most interesting finding on the barriers to good teaching of RSE is its low status in the school curriculum and this was a concern in 2007 when this report was published.  It was found that only 60% of schools surveyed had a RSE policy.  Some 30% of schools reported not teaching RSE in third year, 43% in fifth year and 48% at leaving certificate level.  Do we have any further baseline data available to us in 2011?  Has it receded or has it increased?</P>
        <P>This morning I texted my daughter, who is now going into transition year.</P>

	<P>I did not know one could call a friend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I sent her a text asking if she had received relationship and sexuality education in school and saying that I had to speak in the Seanad.  I received a reply very quickly saying they never got anything like that and that the only thing they got was in sixth class.  I will not go through how she spelled all of that.  Essentially, her last relationship and sexuality education class was in the sixth class, some three years ago.  She is now going into transition year but without receiving one such class.</P>
        <P>My eldest daughter has just finished six years in secondary school and the only time there was any engagement around sexuality was in leaving certificate biology class.  That is astonishing.  I am privileged to be a middle class person and to have been able to send her to the school to which I wanted to send her but we are dealing with an issue which has a great impact on the mental health of our young people.</P>
        <P>The barriers to RSE are also referred to in the report which provides interesting statistics and which I am sure the Minister knows.  It surveyed &ldquo;very important&rdquo; to &ldquo;quite important&rdquo; factors preventing full RSE implementation in post-primary schools.  Some 82% of schools agreed that the overcrowded curriculum was a barrier.  Some 71% agreed that the need to complete so many courses in so many subjects was a barrier.  Some 71% agreed that the discomfort of some teachers teaching RSE was a barrier.  That is quite high and refers to a deficit in the training of post-primary teachers, to which I will refer later.   The final barrier to RSE implementation was the pressure of examination subjects.  My daughters deserve full access to RSE in school.</P>
        <P>What are the next steps?  We would like an updated and complete audit on what is happening in schools with regard to RSE.  School principals are key opinion formers in the education system.  I understand the Minister is about to change a significant portion of school boards and change patronage.  It is an opportunity to let boards of management know that RSE should be seen as a priority and not left to schools&rsquo; own devices.  Principals should be encouraged to drive and implement SPHE and RSE as a priority and perhaps tie it into the Croke Park deal.  Greater productivity in this area will make a healthier society.</P>
        <P>Currently, if one trains to be a secondary school teacher, one does not have to do the SPHE or RSE module, unlike primary teachers.  Approximately six years ago, the OECD recom<Col N="734"/>mended that post-primary teacher training in RSE should be concurrent and not consecutive and, therefore, optional &mdash; in other words, when one does one&rsquo;s Higher Diploma in Education, one does not have to engage in RSE training.  That is a deficit which could be linked to the Croke Park deal.</P>
        <P>There is an obvious link to the positive mental health of our young people and how sexuality and development are taught in schools.  We should have another debate in the Seanad early in 2012 when the Minister has an opportunity to come back with recommendations and an audit on the progress of the recommendations of the 2007 report.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>My young son is going into sixth year and went to Oxygen a couple of weeks ago.  My 13 year old daughter told him not to be silly and to wrap his sandwiches, although she did not use that word.  I was very impressed by that.  The programme in primary school and for junior cycle in secondary school in relationship and sexuality education is quite good, and I speak as a primary school principal.</P>
        <P>Some years ago I became involved in a project with the former North Eastern Health Board to pilot what was called &ldquo;sex education&rdquo; in the primary school of which I was principal.  I called a meeting of parents to introduce the project, with staff from the health board in attendance.  Midway through the presentation, I got a dig in the back from one of the parents who said she was very unhappy.  She asked me if I knew with whom she was unhappy.  She said she was unhappy with me and that ended the project at that time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Thankfully, things have moved on since and relationship and sexuality education is now an integral part of the curriculum in primary school and at junior certificate level in secondary school.  I am disappointed after all these years that not all schools have signed up and are teaching the Stay Safe programme.  There is much pressure on schools from the Department of Education and Skills to take part in that programme, and rightly so.  I hope that continues until every school in the country is takes part in the programme.</P>
        <P>However, the programme for the senior cycle is, to say the least, patchy.  If implemented, it occurs in transition year.  Senator Mac Conghail spoke about his daughter.  I have a daughter who has just finished her leaving certificate and who had a good relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programme in Mrs. Moran&rsquo;s school.  I beg your pardon, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I mean Senator Moran&rsquo;s school.  I am making all sorts of mistakes today.  Whatever about the relationships and sexuality education young girls receive in the senior cycle, I think the 71% of teachers who are uncomfortable teaching relationships and sexuality programmes are concentrated in all-boys schools.  Even in the junior cycle, in all-boys schools there is little concentration on relationships and sexuality programmes.  We are lucky in Dundalk that we have organisations like the Apple Tree Foundation which deals with young adults outside school.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support the motion 100% and commend the Independent Senators for bringing it to the House.  This is an important time in young people&rsquo;s lives.  I ask the Minister, not only to take the motion on board but also to ensure that the Stay Safe and the relationships and sexuality programmes in the schools are implemented and that a policy is in place and the programmes taught in all schools.  I do not think the Department inspectorate deals with this subject in whole-school inspections.  It might be an idea to put it on the list of things inspectors survey when they do whole-school inspections.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber for the second time in two days.  We are very privileged and we hope we will see him frequently in the future.</P><Col N="735"/>
        <P>I thank the Independent Senators for tabling such an important motion.  Last week, the Minister published a consultation report on young people&rsquo;s views of the junior certificate programme.  In that report the social personal and health education, SPHE, programme was one of the issues on which they placed most stress.  They said they wanted more and better SPHE classes to cover more areas.  When asked which subjects they felt should be compulsory at junior certificate level they cited SPHE, civic, social and political education, CSPE, English and mathematics.  Of those subjects, the first is very personal and the second relates to politics and society.  It is interesting that when young people were asked what skills they needed for 21st century Ireland, these are the ones they identified.  It is excellent that our focus this evening is on such an important area.</P>
        <P>Other speakers have referred to the value of a broad education, which is something about which I feel strongly.  In today&rsquo;s world, it is important that we equip young people, not only academically but also with the personal and social skills they need to be happy, particularly during their adolescence but also as adults, to become caring and responsible members of society and to develop confidence and self-esteem.  The SPHE curriculum has an important role to play in this.</P>
        <P>It is also important for young people to become more aware of the importance of mental health and to be prepared to reach out and ask for help if they have a problem.  President McAleese recently opened the forum, &ldquo;Working Together for Positive Youth Mental Health&rdquo; and Senator McAleese opened this evening&rsquo;s debate.  The motion refers to that forum.  We owe a debt to Donal &Oacute;g Cusack, who spoke at the opening of the forum about how difficult it was for him to come out and to deal with his sexuality as a younger person.</P>
        <P>The Minister recently launched guidelines on homophobic bullying in schools.  That is an equally important initiative.  We must have an effective strategy to deal with bullying in all its forms.  However, the instances of homophobic bullying are much more frequent than bullying in general.  Speakers have spoken of the preparedness of teachers to deal with issues that come up in schools.  At the launch of the guidelines, the Minister referred to young people&rsquo;s instancing inappropriate comments by teachers as having hurt them more than comments by their peers.  This is central to this debate.  We must make sure that adults in schools are equipped to deal with issues such as sexuality and relationships.</P>
        <P>The Government strategy for improving mental health services, A Vision for Change, acknowledges adolescence as a key stage of psychological development, when children require an understanding of the life challenges they face and need to develop basic skills to cope with difficult emotions.  We all remember our teenage years.  It is a time of increased risk of poor mental health.  There is a general anxiety that everyone goes through as a teenager, but some face issues such as depression, eating disorders and body image, which is a constant issue for girls but increasingly for many young men.  It is a time of increased risk for young people.  Studies have found that one in four Irish teenagers has experienced serious personal, emotional, behavioural or mental health problems and that one in ten has deliberately harmed him or herself.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of youth suicide in the European Union.  We must redouble our efforts to address this problem, and schools have an important part to play.</P>
        <P>It is important that, through the SPHE curriculum, we encourage young people to speak out and ask for help if they need it and also that we equip them with the skills they need to identify friends who are at risk, spot warning signs and know the agencies where help might be available.</P>
        <P>Other Members discussed the patchy implementation of the SPHE and RSE programmes.  I know the Minister is carrying out reviews of every school subject and that schools often complain about an overcrowded curriculum.  I return to the fact that young people themselves <Col N="736"/>emphasised the importance of these areas, of all the subjects they are being taught.  Senator Mac Conghail referred to the 2007 report and the implementation of the RSE programme in the context of SPHE.  I hope the Minister will tell us, in his concluding remarks, if there has been any improvement in the areas that were identified in that report as problematic.  I refer to the problems of teachers feeling uncomfortable teaching the programme, the fact that not all schools offer the subject in the first year and even fewer in the later years and the role of the inspectorate.  Some schools felt that inspectors do not place an emphasis on the programmes when doing whole-school evaluations.  I ask the Minister to give the House an update on that report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House and thank him for taking the time to attend for this debate.  I thank the Independent Senators for proposing this important motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The SPHE curriculum, as laid down by the Department of Education and Skills, makes impressive reading.  In the primary sector, SPHE is delivered to children at all levels, from infants upwards.  At secondary level, SPHE has been compulsory in the junior cycle since 2003.  The curriculum lays down modules on integration, conflict, bullying, stress, emotional health, health, relationships and sexuality.  These are all areas that are vital to the well-being of our young people.  At both primary and secondary levels, the importance of healthy lifestyles, nutrition and exercise are emphasised.  The implementation of SPHE in schools is assisted by a full-time service that operates on an integrated basis in collaboration between the Departments of Education and Skills and Health.</P>
        <P>The relationships and sexuality component focuses on hygiene, puberty, reproduction, pregnancy, peer pressure and relationships.  At senior level, the RSE programme includes in-depth coverage of many issues, including reproduction, puberty, sexuality and sexually transmitted infections.  In 2008, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, submitted a framework for SPHE to be included as a new subject at senior cycle to cover five most important areas, namely, mental health, gender studies, substance abuse, relationships and sexuality education and physical activity and nutrition.  It is unfortunate, however, that it has not been possible to implement this due to the level of resources available and the inability to provide a national programme of in-service training to support a senior cycle SPHE programme in schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I previously worked as a teacher and I am aware that what are termed the &ldquo;points&rdquo; subjects are seen as more of a priority when schools are preparing timetables.  It is often subjects such as SPHE, physical education, religion and choir that are the first to be forsaken in order to offer a subject which will enable a student obtain more points in the leaving certificate.  Last year, a first year who was 12 years old asked me about the percentage of students who took my subjects and who achieved A grades.  She was seeking this information because she wanted to choose her subjects wisely for leaving certificate.  With some students at junior cycle studying 12 subjects, we must wonder about them missing out on what is left of their childhood.</P>
        <P>The SPHE curriculum in secondary school seems impressive.  As a parent of five teenagers, four of whom have studied SPHE at school, on paper the curriculum certainly appears impressive.  As other Senators stated, we must all have been asking our children about their experiences of SPHE in recent days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>There were many embarrassed teenagers in recent days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I even went as far as to bring the SPHE textbook to work with me today.  All of the books on the curriculum are fantastic and there are some excellent publi<Col N="737"/>cations available.  I hope more time can be devoted to educating our children in the non-academic subjects.  The latter is extremely important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is the implementation of the policies relating to SPHE which provides the key to successful teaching of the subject in schools.  As stated, I was previously a secondary school teacher.  I never taught SPHE but I am of the view that it is vital that teachers of SPHE should be willing to teach the subject.  Too often, teachers are given SPHE classes to teach simply to make up their hours on a school timetable.  Such teachers may have no interest in or might not want to teach SPHE.  In order to implement a successful SPHE department within a school, it is essential to choose SPHE teachers wisely.  Not every teacher would be suitable for providing instruction in SPHE.  It is a very personal subject and, in order the interests of efficiency, those who teach it should be in a position to form close bonds with their pupils.  In addition, the timetable should be organised in such a way that a teacher will not have a class for an examination subject in the period before he or she is due to take the same class for SPHE.  It should not be the case that a teacher might have a class for mathematics, that he or she might become angry because the pupils had done their work incorrectly and that he or she would then be expected to teach that class SPHE in the period immediately following.  More care should be taken in devising SPHE programmes and a whole-school approach should be adopted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is often new teachers or those with the least experience who are given the task of providing instruction in SPHE.  Imagine what it is like for a teacher with little or no experience of general teaching to be obliged to provide instruction in the difficult and sensitive issues surrounding relationships, puberty, etc., that arise in the context of SPHE to a class of rowdy 15 year adolescents.  Speaking as a former teacher, the more experienced individuals on a school&rsquo;s staff should take the lead in the context of teaching SPHE.  I would be much better at teaching SPHE now than would have been the case 20 years ago.  This is mainly down to the experiences I have had in the classroom in the intervening period and also since I became a mother.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not at all stating that all SPHE teachers should be experienced or married but those who co-ordinate the subject in schools should have experience.  As is the case with other subjects, some individuals are more suited to teaching SPHE than others.  I reiterate that teachers of SPHE should above all want to teach the subject.  It is essential that an SPHE teacher should have in-service teaching before he or she begins to teach it.  Teachers often provide instruction in SPHE for months and sometimes years before they receive any formal training in it.  I ask the Minister to consider making in-service training for SPHE compulsory before a teacher may begin to provide instruction in it.</P>
        <P>Every school should have an SPHE policy that is regularly updated.  SPHE inspections which liaise with the student population as well as the teacher should be encouraged.  The SPHE department in a school should also liaise not only with the religion and career guidance departments, but also with all teachers.  This would provide an opportunity for the latter to be updated on issues arising.  It is vital that the SPHE should not just be seen to be delivered in an efficient manner.  There must be a policy in place and this must be followed through in an active way.  Schools should also have anti-bullying and substance abuse policies in written form.  There should also be definitive systems of reprimands in respect of such policies.  There is no point in someone teaching a class on bullying and then watching as a pupil tells one of his or her peers that he or she cannot sit on a particular chair because the former&rsquo;s bag is on it.  If a student behaves in such a way, he or she should be subjected to some form of definite reprimand.</P>

        <P>Senator Power referred to sarcasm.  It is not that long since a former Senator, Owen Sheehy Skeffington, campaigned against people who administered physical beatings to children in schools.  We must recognise that the use of sarcasm can be just as damaging and I am delighted Senator Power raised the issue.</P>
        <P>As Senator Moran stated, the SPHE programme in schools should be taught by those who volunteer to do so and who are properly trained.  A study by the Royal Irish Academy indicates that approximately 80% of mathematics teaching at second level is undertaken by people with no qualification in this subject.  One must wonder, therefore, whether the higher diploma in education, H.Dip, is a suitable qualification for those given that most important task of educating the next generation of young people.</P>
        <P>The pleas on the part of previous speakers in respect of more professionalism and additional training are correct.  In Finland &mdash; a country we seek to emulate &mdash; people must typically have a master&rsquo;s degree in a subject in order that they might teach it at second level.  In the past, we engaged in a great deal of silly propaganda with regard to how smart people are in this country.  The Minister has done much to try to set the record straight in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a need to consider the position on the training of those who teach the various subjects on offer at second level.  These individuals have such an important role and we appear to be encountering problems.  People are being asked to teach courses in which they do not have an interest or for which they have no enthusiasm.  Young people tend to pick up on whether a teacher is interested in the subject he or she is teaching.  One always tends to remember the teachers who were inspiring and those who were less so.</P>
        <P>In the context of what Senator McAleese stated with regard to opening up schools, sports have an extremely important role to play.  I refer, for example, to the Sam Maguire cup being brought to a school by the county team that won it, etc.  Why do poets and Senator Mac Conghail and his friends not visit schools?  Why do those who perform in operas for which State funding is provided not visit schools?  One does not know what will inspire students or what they will remember ten or 15 years after they have left school.  It could be a visit by a politician, for example.  It is tremendous to see so many children being invited to visit the Houses of the Oireachtas.  A student might be impressed by someone involved in the arenas of business, sport or culture.  As a result, everyone has a role to play in the context of assisting the development of children in the most wide-ranging way.  The reforms the Minister is attempting at second level are essential.  I commend Senator Martin McAleese and his colleagues on their enterprise in bringing the motion forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Independent Senators for tabling this motion.  It is something I should have done myself before now.  Back in 1996, I was one of the first teachers in the State to train as a relationships and sexuality education tutor.  Prior to that, I was involved in the development of the programme that was the precursor to the social, personal and health education programme, in which role my colleagues and I contributed liberally to the development of the SPHE curriculum at primary level.  Having met many teachers at in-service level, I am aware, as Senator Mary Moran observed, that there are wonderful programmes available.  The programme is not the problem; what is at issue is the practice and the level of difficulty around teaching such sensitive material.</P>
        <P>One of the main difficulties for teachers is the lack of time within the curriculum for SPHE.  It is generally considered a soft subject, particularly at second level and, as such, does not have the same currency as an examination subject.  We are naive if we expect a subject like SPHE to have the same value in parents&rsquo; eyes, in our points-driven system, as an examination subject.  It is a question of priorities.  Teachers and principals are largely guided by parents&rsquo; priorities <Col N="739"/>and will align their teaching priorities accordingly.  If both the SPHE teacher and the mathematics teacher are absent, the principal will be far more concerned about securing substitute cover for the latter.</P>
        <P>In my experience, schools value SPHE only when there is a crisis in regard to mental health, suicide, pregnancy or severe bullying.  The problem with that approach is that it is reactive rather than proactive.  The Minister is the only person who can change this by offering leadership to schools.  The current situation will not change without his intervention.  He is already taking action in a roundabout way, although it may in fact be deliberate.  For example, if he proceeds with his proposal to introduce 50% continuous assessment at junior cycle level and confine students to studying eight subjects, that will open up space in the curriculum whereby the &ldquo;life&rdquo; subjects, namely, RSE and SPHE, can be accommodated.  However, there is a major difficulty in accommodating these subjects within the curriculum at senior cycle level.  Having said that, my son, who has just completed transition year, recently informed me that he and his fellow students are learning about sex.  He was anxious that I should not feel obliged to tell him about the subject because, he said, he was getting the information in other ways, including at school.  Clearly, his school is offering lessons on the subject in some shape or form.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For many teachers, the relationships and sexuality education programme presents personal challenges.  I spoke to one teacher who was incredulous at having to deliver the subject matter, telling me that he would not even speak about his feelings to his wife, let alone to his students.  We cannot expect all teachers to be comfortable teaching the subject and many schools are bringing in guest speakers to deliver the programme.  While that approach is fine, it is neither integrated nor holistic and it conveys the message that it is an add-on subject.  I have seen children asking questions of guest speakers which they would never ask their teachers.  I recall queries such as, &ldquo;How do homosexuals do it?&rdquo;  These are the types of questions they want answered.  The class teacher may not be able to address a question like that because it conflicts with the ethos of the school and is not written into school policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All of the evidence shows we must be open and age appropriate in responding to young people&rsquo;s questions about sexuality.  Above all, we must not seek to evade the question but rather to provide some type of suitable answer.  Having said that, I would be the first to acknowledge that finding the right language is difficult.  Open as I am, I have been asked questions by my own children at inappropriate times to which I have given the most ludicrous answers.  A teacher of my acquaintance &mdash; considered a very open, up-to-date and informed person &mdash; told me of an occasion when she was driving to Galway with her children and it was announced on the news that condoms had been found on a beach in France.  When her nine year old ask what a condom was, she told him it was a &ldquo;condominium&rdquo; or type of house.  She knew if she attempted to answer honestly, it would set off a spiral of questions on why, when and how one might have use for a condom.  The material is not easy and we must ensure the engagement takes place in the right environment and context and at the right time.</P>

	<P>Relationships and sexuality education is critical to children, particularly at senior cycle when young people&rsquo;s identity is tied up with their sexuality and <Col N="740"/>their relationships.  It offers a break from examination-based subjects, thus providing an important space where students can discuss issues that are relevant to their lives.  I urge the Minister to carry out an audit of schools, as Senator Fiach Mac Conghail requested, and to evaluate the effectiveness of social media approaches.  If we can hook into children&rsquo;s lives in more natural ways, we have a better chance of creating a meaningful engagement.  The implementation of SPHE in schools is referenced by inspectors as part of the whole-school evaluation process.  However, the problem is often that the programme is in place in theory but is not being implemented in practice.  It is up to the Minister to move on this.  The implementation of SPHE in all schools to senior cycle will let light in on life and will help schools to produce rounded individuals.  SPHE is about helping young people to make informed decisions which will ensure they can enjoy healthy and mutually respectful relationships.  That is what it is all about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I am heartened by his determination to grasp the nettle on the many aspects of the education system where change is required.  Not least of these is his commitment to increasing pluralism in the patronage of schools, which has a significant bearing on this debate.  It is encouraging to see a Minister so engaged and willing to listen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wholeheartedly support the motion, not only as an Independent Senator but also as an educator.  As I do not have children I was unable to undertake the type of research done by certain colleagues, but I can draw upon my experience of teaching young people for several years in New York city.  One of the subjects I taught was religion.  Most days the students were somewhat engaged, but the school on Fifth Avenue had large windows and they were often distracted by what was happening outside.  In order to bring their attention back, particularly during teaching religion, I often repeated a phrase delivered by Bette Midler &mdash; one of my great heroes &mdash; from the movie &ldquo;The Rose&rdquo;, about the life of Janis Joplin, &ldquo;Drugs, sex, rock n&rsquo; roll&rdquo;.  This shows how long ago that was.  That got them back.  The heart of our motion is about young people and particularly what they want.  They have identified a serious gap in the educational experience which, if filled, could contribute towards a significant move towards positive mental health for themselves, their friends and their fellow students.  They want the education system to provide them with more opportunities to learn, discuss, share, debate and talk about stories about their relationships, sexuality, family, friendship, positive and negative feelings about who they are, who they want their friends to be, how they want to be intimate, how they can push through the dark times of adolescence and how they can discover and celebrate what it means to be human and to be human together.  We think and they think that one of the ways to do this is to experience a high quality social, personal and health education programme and relationships and sexuality education more often than they do now.  They think and we think that it would contribute more significantly to their positive mental health.</P>
        <P>Why is this motion so important other than the fact that we think our young people are calling for it?  Should that be reason enough?  Many Senators have been drawing on research, their experiences and the experience of their children.  Senator Power referred to the suicide rate.  We do not want to have a high suicide rate but Ireland has a high rate compared to Europe.  Senator Mac Conghail referred to research by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency to examine the potential effects of a lack of comprehensive implementation of these programmes.  The lack of comprehensive implementation means our young people have a lack of knowledge about these matters and a lack of opportunities to discuss these issues.  Issues related to this lack of discussion increase as a result of the lack of comprehensive implementation of this programme.</P><Col N="741"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is probably aware of the specific research on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people, particularly as it relates to their mental health and well-being.  In light of the research, particularly by Dr. Mayock in 2009, a picture emerged of the most vulnerable people within the minority of sexual identity.  On average, they realised they were lesbian, gay, transgendered or bisexual at 14 years of age.  My awareness came a little earlier than that and, thankfully as a result of that, it did not lead to what this research points to.  Many of them commenced self-harming behaviour at 15 and a half years of age and attempted suicide for the first time at 17 years.  Many of them did not come out until 21 years of age.  For these participants, the seven years of concealing sexual or gender identity often coincided with mental health difficulties and vulnerabilities.  The research recommends much of what we have suggested today, that there should be more social, personal and health education programme and relationships and sexuality education but particularly for this population.  It should provide for greater scope of the exploration of minority sexuality and gender identity and not just in social, personal and health education programme and relationships and sexuality education in order that those minority sexual identities infuse the school curriculum and contribute to the health and well-being of those people.</P>
        <P>BeLonGTo, GLEN and the social, personal and health education programme support service have developed a resource on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities for use in relationships and sexuality education at both senior and junior cycle and the Department is supporting it.  It is ready to be rolled out in September 2011 but this will merely be a resource for teachers, should they wish to use it as part of the relationships and sexuality education programme.</P>
        <P>I had some conversations recently with representatives of the ASTI convener of the social, personal and health education programme committee.  Second level teachers are very keen to support the teaching of social, personal and health education programme at senior cycle even though there is no obligation to teach it.  They are aware that best practice in this area dictates that they receive training to do this, as referred to by other Senators, particularly in learning methodologies for group work.  To be effective, some of those groups need to be somewhat smaller.</P>
        <P>Young people want it, the research supports it and teachers are standing by to support it.  Now is the time to take practical steps to tackle the barriers outlined by Senator McAleese in proposing this motion in order to get Ireland back on track towards promoting positive mental health for young people.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to this motion.  I support the call for the social, personal and health education programme and relationships and sexuality education to be fully implemented and extended.  Senator Healy Eames referred to the difficulty teachers and parents have in finding language to address issues and talk to young people.  I was reminded of myself as a teenager and my convent education.  We used to have retreats every year and there was a question box where we could submit questions.  It was probably a good idea but as we got older we learned the old adage that one never asks a question unless one knows the answer.  We used to dream up the most shocking questions to see how the nuns would react.  Some things never change.</P>
        <P>I am not a teacher but as a parent I was interested when the social, personal and health education programme and relationships and sexuality education was being introduced in 1996 and 1997.  We had informative meetings on a regional basis in Cork and in local schools.  The course met with many objections from parents, which was a pity.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It was informative in terms of how the courses developed and the language used in supporting young people not just in sexual relationships, but the relationships they have with individuals such as people sitting next to them on a bus or in the classroom and how to cope with those relationships.  It is an excellent programme and is well constructed.  I had concerns that, because of reaction from the floor, it was being chopped and changed and that relevant parts of the programme were being removed and the impact was lost.  It struck me that those who are objecting probably had a well structured and comfortable home environment for their children but the programme was aimed at the children in difficult situations at home or in difficult relationships and providing the opportunity and language to reach out and say that a particular situation is wrong and that help is needed.  It was a very important part of the programme and it was butchered in some cases, which should not have happened.</P>
        <P>It is an excellent programme.  Members of D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills in January 2010 to discuss this matter.  The Department of Education and Skills and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency conducted a review of the programme and the figures revealed a lack of uptake, particularly at senior cycle.  An overcrowded curriculum, discomfort among teachers and the pressure in exam years were mentioned as reasons for this.  These have all been mentioned in Senators&rsquo; contributions.</P>
      
        <P>I congratulate the Minister on his review and his approach to the junior certificate curriculum.  Reducing the number of subjects and introducing continuous assessment will help&mdash;&mdash;</P>

<P>I am concerned that boys&rsquo; schools appear to be lax in implementing the programme, particularly when we have such a high rate of suicide among young males.  That does not make sense.  The high rate of suicide among young males should reinforce the need for such a programme.  The Minister might indicate when responding how he intends to implement the recommendations of the 2007 report which state that the guidelines must be reiterated and that schools must have a written policy on the subject.  The practicalities of implementing those recommendations were raised earlier in the debate.  I support the motion because it shines a light on an extremely important area in our education system.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is good to be back in this House again.  It is even better to be back in a House that debates rather than reads scripts to each other.  I have an excellent script which was prepared for me and which I intend to circulate to Members but it repeats much of the information that has been given and I do not wish to insult the House by reading it.  That is in no way a reflection on the quality of the work done on my behalf.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to praise the motion.  It sets a tone at the start of this Seanad that I hope will continue in the next five extremely difficult years because this country has lost its economic sovereignty.  Our room for manoeuvre is limited and we have growing problems in a host of areas.</P>
        <P>I want to encapsulate and respond to three areas mentioned.  There is a familiar and similar theme running through them and therefore I will not necessarily mention individuals.  We must <Col N="743"/>realise the need to act now, unlike the exercise Senator Clune referred to which was as long ago as 1996 when there were so many taboos around this area.  I am not just talking about the sexuality aspect of it; that is the tabloid side of it although it is so important to all of us.  It is the mental health, personal hygiene and other aspects that were taboo.  We must recognise that we can no longer afford to have taboo subjects because the consequence of taboo subjects are all the tragedies that have been referred to.</P>
        <P>The second point made is the absolute necessity to have good teachers in whatever the subject happens to be.  I am not just referring to mathematics, as stated by Senator Barrett, but in all the topics that have to be taught because we have to teach people how to grow up.  It is done informally in families.  Good, working, functional families do it without even realising they are doing it.  How does one learn to be a parent?  Where is the text book on parenting?  Dr. Spock did it for suburban American housewives who lived five hours away from their Mammy but if one had a dysfunctional parent, what was one&rsquo;s point of reference?  Good teachers &mdash; informal, familial and structured formal teachers &mdash; are essential and to get good teachers on the agenda Members spoke about we need a new curriculum.  I will briefly discuss those three areas.</P>
        <P>This representative Seanad in the broadest sense of the word can knock down the taboos.  Its Members do not need my help in that regard, although in reference to Senator Zappone&rsquo;s contribution, I hope the provision of a greater pluralistic choice of places of education at primary and secondary level will enable people to assert their own value system without apology and for others to be able to find a place where they feel comfortable.  I see no conflict in that.  Pluralism is not some alien philosophy built into this island imported from somewhere else.  It is embodied in the Proclamation, cherishing all of the children equally, and it is embedded in our Constitution where we recognise the right of the parent as the primary educator.  Pluralism is the enemy of no one and is the liberator of us all.  My view is that we should just get on with it but in a democratic, transparent and open way.  I hope the forum on pluralism will provide a mechanism people understand to ensure we can get the changes people want.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Good teachers are a key component of the literacy and numeracy strategy launched on 8 July.  On the point about the good teaching aspect, currently we have five teacher training colleges.  That is what they used to be &mdash; four Catholic and one Church of Ireland.  We now have an on-line postgraduate teacher training course.  I stated at a committee meeting earlier that they have in effect merged themselves into the university third level sector.  There was an intellectual and professional snobbery between primary school teachers who did not have degrees and secondary school teachers who had degrees but who had no teaching skills because the H.Dip was not a teaching skill exercise; it was a right of passage or something else and got one the points to which the Senator referred.</P>
        <P>The reform of the literacy and numeracy strategy will cost an extra &euro;19 million a year when it is up and running, most of which will be to extend the three year B.Ed degree in primary school teaching to a four year B.Ed degree.  The one year H.Dip, to give it a distinctive reference, will become a two year course.  Most of that additional time will be spent on pedagogic teaching skills, therefore, somebody at second level will no longer say they are a history teacher but that they are a teacher at secondary level and their subject at the moment is history, biology or whatever.  They are first and foremost a teaching graduate who specialised in history and if they are taught how to teach a difficult subject they will be comfortable teaching other subjects that might have been more difficult in the past.  If we get rid of the taboos we might make it easier for people to equip themselves with all the teaching aids available.  Reference was made to the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, equipment in regard to teaching skills in areas that are uncomfortable for people and with which they find a difficulty.</P><Col N="744"/>
        <P>The tyranny in all of this is not what some liberal commentators might say has been the legacy of the past, the ethos of particular schools.  The tyranny does not come from hard-line individuals who have a certain religious point of view or a certain traditionalist ethos.  The tyranny comes from the points system in the leaving certificate and the demand from parents that the school get down to the business of getting their child the necessary points to get into the course they want.  Senator Moran referred to the idea of a 12 or 13 year old at the start of secondary school having to deal with the selection of subjects for points.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have a competitive education system.  Some right-wing educational economists - I am not referring to Senator Barrett - would say if we have a voucher system we allow a market mechanism to operate so that pupils will seek out the place where they want to go.  We have that <i>de facto</i>.  It is called the capitation grant.  The critically important difference in the Republic&rsquo;s education philosophy embedded in the Constitution, unlike many status systems, is that the Constitution states that the State must provide for education, not that the State must provide education.  That three letter word is critically important because it recognises parental choice and the role of parents.  I was in Chicago last week and if someone lives in a certain area and the school is not up to scratch they either move or pay through the nose to go to a private school.  The same applies in Britain.  In Ireland we do not tie geography and place of residency to the school where one can send one's child, whether it is a primary or secondary school.  We have never fully realised - I say this from the left - the liberation that provides for parents and the onus it puts on schools to be better than they were last week because otherwise they will lose pupils and if schools have had the phenomenon where parents are bypassing their school and driving out the country road to a smaller, different school one must ask why they are doing that.  There are professional teachers in this Chamber - I am not a professional educationist - and they both know that when a school starts to fail it starts to fail at leadership level.  Schools are fixed by fixing the leadership.  The strength of our system is that parents can exercise choice.  This is built into our republican Constitution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Most parents send their children to be educated in schools in order that they will have better chances in life than they had themselves.  That was the nature of my upbringing and, I suspect, that of many others.  If pupils do not get the kinds of results they require in examinations to do the courses they want to do, their schools are not delivering what their parents primarily want.  We deal with this by changing the junior and senior cycle curricula.</P>
        <P>By international standards, we have a wonderful, inclusive child-centred exploratory learning system that involves fun, play and games.  Good primary schools in this country are a delight to see, they are happy places.  Professor Tom Collins confirmed this when addressing an IPPN conference four years ago.  He saluted the principals and the deputy principals.  The Stanley letter launched primary education in this country 180 years ago in 1831, which means we have one of the oldest systems in the world.  In this context, Professor Collins told the attendees they had achieved something nobody had thought possible for generations.  Speaking much more eloquently than I can, he told them they had removed fear from the classroom of primary schools.  No primary schoolchild is afraid of going to school nowadays.  Most give out to their parents if they are kept back or are late.  This is a transformation we take for granted.</P>
        <P>The experience of secondary level, referred to by the Senator, is different.  Pupils enter second level at 11 or 12 years of age having come from a small school in which they stayed in a single classroom while the teachers came to them.  They may come from a tiny school.  Of the 3,200 primary schools, 620 have fewer than 50 pupils.  These are hardly schools and are more like extended homes, yet we expect their pupils, at 12 or 13 years of age, to make the transition into the equivalent of a shopping mall.  Every hour, on the hour, a crowd comes down the corridor and the building is inhabited by adults &mdash; 18 and 17 year olds.  Pupils entering second <Col N="745"/>level from primary school enter at the very start of the cycle, as with a game of snakes and ladders.  In such an environment, in which we are asking pupils to do all the tasks SPHE and RSE equip them to do, parents simply want their children to get a sufficient number of points in their examinations.</P>
        <P>With regard to curricular reform, I am delighted by the work of the NCCA.  This is not my achievement but work that has been on the boil for some time.  There is now a receptive Minister in the Department to respond to the work of many others.  In fairness to the civil servants, they have had four Ministers in six years.  Any organisation with that kind of turnover cannot operate at full or optimum capacity.</P>
        <P>The new junior cycle will have a number of taught subjects but pupils will only be able to do a written examination in eight of them.  The cycle will involve the compilation of a portfolio of projects and other work from first year through to third year.  We are examining the way in which a portfolio can be assessed continually and how one can respect the integrity of examination results without there being a sense that they have been interfered with.  The integrity of examination results at both junior and leaving certificate levels has not been sullied in any way by what we have done to other institutions.  We must respect this particular virtue no matter how defective it may be.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have not yet finalised the balance between the percentages of marks that will be allocated for both written examinations and for portfolio work.  The ratio will be 50:50 or close to that.  The core of the junior cycle curriculum will involve six taught life skills.  They very much concern the topics the Senator referred to.  The skills should enable a young person to function at the threshold of adulthood.  They encompass looking after oneself, being able to articulate one&rsquo;s concerns, engaging with others and expressing oneself in a non-confrontational way.</P>
        <P>We will keep the transition year because, for some, it is a year of liberation.  Those who are focusing on points see it as a year wasted but it is a year of liberation.  The detail on the reform of the leaving certificate, which follows transition year, has not yet emerged but, as I said today to colleagues at the committee, I hope that in September 2012 the cohort of young people starting first year will be able to study many subjects but will be able to take an examination in only eight.  As soon as possible thereafter, probably the following year although I do not want to make express commitments despite my trying to drive this reform as quickly as I can, we will strike a balance between portfolio work and examinations.  We will achieve the mix between continual assessment of one kind and State examinations of another.</P>
        <P>The reality is that people starting second level in 2012 will not be doing their junior certificate examinations until 2015.  It will be 2018 before they do their leaving certificate examinations.  Change takes time and the outcome will not be manifest until 2018 or 2019.  Who knows?</P>
        <P>One hits a wall in respect of the way in which leaving certificate results are measured and the way in which the registrars of colleges capture those results through the CAO system.  Most people believe the CAO points system is part of a State system but it has nothing to do with it.  The CAO is a private company owned by the third level institutions and its job is to capture the results of the leaving certificate examination and put them through a churning machine that assigns points.  As Professor Tom Collins stated, it is the most effective and efficient form of crowd control the college registrars have ever had.  They love it and it allows them to have their week of power.</P>
        <P>It is for this reason that, only two weeks into the 150 days in which I have been in the Department of Education and Skills, I met the heads of all seven universities and said I would embark on a necessary programme of change but that I could not do so unless they were part of the solution.  I said the same to the heads of the institutes of technology two weeks later.  I said that if the colleges still use a CAO-type form at the end of the process, the curriculum <Col N="746"/>change we want to introduce will not work.  I argued that if there is still a residual points system, the emphasis of the parents, whose tyranny in this respect is understandable, will be on points and on providing grinds to their children so they will get those points in their examinations.  People talk about fees paid to schools but nobody has a clue how much people spend on grinds in post-primary school education.</P>

	<P>It is a lot of money.  The seven presidents, or their representatives, have agreed that they will consider admission systems.  This September, there will be for the first time ever &mdash; it is incredible to think of this &mdash; a joint conference between the HEA and the NCCA to focus on this.  Although we have a wide, exploratory primary school curriculum that is regarded as very positive by international standards, we have a secondary school curriculum that is like a chicane or narrow tunnel through which one must force children.  It is like a sausage factory.</P>
        <P>One critical finding in the research by the NCCA was that the teachers most popular with the young cohort of first-year students are those who teach around the subject and explore the edges of an interesting topic.  The teachers who are most popular in first year are the most unpopular in sixth year because they go off the point and do not teach with a view to their pupils achieving points.  This demonstrates what we have done to youngsters.</P>
        <P>Unless we unlock the tyranny of points and the bridge to third level, we will not be able to effect the required changes regarding subjects that matter in a system of evaluation that enables one to proceed to third level.  The target is to have, by 2020, a third level participation rate of 72% of all pupils, not just those who have the leaving certificate because many students enter college without using it.  Unless we open the system such that RSE and SPHE can be valued in the same way as other subjects, we will not make the changes we require.  I agree that one wants to see these subjects as having equal value but they will not unless they have equal value in the outcome of exams to enter third level.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment the Independent nominees group on this very useful motion.  I listened to the debate on the monitor and it has been very strong.  It has been very encouraging to hear the words of the Minister.  It is useful for us to consider the social, personal and health education programme and I know Senator Moran and others went into great detail on it.  I have always been a strong supporter of it but the concerns raised in the motion are important.  The quality and inconsistency of implementation of the programme are a concern.  I know the Department is addressing these concerns and that studies to which others have referred show implementation is patchy in quality and in need of improvement, particularly in the relationships and sexuality education component.  The studies also show great satisfaction among parents with the rollout generally of the RSE component of the programme and there is great commitment to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thought I might follow the Minister&rsquo;s example, and that of other speakers, and stray a little from the subject of the SPHE programme and speak a little more generally on the education topic.  I compliment the Minister on the fact he has hit the ground running.  Some of the wide-ranging issues he covered show this and they include admissions policy in schools, the national forum on patronage and initiatives at third level.  Coming from the third level sector, I know colleagues understand the need for cutbacks but we have great hopes we will see enough investment at third level to ensure we maintain a cutting edge in research and innovation because this is key to our economic development and recovery.  Trinity College Dublin, where I have the privilege of working, consistently ranks highly in the international league tables, <Col N="747"/>recently in the world rankings in the arts sector and we are very proud of this.  We need to maintain these rankings.  I know the Minister is very much aware of this.</P>
        <P>I also want to speak generally on primary and secondary education as this is the focus of the debate.  I speak as the parent of a child at primary level and, as the Minister is well aware, as the chair of a local Educate Together school start-up group covering the area of the Dublin South-East and Dublin South-Central constituencies, namely, the Portobello multi-denominational group.  More than 400 parents are now members of this group and it is still growing.  It was established last year in response to immense local demand.  The group is very excited by the prospect of the national forum on patronage and we have made a submission to it.  The group is living evidence of the increased demand for new forms of multi-denominational schooling and a mismatch between the current provision at primary and secondary levels and the wants and needs of parents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Other speakers have pointed out &mdash; I am aware the national forum is considering this matter &mdash; the disconnection between the provisions of the Constitution which provide for parental choice in the manner of education of their children and the reality for many parents which is that in practice they are forced to send their children to schools where the ethos is one which they do not share.  This is because we live in a country where 96% of education provision at primary level is denominational, largely under the patronage of the Catholic Church.  Archbishop Diarmuid Martin has recognised this position is no longer tenable.  Out of 3,200 national schools throughout Ireland, less than 60 are multi-denominational schools under the patronage of Educate Together.  As the parent of a child attending a multi-denominational school I am very conscious that the Educate Together model is about more than multi-denominational education; it is also a model of education that is child-centred and that encourages and requires parental involvement at a greater level than other schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to the House to take over from the Minister in an eminently capable capacity.  Her brief covers equality and what I am speaking about goes a little beyond the motion on SPHE but covers the need to see greater recognition of diversity in the provision of education in this country, not only at primary level where the focus is at present, but also at second level.  I was going to give the Minister, Deputy Quinn, a final compliment on his recent announcement that he will recognise Educate Together as a patron at secondary level.  This is very important for the many parents who now wish to see their children, who have been educated through a multi-denominational primary system, receive at second level an education that is child focused and multi-denominational.  This choice is not available.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The debate on SPHE and the need for consistency in the rollout of the RSE component is about supporting diversity among pupils.  We also need to examine how we support the diverse ethos among various parents in an increasingly pluralist republic.  The Minister and the Government have a real commitment to ensuring greater support for diversity in the education system generally and I look forward to this support being evidenced in the actions of the Government in the coming term.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My intervention is directed at the Minister for Education and Skills but as the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and I have previously exchanged opinions on this area in its wider context she will understand what I am about to state but may not agree with it.  Yesterday, I raised a matter on the Adjournment which was taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, on behalf of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  This was on support <Col N="748"/>for the For&oacute;ige Big Brothers Big Sisters of Ireland project.  I could not help but reflect on one of the references made on SPHE, which is that it allows discussions on feelings and emotions, personal safety, making decisions relating to others, communications, resolving conflict, dealing with bullying and citizen and media education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For&oacute;ige has run out of funds to continue the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Ireland project but there seems to be a relationship between it and certain elements of the SPHE programme, which as has been pointed out, is only at junior level.  Perhaps there could be joined-up thinking between For&oacute;ige&rsquo;s Big Brothers Big Sisters of Ireland project and the Department of Education and Skills on using the expertise built up by For&oacute;ige on many aspects of human emotion and the development of young people.  Yesterday, the Minister of State and I discussed the fact that many case histories of children in the project relate to issues of bullying and low self-esteem, which seem to be a significant part of the SPHE curriculum.  Perhaps there is a basis for discussion between For&oacute;ige and the Department.  We have discovered the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Ireland project is very expensive and perhaps joined-up thinking might push it out to second level where it will not be available because of the economic situation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, for attending the debate.  I also thank my fellow Senators for contributing to the debate.  We have had a very rich discussion and have shown the reason and basis for the motion.  A statistic I would like to add to the evidence put before us this evening is that half of lifetime cases of mental health disorders begin by the age of 14 and three quarters by the age of 25.  In Ireland, a recent survey conducted by UNICEF, Change the Future: Experiencing Youth in Contemporary Ireland, found that half of all young people aged between 16 and 20 have experienced depression; more than one in ten anorexia; more than a quarter have felt suicidal; and of those experiencing ongoing mental health difficulties, only 18% are receiving help.  The role of SPHE and RSE in schools plays a key part in addressing some of these issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the debate we heard about the report from D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g and the report of the Department of Education and Skills carried out with the Crisis Pregnancy Agency in 2007.  One of the aspects we would like to follow up is an audit on what is happening in schools in regard to SPHE and RSE.  That is a specific step we would like taken with, I hope, the full endorsement of the motion by the House.  School principals are a key driver and good teachers play a key role, which the Minister has acknowledged in the reforms he is undertaking, and we would like consideration to be given for the issues we raised to be tied into the Croke Park agreement.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the junior cycle review and we hope the debate will strongly contribute to it.  What he is doing with this review and the literacy and numeracy strategy is essential and important.  He referred to unlocking the bridge to universities.  We ask him to give equal attention to the senior cycle in secondary education.  While we need to focus on the junior cycle, we equally have to focus on the senior cycle.  I would like to ensure there is not an imbalance and that we do not say we have ticked the box because this has been done in the first three years of secondary education.  It will not have been covered because children are developing emotionally and physically and they said this in the research conducted by D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g.  The senior cycle is equally important to unlocking that bridge.</P>
        <P>It is also critical that the training of teachers is not ignored.  Many Members outlined their experiences.  I recall clearly at the launch of the D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g report one young teacher sharing <Col N="749"/>her experience.  She was  in her 20s and she was the last teacher into an all-boys school.  She was given the SPHE hours because that is what one gets when one is last in.  She had no training in this area and she was expected to uphold the ethos of the school but she was given no direction on how to do that.  She had a class of young boys with no training.  That does not lead to quality SPHE teaching but she could not say &ldquo;No&rdquo; because she was in a vulnerable position as the last teacher into the school.  As Senator Moran said, life experience is essential.  While in-service training is needed, life experience is also needed and I ask the Minister to give consideration to this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also acknowledge the role of non-formal education and, as Senator Mooney mentioned, the role of For&oacute;ige.  Many youth work organisations in Ireland play an essential role in non-formal education and they could also play a role in SPHE.</P>
        <P>The Independent group will not go away regarding this issue.  We hope the motion is fully endorsed and we will come back to this early in 2012 regarding the next steps we have outlined.  We will ask what has happened and we hope we can support the Minister in moving this essential issue forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs back to a familiar setting for her.  This is the first opportunity I have had to wish her will in her important Ministry</P>
        <P>This is a Seanad Bill which as been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 118, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  The Minister will explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il and this will be looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  For Senators&rsquo; convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  There are also four Government amendments to the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il.  If the House agrees, I propose to allow the Minister, first, to explain the amendments made by the D&aacute;il to the Bill and when this is completed, we can deal with the Government amendments.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
        <P>I propose seven groupings based on the subject matter of the 20 amendments made by the D&aacute;il to the Bill.  Each Senator may speak once on each group.  I remind Members that the only matter that may be discussed is the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  I draw their attention to a typographical error in amendment No. 16 from the D&aacute;il, which should read &ldquo;in page 74&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;in page 75&rdquo;.  I call the Minister to speak on the subject matter of the amendments in group 1.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman for his kind words.  This is important legislation, the objective of which is to provide for the High Court to have statutory jurisdiction to hear applications by the Health Service Executive for special care orders or interim special care orders and related matters in respect of children where their welfare may require their detention in a special care unit.  The Bill provides that such units will be inspected under the Health Act 2007.  The Bill also includes a provision, which allows for the dissolution Children Acts Advisory Board.  In addition, the Bill includes a provision required in the context of the establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</P><Col N="750"/>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to report to the Seanad the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  The first group of amendments amendments Nos. 1, 3, 6, 11, 18 and 19 &mdash; relate to the establishment of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 18 are technical amendments to the Long Title and section 1 and are consequential on amendment No. 11, which introduces a new section 33 to the Bill.  Amendment No. 11 amends Part 7A of the Health Act 2004 in order that I as Minister will have the necessary powers under that Act to require the HSE to furnish and information and documents to me in the public interest.  Clearly, this is necessary to fulfil my job as Minister.  The purpose of the amendment is to strengthen the legislative base for the provision of information by the HSE for the Minister to allow me to fulfil my role and functions, including political accountability to the Oireachtas, and to create a safe channel of communication for sensitive information from the Health Service Executive to me.  The amendment achieves this by placing a duty on the HSE to provide information on its initiative and without delay to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  It also gives the Minister the power to require in the public interest detailed information and documents from the HSE, free of legal prohibition, and to use such information in documents as necessary for the performance of ministerial functions.  It allows the Minister to furnish such information or documents that are considered relevant to a person appointed by the Minister to examine or to inquire into any matter.</P>
        <P>The amendment ensures the HSE keeps the Minister fully informed in all matters he or she needs to be aware of in a timely and appropriate manner.  The HSE must inform the Minister without delay of any occurrence or development that in its opinion the Minister is likely to consider significant for the performance of his or her functions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE is required to monitor and keep under review occurrences and developments concerning matters relating to its objects and functions which includes child care.  In addition, it must similarly inform the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs of any occurrences and developments that fall in a class of occurrence or development of public interest or concern that has been specified in writing by the Minister.  This power to specify will ensure the Minister can be kept informed of important issues relevant to the public interest or concern.</P>
        <P>Following the enactment and commencement of this Part, I will have the necessary powers to fulfil my roles and functions should I require information and documents from the HSE to do so.  Senators will appreciate this is necessary in order for me to do the job properly.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 19 are technical amendments to the Long Title and section 2.  They are required to reflect the title changes of the Minister for Health and Children to the Minister for Health which came into effect on 4 June 2011 on foot of an order made under section 6(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939.</P>
        <P>Many of the functions have already been transferred to my Department.  This legislation adds significantly to the information I can access and receive from the HSE.  More legislation will be required at a later stage to deal with other transfers such as that of the youth justice system.</P>

	<P Just="Left">This Ministry is one of the most important ones and I compliment the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on her work in it to date.</P>
        <P>The Child Care (Amendment) Bill provides for the High Court to have statutory jurisdiction to hear applications by the HSE for special care orders or interim special care orders and related matters in respect of children where their welfare may require their detention in a special care unit.  The Bill also provides that special care units will be inspected under the Health Act 2007 and for the dissolution of the Children Acts Advisory Board.</P><Col N="751"/>
        <P>These are positive and welcome amendments to the legislation.  It was a Fine Gael-Labour Party Government priority to have this legislation passed by the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that failure to abide by laws which would force the disclosure of information on child neglect or abuse will result in tough sanctions such as fines or jail terms.  It is vital all organisations and individuals working with children share information with authorities relating to child welfare concerns.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is preparing legislation which will make it a criminal offence to withhold information relating to sexual abuse or other serious offences against a child or vulnerable adult.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their comments on the important issues the Government has been dealing with recently.  We are determined to give them an urgent response including the provision of a range of protective measures in legislation.  We are not dealing with these in this Bill as it is mainly about transferring authority and powers to my office.  This Bill also ensures the HSE keeps me informed of matters relating to my portfolio and I can direct it to carry out investigations and compile reports on my behalf.  It duplicates the powers already held by the Minister for Health.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased this Bill strengthens the powers of the newly-established Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Last week, the Minister referred to the unsatisfactory situation in 2010 when an independent review group on child deaths, established by the then Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Barry Andrews, was furnished with preliminary information by the HSE but refused access to individual case files.  This was due to legal concerns identified by the HSE on the provision of information for the group.  It is vital to the success of the new Department and both natural and obvious that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is given direct access to files as she needs them in a safe and proper way, bearing in mind the sensitive nature of some of the information required.  This will help her ensure full accountability in the arena of child protection.</P>
        <P>Strengthening the powers of the new Department is also important in ensuring consistency in the collection of child protection data from around the country.  This is the best way to ensure that a consistent threshold is maintained with regards to children being taken into care.</P>
        <P>As the Minister outlined in the past week, there is a big job ahead in strengthening child protection systems.  The new Department will have an agency dedicated to family and children services.  This will remove the child protection component out of the ambit of the HSE which will re-balance that dynamic and power more favourably towards the new Department.</P>
        <P>This Bill is an important step towards strengthening child protection systems.  I note the Minister will introduce legislation later this year to create the new child welfare and support services agency.  I offer her our support on this as it is in all our interests to bring it forward as quickly as possible.  I hope the legislation is comprehensive to allow for the proper lines of accountability at administrative, executive and political levels to ensure the failings that occurred in the setting up of the HSE in that regard are not repeated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The second group, amendments Nos. 2, 4, 5, 17 and 20, consists of technical amendments which were required in the context of amendment No. 17.  This <Col N="752"/>amendment provided for the inclusion in the Bill of a new section 46 which amended the definition of the term &ldquo;bilateral agreement&rdquo;, as contained in the Adoption Act 2010, to ensure the definition was consistent with the provision on bilateral agreements in section 73 of the Adoption Act.  The amendment is technical in nature.  Amendments Nos. 2, 4 and 5 amend section 1 which deals with collective citations.  The amendments reflect those changes to the Bill which affect collective citations in respect of the Child Care Acts and Adoption Acts.  Amendment No. 20 is an amendment to include the Adoption Act 2010 in the Long Title.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Amendment No. 7 relates to section 3(4) of the Child Care Act 1991, which deals with the functions of the Health Service Executive and connects the Child Care Acts with the Health Acts.  The reason for the amendment is that section 3(4) becomes a meaningless and moot section in the context of the establishment of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and transfer of the Child Care Acts to my Department.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is not provided for in the Health Acts.  In that regard, the necessary amendment is the deletion of section 3(4).  It is my intention, at the earliest possible date, to introduce legislation providing the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with the requisite powers and functions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the Health Service Executive to ensure the executive is properly accountable to me with respect to services it provides under the auspices of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The next group, amendments Nos. 8 and 9, consists of two technical amendments to section 23NP, which provides for offences under the Bill.  The amendments are in accordance with section 5 of the Fines Act 2010, which provides that fines between &euro;2,500 and &euro;4,000 are class B fines.</P>

	<P>As Senators are not offering, we will proceed to the next group, amendments Nos. 10, 12 and 16, the subject matter of which is facilities for children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 10, 12 and 16 are concerned with inspections by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  The authority allowing HIQA to conduct inspections of children&rsquo;s residential facilities and services, including the special care units, an issue the House will discuss tonight, is provided under the provisions of section 69 of the Child Care Act 1991.  Amendment No. 10 introduces a new section 25 which makes the powers provided under section 69 of the 1991 Act more robust and includes any services and children&rsquo;s residential facilities provided under the Child Care Act by persons taking care of a child on behalf of the HSE.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 12 introduces a new section 33 and relates to the amending of the Health Act 2007.  Section 33 amends the Act in order that it will be possible for special care units to come within the definition of &ldquo;designated centre&rdquo;, as provided for in the Health Act 2007.  This will mean that special care units, as provided for in the Bill, will be subject to the inspection provisions of the Health Act 2007.  The effect of amendment No. 12 is to allow for special care <Col N="753"/>units to be subject to the relevant provisions of the Health Act 2007, that is, that these special care units will come under the HIQA inspection regime under that Act when the relevant provisions are commenced.  This is achieved by deleting a reference in section 75(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Health Act 2007 to the term &ldquo;special care unit&rdquo; and in section 75(2)(<i>b</i>)(iii) to the words &ldquo;or (<i>d</i>)&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 16 is a technical amendment to the transitional provisions of the Bill.  Its effect is that the relevant date referred to in section 48(9) will be taken as the date on which section 33 of the Bill comes into operation.  It, therefore, brings certainty to the definition.  As previously stated, section 33 amends the Health Act 2007 to allow special care units to be inspected under the provisions of that Act.</P>

	<P>This is the appropriate time to comment on special care orders.  This element of the Bill, which relates to special care orders, is highly positive and pertinent.  It also relates to one of most serious of all State powers, namely, the power to detain a child in a centre such as Ballydowd.  This power must always be used with the utmost care and in absolute deference to the rights of each individual child.</P>
        <P>A previous issue of concern was that the relevant provisions of the Child Care Act 1991 were not operational.  As a result, it fell to the High Court to hear applications for special care orders.  I welcome the provision to afford to the Health Service Executive the power to apply to the High Court for a special care order for a child.  I am pleased the previous ambiguity has been removed and the Bill sets out in unequivocal terms the processes to be followed by the HSE.  These include the steps to be taken from the initial consideration of the child for special care, the application for the order, the hearing of the case, the granting of the order and the care of the child under the order through to the discharge of the order.  I also welcome the role the Health Information and Quality Authority will have in this respect as a result of the amendments proposed by the Minister.</P>
        <P>Although I support the Bill, I am concerned about the failure to address the issue of after care.  I am aware this issue has been debated extensively but this legislation remains a missed opportunity.  I am concerned that an amendment has not been included to make the provision of after care an automatic legal entitlement where a child has an identified need.  The obligation to provide after care should be clearly stated in law.  When the State assumes parental responsibility for a child in care there should be a corresponding obligation on the State, within legislation, making it crystal clear what are the State&rsquo;s obligations, including the obligation to ensure the child is cared for and not abandoned when he or she turns 18 years of age.</P>
        <P>I listened intently to the Minister&rsquo;s comments on after care in the D&aacute;il last week.  Research reports have continually shown that children leaving care need support, as confirmed again by a recent report by Empowering People in Care, EPIC, formerly the Irish Association of Young People in Care, IAYPIC.  An amendment to legislation on the issue of after care has been sought by many organisations, including Barnardos.  It is also one of the primary demands of the action for after care coalition.  While I am aware the Minister intends to return to the issue of after care and much work is being done on it, an opportunity has been missed to address the issue in this legislation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I recall that after care was a major political issue when the Bill previously came before the House.  When my party was in government it took tremendous flak for not agreeing to the proposal by various interest groups to include a provision on after care in legislation.  I accept that such proposals were made in good faith.  At the time, the Minister indicated that the issue was already covered in law.  I understand this is the reason the current Minister would cite for not providing for aftercare in the Bill.  It is strange, therefore, that the major campaign undertaken on this issue when the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was in power has not been repeated in respect of this Bill.  Instead, the Minister&rsquo;s assurances on the issue appear to be accepted, despite being exactly the same as those given by my party on the legal provision for aftercare.  The Government has adopted the same position as the previous Government.</P>

<Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and support the legislation.  Having been before the Houses since 2009, I am pleased the Bill is being brought to a conclusion.  In common with other speakers, I acknowledge the issue of aftercare.  Arising from my professional background as a solicitor and role as chair of the Threshold housing organisation, the issues of children in care and children leaving care have been of significant concern to me and the organisation I represent.</P>
      
        <P>I am, however, pleased that after care is not addressed in the context of the legislation.  After care needs more than an <i>ad hoc</i> response in legislation specifically dealing with special care orders.  It must be addressed in a much broader and wider context that goes beyond the issue before us today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the commitment to the child and family support agency legislation which I am assured we will deal with early in 2012.  What we need is a complete overhaul of the social work system in this country, particularly in the way it interfaces with children.  What we require is a much more in-depth, thought-out response to our obligations as a State dealing with children in care.  I urge the Minister to make a commitment to the House that aftercare will not be shelved or put on the back-burner but will be very much at the core of discussions on the child and family support agency.</P>
        <P>I did not contribute when we were talking about the HSE and its obligations to report to the Minister.  However, one of the issues of concern is the quality of the data and information held by the HSE.  It is only in a position to give what it has.  I have serious concerns about the quality of data held by the HSE.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am very much concerned about aftercare.  I do not want to see it treated in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion as an add-on to this legislation.  I want to see it as central and core to the way we treat the entire child care process in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Some broad points have been raised about the child protection system in this country, particularly aftercare but also the overall system.  As Gordon Jeyes, director of the child and family services in the HSE, has said, we need a child protection system that is fit for purpose.  He also spoke last week about developing an Irish model of child protection.  As the previous speaker and others indicated, such a model must have consistency of approach.  There is much talk about the need for resources in this area but there is also a need to manage the resources well and consistently and to record data in a similar way across <Col N="755"/>the country in order that we can compare statistics, and that we know what we are talking about when figures come in from different parts of the country.  It is clear that we do not have consistency, which is a challenge.  It is not just about resources.  It is also about management, practice, implementation and monitoring.  I am determined that we will have a child protection system that is fit for purpose.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are very good people working on the front line, good professionals who need support and supervision.  We must also ensure that experienced professionals stay working at the front line of child protection and do not always disappear into management in the way that happens in the hospital system.  We must ensure that high quality and top quality professional social workers remain working with child protection and bring their expertise into that area instead of leaving it to the most inexperienced social workers who often deal with the most complicated cases and situations.  There is a job of work to be done.  I reassure Senators that it is being done.  That is the goal.  A reconfiguration of services is going on which will continue when we create the new child and family agency.</P>
        <P>There is extremely strong legal advice that under section 45 of the Child Care Act the HSE has a legal obligation to provide aftercare.  That has been questioned but the advice is that where an assessment of need has been carried out on the provision of aftercare, it must be provided.  Not every child or young person who leaves care will need aftercare.  There is no question of that.  Many just get on with their lives, but of course, like many young people when they reach 18 it is not simply a question of getting on with things on their own, many still need support either from their foster families &mdash; many of which continue to give that support &mdash; but, equally, the young people who leave residential care are most at risk.  We have data from the child death review which is being carried out at the moment and which I expect to receive in a few months that this is a group which is particularly at risk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I accept the points on aftercare.  A national aftercare policy is being developed as well as a national implementation plan.  A total of 45 aftercare workers are in place and a further ten are being recruited.  We must match those 55 staff to where the need is greatest and collate the information on what they are doing and the needs identified.  Work is being done on the issue.  I give a commitment to the House that if regulation by statute is necessary in order to ensure we develop proper aftercare services, as is the case in the North of Ireland, I will consider making provision for it in law in order that it should be delivered if it is required.  I will continue to monitor the situation in the meantime because it is a very important service.  They are the main points I would like to make in response to what has been raised by Senators whom I thank for their contributions.</P>

It is required in the context of the dissolution of the CAAB, which is provided for in Part 6 of the Bill.  It has been decided in the context of the need to rationalise State agencies and in accordance with Government policy to dissolve the CAAB and to subsume many of its functions into my Department.  The amendment ensures that there will be no meaningless sections remaining in the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, following the dissolution of the CAAB.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  The main objective of the Bill is to safeguard the best interests of children who are in need of special care, as we have been discussing.  What is being enshrined in the Bill will support its achievement.  Special care is a last resort but it is an important part of child care which does meet the express needs of a very small number of children.  It is only used when other forms of residential or community care are considered to be unsuitable.  It is appropriate that these cases should continue to be presented to and determined by the High Court. <Col N="757"/> That will allow for the consistent, well managed and structured presentation and consideration of the applications which come before the court for special care orders.

Now that the new Department has been established we wish to make it a success.  What the Minister <Col N="758"/>has done in the Bill today is very important.  The Government amendments took on board much of what was said in the debate regarding guardian <i>ad litem</i> and I welcome the fact that the Minister moved so quickly to do that.

The effect of the amendment is to continue the practice for the guardian <i>ad litem</i> to be in a position to appoint legal representation in care cases and special care cases, and the judge has discretion regarding the appointment of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> in the proceedings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Senators for supporting the amendments.  I appreciate the support of the House for this Bill and the very constructive comments from Members.  I am sure I will return to the House to discuss the detail of some of these areas when we establish the new child and family support agency and as work progresses on putting the Children First guidance for the protection and welfare of children on a statutory basis.  Undoubtedly, some of these issues will arise again, particularly aftercare services.  I note how strongly people feel about those services.  As I said previously, we will gather information on the current practice in this country and examine what is being done, where there are gaps and how we can best deal with them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter.  Apparently, as I was the only Member to give notice of raising a matter on the Adjournment, its selection was a <i>fait accompli</i>.  This is an important function of the Seanad and I encourage Senators to use it.  If we do not use it, we might lose it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  She is one of the better and more informed Ministers in terms of her brief.  She is also a caring Minister, which is particularly important for her job given the need to show empathy and sympathy.  Unfortunately, she is being detained in the House tonight because the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, has not appeared before the Seanad to answer our questions.  We have sought numerous debates on health policy and local hospital services but the Minister has not seen fit to come to the House.  He came to the House for debates on non-controversial, cross-party issues and was happy to discuss them, but not issues such as this.  This Minister would not be here tonight if the Minister for Health had come to the Seanad; therefore, I am sorry for detaining her.</P>
        <P>The issue of local hospitals is very emotive but it is an issue that must be discussed at the highest levels in Parliament because it is being discussed at kitchen tables in counties Meath, Louth and Roscommon.  There is confusion surrounding the status of Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan.  Last year, certain surgery services were removed or suspended.  I supported that at the <Col N="759"/>time because we received confidential information from Dr. O&rsquo;Brannigan of the HSE.  I am happy to stand over that support as I believe it was based on sound medical practice, according to what was described to me.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, there are various rumours, stories and allegations about the retention of accident and emergency and orthopaedic services at the hospital.  In one case, a local group was apparently told that the accident and emergency service would remain open for at least six months.  That is no way to run a health service, telling people it will be given six months and that it might close afterwards.  In addition, the hospital in Navan is something of a centre of excellence for orthopaedic services, providing a service not only for the local catchment area but also for the entire north east and for north-east Dublin.  We have been told that, for the first time ever, the orthopaedic service is to be closed if and when Cappagh Hospital gets extra capacity.</P>
        <P>Any threat to accident and emergency services in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan, will be vigorously opposed by the residents of County Meath.  Throughout my party&rsquo;s time in government it was consistently accused of attempting to close the hospital, but the situation with the accident and emergency service was always very clear &mdash; the hours of the service would be reduced but only when there was sufficient capacity available elsewhere to cope with the expected demand.  That capacity is simply not available in either Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, or in Blanchardstown hospital.  Safety is the first priority and it has not been shown that patients would be safer going to hospitals in Drogheda or Blanchardstown.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The removal of orthopaedic services from Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Navan would be a travesty and a scandal.  Its services are second to none and some of the finest surgeons and medical practitioners in this area of medicine operate from this hospital.  It is the regional centre for orthopaedic services.  Removing this important facility is surely only a stepping stone to the downgrading of the hospital to a glorified nursing home.  In terms of the future of small hospitals, which the previous Government and the HSE were committed to, the idea was to accept that there would not be a general hospital in every area but there would be an effort to provide certain specialised services in particular hospitals.  Navan has fulfilled this function very well in terms of orthopaedic services.</P>
        <P>With regard to accident and emergency services, the facilities are not in place.  It is most unfair of the Government to release information through leaks and, perhaps, briefings to Fine Gael Deputies and hospital committees.  There are various stories emerging from those meetings as to what might or might not happen.  It is time for clarity.  It is also time for the Fine Gael Party to implement the commitments it made in the general election campaign.  It made many varied commitments but it appears to be rowing back from them quite extraordinarily.  If the removal of orthopaedic services had been raised when we were in government, there would have been holy war from the Fine Gael Party.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am flagging that issue now and seeking clarity.  With no disrespect to this Minister, who is very busy with her brief and doing an excellent job, I believe the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, should appear before the Seanad to discuss this and other issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Navan hospital is an integral part of the Louth-Meath hospital group and the Minister is determined that it will continue to play an important role in the delivery of clinical services in the Louth-Meath area and to patients in other parts of the north-east region.  At present, Navan hospital continues to provide a 24-hour emergency department.  The Minister has stated that any changes to the operation of the emergency department can only be carried out after significant improvement in the performance of the emergency department at Drogheda.  To fully <Col N="760"/>consider the issues involved, the Minister will take account of the current organisation of acute services in the region and the important clinical programmes being developed by the HSE.  The Minister acknowledges the need for communication with the local community at this time and understands that the HSE is available to meet community representatives, as he is himself.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the Minister met the consultants in Navan hospital and with the Save Navan Hospital Alliance last week.  At that meeting, the Minister set out the position with regard to the emergency department at Navan hospital.  The Minister is absolutely clear that due to need to ensure the safe delivery of services and the best outcomes for patients, changes need to take place at the emergency department.  However, he has been equally clear that such changes need to be carried out in a planned way and that there will be full consultation on any changes.  The Minister estimates that it will be at least six months before any changes to the emergency department in Navan can be effected.</P>
        <P>The hospital continues to be the regional centre for elective orthopaedic surgery, including complex joint replacement surgery.  This surgery is a combined service with Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.</P>
        <P>The debate over smaller hospitals has been dominated for far too long by what they cannot do.  We need to move the debate on and focus on those things that they can do safely and efficiently, thereby ensuring the best outcomes for patients.</P>
        <P>The Minister has repeatedly emphasised the extremely important role that smaller hospitals have to play in services for their local community.  He believes that such hospitals can and should provide as wide as possible a range of services close to the local community.  They should be the cornerstone of locally based services and should have strong links to the local community-based services and to the larger hospitals in their region.  As the Minister previously stated, too often we have focused on what we are taking away rather than what we can add to services there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All of this will be done with full regard to the safety issues highlighted by HIQA in its reports on Ennis and Mallow hospitals.  When this framework is implemented, smaller hospitals will have a vibrant role, doing more work, not less, and meeting as many as possible of the needs of their local community while delivering safe health services with better patient outcomes.  That is the goal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply on behalf of the Minister for Health.  There seems to be some watering down of the requirement that there would be capacity elsewhere to deal with patients who would otherwise be in Navan.  The Minister&rsquo;s reply referred to a significant improvement in the performance of the emergency department in Drogheda and estimated that it would be at least six months before any changes could be effected.  I do not believe that is in line with the HIQA report, which talks about the extra capacity, nor is it very fair for the Minister to repeat this statement that there is at least six months left for the accident and emergency department.  I agree the focus should be on what hospitals can do and I am glad the reply contained no express threat to the orthopaedic services.</P>
