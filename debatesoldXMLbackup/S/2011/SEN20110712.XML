      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re referral of agreement between the European Union and Australia on the transfer and processing of passenger data to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, to be taken without debate; No. 2, address to Seanad &Eacute;ireann by Mr. Jerzy Buzek, President of the European Parliament, to commence at 2.30 p.m and to be followed by a question from each group leader who will be called upon in turn by the Cathaoirleach &mdash; to facilitate the prompt start of Mr. Buzek&rsquo;s address, Senators are asked to be in their seats no later than 2.25 p.m; and No. 3, Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill 2011 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 3.45 p.m. and conclude not later than 6.45 p.m.  Business will be interrupted between 3.10 p.m. and 3.45 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In welcoming the visit of Nabil Shaath, a former Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Palestinian Authority, I mention again the idea raised by Senator Feargal Quinn last week: that we prepare and agree a cross-party motion calling on the Government to support the efforts of the Palestinian Authority to gain recognition for full statehood within the United Nations.  Senator Feargal Quinn raised the issue last week and this side of the House completely agrees with him.  I, therefore, ask the Leader, if possible, to seek agreement among the Whips on a motion to be discussed this week while Mr. Shaath is here.  Some of us have been in contact with Palestinian groups and Irish support groups and the visit offers an opportunity for the House to table and agree a motion.  Our Whip will certainly discuss with the Government and other groupings an agreed motion in support of the application for full statehood in the United Nations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On Thursday there will be statements on A Vision for Change, the document introduced by the previous Government, on which much work was done by the then Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, John Maloney.  It is ironic that last week, under the radar, a decision was taken to disallow further admissions to St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital in Portrane in my constituency, Dublin North.  This is the largest psychiatric hospital north of the River Liffey but from 31 August there will be no new admissions.  This follows a week of major issues in the health service, with people wishing some things that had been said could be unsaid and promises broken.  I ask the Minister for Health to come before the House to explain how decisions such as this can be made directly to the staff, with no communication with the D&aacute;il, the Seanad or other elected officials.  This Government decision will no doubt be blamed on the HSE, but <Col N="456"/>it means that 800 new admissions for acute psychiatric care must go elsewhere, although there is no provision made on the north side of Dublin for these patients.  Within six weeks St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital will be issued with a closure order without any announcement by the Minister for Health, in whose constituency the hospital is located.  I will be raising this matter on Thursday, as no doubt the Leader will suggest, during statements on A Vision for Change.  The irony is not lost on me.  A vision for change in north Dublin means the shutting of a psychiatric hospital which is not the sort of change I want to see.</P>
        <P>I will try to be relevant for fear I will incur the wrath of Senator C&aacute;it Keane.  Last week I asked about the assistance being given, based on promises in the programme for Government, in respect of distressed mortgages, following the recent ECB base rate increase, with two further increases expected later this year.  I will ask the President of the European Parliament questions about this later.</P>
        <P>Can the Leader tell us when the Government will make good on the promises it made in the programme for Government to increase mortgage interest relief to 30% for first time buyers who bought their houses between 2004 and 2008?  I note that in reply to a parliamentary question in the D&aacute;il last week the Minister for Finance said this would be considered in his deliberations on the forthcoming budget.  That is not what is said in the programme for Government.  In the first quarter of 2011, more than 140 houses were repossessed, an increase of more than 25%.  When will the Government bring forward its proposals?  They will be supported by this side of the House.  Today we published our Bill on the protection of the family home.  Senator Marc MacSharry has been working on the Bill and I hope when it is introduced in the House on 27 July there will be cross-party agreement on it, just as on the Labour Party motion on house repossessions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s call for a cross-party motion in the House on Palestine.  It would be a suitable topic for a cross-party motion; the Labour Party would fully support it.  The idea first mooted by Senator Quinn is good and this is a good week to do it, given the visit this week of Dr. Shaath.</P>
        <P>We all might predict the type of questions we will ask Mr. Buzek, the President of the European Parliament.  Senator O&rsquo;Brien has already alluded to that.  It is an auspicious day with the positive announcement on interest rates but it is worrying that this appears to have been precipitated by the news from Italy and concerns about that country&rsquo;s debt levels.  Some of us might frame our questions in the context of what will happen in the eurozone generally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I again ask the Leader to arrange a debate on media ethics.  Since last week, when I and others raised the issue of the <i>News of the World</i>, matters have moved swiftly.  I doubt that any of us expected or anticipated the announcement that the <i>News of the World</i>  would close.  Many honest journalists lost their jobs as a result.  It appears to have been a rather cynical move by Mr. Rupert Murdoch to try to save his bid for the takeover of BSkyB, which now appears unlikely to be successful.  It has become a full-blown political scandal in Britain and has serious implications for the British Government.  In Ireland, there is a need to debate media ethics to try to forestall any news that these underhand and illegal tactics have spread to Irish newspapers.  News International has a big hold on the Irish newspaper market with both <i>The Sun</i> and <i>The Sunday Times</i>.  News of the despicable and illegal attempts to get material on Mr. Gordon Brown and his family should be a warning for us to ensure that these tactics are not used in Ireland.  I hope we can have a debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>I seek a debate on the future of universities.  In that context, I congratulate Trinity College which has been named among the leading universities in the world in the latest QS world university rankings.  Social sciences feature in the top 100 for each of the listed disciplines.  I <Col N="457"/>confess a certain self interest in this regard given that the law school in Trinity College is in the top 100.  Trinity College is also the only Irish university to make it into the top 50 for sociology, politics and international studies.  That is a remarkable achievement in view of the level of cutbacks the third level sector has faced in recent times.  A debate early in the next session on the future of the university sector would be very useful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not give a preview of our question to the President of the European Parliament; I will leave that to my esteemed colleague, Senator van Turnhout.  I have two questions for the Leader of the House relating to a significant process which Ireland is engaged in at present, its participation in the United Nations Universal Periodic Review, UPR.  As Members are aware, the UPR process is an innovative mechanism under which countries are held to account every four years by their fellow member states in the United Nations on their complete performance across the full range of civil, political, social and economic rights.</P>
        <P>Last week, the Irish Government submitted its report on its record.  The report explicitly states a number of times that Ireland is deeply committed to the protection and promotion of human rights and that this is central to Ireland&rsquo;s domestic and foreign policies.  I encourage Members to review the Government&rsquo;s report, if they have not already done so.  It is a fascinating read and points to a number of achievements in Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to protect and promote human rights.  Of equal importance, it provides us, as law-makers, with a concrete expression of how and why the framing of legislation must be compliant with the human rights provisions of the Constitution and our international human rights obligations.</P>
        <P>This Government report is one of the documents the UN member states will use when they examine our human rights record on 6 October.  Another document is the stakeholder report.  It is a compilation by the United Nations of submissions received from Irish civil society actors and the submission received from Ireland&rsquo;s national human rights institution, the Irish Human Rights Commission.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties formed a coalition with an extensive number of organisations to produce Ireland&rsquo;s civil society UPR stakeholder report, which was launched last May.  The Irish Human Rights Commission issued its recommendation to the Government yesterday that, in advance of the UN examination, Ireland ought to name its voluntary commitments that will identify how it intends to reduce gaps in its human rights protections, such as an assessment of the human rights impact of welfare and service related decisions on those who are vulnerable or disadvantaged.</P>
        <P>Prior to Ireland&rsquo;s examination by the Human Rights Council in October, could we invite one or two leaders to engage with us about their views on Ireland&rsquo;s human rights record, for example, the president of the Irish Human Rights Commission, Dr. Maurice Manning, who is a former Leader of the Seanad, and a member of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties?  This could provide us with another opportunity to implement the motion passed by the House to engage directly with leaders on issues of public importance.  After Ireland&rsquo;s examination and prior to the outcome report from the process that will be produced in early 2012 and which the Irish Government formally adopts, will the Leader consider inviting the T&aacute;naiste or the Minister for Justice and Equality to the House to engage with us on how Ireland will commit itself to improving its human rights record in light of the UPR process?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My attention has been drawn to the very high price the public pays for pharmacy goods here, be they over-the-counter or prescription medicines, compared to what the public pays in other countries.  It is due to legislation produced here, not EU legislation.  Perhaps the Leader would invite the Minister for Health to the House to discuss this.  It is quite confusing that a large number of products that are available over the counter in other countries are prescription products here.  That means people must pay to go to a doctor to get the prescription and then pay the price of the product, which in many cases is a multiple <Col N="458"/>of what is charged elsewhere.  It applies to a large number of products.  I can understand why anti-depressant products are prescription only, as they could be addictive.  However, one can go into an off-licence and buy ten or 12 bottles of vodka, which is a far bigger problem, but one cannot buy Solpadeine and some other products even though only a tiny number of people could be addicted to them.</P>
        <P>I do not know the answer to this problem, only that Irish people pay a price for many of these products that is a multiple of the price elsewhere.  Part of the reason is that the products have been put on prescription instead of being sold over the counter.  As a result the pharmacists do not have the choice or freedom to do otherwise.  A large number of generic products can be sold in pharmacies in other countries but we do not appear to have that freedom here.  We do not permit the advertising of products sold behind the prescription counter.  I understand why we do that but the matter is worthy of debate, especially when many products that are sold over the counter in the North of Ireland and in Britain cannot be sold here except on prescription.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>Last month, President Obama visited this country and, for once, Ireland was projected throughout the world for reasons other than the banking crisis.  That was very welcome.  The Bank of Ireland building on College Green means a great deal to Ireland.  It could be a symbol of where we intend to go.  We must show that we have not yet lost our imagination, our capacity to reason and our ability to innovate.  We must show that our artistic soul is still thriving.</P>
        <P>In recent days we have heard the governor of the Bank of Ireland and other senior figures in the bank speak about the value of the College Green premises to the bank, but this must be viewed in the context of the abject failure of performance over the past five years.  If this was 2005, I could well understand how the bank would have felt it had some room for manoeuvre, but this is 2011 and we, taxpayers, own 36% of the institution and as such, it is something to which we feel we are more entitled than ever.  Much like the runner who has been outrun in the race, Bank of Ireland has not come to terms with its new position in the market and the nation.  Its stubborn refusal to engage is symbolic of this.  In this endeavour I fully support the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, whose idea demonstrates a capacity for seeing the bigger picture, something we now need.  If his proposal were to be implemented in full, College Green could become a square that would rival those in New York and London.  I imagine it would far supersede any mere bank relocation in terms of cost.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to invite the Minister to explain his thinking on the matter which would enable us to have an input as to how we believe it could come to pass.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two issues, the first of which relates to the Family Home Bill published today by Senator Marc MacSharry and me.  As Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien said, it forms part of the Fianna F&aacute;il strategy to deal with mortgage indebtedness and personal debt.  Protecting the family home is a priority for everybody in the House.  As Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien said, there was cross-party support for a Labour Party motion in this regard.  No doubt there will be some aspects of the Bill that people may or may not like and that they can address on Committee Stage.  However, no one can be in any doubt that the objective of keeping people in the family home is one that should be supported in legislation in this House.  I look forward to that debate when the Bill is taken in Private Members&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>Some serious issues have arisen in the media and I hope they will be the subject of discussion at the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party meeting.  Allegations have been made in the media that <Col N="459"/>the issue of whether a Deputy was loyal to the Taoiseach in last year&rsquo;s leadership battle is having an influence on which hospitals should be closed or kept open.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is relevant to be asked by&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should be brought before the House to discuss this issue because I have never heard such an allegation being made before.  Unnamed Fine Gael Deputies expressed this concern at the weekend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is out of order.  We cannot discuss what happens at parliamentary party meetings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a most serious issue and one that badly needs to be addressed because we see Ministers running to protect their own areas.</P>
        <P>My second point relates to media reports at the weekend that sources close to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, were seriously criticising the Taoiseach about his commitment on the issue of income tax.  Whether that is true should also be addressed in the House.  The commitment was given since the general election.  As they got to read the books, they do not have the excuse that they did not know how bad things were.  Will the commitment given be abandoned?  Is there talk of it being abandoned, or did it mean anything at the time it was given?  These topics in the media of concern to the people are worthy of discussion in the House.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to arrange a debate on them.  We were promised that the Minister for Finance would come into the House for a full throttle debate on financial issues.  I fully accept, as I always have, that he is a very busy man and that his primary function is that of fulfilling his role as Minister for Finance, but time should be made available to the Seanad to discuss the issues I have raised and other serious matters concerning his portfolio.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Senator Catherine Noone for her presentation on that iconic building in College Green.  I also commend the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, for having the imagination to suggest it could potentially be used as a centre of excellence for literature.  We know the benefit literature has been to this country internationally.  The potential to develop a square, a world famous piazza, in College Green is something that must be considered.  I take grave offence at Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s attitude in this regard.  It is the least it should do, given the fact that it played a significant part in bankrupting the country, destroying the economy and ensuring&mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>These are points the Deputy can make during a debate on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;our international reputation would be left in tatters.  If legislation is required to ensure the building is be taken into State ownership, I for one will play my part in ensuring it passes through the House, as I am sure will other Members.  The bank&rsquo;s attitude is appalling.  To think that delinquent bankers would maintain that an iconic building in this city, which really and truly belongs to the people now, should be&mdash;&mdash;-</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;traded and used in horse trading because of its so-called monetary value is appalling.  I ask the Leader to ensure that he raises this issue with the Minister, <Col N="460"/>Deputy Deenihan.  I am sure we will all play our part in whatever steps are necessary in this respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two questions for the Leader but before I raise them I make the point that it is fast becoming obvious to many people that this Government is following the lead of the previous Government.  It is becoming again a Government of announcements.  We heard the Minister for Finance say on radio this morning that at some point in the future there may be something done in respect of the interest rates that might be good for Ireland.  We have had endless optimism from the Minister but no detail.</P>
        <P>The President of the European Parliament will address this Chamber today.  Sinn F&eacute;in is the second largest Opposition party in the Oireachtas and we do not have the opportunity to welcome the President of the European Parliament to this House.  That is disgraceful and appalling.  I have taken this up with the Leader of the House but I have not got a favourable response.  It is appalling.  Perhaps it has more to do with the fact that my party is the only party that is standing up to people in Europe and those who are trying to put a noose around the necks of taxpayers by asking us to unfairly shoulder the responsibility for the reckless borrowing of other people that they had nothing to do with the people of this country.</P>
        <P>We also had statements in recent times.  We all saw the media coverage of commitments given by the then Deputies Eamon Gilmore and Enda Kenny and Senators during the last election campaign in respect of Roscommon County Hospital.  There has been a clear betrayal of voters by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question.  Last week we had a five hour debate on the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill but we saw no sign of the Minister for Health.  I intend to move an amendment to the Order of Business.  Three hours are to be allocated today to take Committee and remaining Stages of the Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill, to which there is not even an amendment tabled.  This is madness.  We will discuss mobile phones for two hours and yet we cannot get the Minister for Health to come in here to talk about the very real issues of health care facing the people.  I am not referring only to the broken promises in respect of Roscommon County Hospital.  I could mention a number of broken promises that were made in respect of my constituency of Waterford.  A community nursing unit was promised&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are points the Senator can make during the debate later today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;by this and previous Governments.  The Minister for Health needs to come into this Chamber to discuss the real concerns people in County Roscommon and in many other counties have who believe that what happened in Roscommon County Hospital could also happen in their counties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business: that the Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill be heard from 3.45 p.m. to 4.45 p.m. and from 4.45 p.m. to 6.45 p.m. that the Minister for Health come into the House.  It seems he is afraid of debate, afraid to come in here and listen to the views of the elected representatives who represent people who have been betrayed by the Government and by the promises that were made by the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  It is simply not good enough.  We want to know when the Minister for Health will come into this House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the matter of a report on the use of legal highs published by the EU yesterday.  Those in the 15 to 24 age group in our population are highest users of legal highs, with 16% of that age group having admitted in surveys to using them.  This issue was dealt with last year, but it has not gone way.  This problem will remain with us.  Once one drug is made illegal, a new manufacturing process is put in place to bring another similar type drug on to the market.  One drug alone accounted for many deaths in Europe.  There were 39 deaths in Europe, 37 in the UK and Ireland.  It is a serious issue which involves the Department of Education and Skills as well as the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health.  At this stage, we need to implement a proactive education programme.  I ask that the Minister for Education and Skills outline to the House what his Department proposes in terms of educating young people about the dangers of illegal drugs and legal highs.  They may not affect their health immediately but they have long-term impacts.    </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I would welcome a debate on health issues with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  He owes it to us to come into this House and I will move non-Government motion No. 3 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper if the opportunity arises.  We should have an opportunity to discuss the serious decision to close the accident and emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital.  Yesterday, 11 July 2011, was a black day for Roscommon.  It has been proven that the Taoiseach made statements on radio to the effect that he would retain those services.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, sent the letter that I read on the floor of the House last week and the T&aacute;naiste gave a commitment to Senator John Kelly that the Government would guarantee the future of the hospital and its accident and emergency department.  The T&aacute;naiste has also stated that he will protect the accident and emergency department in Loughlinstown, which is located close to St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital.  The same cannot be said about Roscommon County Hospital, however.  The Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s hospital in Castlebar will benefit from the closure of the accident and emergency department in Roscommon.</P>
        <P>It is a major blow to Roscommon and, as someone who has been involved in this issue for a long time and signed the contract for the new accident and emergency department in 2002, I find it most regrettable.  The people of Roscommon feel deeply saddened by this decision and if the Taoiseach announced the closure of the department, I do not doubt Fine Gael would have won only one seat, if any, in the Roscommon-South Leitrim constituency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the strategy announced by the Minister for Education and Skills regarding literacy and numeracy.  The strategy, which was published following a consultation period, focuses on improving standards at higher and lower levels, increasing literacy and numeracy skills and setting standards for the uptake of higher level maths.  It will involve changes in teacher training and continuing professional development.  One of the intentions behind this important strategy is to raise awareness.  A debate in this House would certainly raise awareness and we could have a useful discussion if the Minister is prepared to outline how he intends to proceed in this area.  It was not my intention to refer to the closure of the emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital, but the issue was raised by two Senators.  It is outrageous to suggest the Taoiseach or the Minister for Health would take advantage of the situation.  Senator Terry Leyden suggested services were being improved at Castlebar hospital, while Senator Thomas Byrne made a twisted suggestion regarding the Taoiseach&rsquo;s relationship with members of his party.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>We all know HIQA produced a report stating the services provided at Roscommon County Hospital were unsafe.  Are Senators advocating that the Taoiseach should ignore this advice?  If I was in opposition, I would always uphold standards in the interests of patient safety.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not have an opportunity to consult HIQA on the mortality figures in local hospitals, but the closure of services in Roscommon is a critical issue.  I am not an instinctive &ldquo;save our hospital&rdquo; type of person because calm, rational and systematic decisions need to be made about the configuration of hospital services.  However, these decisions must keep in mind two key variables.  The first is that larger centres with a higher throughput will generally have better outcomes than smaller centres dealing sporadically with the same health problems.  The second is that local people will enjoy some improvements in the quality of their care if they have local access.  A balance has to be struck between these variables.  For that reason, I will not state whether services in Roscommon should be closed or remain open.</P>
        <P>I have strong opinions about where cancer care services should be provided, but I am not as certain about the emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital.  However, the decision-making process which apparently led to the precipitous decision to discontinue emergency services at Roscommon County Hospital leaves something to be desired.  I ask the Leader <Col N="463"/>to arrange for the Minister for Health to come to the House with the figures and, if necessary, a good old-fashioned US Congress-style board because I, for one, want to understand the numbers which led to the statement that the mortality rate in Galway was 5% compared to 20% in Roscommon.  As a professional, there are not many areas of my speciality in which two treatments gives rise to a 200% difference in outcome.  As I thought there was something odd in the figures, I sought information from the folks in Roscommon and the figures they supplied indicate that there were approximately 430 admissions to the coronary care and cardiac unit last year in Roscommon, with a mortality rate of approximately 5%.  I have also seen the figures for the patients who died while in the care of Roscommon County Hospital in 2011 and believe most of those who died could not have been saved in Mayo Clinic, Massachusetts General Hospital or anywhere else.  They included patients who had had devastating strokes complicated by pneumonia and elderly people with multi-system complications and no chance of recovery.</P>
        <P>When I heard the suggestion that matters were so bad in Roscommon that not only was it necessary to close the service but that it had to be done as an emergency, I was discomfited on behalf of my good colleagues working at the hospital who for many years had provided a service on a shoestring budget and, in some cases, built modern cardiac services with limited or no support from successive Governments.  They have managed to achieve and deliver a reasonably good service for the people of County Roscommon.  The argument may be made in favour of centralising cardiac and other emergency services in Galway and this should  be part of the national debate.  However, promising in advance of an election that &mdash;&mdash;</P>

Furthermore, it has just been reported on radio that Mr. Patrick McHugh stated HIQA had never visited or inspected this hospital.  A representative from HIQA was put on the spot on the radio programme and said there had not been an inspection of Roscommon County Hospital.  The Minister may have made the right or the wrong decision.  I do not know, but we need him to come to the House to give us the figures and take us through the thought processes behind the decision.  I am sorry for running over time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Today we published the Family Home Bill 2011 which will be taken in the Seanad during Private Members&rsquo; time on 27 July.  It includes some radical proposals to protect families and prevent them from losing their homes.  It has been brought forward in the context of the crisis Ireland is facing and informed by two years&rsquo; work, debate in the Houses, the work of the Prevention of Family Home Repossession group, of which I am a founder, the New Beginning group and others.  It is radical and will be controversial for some, but there is no reason every Member should not support it.  We are not saying the Bill has been brought forward to embarrass the Government; far from it.  It can be its finest hour if it embraces the good will on this side of the House in bringing forward these proposals and the ultimate improvements it would bring in protecting the family home.  I have said before that there can be no more important consideration for society than the protection of the family.  For this reason, the radical and fair proposals made in the Bill require, if not demand, the support of every Member.  On Committee Stage, assuming we all support the Bill on Second Stage on 27 July, I have no doubt further improvements could be made to it.  I hope this Seanad which all of us said we hoped would be the best if it had to be the last can take a giant leap forward and bring forward what would be a most historic Bill aimed at the protection of the family home.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would wholeheartedly welcome an opportunity for the Minister of Health to come to the House.  I know he is very busy and trying his best.  However, I have grave concerns about commitments given in the heat of political debate during election campaigns.  There are <Col N="465"/>recordings of all of the leaders in the Government speaking about cancer services in Sligo General Hospital and other services in Roscommon County Hospital and other hospitals across the country.  It is clear that the configuration of hospital and medical services must be examined.  I have seen no cohesive strategy from anybody for what is proposed north of a line from Dublin to Galway, but we have reports on cardiac catheterisation, trauma and cancer services that involve centralisation and effectively ignore people north of that line.</P>

	<P>Yes.  I am asking for a debate on this issue.  I have very serious concerns about the proximity of HIQA to senior management in the HSE.  Following a difficult process under the Freedom of Information Act, I managed to get my hands on a report which proved that Mr. John Billings of HIQA  &mdash; I am quoting words from minutes he wrote in respect of which I had to solicit the help of the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly &mdash; and HIQA had constructed a process&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If debates on these issues could be arranged, I would greatly appreciate it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the publication of the Family Home Bill 2011 that Senator MacSharry is to bring before the House.  We are all concerned about protecting the family home.  Many of us spoke strongly about that in the last Senate, so I welcome a reading of that Bill.  With a bit of luck, we will be able to find a way to support many parts of it.</P>
        <P>I have been reading about the moves made by the Minister for Education and Skills, and I thought &ldquo;there is a God, after all&rdquo; when I read that he will introduce 50% continuous assessment for the junior certificate.  I really welcome this move.  Our children learn differently, so I am delighted to see that the Minister is talking about 50% continuous assessment and 50% for a terminal exam.  I am also delighted about the publication of the literacy and numeracy strategy to which Senator Clune referred.  However, I am concerned that the Minister is making rapid and far-reaching decisions that will affect all our lives and our children&rsquo;s lives for generations.  We need him to come into this House.  I ask the Leader to convey to him my concern that he has not been here.  How are we to have any input into his decision making process?  How are we to convey the concerns of teachers, parents and students unless we speak directly with him?</P>
        <P>I raised the issue of AIB a few weeks ago and its slow move on issuing finance for business.  I raised a case for a high-tech company in Galway with &euro;4.5 million in new orders and which was able to employ eight people.  Almost four weeks later, the bank has still not issued credit to that company.  Representatives from the company contacted me today.  They are now about to lose that order.  This is wrong.  We must have faster decisions by our banks.  I have been working with the bank on one side and the client on the other side.  I have been given permission by both to do that.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Time is of the essence.  I call on the Leader to bring the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation before the House and see how we can expedite decisions on behalf of banks in order that our companies are not <Col N="466"/>losing their orders and opportunities to employ people.  The small and medium enterprise sector is the lifeblood of the economy and I fear for its future if the banks are this tardy in making decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in calling for a general debate on the health services.  What has been raised at the moment is the question of the standards of truth that prevail at election time.  That is an important issue of morality and principle.  I am afraid that this hospital issue has now precipitated a highly volatile and dangerous political situation at a time when the country could do without it.  I wish people would be forthright and honest when dealing with these issues, and not just seek electoral advantage.</P>
        <P>With regard to HIQA, I have no intention of disparaging the personnel and I do not have any names.  I recall sharing an Adjournment matter with a Member from a Government party who is now in the other House dealing with the closure of a home for the elderly in Carlow.  HIQA was involved in that and the reasons given basically amounted to a lack of proper paintwork.  Elderly and vulnerable patients were forcibly evicted in what was clearly an economic move, which was not right.  Our concern should be the welfare of citizens, particularly the elderly and vulnerable.  I hope we will have a good examination of the economic principles or whatever is behind such action.  It is a dangerous and regrettable position and I am sorry we have been precipitated into it as nobody will benefit.</P>
        <P>Related to this is the serious issue of the haemorrhaging of young doctors from this country.  All our medical graduates, including doctors and nurses, are going abroad because they cannot get proper jobs.  At the same time we are importing 200 personnel from Asia and making special provisions to find out about language skills and the taking of exams.  That is appalling.  I do not mean to denigrate the people involved but we are asset-stripping medical resources from vulnerable people on the other side of the planet.</P>

I am glad the Senator put the issue in the context of protecting the family, as everybody in the House would accept the concept.  We are all pro-family, and I hope this will be an opportunity for us to resist the attempted colonisation of the word &ldquo;family&rdquo; and the values surrounding it by a small amount of interest groups in the country.  It would be a dangerous path to tread.  We are all part of families here, and families exist and are recognised in a diversity of forms.  That should be celebrated and I look forward to making that point during this important debate.  I will certainly support the Bill. </P>

	<P>I wish to raise an important issue, namely planning in rural Ireland.  There is little activity currently in the building industry but at the same time a range of tests must be carried out by people who want to build in rural Ireland.  These include percolation tests.  It may be time for us to consider a regional approach for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as people are objecting to activity in rural Ireland.  Along the western seaboard we have seen in recent years people seeking and getting planning approval from local councils for wind farms but people are objecting to such projects.  We discussed last week how this sector could see a range of job creation for young people.  I ask for the relevant Minister to attend the House so we can have a debate on the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, for his initiative concerning the Bank of Ireland building on College Green.  If his officials bring him through the entire file <Col N="467"/>he would see a letter from me to the previous Minister suggesting the same idea.  We were making progress on the issue until the untimely general election.  We do not care which Kerryman opens the building, even if it is my Seanad colleague, Senator Paul Coghlan.</P>
        <P>I will not mention NAMA today but I ask the Leader to invite the appropriate Minister to the House to discuss the proposed price increases from Bord G&aacute;is.  For the past two years, under a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government, there were price reductions and I want to know what the current Government will do about the proposed increases.</P>
        <P>Another Senator from Louth raised the issue of Palestinian statehood.  A couple of days ago we had the fifth anniversary of the capture and imprisonment of an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, who has been held in inhumane conditions within the Gaza strip.  I am sure all Members of the House will join me in calling for his release.  At the same time I look forward to the debate on Palestinian statehood.</P>
        <P>Senator Crown from the Independent group spoke about what was just released on the radio.  It is disturbing that no report was done and this is being used as a political tool to justify a political decision, with the justification only produced later.  We look forward to the debate proposed by Senator Leyden in that regard.  Will the Leader facilitate a debate in the near future on organ donation?  The programme for Government discusses presumed consent and I do not know if those opposite who voted for the programme realise what that means.  It means the State has the right to take a person&rsquo;s organs, whether the family agrees to the procedure or not.</P>

	<P>I commend Senator Bacik for raising the fact that Trinity College Dublin is rated among the finest universities in the world this year and relate this to the training of doctors.  I hope the Minister for Health will come before the House, although I have seen him in here since I was elected.  It would not be his first time in the House.  I wish to discuss the reason our doctors are leaving after receiving good training, as they go to another country for further training before being appointed consultants.</P>
        <P>Is it possible to consider a system where every student &mdash; not only medical students &mdash; would give something back to the country which serves people so well through training?  Education is a very valued commodity in our society and it is the most valuable asset of young people.  Those who receive it should be and are very grateful.  I see students participating in the Gaisce awards overseen by President Mary McAleese and they are delighted to give something back.  Students are also involved with meals on wheels and are delighted to give something back in that way.</P><Col N="468"/>
        <P>We should not just pick out medical students to give something back and a system could be devised where students would get extra points &mdash; or another form of incentivisation &mdash; to give something back on foot of their education.  Many young people still cannot avail of the fine education others receive.  The Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health could consider a system with the help of other training bodies.  I ask that when the Minister for Health comes before the House he would give a statement on that suggestion.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>These increases will further exacerbate the difficulties experienced by a large number of households when they receive their energy bills.  They will push many people into arrears, increase the number of disconnections and lead to many people being unable to heat their homes during the colder winter months.  I remind the House that Bord G&aacute;is made a profit of &euro;120 million last year.  It persuaded a large number of people to make the &ldquo;big switch&rdquo; from their previous electricity supplier on the basis that they would make a saving and get a better deal.  As a result of this move bills will increase and customers will lose out by more than &euro;300 a year.  This measure has been proposed at a time when more than 114,000 customers of Bord G&aacute;is are in arrears of more than two months.  That figure has increased by 300% since last year.  The degree of price-matching in this sector makes it inevitable that the other two major players in the sector will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources comes to the House to discuss electricity prices, perhaps we can also discuss the terms of reference for the commission of investigation into the North-South interconnector, which were considered by the Cabinet last week.  We could kill two birds with one stone by having an overall discussion on energy provision in the State.</P>

	<P>I support the call for the Minister for Health to come to the House to discuss the overall health situation.  I join others in requesting that the CEO of the HSE, Mr. Cathal Magee, be invited to the House as well.  The HSE has not covered itself in glory in its planning of the new facility in Roscommon with advanced paramedics and an enhanced ambulance service.  The big difficulty in Roscommon is that there is no confidence that the system which has been promised will be delivered.  The HSE has many questions to answer.  I want the Leader to impress on the Minister the need to ensure sufficient resources are provided in the hospitals that will take additional patients from Roscommon.  We need to make sure we do not end up with large waiting lists and people in queues at hospitals like Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe.</P>

	<P>I am looking for a debate.  I want to make sure we provide the investment needed to ensure the people of Roscommon, who deserve a top-class health service, can avail of the necessary facilities when they have to go to Ballinasloe, Castlebar and Galway.  This is an urgent request.  The CEO of the HSE, Mr. Cathal Magee, must be brought in to discuss this issue.</P>

	<P>I could not help noticing Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s reference to incurring the wrath of Cain.  I thought he was talking as a Trekkie fan about &ldquo;The Wrath of Khan&rdquo;.  The elephant in the room &mdash; the Italian and Spanish debt crisis &mdash; has not been mentioned so far today.  In that context&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>That is what one calls a candid compliment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I was probably unable to grasp that aspect of her contribution.  In this House some weeks ago, I asked the Minister for Social Protection where the Government would find the money to fund essential services ahead of the next budget and beyond it.  My question was based on statements made by the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach to the effect that they would not increase income tax.  We need to bear in mind that they cannot do anything about the Croke Park agreement, which means public service jobs are guaranteed.  Nobody can <Col N="470"/>be fired or let go until 2013, at least.  We will have to borrow &euro;20 billion this year or next year.  Figures released by the Department of Social Protection earlier this week show that almost half the people of this country are receiving social welfare benefits.  An achievement of the two most recent Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers in that Department, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Mary Hanafin, was buried in those statistics.  The figures for 2010 show that savings of almost &euro;500 million were made as a result of the initiatives taken by both Ministers.  I wish the current Minister well in her continuing efforts to ensure there is no fraud in this area.  We need to ask where the money will come from to provide essential services to everyone who is now on social welfare.  The jobs initiative is stuttering.  It has not achieved anything yet.  We wish it well.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader, in light of the Italian and Spanish debt crisis, to consider inviting the Minister for Finance to come to the House before the end of the recess.  I know a similar request has been made in a different context.  The Minister should indicate exactly how the Government intends to address this matter.  I am firmly of the view, which is shared by an increasing number of financial commentators and analysts, that the debt burden with which this country is encumbered is unsustainable in the medium to long term.  There is a great deal of talk in Europe about all sorts of restructuring, which the international investors are interpreting as default&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked the Leader to invite the Minister for Finance to come to the House.  In that context, he should raise with the Minister the question of whether the Government should give serious consideration to a revision of its current position on our unsustainable debt burden.  It seems to me that something needs to be done before next year to remove the unsustainable debt burden, particularly that incurred through reckless banking.  Regardless of the political charges that might be made, I suggest that reckless banking is at the bottom of this.  It is happening in Spain and Italy and it has happened in Greece.</P>

	<P>Four more Senators have indicated that they wish to speak.  We have gone over time.  The President of the European Parliament will be here at 2.30 p.m.  An amendment to the Order of Business has been proposed.  The Senators in question &mdash; Senators Walsh, Bradford, White and O&rsquo;Sullivan &mdash; will get an opportunity to speak on the Order of Business tomorrow.  I call the Leader of the House.</P>

	<P>On a point of order, while I accept the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling, I would like to point out that this is the second time this has happened in a couple of weeks.  The Chair will accept that I indicated at an early stage in today&rsquo;s proceedings that I wished to speak.  Now that we have a quasi-Independent group in the House, the chances of Members getting to <Col N="471"/>speak are much more limited.  Therefore, the two-minute limit on contributions should be applied fairly rigidly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien referred to an agreed motion on Palestine.  I have no objection to a discussion on the matter by the Whips.  I do not know whether they will be able to agree a joint motion.  I am quite willing to allow the Whips to meet to discuss the matter.  It is unlikely that we will have a debate on any such motion this week.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien raised the question of St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital in Portrane.  As he correctly stated, Senators will have an opportunity to discuss such issues on Thursday when the House debates A Vision for Change.  Since the new Seanad started to meet, a number of Members have requested debates on that report and on various mental health issues.  We will have an opportunity to discuss them on Thursday.  Given that the debate was requested by Members, I am sure we will have a full quota of speakers on A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P>Reference was also made to the problem of distressed mortgages.  It is a matter which the Minister stated he will address in the budget and I do not wish to second-guess the Minister on that.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik raised media ethics and the deplorable hacking issue in England about which we have read and heard.  One hopes it is not happening here as well.  It might be an idea to have a debate on that as soon as we possibly can arrange one.  I am sure we all would like to join in complimenting Trinity College on its successes.</P>
        <P>There have been requests from quite a number of Senators for debates on education, the future of the third level sector and so on.  We are trying to arrange that the Minister for Education and Skills would come in here as early as possible in September.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn sought a debate on the cost of prescription drugs.  It is a matter which was discussed previously here but it certainly needs further attention based on a number of articles which we read about recently.</P>
        <P>Indeed, when speaking about Senator Quinn, I refer to Senator Daly&rsquo;s call for a debate on organ donation.  That is a matter close to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s heart and he has raised it on several <Col N="472"/>occasions in this House.  It is possibly an area on which we can have a debate.  I think Senator Quinn tabled a worthy Bill dealing with that matter in this House.</P>
        <P>Senators Noone, Conway, Daly and others sought a debate on the Bank of Ireland building on College Green.  We will endeavour to have the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, in here, not alone to discuss the College Green building but also to have an overarching debate on the arts, which is long overdue.</P>
        <P>Senator Byrne raised the issue of the Family Home Bill.  I received that only today and I look forward to reading it.  Senator MacSharry has put much work into this Bill.  I compliment any Member who introduces a Private Members&rsquo; Bill in this House.  It is not easy to do.  We look forward to taking that Bill on 27 July when I am sure that we will have a constructive debate.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator Cullinane, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in his discussions on the radio talking about reports, was only answering questions put to him by reporters on last night&rsquo;s meeting.  He was not making any statements, but answeringquestions.</P>
        <P>On the Minister for Health, the issue of junior doctors has again come up.  There was a five-hour debate here last week on the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill.  The junior Minister apologised for the absence of the senior Minister because he had to attend a funeral out of the State on the day in question.  Otherwise he would have been here.</P>
        <P>Senator Colm Burke called for a debate on illegal highs and their availability on the Internet and elsewhere, and educating young people on the dangers of this.  There is legislation but, obviously, it is not sufficient and needs to be addressed further.  It is something which several Senators, in particular, Senator Wilson raised in the previous Seanad.  We can raise the matter again with the relevant Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden and quite a number of other Senators sought a debate on Roscommon hospital.  Patient safety must be the No. 1 priority of any Government and any Minister.  Whatever about promises or anything else, the patients&rsquo; safety must come first.</P>

As it is an important issue, we should arrange to have a debate and have the Minister for Education and Skills in here in September to deal with that.</P>
        <P>Senator Crown raised the issue of Roscommon hospital.  It is all about reform.  There is an &euro;18 billion deficit.  Senator Crown, more than anybody else, has spoken about reforming the health service.  That is what we must do.  The Minister is doing his best to address the issues in reforming, but it will not happen in the first three months or in the first three years.</P>

	<P>Senator D&rsquo;Arcy also called for a debate on Palestinian statehood.  We should arrange a debate.  If we can have an agreed motion, we could possibly have a debate on that if we can secure the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore.</P>
        <P>I already addressed Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s matter and again compliment him on introducing the Family Home Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames called for a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills on the literacy report, to which I referred.  She also called for a debate on AIB.  I am sure the Senator, if she has dealt with the matter between both the bank and the company involved, has brought the Credit Review Office into this matter.  It is not acceptable that banks are not lending to small enterprises, as she mentioned.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris spoke about the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  HIQA has produced quite a number of reports on nursing homes and many nursing homes have been closed.  I do not think any of those nursing homes were closed down because of economic principles.  The closures were based on the authority&rsquo;s reports on what was going on in those particular nursing homes and I am sure everybody here agreed with HIQA on the closure of the nursing homes involved.</P>
        <P>Senator Comiskey sought a debate on planning in rural Ireland and the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, has agreed to come in here in September to discuss the question of reform of local government.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly and Senator Reilly sought a debate on Bord G&aacute;is price increases which will be dealt with by the energy regulator.  It is a cause of concern that prices are rising.  I referred previously to the question which Senator Daly raised on organ donation.</P>
        <P>Senator Keane called for a debate on the training for junior doctors and offering incentives for junior doctors to stay at home, which is an interesting proposal.  She is quite correct.  There has been the Fitzgerald report, the Hanly report and several other reports on the health service over the years which gathered dust.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullins requested the CEO of the HSE to be invited to attend the House.  We will be having a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges later and we must examine the question of invitations and who we should invite into the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney raised the Italian and Spanish debt crisis and invited the Minister for Finance into the House to debate the debt burden.  The Minister for Finance is anxious to come into the House but it is a matter of finding the necessary time.  If we can have the Minister for Finance in here before the summer recess at the end of July, we will get him to discuss the question of debt burden and the budgetary process.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Polish ambassador, Mr. Marcin Nawrot, the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, Mr. Pat the Cope Gallagher, MEP, Mr. Gay Mitchell, MEP, and the former President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox.  On my behalf and that of my fellow Senators, I welcome to the House His Excellency, Mr. Jerzy Buzek, President of the European Parliament.  No Member of this House needs reminding that we are at a crucial time in the history of the European Union.  Ireland and the EU face many issues and challenges.  President Buzek, you are an example of how we can all meet and surmount the challenges we encounter and a measure of how Europe can change for the better.</P>
        <P>In 1980, President Buzek joined the Solidarity movement in Poland, was appointed chair of the works committee and became an increasingly important member of that movement.  Following Solidarity&rsquo;s triumph in 1989, he became a full-time academic.  He once stated his ambition was to become a member of parliament in a free Poland but he achieved more than that.  He became Poland&rsquo;s Prime Minister in 1997, undertook ambitious reforms and helped to negotiate Poland&rsquo;s accession to the EU.  In 2004, he was elected to the European Parliament with the largest majority in Poland and was elected President of the European Parliament in 2009, having won the largest majority of any President since the first direct elections in 1979.  He is the first President of the European Parliament to come from central and eastern Europe on foot of the European Union&rsquo;s enlargement in 2004.  Throughout his career, he has shown great passion for and dedication to the democratic ideals we should never take for granted.  His <Col N="475"/>journey, both personally and politically, should serve as an inspiration to all who believe that parliamentary democracy can achieve real change for the benefit of ordinary people and is a symbol of unity in a shared Europe.  President Buzek&rsquo;s presence here underlines the close relationships between our Parliament and the European Parliament within the framework of European Union interparliamentary co-operation.  His visit is also particularly timely, given the enhanced role of national parliaments under the Lisbon treaty.  It now gives me great pleasure to invite him to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>

	<P>A Chathaoirligh agus a Sheanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir dom bheith anseo inniu romhaibh.  Dear friends, I am delighted to be in your country.  This is a great visit for me.  I know that I represent 735 of my colleagues in the European Parliament.  We may differ from time to time on the very important issues for the European Union.  However, from the point of view of representation and visiting all member states, from the point of view of presentation of the idea of unity of the European continent, and from the point of view of common values, tradition, heritage, we may differ from country to country, but all of my colleagues in the European Parliament are of the same mind that we need co-operation and openness if we want to be a continent which will be different from the Europe of the first half of the 20th century.  We all worked very hard in the second part of the 20th century to change our attitude to the most important issues for our continent and we must continue to do so.  In this point of view the Members of the European Parliament are united.  I can, therefore, represent all of its members.  This is the direction we should follow.  The most important issue is the detail of how to agree the most important political guidelines and how we should organise ourselves.</P>
        <P>EU member states are different countries and situated in different parts of the Continent, but we share a similar history of occupation, immigration, poverty and striving for freedom.  We also have a history of transformation, economic success and shared European aspirations.  For the countries which joined the European Union in 2004 during the Irish Presidency, Ireland&rsquo;s success has been an inspiration for achieving deep reforms, broad modernisation and internal solidarity, as in the solidarity pact.  Ireland has used the benefits of the European Union wisely and maximised the impact of Structural Funds to accelerate development and modernisation.</P>
        <P>My first visit outside Brussels two years ago as President of the European Parliament was to Ireland.  This was just before the referendum.  I propose to make a few remarks on the changes I have noted in the past two years, not necessarily in Ireland but generally in the European Union and our institutions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My first comment is that we are discovering in practice how the new treaty is a treaty of parliaments, both national parliaments and the European Parliament.  The checks introduced with the yellow and orange card procedures are working, with a total of 337 contributions from national parliaments to the 113 legislative Acts tabled thus far.  It is a large number.  Each such contribution and remark is carefully examined by the European Parliament and the European Commission.  This means that our exchange of information is working rather well, but there can always be improvements in many aspects.  I assure the House that the European Parliament is open to more systematic engagement with both ante and post-legislative dialogue.  This is very important if European law is to be implemented.  We are of the strong view that a network of corresponding committees needs to be created across the European Union.  EU affairs are not restricted to foreign affairs.  They are very much domestic issues because they deal with jobs, the economy, farming, fisheries, the environment and so on.</P>
        <P>I have another comment related to our relations with citizens.  I have great expectations for the citizens&rsquo; initiative which will come into force in 2013, the year of the Irish Presidency.  I wish to comment on how Council Presidencies in general have changed since the Lisbon treaty. <Col N="476"/> From the point of view of the European Parliament, the Presidency is a strong legislative partner because of the new powers given to us by the treaty.  There are two equal Chambers for legislation, the Council and the European Parliament.  There are now fixed meetings with the Presidency and the European Parliament at all levels. I have meetings with the Prime Minister and there are meetings between Ministers and our committees.  This is a positive initiative, as it helps towards better co-ordination of legislation and to sell our common initiatives to citizens, which is very important.</P>
        <P>That leads me to my fourth point.  One of these common initiatives is the next multi-annual financial framework.  The European Union needs a strong, stable and realistic European budget in the next seven year period after 2013.  The European Parliament broadly supports the current proposals of the European Commission, as we believe they go in the right direction.  It is important to keep traditional policies such as the CAP original policy or the Structural Funds, but we also need to invest much more than before in new policies such as innovation, research and new technologies.  I strongly believe these new policies are the key to our future success.  The proposal for a 70% increase for education in the multi-annual financial framework is the right kind of investment, in particular when one sees how much could be changed in Ireland.  More money could be invested in our research and development clusters.  The fragmentation and duplication of efforts in the field of research and development and the substantial costs that need to be reduced are important.  We will all gain from a common approach in this field.</P>
        <P>I may not be touching on the hottest questions all over Europe which are important for all of us.  There is a problem with migration today and neighbourhood policy.  We should tackle these problems in the future.  The current economic crisis is the most important question for our citizens.  My first points mainly concerned co-operation and how we can co-operate as a Parliament to be more efficient for citizens.</P>
        <P>To get out of the current economic crisis we need to stimulate growth and investment.  It is a simple statement but sometimes it is necessary to repeat it.  To do this we will need to close the gaps in the Internal Market, which is not so simple.  There are about 150 bottlenecks in our Internal Market and 12 pieces of legislation proposed by the Commission and the European Parliament.  We should implement all of the legislation.  The most important pieces of legislation will be lying on the table during the Irish Presidency 18 months from now at the beginning of 2013.  We should also implement all of it.</P>
        <P>We should also think about the 2020 strategy and how to fulfil all the policies to be more competitive.  It is connected with my general financial framework.  Ireland is well placed to recover, with a business friendly environment and young skilled workforce.  I know from my personal experience of being responsible for the Government in my country how hard economic reforms can be, but for reform to be successful there has to be help from Ireland&rsquo;s closest neighbours.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to express the main message which is connected with my visit.  It is a message of solidarity and also support from the European Union.  Let me ask a very delicate question.  I am sure it is possible to put such questions between friends.  Did the previous Irish Government negotiate a deal with the EU and the IMF with Ireland&rsquo;s best interests at heart?  I am quite sure it did.</P>
        <P>I have a second question.  Is the current Government right in seeking to try to improve the terms and conditions of that deal?  Of course it is.  To answer yes to the first question does not mean it is impossible to answer the second question with a yes.  Both questions are valid.  I can see it and I can feel it, having been in the European Parliament in the negotiations.  If Ireland is to make a full recovery it needs all the help it can get and all instruments at its disposal.</P><Col N="477"/>
        <P>Let me make one thing clear.  The EU or its institutions should not put pressure on Ireland to change its corporation tax rate.</P>

	<P>It has achieved the guarantee according to the additional protocol in the Lisbon treaty that it is a matter of national competency.  We should all remember such a solution.  There is tremendous good will towards Ireland in the EU institutions and appreciation for the responsible steps it is taking to address its situation.  I understand the situation from both sides.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is big tension in Irish society.  I represented trade unions in my country for more than ten years and was involved in national authorities of the trade unions.  Later on I also represented the Government and I know very well what it means to be on both sides.  I understand both sides.  We had to go through very difficult reforms in my time in government.  We had to close 22 coal mines in my constituency, making 100,000 people unemployed in one year.  Thanks to that we survived with the rest of the coal mines, more than 30 of them, which are still working very efficiently.  It is quite clear that without all those reforms, the coal mining industry in my country would have disappeared.</P>
        <P>It is a very risky profession being a politician, as Senators know very well.  Without risk, however, we cannot achieve anything more than going from one election to another and trying to survive.  That is not the main goal for politicians.  I can understand and feel what Irish politicians are doing with their reforms and how important they are for its citizens.  They sometimes feel differently but the responsibility politicians have is great.  I congratulate them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The position of the Opposition is very helpful for the Government, as far as I know.  Of course, there is never full support from the Opposition for the coalition; it is quite obvious.  Otherwise, it would not be a democracy.  We know very well that in the most important issues for our future there could be from time to time a very broad and wide coalition.  Such coalitions are sometimes necessary, maybe once every ten years or two decades.</P>
        <P>The last time there was such a coalition in Ireland there was an excellent pact of solidarity.  I visited Ireland just after the Good Friday Agreement on the invitation of the Taoiseach.  I visited the country because I wanted to know something about its solidarity pact.  Trade unions engaged in freezing salaries for some time.  It is fantastic because thanks to that, Ireland had at least one decade of prosperity.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a very important country for the European Union.  The last two Secretaries General of the European Commission, Mr. David O&rsquo;Sullivan and Ms Catherine Day, were from Ireland.  One of my predecessors is sitting here, Mr. Pat Cox, whom I thank for coming here.  I am very glad.  I am always proud to see him because he was an excellent President of the European Parliament.</P>
      
        <P>We also know about the important portfolio of Ireland&rsquo;s Commissioner, Mrs. M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  We need to look ahead to create better high technology jobs so that the EU can play a leading role in the competitive global economy.  Ireland is well placed to benefit from this new wave, and Ireland&rsquo;s Commissioner is excellently prepared to do such a job.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let me conclude, although I have probably not kept to the allotted time.  In the European Parliament, where I am responsible for debates, my colleagues are usually angry because I stop them after two minutes.  I must think about that deeply, colleagues, in order that maybe I can adopt a softer approach in future.</P><Col N="478"/>
        <P>The European Union will show solidarity and will help Ireland.  The faster we can secure our future financial instruments, the faster we can make the investments that will stimulate the long-term recovery and prosperity of Ireland and Europe generally.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>President Buzek rightly mentioned the issue of co-operation with the European Union.  The European Parliament has a very important role to play in that respect.  I am asking this question on behalf of this country&rsquo;s mortgage holders, 50,000 of whom are in arrears.  There have been two recent increases in the ECB rate and two more are signalled to come down the road.  What role does President Buzek think the European Parliament can play to ensure that in countries like Ireland, which are doing their level best to get through the difficulties with the assistance of their European partners, our citizens will not be hit by excessive interest rate increases?  Our base rate in the ECB is 1.5%, while the equivalent in the Bank of England is 0.5%.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome President Buzek and thank him for the clear expression of solidarity with us.  I have a two-part question.  First of all, we welcome the reports that more flexibility is forthcoming from the EU and the IMF concerning the terms of the bailout for Ireland, but what interest rate cut is likely in President Buzek&rsquo;s view?  Second, the context for more flexibility seems to be a concern about the growing financial crisis in Italy.  What is plan B for saving the euro and the eurozone if the current propping up arrangements and bailouts for countries such as Greece, Portugal and ourselves do not work?  Is there a plan B?</P>

	<P>I welcome President Buzek to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is an honour for me to speak to somebody who is such a great defender of human rights and European values.  I have heard him say that: &ldquo;There is no &lsquo;us&rsquo; and &lsquo;you&rsquo;. We can say loud and clear that. . . Europe belongs to us all&rdquo;.  In this time of recession, however, that feeling of &ldquo;us&rdquo; is fast diminishing.  I am a committed European and believe we need more of Europe to get us out of this crisis.  We need to get the Europe 2020 strategy back on track.  However, President Buzek raised the multi-annual financial framework which includes a welcome proposal to set up an interparliamentary conference with national parliaments.  That is of interest both to the European Parliament and to us in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  President Buzek also said that Europe needs a strong and stable budget, but do we need to increase the European budget by 5% at this time?  What message does that send to people?  The multi-annual financial framework includes proposals to increase its own resources through revenue raising measures such as a financial transaction tax and a new VAT resource.  In the current climate, is this really the best way to connect citizens and help engender that feeling of &ldquo;us&rdquo;?</P>
        <P>I thank President Buzek for his solidarity.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Uachtar&aacute;n Buzek go h&Eacute;irinn.  President Buzek mentioned that the Lisbon treaty was a treaty of parliaments.  In particular, he referred to the enhanced role of national parliaments in scrutinising legislation, which is a step in the direction <Col N="479"/>of subsidiarity.  He also heard the welcome in this House for his support for Ireland&rsquo;s right to determine its own tax rates, specifically our corporation tax rate.  These two issues are united around the question of subsidiarity and the guarantees given in advance of the second Lisbon treaty referendum.  As President Buzek said, his last visit to Ireland was prior to that referendum.  He will recall that the people had particular concerns around military neutrality, tax rates and fundamental human rights &mdash; specifically the role of the Constitution as the absolute guarantor of the protection of the right to life, the rights of the family and the right to an education.  He will also recall that there was a political agreement at the European Council in June 2009 on these guarantees, to which legal effect was to be given at the time of the Croatian accession treaty.  As that time is upon us, as the European Parliament will have a particular role in that regard, will it fully respect the political agreement made in June 2009?  Will it endorse fully and integrally Irish constitutional supremacy, specifically in protecting the right to life, the rights of the family and the right to an education?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Mr. Jerzy Buzek</NameTxt>
	<P>There were so many questions that I will answer each of them with one or two sentences because it would not be possible to do more.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">On the fiscal challenges facing us, we have a few steps to take, the first of which is recovery.  There is some financial instability, but it is not a crisis in the eurozone.  If we compare the GDP growth rate for the whole European zone with the sum of national debt in the eurozone, it is much better than in the United States.  The problems in the US economy and those in the eurozone are somewhat different.  The problem for us is instability in some member states.  We are aware that such instability could influence the real economy.  A few months after the Lehman Brothers&rsquo; bankruptcy, there was a recession in the real US economy.  We are aware the same could be the case with a Greek bankruptcy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From the point of view of the real EU economy, the position is not too bad.  Plus 1.5% or 2% of GDP is not too bad and is generally not seen as a recession.  We know that recovery is necessary and that we should avoid stagnation.  We need an exit strategy, which is not necessarily the same as a recovery.  It means GDP growth rates of 3%, 4% or 5% are needed to create jobs, because a rate of 1.5% is not leading to the creation of jobs.  As mentioned, we need the 2020 strategy and other important initiatives to create jobs.  We must take all of these steps.  Structural reforms such as a change to the retirement age are most important because ours is an ageing society in the European Union.  Reform of the labour market by achieving agreement with the trade unions is also important.  Many things should be done and we are doing them in the European Parliament and European Commission all the time &mdash; we are very active on this issue.</P>
        <P>There was a question about the interest rate.  The interest rate for Ireland&rsquo;s loans from the IMF and EU at 5.8% is slightly too high if we wish to have growth in coming years.  It is not only austerity measures and structural reform that are important; we also need growth and we should do everything to achieve growth.  Competitiveness is not a bad starting point for Ireland, because generally speaking it has a very modest economy based on high technology.  Ireland&rsquo;s young and skilled workforce is very promising for its economy.  However, the interest needs to be approximately 1 percentage point lower.  It is not a decision of the European Parliament; it depends on the member states, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, European Commission and eurozone leader, Mr. Juncker.  Many international organisations and member states should discuss the problem.  I would like to say there is great support and we can achieve it.  It has the support of the majority of my colleagues in the European Parliament &mdash; it is quite obvious.  We will see how much we can achieve, but 5.8% is probably slightly too much.</P><Col N="480"/>
        <P Just="Left">We talk about flexibility.  We know it is very important for the International Monetary Fund and for the European Union to get money back.  We know that if the international institutions want their money back it may be better to reduce the interest rate, because it would be easier for the country to pay all the money back.  We must think about that in such a way.  I underline again that the European Parliament is not responsible for that.  We can create the atmosphere to help Ireland and we are trying to do so.  With the euro bonds problem, we are just supportive.  Generally I can speak for 60%, 80% or maybe sometimes 85% of my colleagues from the European Parliament, which means the majority, but it does not mean that all of my colleagues think in the same way.  It is important to note that the European Parliament is a fully democratic assembly in which we argue and have different points of view.</P>
        <P>A Senator asked about plan B &mdash; I do not believe we should even think about plan B.  It is most important for the European citizens &mdash; not only the member states from the eurozone and outside &mdash; to support countries such as Greece and Ireland because we are supporting ourselves.  Any bankruptcy of Greece, for example, would influence the situation of some big banks in the European Union, but it does not mean that we help banks helping Greece because after any collapse or bankruptcy of banks it will be recession in the real economy.  Only one financial institution, Lehman Brothers, went bankrupt in 2008.  There is deep recession in many countries throughout the world so it could be the same result now.  We should prevent such a situation and we try to do that.  In helping Greece, Ireland or Portugal, we are helping ourselves and our citizens.</P>
        <P>Two weeks ago I went to Germany for a lecture in Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, just to express this point of view.  Germans are asking why they should support, which is a reasonable question.  We must understand all the sides of the discussion.  The reasonable true answer is that we would like to help ourselves, as otherwise it would be deep recession.  We need responsibility on the other side and I can see responsibility and great honour for all people in Ireland.  The Irish people ask for the solidarity in a responsible way.  It is very important: we need solidarity and responsibility.  We would like to work on such a way in the future.</P>
        <P>There was a question about human rights and values, which is a most important point.  In this case 100% of Members of the European Parliament agree.  I am quite sure we have full agreement about the human rights issue.  On some resolutions somebody will vote against, not because we do not agree on the fundamental values, but we have some small paragraphs which somebody might oppose.  However, we agree absolutely; it is absolutely important to have values and be united.</P>
        <P>European scepticism in Ireland and some other member states is typical in a time of crisis.  Last Friday I was in Austria and faced the same question.  Austria is in the eurozone and is doing rather well, and should also help.  Austrians question why they should help.  It is very important that at a time of crisis people express scepticism.  They would prefer protectionism to showing solidarity with others.  It is a natural answer from the point of view of our citizens.  We know the experience in our continent.  This is the deepest crisis since the 1930s.  Our response to the crisis 80 years ago was to close our borders, be protectionist and divide ourselves.  The result was not very interesting for all of us.  Based on that experience of ours, we should be open, show solidarity and responsibility on all sides, and do it together.  We need to be more united.  We need more Europe and not less Europe.  We had less Europe in the 1930s for each country in our continent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Do we need an EU budget?  Introducing new ideas like a 2020 strategy is just for creating jobs and nothing else.  What do we need if we want to create jobs?  We must be competitive, which will allow us to win in the global market.  How can we achieve competitiveness?  We <Col N="481"/>need to be more innovative, have new technologies, and finance research and development.  We can be more competitive by doing things through the Single Market.  We should have a single market in energy, with cross-border connections.  With a single market for energy we can be much more efficient and secure from the point of view of energy.  Everything is grounded on the energy prices because we must use energy for everything we are doing.  Let us create a single market for energy with cross-border connections with research on the climate issue and everything else.  By financing initiatives such as roads, railways and airports from the EU level we achieve much better results &mdash; it is European added value.  If we want to create cross-border connections Ireland should use its wind energy.  Ireland needs the best possible connections with Britain or France to exchange energy.  We know that wind energy does not last 24 hours at a time, that the wind blows for 12 hours or eight hours and then more energy is needed and it must be bought.  Ireland, therefore, needs connections in each member state.  We must create that and organise the European External Action Service for our Common Foreign and Security Policy, which is also necessary.  As we need money, 5% growth is not too much.  I am sure that is absolutely necessary.</P>
        <P>The last question relates to the right to life and family issues.  The European Parliament respects these.  While we can have resolutions on different topics, European Union law has certain meanings.  In the treaties everything is clearly written &mdash; the responsibilities of individual member states and national governments, and what is decided at EU level.  From this point of view, the division is clear.  All the guarantees in our treaties will be kept, and I am sure the European Parliament will stick to this position.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators and apologise that I spoke for longer than expected.  It was interesting for me to be here for this discussion and for me to hear questions from Senators because sometimes the questions are much more important than the answers.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I may be out of order and, if I am, I ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach to indulge a freshman Senator ill-informed with the standard operating procedures.  I take this opportunity to raise with the Minister of State a matter with respect to the Bill which through my own inattention I should have raised at an earlier stage in the proceedings.  I call on the Government, while it is still possible, to consider including a further amendment to the Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill.  The amendment could specifically ban cigarette smoking in vehicles where a child is present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At this stage, we have all bought into the logic of the original Bill.  It was considered revolutionary at the time and it was forward-thinking on the part of the then Minister, Deputy Martin.  The logic was to ban smoking in enclosed workplaces.  This included smoking in a car if it was a company car, even if it was in one&rsquo;s own car.  This made a great deal of sense.  As a result of what I do for a living I have met many people who drive for a living.  They have <Col N="482"/>remarked how strange it is that they could be prohibited from smoking in their own company car but it makes a great deal of sense.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is the commonplace experience of every citizen who drives through the city and who gets stuck in a line of traffic to see children strapped into car seats in an enclosed car with one or more adults smoking in that car.  If this is not already illegal the Bill should be amended to make it so.  There is a neat provision which could be amended.  There is a section in which the Minister has the right to prevent smoking in several places including places of work, health facilities and Government offices.  I propose a simple amendment: to add a subsection to forbid smoking where children are present in a vehicle.  In addition, although it would be harder to enforce, it may be possible to consider making it illegal to smoke in any room where a child is present, including a room in one&rsquo;s own house.  They could be a test case to establish it.  The ultimate logic is not to expose minors who cannot make their own decisions with regard to smoke and that they should not be exposed to smoke being produced by other smokers until they have legal adulthood.</P>

	<P>I understand and acknowledge that but I wish to take the opportunity to get the message to the Minister.  The Minister of State and the D&aacute;il still have the opportunity to make amendments and I call on the Minister of State to bring this to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.</P>
        <P>This could be an important amendment and I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for indulging me in raising the matter somewhat out of order.  Section 47 of the original Bill deals with the prohibition or restriction on smoking of tobacco products.  The Minister may by regulation prohibit or restrict the smoking of tobacco products in certain cases.  I believe the Minister could include a section 47(1)(<i>h</i>) following section 47(1)(<i>g</i>) which could specifically forbid smoking in vehicles.  Then, if the Minister so wished, he could consider a section 47(1)(<i>i)</i> to prohibit smoking in any enclosed room in which children are present.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Bill was introduced initially last year by the previous Administration.  Compliments were paid on Second Stage to the Minister and the Government for reintroducing the Bill.  Many of the statistics the Minister and other contributors made are relevant.  In the context of section one and these proposals it is important to refer to the latest World Health Organization report on the global tobacco epidemic.  The report was issued in the past two days and gives the stark figure that more than 1 billion people in 19 countries are now covered by laws requiring large graphic health warnings on packages of tobacco, almost double the number of two years ago.  I cannot help but reflect on this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I realise I am crowing from our side but I believe I should add my voice in acknowledgement and recognition of the initiative taken by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin when he was Minister for Health and Children to introduce the legislation.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach will correct me if I am wrong but I believe Ireland was the first country to introduce smoke-free places.  The initiative has been in place for many years and I note that since it was introduced more than 739 million people in 31 countries have been covered by comprehensive laws requiring smoke-free indoor spaces.  More than 353 million people are covered in 15 countries.  Thailand is among the latest countries to ban smoking in indoor public places and in the workplace.  I am keen to highlight these facts.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was much maligned for many things during his tenure in the Department of Health and Children, but that will stand as a shining legacy of his time there.</P><Col N="483"/>
        <P>The World Health Organization tobacco free initiative director, Dr. Douglas Bettcher, stated that large graphic health warnings of the sort pioneered by Uruguay, Canada and a handful of other countries are an effective means of reducing tobacco&rsquo;s appeal and Ireland will now be a part of it.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on this.  He goes on to say that Australia&rsquo;s proposed legislation to require that tobacco be sold in plain packaging will do even more to ensure that fewer people fall into the trap of sickness and premature death, and that the World Health Organization, WHO, stands ready to help countries to resist the tobacco industry&rsquo;s unprincipled attempts to eliminate these important protections.  I share the view of the WHO that one is dealing with very devious, manipulative people in the tobacco industry.  Several films have been made about this.  One of them, whose title escapes me, received a worldwide release and depicts the cynicism of the tobacco industry, particularly from an American perspective.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Requiring large graphic health warnings is among the six demand reduction measures recommended by the WHO.  Interestingly, in the context of Senator Crown&rsquo;s contribution, the other measures are: monitoring tobacco use; protecting people from tobacco smoke; helping users quit; enforcing bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship; raising taxes on tobacco.  Of the six, the Minister of State will probably agree that this country has perhaps reached a tipping point in terms of the amount of tax it is possible to get from tobacco consumption, primarily because of the continuing threat to the Exchequer of the illegal importation of cigarettes.  Perhaps the Minister of  State has a view on that.  I am sorry to throw so many questions at her and for my somewhat scattergun approach, but I am sure she will pick up on this point as it is important that we are given an insight into the Government&rsquo;s thinking on the widespread practice of illegal tobacco smuggling.  Undoubtedly, it threatens the amount of money the Exchequer can collect from the consumption of tobacco and it has been an ongoing problem in recent years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of the six recommended measures, I share Senator Crown&rsquo;s concern that we protect people from tobacco smoke.  It is a difficult issue but perhaps the Minister of State will focus on that recommendation and on what initiatives she might undertake in that regard.  She has already told us she will be a reforming Minister so I urge her to be as reforming as possible.  I am totally opposed to smoking in harmony with the old clich&eacute; that there is nobody more intolerant of smoking than a reformed smoker.  I used to smoke.  I started puffing fags at about ten years of age behind the school shed.  I gave them up in my late twenties and, thank God, have not smoked since.  However, one of our five offspring attended a boarding college for one year.  He did not like it and left after his first year, but he said the only thing he learned there was how to smoke.  He is 21 and is the only one of our family who smokes, despite our best efforts.  I see the danger of passive smoking in our house.  We try to get him to go outside the door but he goes into his den with his friends and the place is often clouded with smoke.</P>
        <P>Both my personal experience and the statistics show the adverse impact of passive smoking on health.  The WHO report states that the tobacco epidemic will kill nearly 6 million people this year.  More than 5 million of them will be users and ex-users of smoked and smokeless tobacco and more than 600,000 will be non-smokers who were exposed to tobacco smoke.  By 2030, the WHO projects that tobacco consumption or passive smoking could kill 8 million people per year, which is double the population of this country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for returning so quickly to the House to deal with this Bill.  The issue I wish to raise is the photographs we have seen.  One of them <Col N="484"/>included the number of the quit line.  Research has shown that where countries include the quit line number on every packet of cigarettes, the number of calls to the quit line number increased dramatically in the first 12 months afterwards.  Obviously, if people are making the effort to ring the quit line, they are making the effort to give up smoking.  Can we put the quit line number on every photograph?  One photograph on the packaging is specifically designed for that but there is a total of 14 photographs.  Does the Bill give the Minister the power to insert the number of the quit line?  I believe so, but perhaps the Minister of State would clarify that.  If the number of the quit line is included on the packet, people have immediate access to information.  It is interesting to see from the research that a large number of young people want to give up smoking, but they probably need an extra push to help them to do so.  If they have immediate access to the quit line, they are more likely to do it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Leas-Chathaoirleach will indulge me.  I will try to speak to the section but I wish to make a number of broad points because I missed the debate on Second Stage.  The points are broadly in line with the section.</P>
        <P>I have never smoked and have always found smoking offensive and anti-social.  However, I know many young people who smoke.  The figures show, unfortunately, that more young people are smoking.  It is a tragedy.  We have also seen the impact of smoking on older people.  Some of my relatives have acquired illnesses as a result of smoking for many years.  It is awful to see something self-inflicted cause so much misery for those individuals.  It also puts enormous strain on our health services.  I do not believe we can put a price on how much goes into ensuring that people get proper treatment after the effects of smoking.  It is a huge issue that must be tackled.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It says a great deal that amendments have not been tabled on this legislation.  There is cross-party support in this Chamber and, I hope, in the D&aacute;il for what the Minister of State is trying to do.  The Bill gives us an opportunity to address some of the issues surrounding smoking.  Earlier, a Member raised the issue of revenue and whether there is scope for further increases in the price of tobacco and cigarettes here.  Both Action on Smoking and Health, ASH, and the World Health Organization have recommended fiscal measures relating to the price as one of the most effective ways to combat smoking.  Some raise the red herring of illegal tobacco smuggling.  That is a major issue that must be tackled.  Criminal bosses here are making huge amounts of money from smuggling cigarettes that are more harmful than the cigarettes one buys over the counter.  However, it is not a reason for not doing the right thing in terms of considering the most appropriate response to steer somebody away from cigarettes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have worked for many years on the problem of drugs and am an active member of a community based drugs initiative in Waterford.  One of the things I quickly learned about other drugs, be it alcohol, cocaine or anything else, is that if one tells somebody that the drug is bad for them, whether it is through graphics or advertisements, it will not, in itself, steer the person away from cigarettes or drugs.  Anybody who works in this area will agree with that.  If the message or strategy is to try through shock tactics to get somebody to stop doing something that is harmful to him or her, it will not work.  The World Health Organization has repeatedly pointed out that increasing the price of cigarettes is one of the most effective ways to deal with this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Minister of State for bringing her proposals forward.  Whatever steps are taken to reduce tobacco consumption here are welcome.  I hope the proposals will have an impact.  Education is hugely important but in the forthcoming budget there will be an opportunity for the Minister for Finance to reflect on what potential there might be to increase prices.  Senator Walsh said we might have exhausted that opportunity but I am not sure that <Col N="485"/>we have.  We should listen to the experts in this area and I ask the Minister of State to convey that to the Minister for Finance.   If that measure is one of the most effective ways of dealing with this issue, we should take that corrective action and play our part in making sure that fewer people here smoke and fewer people are damaged and suffer ill health as a consequence of smoking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House again today.  I spoke at length during the debate last Thursday on the reasons I propose to support this Bill, which Members have agreed has cross-party support.  I do not intend to repeat myself, rather I would like to refer, as did Senator Mooney, to the report from the World Health Organization, which coincidentally was published last Thursday on the same day we spoke on it here.  That report highly recommends the use of graphic descriptions.  As Members said and as I  said last week, a picture speaks a thousand words.  We all know how effective the photographs have been in the road safety ads on television.</P>
        <P>This report is the third in a series of WHO reports on the status of global tobacco control policy implementation.  It examines in detail the two primary strategies to provide health warnings &mdash; the labels on the tobacco product packaging and the anti-tobacco mass media campaigns.  It is an excellent report which provides a comprehensive overview of the evidence base for warning people about the harms of tobacco use as well as country specific information on the status of these measures.</P>
        <P>The report indicates that more than 1 billion people in 19 countries are now covered by the laws requiring large graphic health warnings on packages, nearly double the number of two years ago when only about 547 million people were covered in 16 countries.  The latest countries to add these warnings on packages are Mexico, Peru and the United States.  These large graphic warnings have proven to motivate people to stop either using tobacco or to reduce the appeal for people to initiate smoking.</P>
        <P>This year the tobacco epidemic will kill almost 6 million people, more than 5 million will be users and ex-users of smoking and smokeless tobacco and more than 600,000 will be non-smokers who were exposed to tobacco smoke.  This brings me back to the point Senator Crown made about the number of people affected by passive smoking.</P>
        <P>By 2030, tobacco could kill up to 8 million people a year.  Tobacco use is one of the biggest contributors to the non-communicable diseases epidemic, which includes heart disease, stroke, cancers and emphysema and accounts for 63% of all deaths.  Of the world&rsquo;s more than 1 billion tobacco smokers, more than 80% live in low and middle income countries and up to half will eventually die of a tobacco-related disease.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The WHO report recommends six measures, to which Senator Mooney referred, the first being the large graphic health warnings, which is exactly what we are proposing here and on what I am commenting.  Other measures include: the importance of monitoring tobacco use; protecting people from tobacco smoke; helping the users to quit; reinforcing bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship; and raising the taxes, which was another issue that was mentioned during the debate last Thursday.</P>
        <P>More than half the world&rsquo;s population, or 3.8 billion people, are now covered by at least one of the above mentioned demand reduction measures.  There have been gains in each area because of the effective action taken by countries in 2009 and 2010.  The WHO report confirms that large graphic health warnings of the sort introduced by Uruguay, Canada and a handful of other countries are an effective means of reducing the appeal of tobacco.</P>
        <P>Australia, as was mentioned, has proposed legislation to require that tobacco be sold in plain packaging in order to appear less tempting and which will also ensure that fewer people will <Col N="486"/>fall into the trap of smoking.  I read today that Iceland proposes to introduce legislation in the near future which will require a person to have a doctor&rsquo;s prescription to purchase cigarettes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am conflicted in regard to this legislation in that I am disappointed with it.  I welcome the provisions of it but smoking is such a carcinogenic activity for anybody to engage in and many Senators have illustrated the number of people who are grievously affected by it.  It is a huge imposition not only on people&rsquo;s health but also on their financial position and on the Exchequer at large because of the consequential health issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Only four weeks ago I attended the funeral of a good friend of mine, Paddy Quinn, who died from emphysema.  He made a great contribution to New Ross through many different economic and tourism initiatives.  The John F. Kennedy Trust established the <i>Dunbrody</i> Famine ship at New Ross, which is a huge tourist attraction and has just been injected with  &euro;2.5 million from F&aacute;ilte Ireland to enhance it, and Paddy Quinn was a champion of that project.  My mother died from a smoking-related disease, from lung cancer which spread to her brain.</P>
        <P>Therefore, I believe this Bill comes directly from the school of lazy legislation.  I know it was introduced last year and there have been many changes worldwide in the situation since then.  This Bill reflects a minimalist approach to the issue.  All we are doing is enacting Commission decisions which have been taken and which we are obliged to include in our legislation.  That is a pity.  The scope exists for doing more.  I do not know from where Senator Cullinane got the notion that I thought there was no room for greater fiscal initiatives in this area.  I believe there is scope for that.  We are dealing with an industry, the tobacco industry, which is fundamentally corrupt.  It has had substantial evidence for many decades, which it suppressed, on the effects of smoking and the health risks people take when they smoke.</P>
        <P>If one travels abroad, particularly to undeveloped countries or emerging democracies where income levels are quite poor, one will observe that the industry targets disadvantaged people to get them addicted to smoking.  It includes not only arsenic but many dangerous chemicals in compiling the product, which are highly addictive.  It is done for one reason and one reason only, commercial purposes, with total disregard for any ethical or other human obligations which the companies should have if they were responsible corporations which they are not.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My criticism of the legislation is on foot of a further recent initiative in this respect taken by the Australian Government.  This was the first country to ban smoking in the workplace, which was done in the face of considerable opposition not only from the industry but elsewhere.  I remember heated parliamentary party meetings in our own party where people were totally against it.  I thought Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, who was Minister for Health and Children at the time, showed a great deal of courage and initiative in bringing in the ban.  I want to see the same courage and commitment reflected now in the political leadership of the Department of Health.  There is no reason we could not have gone the road that Australia has gone and prohibited the manufacturers from putting their names on the packets of cigarettes.  That would have been a step in the direction which would have led to a further decline, particularly in smoking and in the different brands of tobacco products, but we failed to do that.  I understand that the Philip Morris tobacco company is proceeding to take legal action in Australia as a consequence of the Australian initiative but we need to be strong, courageous and tough enough to withstand that.  People are dying in Ireland today and more will die tomorrow, Thursday and on Friday from diseases caused by smoking.  We have an obligation to tackle this issue in an effective way and to go as far as we possibly can to try to eradicate it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a parent I take a little pride in an achievement in this area.  Unlike Senator Mooney, as I did not smoke, I am not a reformed smoker.  My wife and I were so anti-smoking that we inculcated that into our children and none of them smoked.  If we never did anything else for <Col N="487"/>them, we did them a great service by getting them to that state.  We need to encourage that kind of thing, but we need more initiatives than purely transferring European Commission decisions into legislation.  I am seeking greater innovation in the future.  I realise the Minister of State is not in the position for very long, but I ask her to apply her mind to this.  It goes to the heart of our responsibility as legislators to the public and to their healthy well being.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not have a chance to make a speech on Second Stage, but I will have to avoid making a Second Stage today.  It has been very interesting to hear what others have said.  I compliment the Minister of State, and although Senator Walsh said she has not gone far enough, she has taken the first step and to do so in such a short time is worthy of consideration.  I am not in favour of a price increase because it encourages smuggling.  We probably have the highest prices in Europe at the moment and smuggling is a huge problem.  I am impressed at the steps the Minister of State is taking, and I believe it is possible to achieve far more in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was at a grocery meeting a couple of weeks ago on the Continent, and the man from Malta congratulated me.  He said that in Malta they have followed Ireland in a different way, and removed plastic bags from checkouts in supermarkets.  He said they also followed us with anti-smoking legislation.  We were the first country to do something about it, and the Maltese are very proud that they have also managed to reduce the level of smoking there.</P>
        <P>It was interesting to hear about how we will convince people.  Like Senator Walsh, my wife and I do not smoke, but we had smokers in other sides of the family, and deaths there as well.  We are impressed that our five children do not smoke, mainly because the eldest child saw something on television at age 13, and became so bitterly anti-smoking that he influenced the rest of the family.  This did not come from us as parents, but from a young man who was influenced by something he saw on television.</P>
        <P>I was not here when Senator Crown spoke, but I believe his suggestion that smoking should be banned in cars if there are children present did not manage to make it to the list of amendments on time.  I am not sure if anything can be done about that, but to make it an offence to smoke in a car when there are children present is something worthy of consideration.  I am not sure how we will do it, but if there is some way of making sure that this happens, it is worthwhile.</P>
        <P>Senator Crown came to two meetings we held in Leinster House 2000, and on one of those occasions, he said that sometimes he worries about his future as a cancer specialist, but that every time he sees Members smoking outside the barrier, he knows his future is secure.  They will still need him in the future.  It is a reminder to those who smoke and if we can manage to get that message across, the steps taken by the Minister of State will help.  There is an onus on us as legislators to do all we can to protect ourselves from the danger of cancer that comes from smoking, especially lung cancer.  I encourage the Minister of State, I wish her well and I believe the steps she has taken are in the right direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for contributing to the debate and for their support for the passage of this Bill.  We are all at one on this.  Everybody realises the huge difficulties caused by smoking, that smoking poses a very significant public health threat, that smoking is the main cause of preventative premature death, and that it puts a huge strain on the health service.  For that reason, we all have an obligation to ensure that we do everything we can to reduce the prevalence of smoking in our society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of these points came up on Second Stage.  In fairness, much work has been done in recent years.  The 2009 Bill was very welcome and very wide ranging.  I salute my predecessors <Col N="488"/>who were very active in this area.  We now have a ban on the display of smoking, a prohibition on vending machines in most locations, a ban on the sale of cigarettes to minors and the strict enforcement of that by environmental health officers.  As Senator Quinn pointed out, we have the highest price for cigarettes in Europe.  There is a commitment to look at this again in the upcoming budget.  The Minister for Health has already signalled his preparedness to examine the possibility of increasing the price further.  There are severe restrictions on advertising.  Health promotion is very well resourced.  More needs to be done in all these areas, but much work is under way in smoking cessation programmes and support and advice for people who are keen to give up.  Members have referred to the courageous Bill that banned smoking in the workplace, which has been very successful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When it comes to tackling the threat posed by smoking, Ireland is very much to the fore.  The ban on smoking in the workplace was ground breaking and we led the rest of Europe in this area.  As we are to the fore in tackling the problem, the tobacco industry has targeted Ireland and has taken several legal cases that are currently under way.  The industry sees us as posing a threat to its business.</P>
        <P>It is important to recognise the valuable work done to date, but we need to go further.  In spite of all the measures taken, the prevalence rate has remained high, at around 29% for several years.  We like to think that societal attitudes have changed, that our generation now sees the folly in smoking &mdash; many of us here, including me, are ex-smokers &mdash;  and hope that our children will not repeat our mistakes, but the reality is that young people are still smoking in very large numbers, especially young girls.  There is no room for complacency in this area.</P>
        <P>I know concerns were raised that we are not going far enough with this Bill.  This is a technical amendment to earlier legislation.  It is necessary to ensure that the Minister has sufficient statutory powers to introduce combined text and pictorial warnings on tobacco products by way of regulations.  Section 6 of the Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Act 2009 empowered the Minister to make these regulations to introduce such combined text and pictorial warnings on tobacco products.  However, while work was under way to finalise the arrangements for this, the Office of the Attorney General advised last January that there was a lacuna in section 6 of the 2009 Act.  As a consequence, there is a concern that section 6 does not adequately empower the Minister to make the necessary regulations.  The Office of the Attorney General further advised that an amendment to section 6 would be required to ensure that the Minister&rsquo;s <i>vires </i>to make regulations is unimpeachable.  As we have been to the fore in this we must be absolutely certain of our legal grounds.  If there is room for any doubt, a case will be taken.  That is why the Attorney General has told us there is a need to amend the 2009 Act, and she is not convinced sufficient powers exist.  That is why we are discussing this legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The enabling section, as it stands, is limited because it only refers to Article 5, which deals with the labelling requirements of the 2001/37/EC directive.  Specifically, it concerns the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products.  There is also the 2003 Commission decision on the use of colour photographs or other illustrations for each of the additional warnings listed in Annex 1 of the directive.</P>
        <P>The subsequent decision in 2005, which provided the library of picture warnings and a technical specification, and the amending decision in 2006 to allow manufacturers to modify warnings for awkward package sizes and shapes, were omitted from the 2009 Act.  In a determination to get this absolutely right in order that it cannot be challenged, the Attorney General has advised on this amending legislation.  It is very specific enabling legislation and following from the passage of this Bill into law, the Minister will be able to make the necessary regulations, which we want to do as quickly as possible.</P><Col N="489"/>
        <P Just="Left">This is not intended as any kind of panacea but it is specific amending legislation.  In that regard I will respond to Senator Crown&rsquo;s points about going further and banning smoking in cars.  There is no doubt that smoking in cars exposes occupants to very harmful environmental tobacco smoke, ETS.  This is a carcinogen and contains the same cancer-causing substances and toxic agents as are inhaled by a smoker; therefore, there is no safe level of exposure to ETS.  Exposure to cigarette smoke is particularly dangerous in enclosed spaces such as cars.  Parents and others with responsibility for the welfare of children have a particular responsibility to ensure such exposure does not take place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I concur very much with the points made by Senator Crown and others regarding the need to move on this front.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has signalled that he would be in favour of legislating to prohibit smoking in cars but would like to see a public information and education campaign to highlight the dangers associated with exposure to ETS in cars and to raise public awareness in advance of the introduction of this legislation.  That is the same kind of approach taken in respect of the legislation that Deputy Martin introduced as Minister relating to smoking in the workplace.  We should create that kind of public awareness and carry out the advertising campaigns before formulating the legislation.</P>
        <P>The Bill before the House for approval today is necessarily specific to the matter in hand of the introduction of combined photo and text warnings on tobacco products, and its passage into law will provide the Minister with the required <i>vires</i> to regulate and make combined warnings obligatory on all tobacco products as soon as possible.  The Bill is an enabling Bill and does not provide a suitable basis for the inclusion of the broader tobacco control measures which Members wish to see.  The Minister and I wish to see these also.  I assure the House that those matters will be addressed.</P>
        <P>A few other points were made during the debate.  We spoke about illicit trade on Second Stage, and the industry has suggested this represents approximately 24% of the cigarettes currently in Ireland.  I take the point made by Senator Quinn regarding price.  A delicate balance must be struck.  There is a significant problem and the authorities have suggested that approximately 20% of cigarettes smoked in the country are illegal.  It is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners to enforce the law in this regard and a wide number of actions are being taken by the Revenue Commissioners and Customs and Excise in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For example, between 2008 and 2010, the Customs service seized a total of 532 million cigarettes with an estimated retail value of &euro;222 million, representing just over 30,000 individual seizures.  Much work has been ongoing at the ports and airports but many cigarettes are still coming in illegally, so the work must be stepped up.  In addition, large quantities of cigarettes are imported legally as the current allowance is very generous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is too generous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and to some extent the free market rules at EU level and the requirements of the Single Market take precedence over health concerns in respect of a number of different products.  I will consider the area and possible restriction of the numbers which can be brought in.  There is much anecdotal evidence of people arriving from parts of Europe, and eastern Europe in particular, with bags of cigarettes for sale locally in estates.  We could take some action on that.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke raised the idea of the quit line number and the desirability of putting that number on the bottom of the warning.  That does not require primary legislation and it would arise in the context of regulations.  A balance must be struck as we are restricted with the amount of space that can be used for the warning.  We try to select the images that are the most graphic and would have the greatest impact.  As well as pictures, there is text and we are <Col N="490"/>also required to have the text displayed bilingually.  The amount of space for the graphic image is limited and it would be a judgment call whether to include the quit line number on the pack as well.  To some extent, more is less if we are trying to gain a big impact from the pictorial images.  I will bear the idea in mind when the regulations are being drawn up.  I am conscious of the point made on the success of such an exercise elsewhere.</P>
        <P>My immediate priority is to introduce the legislation before the House today, which will allow the Minister, Deputy Reilly, to make the regulations we want to see.  The introduction of plain packaging will be considered by the tobacco policy review group, which is expected to report shortly.  I stress that this is not the only initiative being taken at this point and is just specific amending legislation to allow us introduce pictorial images.  With regard to plain packaging, I am aware that Australia&rsquo;s proposal to introduce such legislation is being challenged by the tobacco industry.  The outcome of that legislation and the forthcoming revision of the EU tobacco products directive will inform policy in the area.  I am certainly very open to the idea that we move to plain packaging because it seems to be a factor in glamour and identification of different brands.  I thank Members for their contribution to the debate and their support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Members we have six minutes left to complete the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that but I have a brief question.  I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply and for reassuring the House that there will be more comprehensive anti-smoking legislation.  I hope that will be advanced very quickly.  I suggest the tobacco review committee would address the issue mentioned with regard to the constant use of smoking.  Following the introduction of the smoking ban, there was a reduction nationally to approximately 22% or 23% but tobacco companies appear quite content because usage has again increased to 29% or 30%, despite the best efforts of successive Administrations and independent organisations and their health promotions.</P>
        <P>There seems to be a focus on younger people, and part of the reason for this is their tendency to travel more.  I am pleased to hear the scandalous allowances between countries will be addressed.  We are debating legislation dealing with an EU directive that followed a great deal of debate at Commission level but the same institutions have fostered high allowances between countries.  I suggest there is a need to analyse why the figures have gone back up.  Why is the younger cohort more amenable to the blandishments of the tobacco industry?  I cannot figure out why that is happening in spite of all the restrictions that have been put in place.  I am sure the Minister of State cannot figure it out either.  We are not going to be able to do it here.  I suggest that it be done in the Department.</P>
        <P>It is rather unfortunate that my friend and colleague, Senator Moran, did not swap notes with me prior to our respective contributions.  When future historians look at this debate, they will find that Senator Moran followed everything I said.  Everything she said was a replication.  It is rather unfortunate in the circumstances but that is just the way things are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make four points.  I am heartened by some of what the Minister of State has said.  We need to fight this as vigorously and intensely as we can.  I welcome her intention to consider the possibility of introducing legislation to ban smoking in cars.  I have always felt that should be done.  Although I do not normally believe in intruding into people&rsquo;s personal lives when they are at home, I think we should consider banning smoking in the home when children are present.  Everybody recognises the dangers of secondary smoking.  The measure I have suggested would be controversial, but it should be examined.  Responsible parents go outside to smoke if there are children in the house.</P><Col N="491"/>
        <P>The second issue I would like to discuss is the price of cigarettes.  I do not accept the argument that is made with regard to illicit sales.  It is a matter for the Garda to enforce the law.  We need to be much more vigorous in that regard.  The problem of illicit sales should not deter us from increasing the price of cigarettes.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Minister of State said she intends to analyse the Australian model of removing the name of tobacco companies from cigarette packets.  She mentioned that the size of the packets might make it difficult to accommodate pictorial images.  Can she clarify whether the images will be on both sides of cigarette packets?  As this is a Seanad Bill, the Minister of State can amend it in the D&aacute;il on the basis of the debate in this House.  While we are awaiting the outcome of the case Philip Morris has taken against the Australian Government, perhaps we could provide that the name of the manufacturer should be as tiny as possible on the cigarette packet.  That would give us more scope.  At least we would be starting to introduce the concept of providing for very little recognition of the branding of the packet.  That is an important consideration.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by suggesting that the Minister of State should consider tabling an amendment to the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  I suggest that large posters, replicating the graphic images that will have to be included on cigarette packets, should have to be displayed on the outside of premises where cigarettes are sold.  In other words, retailers who sell cigarettes should be required by law to display graphic images, which convey the message of the consequences of smoking, on the exterior of their premises.  It might be a deterrent.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that proposal.  We need to do everything we can to reduce, if not eradicate, the habit of smoking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill is welcome.  We have a problem in this country.  The current smoking rate is approximately 29%.  Although we were not talking about smoking this morning, I mentioned an EU study that was published yesterday which reported that 16% of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 have used substances that are available on the market to give them illegal highs and that 32% of young people have accessed ecstasy without any difficulty.  Those figures remind us of the need for education about the misuse of drugs and the health issues associated with smoking.  We should set clear targets as we set out on this long road over the next five years.  It will not be easy to solve the problems in this difficult area.  This Bill is timely.  The Office of the Attorney General was right to advise the Department to ensure all angles are covered.  The Minister of State and her officials in the Department are to be thanked for responding so quickly to that advice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I can inform Senator Walsh that the images will be on one side and the existing health warning will be on the other side.  There will be a message on both sides of the packet.</P>

	<P>Senator Burke mentioned the report on illegal highs that was published yesterday.  We face huge challenges because we are leading Europe in this regard.  Some 16% of young people here have used these substances.  That is way ahead of the next country, which is on 9% or something like that.  Perhaps we were not quick enough in dealing with the head shops.  I would like to think the action that has been taken will stop the trend that had been developing.  There is a need for a Europe-wide response to this Europe-wide problem.  People are increasingly gaining access to illegal products on the Internet.  I would like to look at this area.  We have been reasonably successful in stopping people from using credit cards to access pornography on the Internet.  I would like us to investigate the potential for clamping <Col N="492"/>down on the purchase of illegal highs and prescription medication, which is another problem.  We are considering how we might tackle that on a Europe-wide basis.  The use of the Internet means it cannot be done in this country alone.  We face a number of challenges as we try to protect the health of young people.  We need to encourage them to play an active role in protecting their own good health.  There is a serious body of work to be done in the health promotion area.  I thank Members again for their contributions.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, for coming to the House so quickly.  I also thank her officials in the Department of Health and the officials in the Office of the Attorney General.  When advice of this nature is provided, it is extremely important that it be acted on in an expeditious manner.  That has certainly happened in this case.  I compliment everyone involved.  I wish the Minister of State well in her future dealings in this area.  As she has said, further legislation will be introduced.  My colleagues in Fine Gael and in the other groups look forward to working with her to consider further legislation in this area.  We want to set clear targets with the aim of reducing the proportion of people who smoke from the current level of 29%.  We hope that by the time our term ends, some work will have been done and some targets will have been achieved.  I thank the Minister of State again.</P>

	<P>I endorse everything Senator Burke has said.  I am particularly pleased that the legal minds of the former Attorney General and the current Attorney General were united on this issue.  The Minister of State will have gathered from the debate that she can be assured there will be a unity of minds in this House when any further legislation is introduced in this area.  I hope she will take on board the statistic that was mentioned with regard to the high incidence of young smokers in this country.  Perhaps this area can be analysed in the context of the introduction of any comprehensive legislation.  Senators on this side of the House are very pleased to have supported this Bill.  We wish the Minister of State well in all her areas of responsibility.  As she said, this is a particularly challenging area.</P>
