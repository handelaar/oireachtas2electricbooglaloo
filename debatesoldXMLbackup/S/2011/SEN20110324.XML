    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, to conclude not later than 1 p.m., with the contributions of Senators not to exceed five minutes and the Minister to be called upon to reply to the debate not later than 12.50 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wholeheartedly congratulate Senator Cummins on his appointment by the Taoiseach as the new Leader of the Seanad.  I worked well with him as Leader of the House, as did the previous Government Whip, Senator Wilson, and Deputy Whip, Senator Glynn.  I thank him for all he did for us and look forward to working with him in the remainder of the lifetime of this Seanad.  We will support the Government in every way possible to ensure the smooth running of the House.  Senator Cummins has huge experience and will make a very successful leader of the Seanad.  He is the fourteenth Leader of the House.  It is a great honour for his family, party and himself personally and I wish him well in continuing to make the Seanad a success.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and as leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il group in the Seanad, I urge support for the Taoiseach and the Government in their stand against the introduction of a common consolidated corporation tax base ahead of the European summit in Brussels today.  Everyone in Ireland will agree that the Government cannot leave the door open for its participation.  Two weeks ago the Taoiseach said he was opposed to the establishment of a CCCTB which he described as tax harmonisation by the back door.  The matter should not be up for discussion in any shape or form.  We all agree that the European Commission&rsquo;s proposals would see the introduction of a single set of rules which companies operating within the European Union would be able to use in calculating their taxable income which, as we all know, would then be divided up among all of the countries in the Union.  The 12.5% corporation tax rate is our hallmark in terms of what we have achieved.</P>
        <P>Se&aacute;n Lemass introduced his own tax regime in 1960 which stood to us well until 5 April 1990.  The 12.5% corporation tax rate, with the system of free education introduced by Donogh O&rsquo;Malley, has given us what we have which we hope to progress for future generations.  As in the case of the former Taoiseach, former Deputy Brian Cowen, and the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, I ask the Taoiseach to ensure the 12.5% corporation tax rate will not be interfered with in any circumstances.  That is the strong message I ask the new <Col N="682"/>Leader to take back to his party leader whom I wish well in his deliberations in Brussels over two days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We would also like to be associated with the words of Senator Cassidy in congratulating Senator Cummins on his elevation to the important role of Leader of the House.  I wish him well in that regard.  I also thank Senator Cassidy for his support and co-operation in recent years as Leader of the House.</P>
        <P>On the question raised by Senator Cassidy, I seek a reassessment of where we are in the European Union.  By the end of the general election campaign everyone in the country was certain that we would have a reduced interest rate because we had been told this by every party.  However, the first trip by the new Taoiseach to Brussels undermined that idea.  He was told there was no such commitment to reducing the interest rate.  There was then the question of restructuring, which has also been removed from the agenda for the moment, as well as the question of changes to the tax base by way of the CCCTB.  All of these issues have to be looked at.  I wish the Government well in this difficult task and support the points made yesterday by Senator Regan on the importance of maintaining our relationship with the European Union in the way we do business.</P>
        <P>There are some things about which we need to be careful.  We cannot start to raise the expectations of the people only to have them dashed.  In that regard, there is much loose talk coming from the Government.  It would be useful, therefore, if it outlined clearly the vested interests of France and Germany in the discussions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In dealing with the banks, as many on both sides of the House have stated in the past few months, &euro;50 billion, &euro;60 billion or &euro;70 billion of the money we are paying back is going to German and French banks.  Of course, they do not want us to default or see a rescheduling, as it would not be in the interests of their people.  Chancellor Merkel faces four or five L&aring;nder elections between now and the end of the year and many of her supposedly European concerns are actually local concerns.</P>
        <P>The other point that we need to make clear to everybody &mdash; it should be stated and reported on &mdash; is that the actual rate of corporation tax in France is far closer to 7% or 8%.  In real terms, therefore, the corporation tax rate is lower in France than in this country.  President Sarkozy is simply playing a game; he is third in the opinion polls behind Ms Le Pen.  That really is the issue.</P>
        <P>We need to be absolutely clear that the issues being dealt with by the European Union in the context raised by Senator Regan yesterday should be addressed with European objectives in mind and also state that unless Ireland can get back on track, there will be no payback.  Call it burning or whatever one likes, but there must be a rescheduling.</P>
        <P>While I will not take the initiative, this House should discuss the Moriarty tribunal report.  I am not suggesting we do so today, but I ask the Leader to consider the matter.  Some 30 Members could sign such a request.  I support the view that this House should return to discuss the issue which is uppermost in the mind of every citizen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator Cummins on his elevation to the position of Leader of the House and wish him well.  He can be assured of my party&rsquo;s co-operation in the time available to us.  I seek mutual co-operation along the lines I hope I offered when Deputy Leader of the House.  In that spirit, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that after No. 1, 30 minutes be provided to complete Committee and Remaining Stages of the <Col N="683"/>Mental Health (Involuntary Procedures) (Amendment) Bill 2008, on which much progress was made yesterday and to which there are four amendments, three of which have been discussed and the fourth is not contentious.  A series of votes would complete discussion of the Bill.  I would be grateful if the Leader, with the co-operation of the Minister and the Department, could achieve this end and finish the process.</P>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call for a debate on the Moriarty tribunal report, not for the narrow party political reasons that might accompany such a debate but to address the serious issues involved in the relationship between the media, business and politics in general, which will inform aspects of the programme for Government we discussed yesterday.  Before it finishes its term, this House should have an opportunity to do this, especially in the light of the decision of the Taoiseach to refer the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda.  As it was the creation of the Oireachtas, as a House of the Oireachtas, we should have an opportunity to discuss the tribunal&rsquo;s report at an early date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, agree with some of the comments made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, particularly on the corporation tax rate and the distraction caused at European level by the French and, perhaps, German tactics.  The Taoiseach has been consistent in his approach to safeguarding the best interests of the country and has made it clear that the 12.5% corporation tax is a <i>sine qua non</i> and not up for renewal or negotiation.  It may take some time to deal with the issues involved because there are 17 countries involved in the defence of the euro and 27 countries in all in the European Union.  With so many states involved, let there be a little patience in dealing with these matters.  One cannot attend a one or two-day meeting and have decisions made on all matters.  For instance, as has been stated, an interest rate reduction might be in the pipeline, but it will take a little more time to deal with all of the other matters involved.  Therefore, we should be patient.  We have the utmost confidence in our negotiating team &mdash; the Taoiseach, relevant Ministers and the Civil Service.  I say let them get on with it.  It is an issue to which we can come back if the Seanad is still in being.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It is hard to adjust to our new positions today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is all about perspective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on the Order of Business.  I want questions to be put to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator Cummins on his appointment as Leader of the House.  It creates certain difficulties for me on the Labour Panel, which now includes a former Leader of the House, as well as the new Leader.  It will put considerable pressure on me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>And perhaps a future Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for that.</P>
        <P>I have waited nine years to state I want to propose an amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>What stopped the Senator?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, come to the House and call for an immediate ceasefire in the bombardment of Tripoli and other places in Libya.  On the activities of Colonel Gadaffi, who could condone the activities of his regime?  I note that not long ago the former British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, and the Rt. Hon. Jack Straw, MP, negotiated with Colonel Gadaffi the release of the Lockerbie bomber.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="684"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator looking for a debate on the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade come to the House to outline the Government&rsquo;s position on a country with which we have strong trade relations.  I remember the meetings which took place in the desert with the then Taoiseach, the late Charles Haughey, and Mr. Goodman.  I remind the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade that, as a guest of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in 2006 I led a delegation with him to Palestine and that we understand the situation regarding the Muslim nations and the attack on Libya.  This is a serious issue.  By the way, all the armaments in Libya were supplied by Britain and the United States.  Colonel Gadaffi was a friend in need; now he is an enemy.  I call on the Government which is independent and neutral to call for an immediate ceasefire in the bombardment of Tripoli and other places in Libya.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate my colleagues on the Government side and wish them and the Government well.  </P>
        <P>With regard to the euro, I have stated previously in the House that the banking problem is a serious one.  The whole of Europe is involved; it is not merely an isolated problem for Ireland.  In Portugal the Government has collapsed.  This creates a significant additional element.  The people of Portugal, through their representatives, have refused to accept the stringent measures proposed and, as a result, they may well be faced, through central government, with even harsher regimes.</P>
        <P>It is important that the Government appreciates, for example, given the situation in Germany referred to by my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, that we have a job to do, not merely at senior political level where it has been done fairly well so far but also in making contact with local political representatives and civil servants there.  Listening to some of the stuff coming out of Germany on radio the other day, I was astonished at persons speaking from a reasonably high but uninformed position about the situation, the relationship between the financial systems in Ireland and Germany, and the benefits that accrued through the difficulties being inflicted on the Irish people.  The impossibility of the task we are being asked to take on with regard to both bank and sovereign debt simultaneously needs to be brought home to them clearly.  I also listened to an interview on television with people in France.  It became quite clear that Senator O&rsquo;Toole is right when he says the rate of corporation tax in France is between 7% and 8%, but is being concealed.  A man from Strasbourg admitted that the French tax regime provides tax concessions, rebates and incentives.  If they are all added together, it is clear the French corporation tax rate is significantly lower then our rate.  We need an overall view.  I have said in this House previously that an inevitable centrifugal force is driving Europe towards tax harmonisation.  If Europe is to continue to function and the euro is to survive, it is inevitable that tax harmonisation will happen.  We need to prepare for it.  That is a task for the new Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the new Leader to indicate what level of progress is to be made with Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Bill, which relates to the construction industry.  I understand the Leader is an enthusiastic supporter of the Bill.  Will the Government support it in the other House?  Will the Bill pass into law?  The legislation in question marks a significant contribution to Irish political life on the part of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like my colleagues, I would like to be associated with the vote of congratulations to Senator Cummins.  I do not doubt that he will make an excellent Leader not only in the short period before the Seanad election, but also in the future.  I am sure all Members of <Col N="685"/>this House are willing to recommend to the Taoiseach that he should reappoint Senator Cummins as Leader after the election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Burke might be interested.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Burke is going to higher office.  This is probably the last chance some of us will have to say something in this House.  I would like to make some final remarks after 30-odd years in the Oireachtas.  Every citizen of this country has a duty to support the Government as it tries to ensure our 12.5% corporation tax rate is not changed.  If it is changed, this country&rsquo;s chances of recovering from its present situation will be very poor.  We will be bounced from left to right by Sarkozy and Merkel.  As everybody here knows, they have totally vested interests in trying to hammer the Irish economy.  I have said publicly and privately that the rate being charged to this country for the bailout is unsustainable.</P>
        <P>I wish the new Government luck.  It has the full support and confidence of the people of this country as it tries to renegotiate the deal.  If we cannot do so, the jobs we hope to create in the future will be created elsewhere.  In such circumstances, the jobs mentioned in the programme for Government will not be created in Ireland &mdash; they will be created in France, Germany and across Europe and we will be the lame duck once more.  I do not want to see us return to that.  Some of us are old enough to remember pre-EU times.  We know what they were like.  We are aware of the benefits the EU has brought to this country.  We should not allow the EU to take from future generations the benefits we have enjoyed.</P>
        <P>That is all I wanted to say.  I wish the very best to my colleagues who are standing in the Seanad election.  I thank the staff of the House for their co-operation over the years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I would like to inform the House that I do not intend to pursue the amendment I have proposed, given that the T&aacute;naiste may have to join the Taoiseach in Brussels.  I ask the Leader to convey my views to the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment has not been seconded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It would have been seconded if I had allowed it to stand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.  It has not happened, in any event.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallOBrolchain"><NameTxt>Senator Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I recognise the new Leader, as other Senators have done, and wish him well.  I would like to second the amendment to the Order of Business that was proposed by Senator Boyle.  I hope the new Leader will look kindly on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As long as the current Seanad is in place, we should do our jobs.  The new Leader should look to ensure further debates take place.  I would like us to discuss the energy security crisis we are facing in this country.  Such a debate is crucial.  Since the Seanad broke up at the start of the general election campaign, the price of oil has increased to in excess of $100 a barrel, an appalling nuclear crisis has developed in Japan and water supplies in Tokyo have been cut off, which makes it somewhat difficult for the nuclear option to happen in this particular country.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, told the other House last year that Ireland is &ldquo;acutely exposed in the event of fossil fuel import disruptions ... [because] ... fossil fuels comprise 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s primary energy mix ... all oil used for energy and over 90% of natural gas is imported [and] Ireland is at the end of a long supply chain that mostly originates in regions of geopolitical instability.&rdquo;  That is clear from the situation in Tripoli, as has been pointed out, and from the difficulties in Egypt and other parts of the Middle East.</P><Col N="686"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister, Deputy Coveney, also said last year that &ldquo;Ireland has a total of only 11 days of commercial storage capacity for natural gas which may, or may not, be filled at any particular time,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Ireland has only a few days of commercial stocks of oil on the island and is dependent on 24/7 availability of Dublin Port and the Whitegate refinery.&rdquo;  There is an impending oil and energy crisis.  When people ask about the major financial crisis in the world, they often ask why no one warned them about it. We have to warn the people about the impending energy crisis.  I admire Fine Gael&rsquo;s NewERA document.  I am pleased a Minister of State is now responsible for it.  We have to take it seriously.  This country&rsquo;s economy is more exposed than any other in Europe to the needs of energy security.  We should have a debate on it in the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to be associated with the votes of congratulations to Senator Cummins.  Senator Wilson and I received extremely good co-operation from Senator Cummins, who is a very decent man.  I do not doubt that he will reflect the confidence the Taoiseach placed in him when he appointed him Leader of the Seanad for a short time.  I am sure that will continue after the election.  I wish him well.</P>
        <P>I would like to raise a couple of matters in the aftermath of the recent general election.  I have been in public life for almost 32 years.  I have to say the electorate has become cynical and distrustful of politicians in general.  Promises are very real until elections are over, when they are forgotten.  It would be important if people would report on what they have done, rather than on what they are going to do.</P>
        <P>When the new Seanad has been elected, I suggest it should seriously consider the ever-increasing scourge of knife crime, which has reached epidemic proportions.  Last week, a young man of 19 was chased and knifed to death.  Can anybody say with any measure of conviction that it was an accidental occurrence?  It was not.  It was intended.  Those who carry knives do not do so to pare their pencils or their nails.  They do so with the intention of using them for other purposes.</P>
        <P>Even at this late stage, I appeal to the Government parties to row back on their intention to abolish this House.  We all accept it has to be reformed.  No one disputes that.  The failure to introduce reforms is not the fault of this House.  Successive Governments have failed to reform the Seanad.  Several reports have been compiled, but each of them is collecting its own layer of dust.  Equally, the need for local government reform needs to be visited in a realistic way.</P>
        <P>I would like to conclude by thanking the Cathaoirleach.  I will not be contesting the forthcoming Seanad election.  I wish every success to those who have decided to do so.  I sincerely thank the Cathaoirleach and my colleagues on all sides of the House.  I thank all the councillors throughout the country, as well as their spouses and partners.  It has been a very enriching experience for me.  I am delighted to have been given an opportunity to serve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Well done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in congratulating my good friend and colleague, Senator Cummins, on his elevation to the position of Leader of this House.  It has been a great pleasure to have worked with him as Whip for the last four years.  He was always honourable and always kept his word.  His word was always his bond, which is a great attribute in any person.  I also congratulate Senator Coghlan on his elevation to the position of Government Chief Whip in his House.  Nobody deserves it more.  He was one of the few people who could fill Senator Cummins&rsquo;s shoes when he was absent from this House, which did not take place too often.</P><Col N="687"/>
      
        <P>I feel like proposing an amendment to the Order of Business because I have wanted to do so for the past four years to observe the faces of Senators Cummins and Coghlan when they realise they would lose a vote.  I will not do so, however, because I am not that cruel.  I genuinely wish Senator Cummins well as Leader and hope he will serve in that position not only for the next couple of weeks but also for the coming five years.  I also hope I will have five years to get used to sitting on this side of the House and to seeing the faces of Government Senators.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the outgoing Leader, Senator Cassidy, who faced a difficult job at times in keeping the business of the House running smoothly.  He always held his position of leadership in high esteem and I wish him, and all my colleagues, well in the coming Seanad election.</P>
        <P>I also pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach and the staff of the House, including the Clerk and Clerk Assistant to the Seanad, for the courtesy they have shown over the nine years I have served as a Senator.  I look forward to returning to work with the other Senators elected to the 24th Seanad.  I offer my best wishes for the future to all my colleagues who are retiring.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDearey"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Dearey</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in offering my best wishes to Senator Cummins in his new role.  As a proud parliamentarian and Irishman, he fully appreciates the honour bestowed on him and I know he will fulfil his duties with great dignity.</P>
        <P>It is ironic that the Green Party was the only party in the general election to campaign on the basis of retaining the Seanad.  The principle of bicameralism is very important and I did not enjoy the comments from certain Fine Gael Deputies in regard to other parliaments which have thrown away that principle.  That is another example of loose talk which should be knocked on the head.  I wish my Green Party colleagues luck in their bid for re-election.  Given our unique position on the future of the Seanad, it would be ironic if they failed to be returned.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I called for a debate on nuclear power on three occasions in the year I sat in this House, sometimes in the face of speeches in favour of nuclear power.  On one occasion, I spoke at length about the number of quangos and regulatory and supervisory bodies required to put order on the industry.  We can see now what happens when that order breaks down.  To put in context the ongoing threat posed by the industry to Ireland, I remind Senators that whereas 26 kg of caesium 137 were released across Europe when the core of the reactor in Chernobyl melted down, the waste tanks which store liquid nuclear fuel rods in Sellafield contain more than two tonnes of this material.  The caesium is stored in 21 tanks in a building, B215, which is not secure in the event of an aircraft strike.  The unimaginable has happened in Japan and it can happen again.  The call by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to stress test Sellafield is like calling for a stress test on Anglo Irish Bank because it is a proven case.  We need to be more firm in seeking an end to nuclear reprocessing.  Sellafield will not and cannot go away and it needs to be managed effectively and secured against the unimaginable.  I ask the Government to raise its game on this issue and seek far more than a mere stress test.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senators Cummins and Coghlan on their elevation to Leader of the House and Government Whip, respectively, and wish them well.</P>
        <P>Given that 2011 is a census year and as I am sure the new Leader will occupy the same position in the next Seanad, I ask that he bring forward legislation to publish the 1926 census.  There was no census in 1921 and my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, and I have previously called for legislation in this area.  As a local genealogist, every week and month I receive communications from various parts of the United States and England regarding families who had to leave this country between the 1920s and the 1950s.  The publication of the 1926 census, like its predecessors in 1901 and 1911, could provide vital information on these families.  I will <Col N="688"/>send a reminder of the matter to the Leader when he is, I hope, reappointed to his current position in the next Seanad.</P>
        <P>As this is our last sitting and I am not contesting the forthcoming election, I wish my colleagues the best of luck and, most importantly, the best of health.  I hope those who are contesting the election will be returned.  As I understand the Cathaoirleach will not be contesting the election, I commend him on the way he fulfilled his duties in the House in the past three and three quarters years.  I understand now that he always knew what was happening on this side of the House because he had a clearer view of it than he had of the other side.  I offer the best of wishes to his staff and thank them for their help and co-operation.</P>

	<P>I join my colleagues in congratulating Senator Cummins on his new role as Leader of the House.  I wish the best of luck both to those who are contesting the election as well as to those who are going on to other careers.  I am told there is a life after politics.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given that the economy is uppermost in our minds, I hope the renegotiation of the IMF-EU deal will bear fruit.  I am sure all of us were concerned to learn that the Taoiseach will not seek an immediate deal on the interest rate but is parking the issue pending the outcome of the stress tests on the banks.  This underlines the critical nature of these tests for the economy and, in light of what is happening in Portugal, everyone is understandably nervous about what will happen.  I hope and believe the renegotiations will enable the economy to recover.</P>
        <P>Other speakers have referred to the appalling human catastrophes unfolding in Libya and Japan.  As Senator Dearey noted, the natural disaster in Japan, compounded by the crisis in the nuclear reactor, points to the need to debate the issue of nuclear power and the potential of renewable energy as a safer alternative.</P>
        <P>The abolition of the Seanad is on the agenda of the new Government but this alone will not bring about the fundamental political reform which people clearly demanded in the recent election.  If we are to abolish the Seanad, this should be done only as part of a comprehensive reform of the Oireachtas that ensures the scrutiny we bring to Committee Stage of Bills such as the one introduced by Senator Boyle is incorporated into the business of the D&aacute;il by, for example, electing a number of Deputies on a national list system.  This would allow for closer attention to the national interest and the sort of debates we have held in the Seanad.  It is important that we consider overall reform of the Oireachtas in the context of debate on the future of the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Leader.  I am delighted Senator Cummins was elevated to the position.</P>
        <P>Of course the incoming Government is entitled to the support of every Irish man and woman &mdash; it will have it wholeheartedly from me &mdash; in ensuring that the country returns to prosperity and that the necessary changes are made.  However, I ask the Leader to ensure we do not have <Col N="689"/>11 separate constitutional referendums, as suggested in the programme for Government.  I suggest that the proposal for a constitutional review include all of these, although I will be voting against three of them &mdash; the abolition of the Seanad, the introduction of same-sex marriage and the removal of the provision on blasphemy from the Constitution.  It would be wrong to have 11 separate constitutional referendums.  We must ensure there is one proposal for reform of the Constitution, and we can vote on that issue.</P>
        <P>It will not be easy to make certain decisions, although some decisions will be easy.  For example, it was originally proposed that there be 20 fewer D&aacute;il Deputies.  Based on the 2011 census, Dublin will probably lose a seat, but it may lose another six if we have 20 fewer TDs.  It will be more difficult for the incoming Government to ensure this change goes through when all of those seven seats will be Government seats.  That will take real courage.  Another thing that will take courage is the introduction of taxation that the public does not want.  I refer specifically to water charges and rates.  There is a proposal that councils be given this power, but having spoken to councillors around the country I can say that under no circumstances will they vote for this.  They do not believe the Government should divest its responsibility for the introduction of water charges or rates to the councils, and they will not vote for it.  It is important that those on the Government side know this.  It is a function of Governments to introduce taxation, and it will have real difficulty in this regard.</P>
        <P>I hope for the sake of Ireland that the Government has a successful term.  There are some issues that may result in knee-jerk reactions, but there are also real, substantive and difficult tasks to be undertaken.  I wish it well in its deliberations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the fundamental issues that must be addressed by the Government is the EU-IMF bailout deal.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned that promises were made to renegotiate it.  The fact that the deal is unsustainable for this country makes it imperative that it be renegotiated.  I do not think we should second-guess how the Government plays its cards on this one.  There is much damage that must be undone.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is also the question of rebuilding our reputation in Europe.  We must get the facts out about the significance of the 12.5% corporate tax rate, including the fact that this is not the lowest rate in Europe and, particularly, that it played no part in the crisis in the economy.  That will take time.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s strategy of not rushing the fences in the European Council this week will be proved to be correct.</P>
        <P>Lest we do not have the opportunity again, as this may be our last occasion to meet, I must say that I have found it a privilege to be a Member of this House.  The manner in which business has been conducted has been exemplary, and much of that is due to the Cathaoirleach, Senator Pat Moylan, who has conducted business in an even-handed and fair way.</P>

        <P>The Seanad is a most important institution, although its role and effectiveness in scrutinising legislation are not very evident.  Not many amendments or suggestions from the Opposition are accepted by the Government &mdash; at least not obviously, because no Minister wants to admit that he or she is accepting amendments from the Opposition.  However, the debate in this House permeates through to the various Departments and is ultimately reflected in better legislation.  It has provided a platform for raising many issues of national interest and concern, <Col N="690"/>and we have seen results from some of those debates.  The Seanad has effected change in the body politic.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join others in congratulating Senator Cummins on his appointment as Leader.  Like my colleague Senator Hanafin, I wish him well.  We know the road ahead will be a challenging one for those in government.  We wish him well on, as Senator Hanafin put it, the easy and the tough decisions.  As Senator Ellis mentioned, we are all at one, rightly, in our desire to move forward and address the difficult decisions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not wish any disagreement with the Cathaoirleach, who has a letter on his desk from me &mdash; I think he is getting it as we speak &mdash; on the subject of an appeal to his decision not to afford me the opportunity to make a personal explanation under Standing Order 32A.  That is his decision and I will not have any disagreement with him in that regard.  I have sent him a letter of appeal. I hope he will consider it and look favourably upon my request.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I could table an amendment to the Order of Business to seek permission to allow people such as me, who would like to make a short statement, ten minutes to speak.  We do not have a full day of business; I do not think the House will sit into the late afternoon.  I am asking for this, rather than tabling an amendment, and I hope Senator Cummins will accommodate my request in a spirit of co-operation.  As I mentioned, co-operation is what the public wants to see on the national issues, and it should happen at every level.  I am simply asking that people such as I, who have not had an opportunity to put certain issues on the record, be given a chance to do so.  I have been ridiculed personally, as a Member of this House.</P>

Accordingly, I have notified the Senator that I will not be calling on him to make a personal <Col N="691"/>explanation to the House today.  I allowed him to make a personal statement on 2 June 2010 and I am aware of nothing on the record of the House since that would warrant the making of another statement on that matter.

        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to raise with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food the matter of the Department office in Ballybay, known as the DV office, which has a great cloud hanging <Col N="692"/>over it.  I would appreciate if the Leader would ask the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure this office is maintained to provide the service for the people of Monaghan.  The office has been widely used for the last 20 or 30 years, and was very effective when we had to face the big threat of foot and mouth disease in the county and surrounding regions, including cross-Border areas.  The work done from that office was second to none such that we now have brucellosis-free status and TB is well under control in the county and surrounding areas.  It would be a shame to see this office closed.  The office is needed and it will not cost any extra money to keep it open.  That is the one thing I want the Leader to convey to the Minister.  I want to convey a special word of thanks to the last Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, who did everything in his power to keep that office open.  That was brilliant, and I am appealing to the Leader to speak to the Minister on a personal basis on my behalf and ask him to do what he can in this regard.</P>

I offer my best wishes to those Members seeking re-election and wish those who have decided to call it a day well in their retirement.  It was a privilege to work with all the Senators in this House in the last number of Seanad terms, particularly the last one.  It was a good Seanad and we passed some good legislation in this House.  The Seanad is a great Chamber in which to scrutinise legislation and I hope that whatever legislation is introduced in the years ahead will provide the same level of scrutiny that previous Bills received in this House over many years.  The country would be the poorer if this does not happen or if proposals are not put in place to ensure that.  I wish the Cathaoirleach and those who are retiring well.</P>

        <P Just="Left">We have already heard the opening shots of the great retreat about the abolition of the Seanad with the admission by the Taoiseach that the matter may not be as simple as originally portrayed.  We might add that the matter may not be as simplistic as originally presented by <Col N="693"/>the new Taoiseach.  This was clearly a grab, as I have said before, for the cookie jar of popular ideas, when what is needed is a more thorough and mature reform of the operations of the Oireachtas.  That would see reform in both the way the D&aacute;il and the Seanad operate and a better resourcing of Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; agus Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la in order that they can fulfil their duty as scrutineers of legislation more effectively.  I hope now that with all the different measures being promised we will have careful reflection before we jump into referendums on overly simplistic proposals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I did not have an opportunity to contribute to the debate about the programme for Government yesterday.  I was one of the Members waiting to get in, but there was not enough time.  However, one issue I hope the Government takes very seriously is the whole question of how we treat victims of human trafficking and, in particular, how we deal with problems of prostitution.  We saw the former Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, moving towards a recognition of the type of legislation used in Sweden where the purchaser of prostitution services is criminalised but the prostitute is not.  There is a movement towards a recognition that this is the way we should be going.  I had the pleasure, with Senator O&rsquo;Toole, of attending an interesting presentation recently involving people such as the poet, Theo Dorgan, Christy Moore and others, uniting around the issue that men in particular must be seen to be saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the exploitation of women in prostitution.</P>
        <P>For that reason, although I welcome the new diversity in the D&aacute;il, I very much regret the wrong-headedness of Deputy Mick Wallace&rsquo;s approach to this issue where he suggests that we might somehow improve the situation for sex workers, perhaps by giving them a PPS number or something.  He seems to have adopted the naive and mistaken view that it can somehow be made easier for persons in prostitution in terms of accessing health services and otherwise by giving the whole thing the veneer of legality and respectability.  That would be a step in the wrong direction, as other jurisdictions are discovering.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The way to go is to follow the way Sweden has gone, namely, to criminalise the user and protect the person in prostitution.  I hope there will be more careful and sustained reflection on this issue.  I see Senator Regan in the House, a fine lawyer and an influential person, and hope he will push the new Minister for Justice and Law Reform in the direction of bringing forward legislation along&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I should like to thank all the Members for their kind wishes which are very much appreciated. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Cassidy, O&rsquo;Toole, Coghlan, Norris, Ellis, Hanafin and Regan spoke about our 12.5% corporation tax rate and our relations with Europe.  The Taoiseach has made it perfectly clear that the 12.5% rate is sacrosanct.</P>
        <P>With regard to the renegotiation of the terms of the bailout, it is accepted by everyone that it will not happen overnight.  The Taoiseach stated it will be done in a measured way, with the interest of the country paramount.  There is a need to rebuild our reputation in Europe.  There is a diplomatic offensive under way to inform other countries of the difficulties and the position in this country.  Prime Ministers of other countries make rash statements at election times.  This is to be expected and statements should be taken in that context.  The Government is committed <Col N="694"/>to renegotiating this deal and it will be done in a measured way.  There will be no knee-jerk reactions from the Government.  Every Member has wished the Government every success in renegotiating the deal.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle proposed an amendment to the Order of Business that we deal with the Mental Health (Involuntary Procedures) (Amendment) Bill for 30 minutes.  I am prepared to accept that amendment to the Order Of Business in order that we take the Bill after No. 1.  I thank Senator Leyden for withdrawing the amendment he proposed regarding Libya.  Senator Norris referred to the Bill introduced by Senator Quinn, which is very important.  We will make representations to the Government to have it  progress through the other House.</P>
        <P>Senators &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in and Dearey referred to the energy and oil crisis and the dangers of nuclear reprocessing.  A Minister of State has been appointed with responsibility for the NewERA project.  Given the crisis in Japan, it is a matter we must consider and I am sure the Government will give the matter serious consideration in due course.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Glynn raised the matters of knife crime and local government reform.  Knife crime is at epidemic proportions and I hope the Government will bring in further measures, if necessary, to tackle it.  I compliment members of the Garda on their efforts in this regard.  They have a difficult task but they are carrying out their duties in an exemplary manner.</P><P Just="Left">There is a comprehensive list of proposals for local government reform in the programme for Government.  The Government is committed to proceeding with those reforms.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator Carty referred to the publication of the 1926 census.  I will take up the matter and see no reason it should not be published.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik and other Members referred to the abolition of the Seanad.  The Government is committed to comprehensive reforms in many areas and to proposing constitutional amendments.  The Government is committed to a constitutional amendment, irrespective of what Senator Mullen stated, on the Seanad and other matters.  It is hoped that some will be taken together but they may have to be taken separately.  Some of the constitutional amendments proposed in the programme for Government will obviously take some time.  Senator Regan referred to Seanad reform.</P>
        <P>Regarding Senator Callely&rsquo;s point, it is not a matter for the Leader to decide on a personal statement.  It is a matter for the Cathaoirleach and he has ruled on the matter.  I understand the question is also under appeal in the courts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a pity Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s question on Ballybay was not submitted as a matter for the Adjournment but it will be taken up and it would also be a worthy Adjournment matter in the other House.</P><P Just="Left">Senator Mullen referred to human trafficking and there will be sustained reflection on the matter by the Government, as requested.  I can assure the Senator that will happen. I hope for some action on the matter.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his congratulations, which I appreciate.</P>
	<P Just="Left">This motion  amends an existing proposal that sets out jurisdiction rules that apply in international cases involving mainly EU citizens.  On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, I thank Senators for agreeing to deal with this matter at short notice and within a very tight timeframe.   Their co-operation in this matter is very much appreciated and it is to be hoped it will ensure Ireland can play a full part in the negotiations, which have just begun, on this very important instrument.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Commission has sole right of initiative on legislative proposals in the civil justice area and the timing of the presentation of such proposals is within its hands.  This proposal was presented just before Christmas.  Its legal basis is to be found in Title V of Part Three of the <Col N="696"/>Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  In consequence, the terms of the protocol which we share with the United Kingdom, whereby we have three months to exercise our option to take part in the adoption and application of relevant measures, apply.  We have been informed that the three month period will expire on 4 April, hence the reason for bringing the matter to the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  Accordingly, if we are to exercise our option within the required timeframe, it is necessary to obtain the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas before that date.  Given the intervention of the general election, it was not possible to deal with the matter until now.</P>
        <P>Senators will be familiar with the procedure for protocol measures since a large volume of proposals which attract the provisions of the protocol have come before the House in recent years.  In the civil area alone more than 20 such proposals have been considered by the House and this is testimony to the volume of activity in this area.  It should perhaps be noted that this proposal is the first civil law measure to be presented since the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union entered into force.  However, given that the Commission has very ambitious plans in this area, it is likely to be the first of many such measures in the coming years.</P>
        <P>The essence of the proposal is captured by its somewhat unwieldy title which points to the fact that it is concerned with court jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.  It is important to note that the proposal is only concerned with international cases which, at its simplest, would be reflected in the fact that the plaintiff and defendant are located in different member states.  It is also important to note that the purpose of the proposal is merely to introduce certain amendments into its parent regulation, commonly referred to as Brussels I.</P>
        <P>The amendments arise from a process of consultation which was launched by the Commission in April 2009.  Arising from that consultation, it became clear that there was scope for improving the operation of the Brussels I regulation which has been in force since March 2002.  That proposal was presented in September 1999 and at the time Ireland exercised its right to opt in to its adoption and application.  Our timely participation in the parent instrument underlines the vital importance of our participation in its successor.  This is especially the case as we have no particular difficulties with the proposal made and it would be unfortunate if our failure to opt in were to be misconstrued as in some sense being a manifestation of hostility to its content.  Failure to opt in would also run contrary to the commitment we have given to take part in relevant measures in the justice area to the maximum extent possible.</P>
        <P>The original Brussels I regulation is the primary instrument governing the recognition and enforcement of civil and commercial judgments within the European Union.  It provides a degree of certainty on which court in which member state will take jurisdiction in an international case.  That is important.  It also provides a mechanism enabling judgments given in one EU member state to be recognised and enforced in each of the other member states.  In essence, what that means is that such judgments, when they go through an enforceability process, can be enforced in a member state as if they were judgments which had originally been given in the member state.</P>
        <P>There is considerable history attaching to the proposal which is the subject of this debate in that, before the Brussels I regulation was adopted, these matters were governed by a convention which dated from 1968 and was ratified by Ireland in 1988.  Participation in the new instrument is part of the progression towards making access to justice easier and more efficient for all citizens which, in this context, includes consumers, economic operators and individual litigants in a wide variety of contexts.</P><Col N="697"/>
        <P>The original Brussels I regulation is widely viewed as being a seminal instrument in the area of judicial co-operation in civil matters.  The new proposal is essentially an add-on to the existing proposal and, as I indicated, preliminary examination does not suggest it gives rise to particular difficulties in so far as Ireland is concerned.  The intention underlying it is to simplify further the recognition and enforcement regime for judgments in the civil and commercial area.  This has the potential to be of particular benefit to the business community as studies suggest the complexities attendant upon cross-border litigation are a significant disincentive to doing business in another jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>It is the case that, under the protocol, we may accept a proposal any time after it has been adopted.  However, it is our considered view that early opt-in to the discussions will maximise our ability to influence the shape of the final outcome.  It will give us voting rights and enable us to participate in alliances with like-minded member states in the event that this becomes necessary in order to defend a particular policy stance.  It will also confirm our commitment to continued participation in a regime which has been operating successfully in this jurisdiction for more than 20 years.</P>
        <P>I will deal briefly with the key elements of the new proposal.  The first and most important element involves the abolition of a procedure known as <i>exequatur</i>.  What this involves is a procedure whereby a declaration of enforceability is required before a judgment given in one member state can be enforced in another.  In Ireland, a declaration of this kind is obtained by way of application to the Master of the High Court.  Commission figures suggest that within the European Union the overall cost of <i>exequatur</i> proceedings amounts to more than &euro;47 million per year.  Its analysis also suggests the time for obtaining a declaration of enforceability can vary considerably from member state to member state.  The costs and time involved in obtaining such a declaration are perceived to be inimical to the proper functioning of the Internal Market and present a real barrier to doing business within the Union.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that the abolition of <i>exequatur</i> carries with it certain risks and, for that reason, a number of remedies to protect the rights of the defendant are envisaged.  These include the right to contest a judgment in the member state of origin if the defendant has not been properly informed about the original proceedings in that state.  Also included is the right to contest any other procedural defects that may have arisen before the court of origin and which may have infringed the right to a fair trial.</P>
        <P>Another element of the proposal relates to the operation of the Brussels I regulation within the international legal order.  Clearly, this is a matter of some delicacy since it involves relationships with third countries.  What is proposed is that the jurisdiction rules of the regulation should be adjusted in order that jurisdiction in regard to defendants from outside the European Union would no longer be governed by national law but by specific rules set out in the regulation.  In addition, the courts of a member state would have a certain discretion to stay proceedings in a case where a non-EU court was already dealing with the same case.</P>
        <P>The proposal also attempts to improve the effectiveness of choice of court agreements in order that the court chosen by the parties to resolve the dispute will always have priority to decide on its jurisdiction, even where one of the parties seises another court first in time in an effort to avoid compliance with the original agreement.  The provision has been designed to ensure it will not interfere with the future ratification of a Hague Convention which also deals with choice of court agreements.  In this way, it is envisaged that the widest possible respect will be given to international choice of court agreements which are often an important tool in the formulation of international commercial contracts.</P>
        <P>The proposal also contains provisions designed to improve the interface between the regulation and arbitration by providing that a court seised with a dispute involving an arbitration <Col N="698"/>agreement would have to stay proceedings if an arbitral tribunal or a court at the seat of the arbitration was already seised of proceedings to determine, as its main object or as an incidental question, the existence, validity or effects of that arbitration agreement.  This is intended to enhance the effectiveness of arbitration agreements in Europe and eliminate the incentive for abusive litigation tactics.</P>
        <P>There are other minor elements designed to facilitate co-ordination between courts and the circulation of provisional and protective measures.  However, the four elements I have outlined represent the key amendments that are being proposed in regard to the new regulation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The technical negotiations on this proposal commenced in early February and the first reading has yet to conclude.  It is too early at this stage to say when the negotiations will reach finality.  By and large, member states seem to be of the view that the Commission has done a good job in presenting a well balanced text which is likely to be of general benefit.  Inevitably, however, the negotiation process is likely to reveal diverging views on some aspects of the proposal. This underlines the need for us to be in a position to make common cause with those member states whose perspective most accords with our own.</P>
        <P>It should be emphasised, lest there be any doubt on this point, that opting in to the proposal at this time does not mean we necessarily agree with every aspect of it.  The opt-in process merely ensures we can be active participants in the negotiation process, and this carries with it the right to make proposals to alter the text should that seem to be desirable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has taken a very positive approach to participation in the various civil law instruments that have been presented.  These instruments range over matters as diverse as the service of documents in judicial proceedings, the taking of evidence in such proceedings, small claims procedures, mediation, legal aid and maintenance.  It is a mark of our commitment to the EU project that we tend to be very positively disposed towards participation in such projects from the outset.  Certainly, we are very positively disposed towards participation in this particular project which has the capacity to enhance legal certainty for individual litigants across the EU.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

        <P Just="Left">This is the type of change in Europe we need to welcome.  It is a tidying up and reduction of bureaucracy.  It is a recognition by various countries of each other&rsquo;s court systems.  It undermines the attempt by people to play off against each other the court systems of various countries.  It is very much to be welcomed.  What are to be welcomed even more are the fail-safes, conditions and protections included in terms of ensuring the right to contest procedural defects can be dealt with and making particular arrangements for people outside the EU.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I very much welcome this legislation and ask the Minister to take any opportunities that arise to speak about it as it is about how being part of Europe makes life easier.  When people speak about the straight banana, this is the other side of the argument.  I support the motion and wish the Minister well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the motion and the Government&rsquo;s attempt to exercise the option prior to 4 April.  It is important to enter the necessary negotiations to ensure the instrument is as effective as possible.  There are two areas in particular where we need to take care that what is eventually agreed is in our national interest and works in the interest of all members of the European Union.  We want to ensure we cannot be backed into situations under civil law whereby the Houses of the Oireachtas are left behind and not involved in discussing the policy aspects of what is eventually agreed.  There must be a mechanism to ensure this does not happen.</P><Col N="703"/>
        <P Just="Left">We also need to ensure when seeking alliances with other countries and exercising this instrument that we do not pick the wrong fights and that we do so for the right reasons.  I am led to believe the recent court decision with regard to crucifixes in Italy involved Malta and may also have involved Ireland.  I would not have seen that as a wider European issue to be discussed at such a level using an instrument of this type.  It should have remained a matter of national competence.  This is why we need to be careful and give the Government every confidence in ensuring the negotiations and the improved instrument to be eventually agreed is one that works for Ireland and the European Union.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the motion to the House.  This legislation was drawn up originally outside the European Union framework under the Brussels Convention of 1968 under the aegis of the Council of Europe.  Subsequently, it was adopted as a regulation following the Amsterdam treaty and it is very important legislation.  Many judgments have been made at European and national court level on the matter in the interim period and it has been extremely important, particularly in the commercial sphere where a person trading with another member state can seek to have litigation dealt with in his or her jurisdiction.  It has saved much in costs for many companies and it makes it possible to do cross-border business with much greater ease.  The various judgments of the European Court of Justice inform the amendments and improvements envisaged.</P>
        <P>The Minister outlined four main areas, including the declaration on enforcement, which is surplus to requirements.  The issues of dealing with the jurisdiction with regard to third countries as distinct from European member states and that where parties agree by contract that a particular jurisdiction should apply are to be respected.  Another matter is clarification on arbitration.  I have no hesitation in recommending this resolution.  Ireland should play its full part in this area.  We secure major benefits from this type of legislation and it is important we are involved in the negotiations at the beginning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am delighted with her appointment as she will be an excellent Minister with responsibility for children and it is a well deserved appointment.  I am sorry there are not more women in the Cabinet, but Deputies Burton and Fitzgerald will be really excellent in their respective briefs and I am delighted they are Ministers.  I am sure the children&rsquo;s rights referendum will be prioritised to a much greater extent under Deputy Fitzgerald&rsquo;s stewardship than it was previously. This is crucial.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the motion and the Minister has put the case for an early opt-in very well.  It is clear there is a volume of activity in this area and that it is important to ensure greater certainty for litigants across the European Union.  Of course, this is not about the harmonisation of legal procedures because as the Minister pointed out, it only applies to international or transnational cases with an international dimension.  However, it will reduce the cost and time taken to do business and thus ensure the conduct of business benefits.</P>
        <P>I welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to devote a full week each year to debating major EU issues of concern.  I suggest the week commencing 9 May, Europe Day, would be appropriate, given the volume of EU directives and decisions coming before us.  It is important that we take a step back once a year to consider the different themes and measures coming from the European Union.</P>
        <P>Let me briefly remark that Senator Callely behaved outrageously this morning.  Lest the silence of any Member be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I thank all of the Senators who contributed to the debate on the motion.  The point has been made that it will have very practical consequences and lead to greater efficiency which will be to the benefit of all citizens.  The timely exercise of our right to opt in to discussions at this time will maximise our ability to influence the shape of the outcome of the negotiations and confirm our commitment to continued participation in a framework which works well and in which we have participated for more than 20 years.  An early opt-in does not mean we accept all elements of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, but it strengthens our hand in terms of further policy proposals at a later stage.  I appreciate the positive attitudes expressed towards the proposition that this is an instrument in which Ireland should participate from the beginning.  As a number of Senators observed, it is important in this regard that the deepening of co-operation in civil matters within the European Union takes place on the basis of proper analysis and scrutiny.  </P>
        <P>I appreciate that time was made available by the House at short notice to agree to the motion.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to finish my brief comments before we make decisions on the amendments being discussed.  The effect of the Bill is not to change the use of electroconvulsive therapy or even the law as it results in involuntary treatment but to pass a Bill in this House that needs further consideration in the other House.  Reconsideration will also give the Minister of State time to come up with adequate legislative measures either by following this Bill through should the House approve it or by introducing a new mental health Bill.  I hope the decisions today, with the debates that have preceded it, will help to inform the Minister of State in that process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill and I am very glad it has been given extra time today.  I pay tribute to Senator Boyle and former Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca who were both responsible for promoting the Bill.  I also pay tribute to the campaigners who have highlighted the abuse of human rights as a result of the existing wording of section 59 of the 2001 Act.  We are all on the same side and I am delighted the Minister of State has committed to changing the wording.  We are all agreed that section 59 denies the right of a competent patient to refuse <Col N="705"/>ECT and we all want to change that position.  I am grateful to Amnesty International for its briefings, proposing that this needed to be changed and expressing the view that a comprehensive package of reforms needed to be introduced.  The Bill represents an opportunity for the Minister of State and the other House to consider what needs to be done to provide for proper safeguards in the administration of ECT in the very rare and exceptional cases in which it continues to be performed.  I believe most such occasions take place on a voluntary basis.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State and express my delight that she has been appointed to her role, in which she will be excellent.</P>
        <P>We are all keen to ensure anyone who is able to refuse consent is not denied his or her right of refusal.  It is a critical point which is addressed in the amendment.  The deletion of the words &ldquo;or unwilling&rdquo; from section 59(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Mental Health Act 2001 is critical and will ensure competent patients will have the right to refuse ECT, as they should be able to do under international human rights law and the Constitution.  However, their mere deletion is not enough.  As Senator Boyle acknowledged, the provisions of the Bill are not enough to ensure adequate safeguards for mental health patients.  The other human rights concerns raised by organisations such as Amnesty International about section 60 of the Act, the need for comprehensive capacity legislation, the right of appeal and the provision of a ban on the administration of ECT in the case of minors all need to be dealt with in more comprehensive legislation aimed at protecting the rights of patients and ensuring we will be in compliance with international standards and best practice.</P>
        <P>All of these issues have to inform the debate.  We are all trying to strike a better balance than that struck in the 2001 Act and all accept that there are flaws in the Bill we are debating.  The best we can do today is to accept the amendment.  Senator Boyle accepts that the wording of amendment No. 2 is flawed, but I am happy to accept amendment No. 3 and withdraw my opposition to section 2.  I understand he is happy to accept amendment No. 4.  In a spirit of co-operation, therefore, we can proceed to accept the Bill and I am very happy to support it.  We all want to see more comprehensive legislation put in place to protect the human rights of psychiatric patients.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate.  When I watched it again last night, I must admit it was most comprehensive, one which could not possibly have taken place with the same fluidity in the other Chamber.  There is a different structure in this House and a great deal more freedom which allows different opinions to be expressed, sometimes in a very calm manner and at other times with great passion.  It is the type of debate we should have at all times.</P>
        <P>As I said previously, we are all agreed that we should act in the best interests of the patient.  There are times, however, when a person will not agree that he or she is a patient.  This debate has informed me a great deal and we need to have more debates on the issue which is not black and white.  There are definite views on either side which are passionately held, but each side is acting in the interests of the patient.</P>
        <P>I am glad that we have come to an arrangement and I hope that when the Government produces additional legislation, this issue will form a major part of it.  The views expressed will be taken into account and we will produce a Bill which will be rights-based and driven very much by our human rights obligations in regard to mental health issues.  As I said yesterday, I still maintain there is very little between us on the subject.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It should have been stated it would replace section 3 with a new section providing for a different Title.  The explanation that should be offered to the House is that the words &ldquo;involuntary procedures&rdquo; in the current Title of the Bill do not actually appear in the Bill. It is more correct that it simply be referred to as the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill, as part of the series of mental health Bills. Therefore, there would be a collective citation as well.  We have included the more correct citation of the Bill.  I think Senator Boyle accepts the different wording of the Title.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the mover of the Bill I thank the House and Members for their co-operation.  As this is probably our last business in the Seanad before the election, it is important that we have passed a Private Members&rsquo; Bill and the House has been seen to act independently because questions about the future of the House will form the debate that centres around it.  I am especially pleased that the House has co-operated on this important area on which their is valid public concern.  It is the second such Private Members&rsquo; Bill that I have had the opportunity of having passed in the House and I take some pride in that.  There have been three such Bills in this Seanad.  When measured against the normal parliamentary output of any chamber in any developed democracy that is something in which we can take collective pride.  As we move forward in the future I thank those who have contributed not only to this Bill but to the life of the Seanad, the staff, the Cathaoirleach, representatives of the Government and successive Governments in this House.  I hope when a Seanad reconvenes it will take value from the experience of not only this Seanad but the previous 22.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the passage of this Bill which is important legislation.  I commend Senator Boyle and former Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca for promoting it.  Like Senator Boyle I have two Private Members&rsquo; Bills before the House, one on FGM and the other on climate change.  I very much hope that versions of those Bills will be passed by the Government.  It is a strength of the Seanad that we have the capacity to debate and pass this type of legislation in an environment that is conducive to the type of co-operation we have seen today where we have all agreed on the need to pass the legislation in a conciliatory and co-operative way.  I thank the Minister of State and her staff for their work on this Bill.  I thank also the staff of the Seanad and you, a Chathaoirligh, for your courtesy in dealing with us on the Bill.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I take the opportunity to welcome the Minister of State and wish her well.  The Bill is a very significant achievement for the Green Party.  The Green Party, particularly Senator Boyle and the former Senator de B&uacute;rca, deserve commendation for bringing this issue to the fore, and the Labour Party for its amendment.  I listened carefully to the debate and contributed on a previous occasion when the matter came before the House.  This is a difficult issue to get right.  There are intersecting issues of human dignity, patient autonomy and the whole question of the duty of care of medical professionals and what precise protections they enjoy as they seek to exercise their duty of care.  Progress has been made with the amendment that has been accepted by the Green Party.  It is an issue on which I hope there will be further debate in the other House.  It is an important issue.  There are people who are personally concerned by the issues we have discussed.  There has been goodwill on both sides of the various arguments made.  People are united around the desire to do the right thing by vulnerable people.  Certainly progress has been made in the acceptance of the principle that people cannot be treated against their express wishes.  There are other issues that remain for further careful consideration.  I heard the Minister of State make similar comments to those made by her predecessor, the then Minister of State, John Moloney, that we have to look carefully at <Col N="708"/>this issue as it is not an easy one to get right.  As long as there is goodwill and a genuine desire on the part of Government to do right by the people involved, I hope we will arrive at solutions that honour human dignity while allowing medical professionals to do the work they have to do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I pay tribute to all who contributed to the Bill.  The debate reflected the strong cross-party dimension that has always been evident in this Chamber on issues such as mental health, disabilities or child protection.  Given that mental health and disabilities do not get much of the spotlight, it is fitting that the last piece of business in this Seanad was on mental health.  I thank the Minister of State and her staff and all the staff of the Chamber.</P>
        <P>An essential plank to what we are all trying to achieve when it comes to very vulnerable people is the bringing forward of mental capacity legislation.  Significant work has been done in that area in recent years and I ask the Minister of State to make it a priority.  I welcome her comments last night on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I congratulate Senator Boyle on having this legislation passed by the Seanad.  It now goes to the other House and, I hope, during the course of the next few months the Minister of State and her colleagues in government will reflect deeply on this legislation.  We send forth to the other House a strong message as to how the legislation should proceed and the strong view that it is not only appropriate but humane, balanced and fair.  It was interesting to listen to the Minister of State yesterday when she spoke about the possible introduction, hopefully in the near future, of mental capacity legislation.  That whole area will be of significant importance in the life of the next Government.  This is a mental health Bill.  It is interesting that Deputy Lynch is the Minister of State with responsibility in this area because when she gets up every morning in city of Cork and looks across the brow of the hill she can see the old Cork mental hospital.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">During the preliminary debate yesterday I spoke about the film &ldquo;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest&rdquo;.  In the city and county of Cork when people think of mental health they think of St. Anne&rsquo;s and Our Lady&rsquo;s hospitals.  We want the future of mental health care to be a million miles removed from that sad era of a different type of care and analysis of mental health and mental capacity.  I hope this legislation is part of the changing trends and attitudes.  I strongly commend Senator Boyle for bringing the legislation before the House.  In the long-standing tradition of the Seanad it has been debated in a balanced, fair and political &mdash; with a small &ldquo;p&rdquo; &mdash; way.  I wish the Minister of State well as she reflects on the legislation and presumably brings forward important mental health legislation during the lifetime of the new Government.  I congratulate Senator Boyle on having the Bill passed.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There is nothing better than the threat of abolition to focus minds.  That applies very much to the Seanad and the Green Party.  It is appropriate that probably the last legislation to go through the House is Green Party legislation. I commend Senator Boyle on his huge contribution as Deputy Leader to the House and bringing the Bill forward. There are many others I wish to congratulate.  Senator Cassidy who is sitting beside Senator Boyle made a great contribution as did those on the other side.  I very much welcome the comments of the Minister of State in respect of this House but particularly her approach to rights-based legislation and always putting the patient first.  If that is the approach the Minister of State is going to take we are in safe hands.  Politics much change.  We have to put aside the adversarial approach.  We have a very strong Government in place.  It is a time for the country to heal itself and work together for the betterment of the people.  If the Minister of State&rsquo;s approach, a <Col N="709"/>rights-based and a people focused approach, is the approach of the Government it will be a very successful time for this country.</P>
      
        <P>I also thank everybody else who contributed to the considerable success of my time here in the Seanad.  If this is the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s last day sitting in the Chair, praise has been heaped upon him and it is well deserved.  It can be looked upon as a great time in the history of this country and I hope it is looked upon as a time of new beginning, not of abolition.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I congratulate the Green Party and Senator Boyle, with whom I worked so well in the past four years as Deputy Leader for bringing this Private Members&rsquo; Bill before the House and acknowledge the responsible way in which the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, the Independents and  Fianna F&aacute;il have worked in unison to do the right thing on this legislation.  I do not want the new Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to believe that this will always be the case when she comes back to the House in the 24th Seanad, but it is something on which everyone feels they are making an immense contribution to help those who cannot help themselves.  It typifies what the Seanad is about, what it can do and the changes it can commence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish all colleagues who are standing for the election well.  I thank all those who are not standing for re-election.  Some colleagues have been here a long time.  Senator Ellis has spent 33 years in the Oireachtas, while Senator O&rsquo;Brien has spent almost 22 years here.  These are considerable lengths of time, the prime of careers of individuals who have made an immense contribution to the democratic system, the community and the public service in general.  I acknowledge and respect that.</P>
        <P>I wish the Cathaoirleach well.  He has been impartial and we have worked with him for the past 14 years.  The Seanad has been enhanced by his membership and stewardship and I join everyone here today in acknowledging that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the efficient staff, from Ms Deirdre Lane, Clerk of the Seanad, to Ms Jody Blake, the Clerk Assistant, the ushers, the Captain of the Guard, Mr. John Flaherty, who has been a great help and a great friend to me personally in my membership of the House, the Superintendent and all the staff in every part of the House who help and assist us on a daily basis.  It certainly has meant a great deal and has helped us considerably.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope that Seanad &Eacute;ireann will survive, succeed and be significantly reformed.  I believe in accountability, particularly to the taxpayer, and in being the protector of the taxpayer.  With the general election over the people have given a 55% mandate for change to a new Government.  I wished it well yesterday, as I wish well the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, who was here today as its representative.  I did not get an opportunity to congratulate her, the former Leader of the Opposition, whose former seat I am now in.  I wholeheartedly congratulate her.  How proud we are of her being appointed to the Cabinet, coming directly from the Seanad in her position as Leader of the Opposition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Today&rsquo;s business exemplifies to the people of Ireland the good Seanad &Eacute;ireann is doing.  I certainly hope, with the wishes of the electorate, to be re-elected and be back here.  If I am not, it was the highlight of my career being a Member of this House. Beidh l&aacute; eile.</P>

	<P>Unfortunately days like this on which the work is done on an all-party basis are all too rare in the Seanad and much work that deserves a great deal of attention is not given enough attention.  There have been a few occasions during the lifetime of this Seanad when we all worked together to the advancement of good, rights-based legislation.  I would like to think that in the next Seanad it will be the way work is done on a regular rather than a rare basis.</P><Col N="710"/>
        <P>I commend the Green Party for the work it has done.  Rather than thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, I wish her well.  The path she laid out yesterday for what she proposes to do in her area of responsibility bodes well for it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Cathaoirleach as he is retiring.  I hate the sound of valedictory speeches. I certainly hope I am not making mine here, but I wish him well and thank the staff for their time in the 23rd Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was a little confused when I came in today.  It is still the 23rd Seanad and I cannot understand why all of my colleagues have swapped sides.  They are doing the House a disservice by deciding that, because an election took place in the other House, the consequences of it mean they should transform themselves here.  I refuse point blank to swap sides because this is the side on which I was allocated my seat and I shall remain here for the lifetime, and the dying moments, of the 23rd Seanad.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It may or may not be the last day as I do not know what the future holds.  On my own behalf, as I did not do it earlier, I congratulate Senator Cummins on his appointment as Leader of the House, and Senator Coghlan on his appointment as Government Whip.  I thank Senator Burke, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, for his help and co-operation and outstanding work for me here, and the many other Members who presided in the Chair to help me.  I thank the Captain and the ushers for their help and co-operation in the House.  I thank Senator Cassidy, the Leader for most of the time, and Senators Wilson and Glynn, the Whip and Deputy Whip, respectively, and wish them well for the future.  I thank the staff of Ms Lane and Ms Blake who have shown professionalism and expertise of a high order.  I wish the best of luck to Senators standing for election and also to Members of the House who are not standing, and wish them well in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I had my differences with Members from time to time but I always tried to uphold the rules of the House to the best of my ability.  I wish this House well in the future.  Whatever the changes proposed for Seanad &Eacute;ireann, they should be carefully considered and not made lightly.  From my experience of almost 14 years in this House, I have found Seanad &Eacute;ireann to be exemplary in the manner in which it dealt with all legislation.  Unfortunately, my regret on occasions was that some really outstanding contributions on legislation, and outstanding efforts made by Members of this House in going in depth through legislation to do what was best for the legislation and the country, were not reflected in the media.  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, well for the future.  I sincerely thank the recording staff and those who keep every word on the record for the future, and wish them well.</P>
