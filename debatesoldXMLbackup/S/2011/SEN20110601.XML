	<P>I have received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify if the HSE will address, as a matter of urgency, the serious lack of community health doctors in County Galway which is putting the health of children at risk.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Terry Leyden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the progress made on the Government&rsquo;s proposed wording for a referendum on the protection of children and his views on the proposal for a constitutional amendment to strengthen children&rsquo;s rights as outlined in the final report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children of February 2010.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Marine and Food to provide adequate compensation for farmers whose grazing lands and agricultural fencing were destroyed during the recent gorse fires which took place across several countries, including Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P Just="Left">For the information of Members of the House, the Seanad was up and running in four weeks, only four days after the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees were announced.  This compares with eight weeks in 2002 and seven weeks in 2007.  It is a major improvement on previous years and I hope we can make many improvements to the way we do our business in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
        <P>I propose that the Seanad will sit until 23 July or, more than likely, to 30 July and return on 14 September, approximately.  This is a significant reduction in the holiday period compared with previous years.  There is a need for further improvement in the years ahead.</P><Col N="34"/>
        <P>The Seanad will sit on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of each week and on Friday where necessary.  It is my intention to notify the House in advance of legislation and reports so that the House can debate them a number of weeks beforehand.  When Members were in opposition, they requested a number of times that this be the case.  I intend to give Senators more time for precise, researched, objective and intelligent contributions on debates.  This opportunity will be welcomed by all Members.  It may not always be possible to give notice of legislation weeks in advance, but we on this side of the House will strive to do so where possible.</P>
        <P>Senators can see that a number of Bills will be restored to the Order Paper, one of which will be debated tomorrow, namely, the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill 2011.  This Bill is similar to that which Senator Bacik introduced in the House some time ago.  It is appropriate that the legislation in question should commence its journey through the Houses of the Oireachtas in this Chamber.  Other legislation which will be debated in the coming weeks includes the Finance (No. 2) Bill, the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2011, the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill &mdash; which must be signed by the President by 30 June &mdash; the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill and a number of Bills dealing with the EU-IMF programme and certain financial matters.</P>
        <P>A number of reports have been published by various agencies in recent times.  I intend to make time available for debates relating to some of these reports in the coming weeks.  Senator van Turnhout has requested a debate on the fourth report of the special rapporteur on child protection and I intend to make time available for that next week.  I also hope to make time available for debates on the report of the independent review of employment regulation orders and the report of the inspector of prisons in the coming weeks.  The Seanad comprises people who possess knowledge of and practical experience in a wide range of areas.  I look forward to hearing excellent contributions from all Members in the coming months.</P>
        <P>Reports on Seanad reform deal predominantly with how the House is elected.  I want to reform the House but I have no monopoly on wisdom with regard to how we should do our business or how we might improve the way in which we operate.  I have an open mind on the issue and I would welcome suggestions from Members on all sides.  My door will always be open in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I suggest that bringing in people from outside, such as European Commissioners, to address the House and take questions would be a good development.  Matters such as this will obviously have to be discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  However, it is an issue in respect of which I also have an open mind.</P>
        <P>I hope to circulate the rota for Private Members&rsquo; time in the coming week.  I can confirm that it will be Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; time next week.  When all the groupings have been finalised, I will be in a position to allocate the other slots.  I understand that the Independents nominated by the Taoiseach intend to form a group of their own.  I welcome this move because it will afford these individuals designated speaking slots and enable them to make a greater contribution to the House.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, and No. 10, motion No. 1.  We will deal with No. 1, the election of a Leas-Chathaoirleach, in 15 minutes.  Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive &mdash; which involve the restoration to the Order Paper of the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill 2011, the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008, the Coroners Bill 2007, the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (Amendment) Bill 2011 and the Privacy Bill 2006 &mdash; will be taken without debate.  No. 7 will be taken no later <Col N="35"/>than 4.15 p.m. and conclude at 5 p.m.  Spokespersons may speak for five minutes, with the Minister to reply not later than 4.55 p.m.  No. 10, motion No. 1, which relates to the tourism sector, will be taken from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. as normal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>When I spoke during last week&rsquo;s sitting, I was not aware that Senators Cummins, Bacik and Paul Coghlan had formally been elected as Leader, Deputy Leader and Government Whip, respectively.  I wish to place on the record my congratulations to them.  Senator Cummins will be obliged to grow eyes in the back of his head if some of the comments made by certain Members on the Government side at the weekend are anything to go by.  However, that is a matter for another day.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Leader has indicated that the Seanad will sit on additional days.  I suggest that the House should at least sit until 30 July.  The Leader can take it that I and other Fianna F&aacute;il Members intend to introduce a number of relevant and constructive items of legislation in the House prior to the end of this session.</P>
        <P>As a new Member of the House, I welcome the comments that have been made in respect of reform.  As a number of Senators mentioned last week, it is not just this House which needs to be reformed.  I served in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and I am aware that it also requires reform.  I remind all Senators of our individual responsibilities to ensure this House is and is seen to be relevant to the people and can do the business for them.  This Seanad, with the diversity and broad range of experience its membership from all sectors in society has, can be the best so far.</P>
        <P>Of course it is right that Members raise concerns.  However, change does not occur overnight in any walk of life, be it in the private or public sector.  It is a great game played slowly.  We have to be careful about what we do.  We must examine our procedures to see how the Seanad can be reformed.  This side of the House will be proposing innovative reforms such as that mentioned by the Leader earlier of inviting outside experts and European commissioners to the Chamber.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the Leader&rsquo;s proposal to extend the number of sitting days.  I believe the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday sittings are crucial.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Senators will be asking for certain Friday sittings too.  It is no harm as we are here to do a job and must be serious about it.</P>
        <P>The Leader referred to various reports including ones on child protection and employment regulation.  The Seanad must discuss the programme for Government.  In the interim between the Seanad elections, the 23rd Seanad debated the programme for one day.  Many new Senators have been elected since then.  The House deserves the opportunity to have a proper and meaningful debate on the programme.  Will the Leader consider scheduling such a debate?</P>
        <P>In the 23rd  Seanad I raised the crucial report of the review group on State assets and liabilities.  The Seanad&rsquo;s views on which State assets will be sold or which will not must be taken into account.  Other matters such as how the Seanad can represent the Irish abroad must also be debated.</P>
        <P>The Leader will find this side of the House to be robust in opposition and debate.  I urge him to ensure the House sits until 30 July and not just for the sake of it.  There is real business to be done.  This is an open forum in which every Senator must be able to raise issues and matters which they believe are important.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader clarify the position on the household management charge announced yesterday by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government?  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade this afternoon claimed the charge will not be in place and any charge on water metering will only come in on the basis of the metering being completed.  Will the Leader clarify the Government&rsquo;s position on this?</P><Col N="36"/>
        <P>Last night, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, spoke on RTE about the future of the fair deal scheme.  This is a concern for all of us.  Thousands of families cannot access the scheme.  The Minister is holding a review of the scheme, which we welcome, and is set to be completed by Friday.  He will then make a statement on the matter on Monday.  This will be the most crucial issue of how the elderly are cared for.  Will the Leader arrange for a debate with the Minister for Health and Children on the operation of the fair deal scheme as soon as possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the election of Senator Maurice Cummins as Leader of the House and look forward to working with him and Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien as Leader of the Opposition.  I also welcome the announcement of a new configuration of groups in the House which will be conducive to the carrying on of effective, coherent and well-informed debate in the House.  I welcome the Leader&rsquo;s announcement that procedures will be reformed.  We need to see transparency and clarity around procedure.  There must be advance notice, where possible, of upcoming debates and legislation.  We always sought this when we were on the other side of the House but were not always successful in achieving it.  I hope this House will be able to conduct its business in a more efficient and effective manner.  It is unfortunate that last week&rsquo;s debate was somewhat incoherent and lengthy.  It is fair to say many speakers on the opposite side were not sufficiently concise.  It is important procedures are put in place to ensure as many speakers as possible can contribute.  We need to ensure the new Senators who have much to say and a great deal of expertise to bring to bear on debates will have an opportunity to contribute and that contributions are concise, thus enabling the House to be more effective in the manner in which it conducts its business.  </P>
        <P>I welcome the announcement that the House is to hold debates on a number of reports.  I also welcome the announcement this week by the Government of two initiatives to progress women&rsquo;s rights, which include the electoral (amendment) (political funding) Bill which will set quotas in terms of minimum numbers of candidates of either gender to be achieved by political parties, something for which I campaigned during the previous Seanad.  It is hoped the Bill will come before the Seanad before it rises at the end of July.  I welcome the fact that the first Bill to be debated in the House tomorrow is the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill 2011, the principle of which received cross-party support in the House last year when introduced by me on behalf of the Labour Party.  It is welcome that the legislation will be introduced and debated in the House tomorrow.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to provide time before the end of this session for a debate on white collar crime.  The Director of Public Prosecutions raised this issue over the weekend in his speech to the prosecutors&rsquo; conference.  He made the point that public concern and anger at the delay in prosecuting individuals as a result of failures in the banking system needed to be addressed.  There is immense public anger in that regard.  As legislators, we must examine how we can reform the law to ensure people will be brought to justice for engaging in white collar crime.  There are plenty of provisions in the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 which could be used to prosecute those whom it appears have committed fraud offences.  As such, it is not necessary to go into the complex corporate offences code in this regard.  The matter could be considered in the context of a debate on white collar crime.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I measc buanna an tSeanaid t&aacute; an deis at&aacute; aige c&uacute;rsa&iacute; reatha a phl&eacute;, go h&aacute;irithe nuair a bh&iacute;onn fadhbanna ollmh&oacute;ra os comhair an phobail.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&iacute;-th&aacute;bhachtach go dtap&oacute;dh an Seanad an deis chun na c&uacute;rsa&iacute; sin a chur faoi chaibidil.  N&iacute; fi&uacute; &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh muna bhfuil saineolas agus cruinneas le cloiste&aacute;il freisin.</P><Col N="37"/>
        <P>One way in which the Seanad can make a difference is through its ability to comment on important and pressing current issues.  However, we will only really take advantage of that opportunity and serve the public well if wisdom is reflected in our contributions.  I support Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s call for a debate on the programme for Government and it is important such a debate should take place.  It would be impossible to ignore the good work done by &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; as shown in the past couple of nights in highlighting not alone the human cost of cutbacks but also their hidden human cost.  These programmes, in particular the programme shown on Monday night, drew public attention to the suffering of so many good people in silence.</P>
        <P>It will be difficult for Members of this House and the D&aacute;il to debate these issues in the coming months knowing the gruesome trial we face in trying to close the deficit between what is taken in and what is paid out.  It is not enough for the Minister to say it is a matter of prioritisation.  Members of the public, in particular those at the centre of the documentaries, deserve to be told by the Government at the earliest possible opportunity the full menu of options in terms of cutbacks to be made and how precisely it proposes to prioritise in order that the needs of some of the most vulnerable in our society will not be pushed aside.  It is not acceptable for the public to have to depend on the public broadcaster to highlight such suffering.  We need to be up close with the details of the cutbacks, commenting on them and making recommendations to the Executive about what is appropriate and what is not.</P>
        <P>Members of the Government and the Minister who now has responsibility for health made great play when in Opposition of the fact that the previous Government used the operational independence of the Health Service Executive as a way of dumping and quarantining problems that needed to be dealt with.  It is right and proper that the Minister would seek to put order on the HSE&rsquo;s house but he is now the person in charge.  He will need to come to this House and to the D&aacute;il to tell us in advance what will be done, as part of the necessary prioritisation.  We must look forward to a moment when we are not dependent on RTE to bring the hidden suffering of so many good people to light.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I encourage the Government to resist taking the opportunity to be in government and opposition at the same time.  In recent days we saw a succession of events when Ministers announced proposals and Members from the other party in Government snapped at the ankles of the Minister.  That strikes me as playing the PR game.  The people who will be affected by, for example, changes in registered employment agreements or the introduction of water charges deserve that the Cabinet should settle on a line before we hear about changes.  The next people to be told should be Members of the Oireachtas.  Let us have an end to announcements being made in the media before they are heard of in the Oireachtas.  If we are serious about political reform we will maximise the potential of the Oireachtas.  One way that will happen is by the Executive outlining plans that have been agreed in Cabinet and sharing them with the Oireachtas at an early date.  The Government can then have its press conference.  People will have no time for the D&aacute;il and Seanad if it is widely known that we are the last to hear about important developments in public policy.</P>
        <P>I welcome the promise of a new group in the House.  I encourage them to be as independently minded as the university Senators will be.  If they are not, we will want to know why.  I encourage them in their deliberations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend my congratulations to the Leader and deputy leader of the House, the Leader of the Opposition and whoever else needs to be congratulated.</P>
        <P>I confirm that the Independent Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees will form a group.  We come from very different civil society groups and have different representations.  Our diversity is our strength.  We wish to maximise the opportunity that has been presented to us.  We all have issues that <Col N="38"/>are close to our hearts.  However, I can guarantee that we will knock on the Leader&rsquo;s door to discuss Seanad reform.</P>
        <P>I thank my colleagues in the group for putting their trust in me to lead the group for the time being.  I will do my best.  We have people of excellent calibre in the group and we will use our time wisely.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I thank the Leader for his agreement to a debate on an important report by Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, who is a special rapporteur on child protection.  Too often, reports come and go and we wait for television programmes like &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; to expose the horrors.  I recommend to colleagues that they read this report before we debate it next week.  I hope we do not use the time allotted for the debate simply to complain but to discuss the solutions required and the legislation and policies needed to achieve them.  These solutions include the provision of a 24 hour out-of-hours social work service, a range of reforms for children with mental health difficulties and reform of elements of the criminal justice system, including the introduction of legislation to disclose confidential records.</P>
      
        <P>There is a long overdue need to put the Children First guidelines on a statutory basis, which would ensure there is a duty to report concerns of neglect or abuse of a child, a point which was very much highlighted this morning at the launch by the Ombudsman for Children of her annual report.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity that will be presented to us tomorrow to discuss the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill 2011.  This is an issue that is very close to my heart and I have seen the horrific ramifications the practice can have for women.  I hope we will be able to strengthen the Bill and help it move through the Houses as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Like previous speakers, I commend the appointments which have been made.  At our last meeting, I commended my colleague from Waterford, Senator Maurice Cummins, on his appointment and I take this opportunity to do so again.  I welcome his proposals in regard to the extension of how long we sit.  I agree with previous speakers that we should sit until 30 July and return earlier in September.  I also welcome the longer sitting periods and the fact we may sit on Fridays on occasion.</P>
        <P>I welcome the formation of the second Independent group.  I made the point at our last meeting that it was a very good choice by the Taoiseach to ensure a broad range of groups is represented.  Their independence in this Chamber is very positive and I welcome it.</P>
        <P>The Cathaoirleach and the Leader of the House should take note while Sinn F&eacute;in may not have the magic number of five to form a group, I hope there would be some form of informal recognition of Sinn F&eacute;in as a group.  In the spirit of fairness and reform, this may be something for the Chair and the Leader to consider.</P>
        <P>In respect of Seanad reform, it is important that this House leads and is central to the debate.  We all accept there will be a referendum and we must be part of whatever proposals are put to the people.  At the first meeting of the 24th Seanad, the point was made that those of us who believe in a second Chamber need to work constructively together, where there is common ground.  I hope this opportunity will be afforded to us.  I welcome the suggestion we would invite outside organisations to the Chamber.  There are many advocacy organisations which advocate for political reform, not just in regard to the Seanad but also in regard to local government, the D&aacute;il, a new constitution and many other issues and ideas.</P><Col N="39"/>
        <P>It is welcome that there will be a discussion on the report on the joint labour committees, JLCs.  I remind the House that this was an independent report.  Aside from just having a debate or discussion on those proposals, new and different proposals have been put forward by the Minister which deviate from the scope of that report.  If we are to have a discussion, it must be wholesome and we must also discuss the Minister&rsquo;s proposals.  With regard to the timeframe for consultation, while the Minister has referred to a period of ten days, the trade unions and social partners are deeply unhappy with that consultation process.  If we are to discuss this report, we need to do so quickly if the Minister&rsquo;s consultation process is ten days.  I welcome the fact the Minister stated he wanted to hear the views of public representatives across the State, including Members of this House.</P>
        <P>A previous speaker referred to the report published today by the Ombudsman for Children, which is a critical and important piece of work.  I was taken by what the Ombudsman for Children said this morning about law makers taking into account the rights of children.  She cited the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act as an example of where, collectively, law makers failed to take into account the rights of children.  It would be important, in the spirit of bringing people to this House, to invite the Ombudsman for Children to the Chamber.  She made some telling points, and, if I can, I will read one quick paragraph from the report which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I support the call for the Minister for Health and Children to come to this Chamber because there are very many issues that need to be discussed, including the fair deal scheme.  There are issues affecting local and regional hospitals, people with diabetes and many others.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to see the Seanad working.  This morning I telephoned the Cathaoirleach and the Leader of the House to discuss a revolutionary, or radical, change in this House, namely, how we might invite people to come to the Chamber who would be accountable and answer questions.  I compliment the Leader for stating he will seek to have Standing Orders amended through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, to achieve that.  That is what I call progress.</P>
        <P>For that reason, and in the public interest, I raise the issue of NAMA and what precisely it is achieving.  I have learned that the business plans required by NAMA are completely unworkable, some being hundreds or thousands of pages long.  Some businesses are charging between &euro;40,000 to &euro;240,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="40"/>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall explain what I seek.  We need business to work and to be released.  NAMA was set up in order that credit would flow.  I ask the Leader to invite the chief executive officer of NAMA, Mr. Brendan McDonagh, to the House in order that we might ask questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no provision for that.  It is a matter for Senator Healy Eames to address through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but it is not on today&rsquo;s Order of Business.  Does the Senator seek to have a debate on NAMA?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek answers as to how NAMA is serving the public good.  I shall take the Leader&rsquo;s advice on whether we should first look to the Minister for Finance, but ultimately we should use the method he suggested today and invite persons to the House to answer direct questions.  In that way this House might be accountable to the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange an emergency debate on energy provision and security and ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, to come to the Chamber and make a statement on ongoing difficulties in a major project in the mid-west?  The Shannon LNG project, which is under the auspices of a multinational energy provider, the Hess Corporation, is well advanced.  Millions of euro have been spent in developing a site on the Shannon Estuary in north Kerry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter is more suited to the Adjournment debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps we might discuss it more immediately.  Our colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, has been proactive on this matter in the other House and we in this Chamber should act likewise.  This issue is very important for energy security and 500 jobs are at stake in the Kerry region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a lighter but not entirely jocose note, I am happy about the extended sittings of the Seanad and will be glad to continue until 15 August, if needs be, but it has come as a tremendous shock and is a matter of deep regret to me that the Leader proposes to bring us back in the third week of September which, as the entire world knows, is the week of the Listowel races, a most important event in the racing calendar and a major festival for the whole southwest.</P>

	<P>Arising from my nomination to contest the Seanad election, I request a debate on joint labour committee, JLC, rates, a very important issue that will have a significant effect on the lives of people in this country who are compelled to work at weekends and on Sundays.  This matter warrants an open debate.</P>
        <P>The Leader stated that the debate on the employment regulation order would be an opportune time to discuss this matter.  There is a timescale involved, given that only ten days remain and, therefore, I ask for the debate to be advanced as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Leader, Senator Cummins, not on his election on which I already congratulated him, but on the manner in which he speedily addressed the efficiency of this House.  He will have the support of all sides of the House in so doing.  There was a slight delay, but it was not caused by the Leader of the House or any of his officials, rather it was caused by the Taoiseach in his deliberations on his selection of nominees to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and it was worth the wait because we have such an unusually excellent group of people.  Today those Senators have taken an historic step.  Never in the history of the Seanad have the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees formed a group and elected a leader.  I sincerely congratulate <Col N="41"/>Senator Jillian van Turnhout on her election.  She has a fine record in protecting the rights of children.  In that regard, I join my colleagues from Sinn F&eacute;in in asking for a serious debate on the report of the Ombudsman for Children in which she makes some serious remarks, including that children are still being denied the right to be heard, that they still have an impossible task in some instances of realising their rights and that they are being denied basic essential services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator knows he can make those points during the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am calling for a debate to be held on the matter.  I bow to the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling.  I should have put the question mark at the start of the sentence.  As a grammarian, I am used to putting it at the end of a sentence.</P>
        <P>Can we have a debate that will also include information gleaned by all of us so painfully from the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; report on carers?  We saw clearly the tragic consequences not just for adults but for children too, some of whom are in a terrible situation because funding has been withdrawn from the Jack and Jill Foundation which was supporting them.  I am pleased that among the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees is one of the leaders of the foundation, Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, and I am sure the name will be correctly pronounced in this Seanad, although it was mistaken in the last.</P>
        <P>It is particularly important that we have this debate and I was pleased to hear a distinguished commentator from <i>The Irish Times</i> remark on my consistent record in this House on the protection of children, by which I stand.  I want it to be known publicly that I will not be deterred and will continue to protect the rights of the vulnerable, particularly children.  I invite anyone who questions this to look at the record of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, on which I stand proudly.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation being presented to us, again in a speedy and efficient manner, but what is the ultimate fate of Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill which was one of the most important to be put before this House?  I understand it is in suspended animation in the other House and hope it will soon be passed into law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know in my heart, as Mr. de Valera might have said, that the Independent Senators feel the same as I do and that we will play a constructive role.  We are engaged in our own debate on the division of responsibilities within the group.  As the Cathaoirleach is aware, under the regime of former Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole, we did not have a leader, but we are opening up these issues.  In this House we should make sure we are constructive, not confrontational.  If there is to be sniping, partisanship and mud-slinging which sometimes form part of political life, let it take place in the other House; let us make sure the atmosphere in this House is calm.</P>
        <P>I will support strongly the rights of the Sinn F&eacute;in group to be heard as a small group.  It started with one Member; it now has three and those Members should not be downgraded in their privilege to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can raise that matter with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Also, Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Bill is on the D&aacute;il Order Paper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I was asking for information from the Leader on its progress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the initial statement of the Leader on his plans for &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; reform.  I fully support the idea of European Commissioners and MEPs addressing the House, as was the case a number of years ago.  The Leader should take the obvious step of ensuring that each Minister will come before the House at least once every five or six weeks, as they do before the other House, to account for their stewardship of their Departments and to take questions, queries and suggestions from Members of this House.  I expect the Government to respond favourably to such a request.  I made it a number of times when on the other <Col N="42"/>side of the House but I will not change my view of politics simply because of musical chairs.  Each Minister should come before the House and this should start in the near future.</P>
        <P>In this context, the first Minister who should appear before Members at the earliest possible date is the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  While the meeting should be on a wide variety of issues, Members must take note that today&rsquo;s unemployment figure of almost 450,000 people demonstrates clearly the scale of the problem facing the Government and this House.  Job creation also must be at the core of this House&rsquo;s agenda and many of its Members have ideas they would like to present to the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  He has the ability and range of thought to respond favourably to them.</P>
        <P>Action is what is needed from Ministers, not the so-called consensus that obtained over the past ten or 15 years in which everyone was permanently in meetings talking about solutions but not doing anything.  I look forward to action by the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  He should appear before this House within the next week or two to discuss his plans to put Ireland back to work.  Every problem is secondary to this.  Problems cannot be solved in the areas of health, education and social welfare unless people are put back to work.  Will the Leader facilitate an urgent debate on unemployment and job creation, with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, at the earliest date possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the Jack and Jill Foundation, for the benefit of those Members who were not present at the time, it was referred to as the &ldquo;Jekyll and Hyde foundation&rdquo; by a former Member of the House.  Moreover, despite being corrected, he kept referring to it as the &ldquo;Jekyll and Hyde foundation&rdquo;.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>It was for the purpose of clarity.  As I did not get an opportunity on the last day on which the House sat, I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his appointment.  In addition, I congratulate my constituency colleague, Senator Paul Coghlan, on being made Whip &mdash; a more affable man one could not meet.  I also congratulate Senator Cummins on being made Leader of the House.  He discussed the issue of Seanad reform and I suppose the system failed the people.  Had the Government, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad been working as they should, Ireland and its citizens would not find themselves in the present position, namely, in a dark place in which one can envisage a return to unemployment and emigration.  One can envisage a return to the past in which citizens see a future not in Ireland but in another land.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the future of this House is in doubt because people believe it is not fit for purpose.  Then again, neither is the D&aacute;il or the Government.  The entire system failed the people and if the forthcoming referendum contains only one substantial proposal, namely, the abolition of the Seanad, that will not constitute reform.  That will not prevent the type of catastrophe in which we now find ourselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Senator have a question for the Leader or is he seeking a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Leader brought up the issue of Seanad reform, I ask whether such reform will be comprehensive and will it simply be about Seanad reform?  When the issue is being debated in this Chamber, will the debate be about legislators legislating to pre-empt disaster, rather than talking about it after the event?  In essence, that will be the benchmark.  Reform of this House, the D&aacute;il and the Government will be benchmarked against a single issue, namely, whether it will prevent the kind of catastrophe in which we find ourselves at <Col N="43"/>present.  Unless it does so, it does not constitute reform of these Houses but merely a papering over of the cracks.  I commend the Taoiseach on his nominees.  It is welcome that it took him four weeks to nominate them, because although choosing from 4.42 million people is no easy task, he appears to have found some extraordinary individuals who undoubtedly will make an enormous contribution to this House.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s newspapers mentioned a report from the World Health Organization on mobile telephones and the danger to children.  In the last Seanad, Members from this side of the House published a Mobile Phone Radiation Warning Bill, which proposed that a warning label be put on all mobile telephones.  I note the European Environmental Agency proposed the precautionary principle and that it took 47 years to prove that tobacco caused cancer.  Moreover, a labour court in Italy gave compensation to an employee because he was using mobile telephones as part of his work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is the Senator seeking a debate on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  In addition, Lloyd&rsquo;s of London refuses to insure any mobile telephone company because it is unable to quantify the risk.  I hope Members opposite, some of whom do not see this House as being fit for purpose, might consider supporting this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I ask the Cathaoirleach to refer my proposals to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I wish to make a few observations on my first day speaking in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  As a Senator who was quoted in the newspapers about the possible abolition of the Seanad, I do not think anyone sitting here today wants to see it abolished and if anyone wishes to abolish it, he or she can make their views known.</P>
        <P>In August when we will have some time on our hands, I suggest Members read a book entitled <i>Lustrum</i> by Robert Harris in which he refers to the emperor, Cicero, who introduced a Bill to curb the travelling expenses of senators throughout the Roman Empire.  Nothing has really changed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>He came to a bad end.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the Roman Empire which was slightly bigger than Donegal.  Perhaps we could learn from Cicero when he wrote that the art of political debating was to keep speeches short, remember names, tell a few jokes, put on a show, but above all, render an issue, however complicated, into a story anyone could grasp.  This is advice from 53 BC and perhaps we could all learn from Cicero today.  I advise Members to read <i>Lustrum</i> during their August break when they have a few spare hours.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Senator finished?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not finished at all.  My proposal, which I would ask the Leader to refer to the CPP, is that this Seanad should meet outside Dublin on perhaps one occasion every year.  Article 15.1.3&deg; of the Constitution states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Houses of the Oireachtas shall sit in or near the City of Dublin or in such other place as they may from time to time determine.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I ask that the House give this some consideration.  I am sure my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, would not disagree that it should be held in County Donegal for the first time and after that it could sit in Galway, Cork and Kerry, to name but a few counties.  The people have <Col N="44"/>to see the Seanad is active and not just in Dublin.  Many of the new Senators are from rural Ireland and they would like to see the Seanad sitting one day a year in another place, perhaps in the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s own county of Mayo which I am sure would be second after County Donegal.  I would not object to that.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that my proposal be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for consideration.  It would be in the interest of all Senators to travel.  Some Senators may not have been in County Donegal in all their lives so I am inviting everyone to visit.  We will provide a suitable venue in which to host the Seanad and it will also be a tourism boost for Donegal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, it is important and in the kindest possible way to correct Senator Harte.  Cicero was not an emperor.  He occupied a much more exalted position.  He was a member of the Senate as well as an orator and an historian.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that when any of us refers to legislation being passed in the other House, we are told it is not our business.  I ask the Leader to draw to the attention of the Minister concerned the fact that the Daylight Saving Bill has passed Second Stage in the British House of Commons.  The reason I raise this matter is that it will be on Committee Stage in the next few weeks.  It proposes that Britain should join central European time which would give it an extra hour&rsquo;s daylight every evening.  The Cathaoirleach will know that I have been arguing this point for many years.  My argument is that we should be doing something about it.  I was contacted recently by people in the British House of Commons who told me that Northern Ireland is concerned that if it joins central European time, it will be operating in a different time zone from this State.  It is proposed that Britain will change over in the next couple of years on a trial basis, as happened in the years 1968 to 1971.</P>
        <P>I am a firm believer that there are many benefits in this country joining central European time and gaining an extra hour of daylight every evening of the year.  The number of road accidents would be reduced quite dramatically, as was the case during the trial period.  There would be an energy saving, something that is now more important than it was 30 years ago.  Along with the advantages to tourism, these are just some of the benefits to be had from joining central European time.  I raise this issue because if Britain determines to do so now we will be seen to be coming after it.  In the past I said we should be willing to leave the nursery even if nanny does not come with us.  We should claim that it is our intention to move and let it be seen that we are leading on this issue.  It would have so many benefits that the British would follow us.  I would like the Leader to call to the attention of the Minister that this change is likely to happen very shortly and we do not want to be seen to be following Britain.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Construction Contracts Bill which was passed by this House in March, it will go before the D&aacute;il.  It is the intention of the Government that it will pass and I look forward to making sure that happens during the coming months.</P>

        <P>I wanted to congratulate the Leader of the House and compliment him on the very businesslike intentions which he outlined for us here today.  It shows how well we intend to proceed in this House.  Many important items were touched on.  As I did not speak the last day I congratulate Senator Norris on his very thoughtful address and all the matters he touched on, which I have no doubt we will come to do.  He was most helpful to the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Leader&rsquo;s intentions, which he outlined today, are most helpful and can be coupled with Senator Bradford&rsquo;s comments on bringing Ministers before the House.  We should remind ourselves of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention that Ministers would be equally answerable to this House, as they are constitutionally obliged to be, as they are to the other House.  It is an important point to make.</P>
        <P>I, too, want to very much welcome the formation of the new independent grouping.  It will add greatly to the work of the House, as the Cathaoirleach and Leader mentioned.  I look forward to working with all Senators.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Leader on the very impressive presentation he made here today.  It does not come as any surprise because he is a man who has given excellent service to this House as a Senator in the past.</P>
        <P>I hope to have an issue debated in the House if time can be found.  It might even culminate in an agreed motion.  All reasonable people at the current time welcome the new, improved relations between Ireland and Britain.  It augurs exceptionally well for the future and something which happened recently has added to that.  We have had the report on the inquiry into the murder of Ms Rosemary Nelson.  It is a very harrowing report but it is good to be able to say that the family now regards itself as having been vindicated.</P>
        <P>However, there is another group of people which is currently in limbo, namely the families affected by the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  We have discussed them here in the past and they have been examined by a committee.  The Government has taken a position on the issue but I hope that, given the good relations which now exist between Ireland and Britain, we might be able to get out of the cul-de-sac on the issue.  The cul-de-sac seems to have resulted from the fact that we are not getting co-operation from Britain in regard to files.</P>
        <P>I will make a suggestion to the House and when there is a debate we might be able to get an agreed motion.  I believe it would be possible to have a joint, low profile inquiry on which Britain and Ireland would co-operate.  Senators who have met representatives of Justice for the <Col N="46"/>Forgotten will know the terrible agony endured by those affected by the bombings, some of whom are very old.</P>

	<P>I congratulate all those who have been elected to various positions, including the Leader, Senator Cummins, who has been a friend of mine for many years, although he has caused me to lose a great deal of money on various race tracks.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the proposed household management and water charges.  I concur with Senator Mullen&rsquo;s view on announcements being made before they have been fully endorsed by the Cabinet.  Decisions and announcements should be made following agreement by the Cabinet.  Members of the public are concerned and confused about the proposed charges.  While I accept that the country is tied in to certain commitments arising from the EU-IMF deal, there is a right and wrong approach to these issues.  The right approach would be to request the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the House to discuss the proposed charges and give Senators a clear understanding of what is proposed.</P>
        <P>On the Leader&rsquo;s comments on reform of the House, as someone who has been involved in local government for almost 25 years, I fully support the concept of inviting European Commissioners to appear before us.  However, it is equally important to invite the first and second tier of local government &mdash; town and county councillors &mdash; before the House to allow them to have an input.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

        <P>Local government, which has a strong place in the democratic system, does not receive much of a hearing.  In this regard, I thank the 880 councillors who elected 43 of the Senators present.  I also congratulate the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees and the six Senators elected by university graduates.  Local authority members are the forgotten electorate and practitioners of democracy in their own right.  No one referred to them last Wednesday or thus far today.  I thank them for putting up with Seanad candidates when we were on the road for six or eight weeks and engaging in the democratic process by electing us.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak for the first time in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and look forward to working closely with fellow Senators.  I have a long-standing interest in disability issues and received a nomination to run for the Seanad by Inclusion Ireland, the association for people with an intellectual disability.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the issues raised on the RTE &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme broadcast on Monday night, which reported on the silent suffering and lack of support services for carers of people with special needs.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an gCeannaire.  In particular, I welcome his commitment to bring some innovation to the business of the House.  While the idea of inviting European Commissioners to the House is a good one, we should go further.  The current economic challenges are the most pressing issue facing the country.  There are many eminent economists of international standing who could make a significant contribution to charting a way forward for us.  Unfortunately, however, we are being inundated with commentary by celebrity economists, many of whom are moonlighting from various universities when they appear on media programmes.  I am singularly unimpressed with some of the commentary emanating from them because it is not helping the economy and could be doing economic damage.</P>
        <P>While I support those who have called for a debate on joint labour committees, JLCs, I ask the Leader to consider framing it in the context of an overall debate on competitiveness.  I also ask that the Minister would come to the House to explain the reason certain employees are paid between &euro;3 and &euro;4 per hour more than their counterparts in Germany, our Supreme Court judges are paid more than &euro;100,000 per annum more than their counterparts in the United States and professors in Irish universities and consultants in Irish hospitals earn 50% more than their counterparts on the neighbouring island.</P>

	<P>I am asking the Leader to ensure they are included in a clear-cut debate.  The challenges facing us are of such magnitude that if we fail to address them properly, we will consign not only this generation of young people but the next generation to unemployment or emigration.  We must face up to these challenges and I ask the Leader to include them in a broader debate on competitiveness and specifically address them to the Minister in the interests of those who are unemployed.</P>

        <P>While I support Senator Moran&rsquo;s call for a debate on the issue of people with disabilities, I ask that the discussion be widened to include Ireland&rsquo;s failure to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I bring to the attention of Senators an article in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> which reports that Inclusion Ireland has highlighted the fact that increasing numbers of parents with mild disabilities are having their children removed from them by the State.  The organisation also pointed out that many parents in such circumstances would be capable of keeping their children if they were provided with appropriate supports by the State.  The House must be concerned about this issue, especially given that all available evidence shows that parents should be supported to help them be the first and primary carers of their children.  I ask, therefore, for the motion to be extended to include the wider issue of ratification of the UN convention</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to inform the House that I have published the Registration of Wills Bill 2011, which is the first Private Members&rsquo; Bill of the 24th Seanad.  I will be seeking support from the Leader of the House for Government time in which to have this measure debated in due course.  I want the Government to consider this matter, which was unanimously agreed by the previous Seanad.  We were in Government at the time and the Opposition parties were very supportive of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I also want an opportunity to brief colleagues on this measure, perhaps next week.  I draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is no system for the registration of wills in Ireland or, indeed, in most countries.  There are more than 2,000 solicitors&rsquo; offices and each one has its own method of registration, which sometimes can be very inefficient.  In fact, many wills have been lost or mislaid and thus people have been deprived of their inheritance rights.</P>

I encourage those who may have difficulties with how this House is run to gather their thoughts and put forward ideas for legislation to be introduced here.  It is a great opportunity for Senators to introduce legislation via Private Members&rsquo; Bills.</P>
        <P>I hope I will get the support of both sides of the House for the Registration of Wills Bill 2011.  I am anxious that new Members would have an opportunity to study the Bill.  I would like to brief them on the measure and hope they will also have an opportunity to table amendments to it.  I would be glad to consider such amendments, and accept them, with the agreement of the House.  I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me the time to announce this matter today.</P>

	<P>I welcome some of the younger people who have just arrived in the Visitors Gallery.  I am sure some of them may be Senators in time to come if we can ensure the future of the Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the risk of overburdening the Minister for Health and Children, I ask that he attend this House to discuss the future reconfiguration of hospitals.  There has been much discussion throughout the country about the way in which hospitals are being reconfigured.  We know that some small regional hospitals are concerned about their futures, not least Sligo General Hospital in my own area.  We have seen how the configuration of cancer services changed the system so that there are no centres of excellence above a line from Dublin to Galway.  When hospitals are reconfigured in future in the interests of delivering quality services and efficiency, <Col N="49"/>I do not want to see us ending up with an imbalance of hospitals and further arguments arising.  I therefore ask the Leader to request the Minister for Health and Children to attend the House for such a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Rather than having a broad, sweeping debate on health issues, which it could be, given the wide variety of important issues involved, perhaps we could break it down into sectors.  I am seeking a specific debate on the HSE budget, which is an issue I have raised many times before.  I am uncomfortable with the fact that the HSE, which is effectively a third party organisation, has control of more than half the country&rsquo;s tax take.  Given the new expertise available to the House and the diverse interests here, it would be important to have a debate specifically on HSE financing.</P>
        <P>I would also like to have a debate on where the national cancer control programme is working and where it is not.  There are gaping holes in service provision, particularly in the north west, as Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe pointed out.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to bring forward a series of debates on the difficulties faced by many families in dealing with mortgage arrears, high unemployment and the inevitability of higher interest rates in future.  As the Leader will know, in the previous Seanad many of us regularly referred to these matters and brought forward proposals to deal with them.  In this context and following Senator Leyden&rsquo;s lead, this side of the House intends to introduce another Private Members&rsquo; Bill &mdash; the enforcement of court orders (amendment) Bill.  It aims to give statutory protection to the primary family residence, effectively preventing the granting of court orders to repossess such a residence unless the court is satisfied that an independent assessment has been made of the existing ability to repay.  The court must also be satisfied that the original mortgage application and underwriting quality are assessed and that a range of alternatives is available, such as those brought forward by our group in the past and as now outlined in the code of conduct for the mortgage arrears resolution process.  The proposed Bill, if enacted, would put such matters on a statutory footing.  These issues had cross-party agreement in the last Seanad and I hope that the new configuration of the House, with two Independent groups and such a diverse array of backgrounds and expertise, will accept this Bill.  It would show the kind of leadership that will ensure the future of this House.</P>
        <P>On a humorous note, if the love bombing from Senator Norris continues, I am confident he will have his nomination for the Presidency by the end of the day.</P>

	<P>I congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh, on your elevation to high office.  I also congratulate my colleague Senator Maurice Cummins, on his appointment as Leader, which is well deserved.</P>
        <P>Can the Leader outline when the necessary legislative measures will be introduced to ensure the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities?  Like Senator Mary Moran, I was nominated by a disability body, People with Disabilities in Ireland, to run for the Seanad.  The issues raised in the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme last Monday night are of deep concern to everyone, especially carers and those suffering from various disabilities and mental health issues.</P>
        <P>The UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities is concerned with very important issues.  As a country, we should be pushing these matters to ensure the necessary legislative measures are in place.  As the only Member of the Oireachtas with a declared disability, I will be highlighting such matters with the Leader.  In addition, I will work hard to ensure this House reflects and espouses the rights of minorities.  I look forward to working with the Leader in this respect and would welcome his response to the matters I have raised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Leader of the House on his appointment and acknowledge his wish to reform the House and its workings.  In that way, the Seanad can be more effective and efficient in the way it conducts its business.  I welcome the example given by the Leader that members of the European Commission could attend the House to discuss issues of relevance to this country.  I respectfully suggest that we could extend an invitation to the Commissioners with responsibility for agriculture and fisheries to a debate on the future of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy, both of which are under review.  Agriculture is the current growth sector in the economy and is fuelling exports.  It is very important we secure the benefits that Europe is providing to that sector, so it would be timely to have such a debate, if possible before the summer recess, with either Commissioner.</P>
        <P>Ba mhaith liom aont&uacute; leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh i dtaca leis an Ghaeilge agus an cur i l&aacute;thair a d&eacute;anadh n&iacute;os luaithe inniu in &Oacute;st&aacute;n Buswells ag an eagra&iacute;ocht, Guth na Gaeltachta agus ag Conradh na Gaeilge.  Cuireadh i l&aacute;thair an strait&eacute;is at&aacute; acusan i dtaca le todhcha&iacute; na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta agus na molta&iacute; at&aacute; acu i dtaca le cur i bhfeidhm an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge.</P>
        <P>It is vital that the new Government addresses the issue of the Irish language both inside and outside Gaeltacht areas and that a clear strategy for the implementation of the 20-year strategy for the Irish language is adopted.  I call for a debate on that strategy and on the future of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The news emerging on the future of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is alarming to say the least given that the previous Government gave a commitment that its enterprise functions would be retained.  I hope clarification can be given at an early date that the Government agrees with the decision of the previous Government and that those functions can remain in place.  We should have a discussion on the Irish language.  No one party or individual in the country owns our language.  It pleased me greatly that in the previous Seanad and D&aacute;il all the political parties worked in unison to prepare the 20-year strategy for the Irish language.  I hope we can discuss that strategy and obtain an insight into the Government&rsquo;s thinking on the manner in which it will fund it over the next 20 years.  I hope we can have a debate on that issue next week or the week after given that it is very timely.  I appreciate the Leader will have pressing demands to have discussions on an array of topics but the Irish language is a vitally important aspect of the country&rsquo;s future, not least in terms of economic tourism in the cultural sense.  I hope we can have such a debate and I trust that the Leader will address that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is f&eacute;idir liom comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh le mo chara, Seanad&oacute;ir Cummins.  I did not have the opportunity to do so last week because, as a colleague said, we were awaiting the official confirmation.  I am delighted the Senator has taken up this role.  I also praise him for a presentation of considerable substance that he outlined to the House.</P>
        <P>I have a number of brief questions.  On the issue of Seanad reform, will the Leader consider at some point providing Government time to allow a debate on proposals as to how the Seanad should organise its business?  I appreciate this is in the Government&rsquo;s remit and that the Leader, in his role of representing the Government in this House, will set the Order of Business.  I am particularly interested to hear the views of the newly elected Members of this House, some 38 of them, who, considering their large depth of expertise and world experience in a variety of different areas, would perhaps bring new, fresh thinking to the debates that have already taken place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader consider at some point providing Government time for a debate on the Irish Diaspora on a regular basis?  Those who know me will know that, wearing my other hat as a broadcaster and as a former emigrant, I have championed the cause of the Irish abroad inside and outside this House.  I am privileged to currently present a monthly radio programme on RTE, &ldquo;The Irish Abroad&rdquo;, which will come to the end of its series this month.  In that context, <Col N="51"/>the fact that the T&aacute;naiste has been appointed not only Minister for Foreign Affairs but Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade indicates that the Government is aware of the growing importance of the Irish Diaspora in various parts of the world where the Irish gather.  I am astonished at the number of Irish societies which are not only involved in social activities in their adopted countries across the world, particularly in Europe and Asia, but which have used their network of contacts in recent years to promote not only the image of Ireland but the trade and commerce links that are continually growing between ourselves and various other countries, particularly in the larger economies.  Considering that the Government allocates some &euro;11 million, at the last count, towards funding Irish Diaspora activities, with the bulk of that money going to the UK, particularly in the area of social outreach where there is an ageing population, but also to Australia, Canada and America, it would be a useful exercise and would send a strong signal to the Diaspora that those of us in these Houses of Parliament have not forgotten them and that we are aware of the issues confronting them, especially the new Irish emigrants who are leaving.</P>
        <P>The Leader made some reference to committees.  My understanding is that the Government proposal is not only to reduce the number of committees but to reduce the membership of the surviving committees.  This would pose a particular difficulty for this House in that if the number of members of the committees were reduced, the number of Seanad representatives would be proportionately reduced.  I urge the Leader to fight the corner for this House to ensure that we get not only numerical representation based on whatever system is used but a more relevant representation that would embrace all the various strands of thinking within this House.</P>
        <P>The first day of the new Seanad last week was largely ceremonial.  Those of us who were here on the first day of a previous Seanad would know that.  There was only one issue on the Order of Business, namely, the election of the Cathaoirleach.  As a mark of respect, courtesy and friendship to the newly elected Cathaoirleach, in my contribution I single that out.  I would be the first to admit that it is not a contribution that would rank alongside Cicero, the brilliant orator referred to earlier.  That was the nature of that first day.  I deeply regret that an elected Member of this House saw fit, as Andy Warhol said, to pursue his &ldquo;15 minutes of fame&rdquo; on national radio by denigrating myself and a colleague of this House.</P>

	<P>I have a request for about 30 debates on various subjects already on the first day of this Seanad.  There would be no problem facilitating such debates but getting Ministers in here to deal with every one of them may be a problem.  There is always the possibility that we could have debates in this House without Ministers being present.  Some people may feel it would be pointless to have debates without Ministers present but it is an option open to us if we cannot get Ministers from time to time and it is something to which I will also have to give consideration.</P>
        <P>I am mindful I have business ordered for 4 p.m.  The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, requested a debate on the programme for Government, on the report of the review group on State assets and on the fair deal scheme and I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss those soon.</P>
        <P>Likewise, the deputy leader, Senator Bacik, spoke about the issue of white collar crime.  It is a matter the Minister takes very seriously and he expects legislation will be introduced soon.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senators Mullen, Norris, Hayden, Conway and others spoke of the hidden cost of the cutbacks and the requirement to prioritise the needs of families such as those we witnessed on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme recently.  I am sure we will be in a position to arrange for the Minister for Health to come into the House.  He has been asked by Members to come to the House to debate nine health items.  As to whether those items can be clustered or broken into different areas for consideration, we will try to arrange for the Minister to come to the House as much as possible to deal with the matters raised by Members today.</P>
        <P>I welcome the maiden contributions of several new Members who are present and I hope it will be the first of many contributions we will hear from the new Members.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Cullinane for his comments and assure him that I will certainly try to be fair in the allocation of time.  It is not my intention to exclude any Member from making contributions in this House.

It is not my intention to exclude any Member from making contributions and having time to do so in the House.</P>

Senator Mark Daly made the same point.  The policies pursued in recent years led to these appalling figures.  We will arrange a debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly also asked about mobile phones and legislation to prevent disasters.  It is a pity there was no legislation in place to prevent the economic disaster of recent years.</P>
        <P>I will take Senator Jimmy Harte up on the interesting reading he suggested for the summer months, that is, <i>Lustrum</i>.  I agree with his comments and those of Cicero on the brevity of statements in this House and the Roman Senate, respectively.  It is important that Members keep their remarks brief.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges will meet to set down the length of time Members can speak on the Order of Business.  It was two minutes in the previous Seanad, a time limit which I hope will be retained by the new committee.</P>
        <P>We will consider the possibility of meeting elsewhere, but we must be mindful of the costs involved.  Bringing the Seanad to County Donegal or anywhere else would be expensive.  Not only must we consider Members, we must also consider the many other costs attached to the running of the House.</P>

        <P>Senator Denis Landy called for a debate on water and household charges, the importance of local government and the democratic duties taken so seriously by local councillors in the recent Seanad election.  Senators Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill asked about the Irish language strategy, on which we can arrange a debate.  I am mindful of the fact that Cumann na Gaeilge is meeting in Buswell&rsquo;s Hotel until 8 p.m. today.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry Leyden referred to his Registration of Wills Bill 2011.  I welcome the introduction of the Bill which could be appropriately dealt with during Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; time next week.  I am sure the Senator will raise the matter with his party.</P>
        <P>Senators Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe and Marc MacSharry raised health matters, in particular, cancer services and the configuration of hospitals.  The Minister for Health could be in the Seanad for days in the light of the number of requests made today.  We will do our best to invite him to debate a number of these subjects.</P>
        <P>I am glad to note Fianna F&aacute;il Members will introduce a court orders Bill.  I welcome it when Senators introduce Bills.  The Bill mentioned can be debated during Private Members&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>Senator Martin Conway discussed the rights of people with disabilities, a cause I am sure he will champion.  We will do our best to have the Minister attend to discuss the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Paschal Mooney raised the issues of Seanad reform and the Irish Diaspora.  The number of committees will be reduced from 23 to 14.

	<P>It is my pleasure to second the nomination of Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan who is a fitting person to be Leas-Chathaoirleach.  He has given great service in this and the Lower House.  In the spirit of cross-party co-operation, I have no problem in seconding his nomination.</P>

	<P>I am happy to support the nomination of my old colleague and friend, Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan, as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  He is a distinguished Member of the House and a well known solicitor in Bantry or somewhere in west County Cork.  His legal knowledge and expertise have been made available to the House in a quiet and gentlemanly way.  He was a member of the Joint Committee on the Constitution, to which I made submissions.  While serving on the committee, he was always extraordinarily courteous and careful to listen to and balance all of the evidence presented.  He never got into difficulties or rows, however contentious matters became and some contentious matters were raised by groups which were displeased with the direction the committee took.</P>
        <P>As I stated in another forum today, I know well the phrase, &ldquo;If you cannot stand the heat, get out of the kitchen&rdquo;.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan will be well able to stand the heat, as I am.  What I did not realise was that it was Celebrity Chef Kitchen and I was going to have filthy language, knives and plates thrown at me.  I doubt if this will ever happen to Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, given his charming manner.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan was also involved in the Abbeylara committee.  That experience will prove useful, as I understand the Government intends to revisit the matter.  We are very lucky to have such a distinguished Member being put forward for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I look forward to what I am sure will be his uncontested election.</P>
        <P>I completely agree with the Leader, Senator Cummins, that this too is an example of cross-party co-operation.  I hope we will continue to go about our business in respect of this matter in a non-contentious way and will not become involved in the kind of ping pong in which we usually engage on Wednesday evenings.  It would ill become me to be contentious on this happy occasion of electing a distinguished Member, who is a friend to everyone in the House, as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I support Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s nomination as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  He is an excellent choice for the position.  I had the pleasure to mark him on the justice portfolio when we were on opposite sides of the Chamber during the lifetime of the previous Seanad.  He was always very courteous, easy to deal with, knowledgeable and well-informed.  We engaged in some excellent debates, particularly during the Committee Stage deliberations relating to justice Bills.  I look forward to the same quality of debates during the lifetime of this Seanad.  It is unfortunate that the Senator, as Leas-Chathaoirleach, may not be quite as able to participate in those debates.  I look forward to seeing him in the Chair as Leas-Chathaoirleach and I support his nomination.</P>

As Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and Norris highlighted, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan has a very proud record of service in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Being elected to the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach is a great honour for him and his family.  I wish him well in his role as Leas-Chathaoirleach of the 24th Seanad.</P>

	<P>I add my voice to those which have already proposed Senator O&rsquo;Donovan as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  The Senator has been an active Member of this and the Lower House.  He has been committed to subjects in which he has a particular interest, including fishing, harbours and ports and anything to do with the sea.  The House has benefitted from the commitment he has shown.  I believe he holds the record for the longest ever contribution in the House.  I congratulate him on that.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan serves as a reminder that when someone is really interested in, enthusiastic about and committed and dedicated to a particular topic, he or she can get things done or change perceptions.  The Senator&rsquo;s record provides evidence in this regard and I am sure he will be an excellent Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>

	<P>On a serious note, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan is an outstanding Member of this House and he was also an outstanding Member of the D&aacute;il.  He is something of a legend in the electoral history of Fianna F&aacute;il because he managed to win a seat in a constituency where it was seen as being almost impossible for my party to do so.  By a quirk of misfortune, he lost out in 2007 when he was destined to serve either in Cabinet or as a Minister of State as a result of his performance in the previous D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan is a man of great grit and courage and he understates his legal ability and knowledge.  However, he is always available to help anyone who needs it and has certainly <Col N="56"/>been a great friend and adviser to me.  We could select no better person to serve as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I look forward to his elevation.</P><P Just="Left">Question put and agreed to.</P>

As a number of speakers indicated, he is a long-serving Member of both Houses and is extremely familiar with the procedures and Standing Orders relating to this House.

I thank my proposer, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and my seconder, Senator Cummins, and all of the other Members who spoke so kindly about me, including Senators Bacik, Norris, Cullinane, O&rsquo;Sullivan and van Turnhout.  I hope I have not left anyone out.</P>
        <P>Five weeks ago I was fortunate to win a seat on the agricultural panel.  Serving as Leas-Chathaoirleach or holding any other position in the House was the furthest thing from my mind at that point.  However, it is a great honour to have been elected to the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I hope I can emulate the Cathaoirleach who for the past nine years has been an excellent Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I am sure I can learn a great deal from him.  I would like to work with him and with the officers of the House, including the Clerk, Ms Deirdre Lane, and all the staff in ensuring that the Seanad maintains its dignity and retains the important position it holds into the future.</P>
        <P>When I first entered the House in October 1989, the Clerk was Mr. Kieran Coughlan, who is currently Clerk of the D&aacute;il, the Leader was former Senator Mick Lanigan, the leader of the Opposition was former Senator Doyle from Wexford and the then Cathaoirleach was the late Senator Se&aacute;n Doherty.  That is a long time ago and we were all a great deal younger then.  Many changes have marked the intervening period.  Since I was first elected to the local council in 1985 I have fought a total of 17 elections.  Unfortunately, I did not win all of them but that is the way politics goes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a very proud day for my family and I pay tribute to them.  Not all of my family are present in the Chamber.  If they were, it would be possible to fill the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery twice over because I am the youngest of 11 children.  I pay tribute to my partner, Eileen, my daughter, Naomi, my son, Luke, and his wife, Marian, my son, Gerard, and his wife, Clare &mdash; who is not present &mdash; and my only grandchild, Lucy.  I would have loved it if Lucy were here but she is only a year old and I am sure she is oblivious to what is happening to her grandfather.  I pay tribute to my son, Donnachada, my partner Eileen&rsquo;s two daughters, Julie and Glenda,  and my sister, Sheila, who is one of my seven sisters, thankfully, not all of whom are present.  I also pay tribute to my sisters, Margaret and Noreen, Noreen's husband, John, my brother, Thomas, and his wife, Sadie, my brothers-in-law and all my friends who came to the Seanad today to support me.  I hope I have not left anyone out.</P>
        <P>This is a very proud day for me.  I am honoured to be elected to serve as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I hope the Cathaoirleach will not crack the whip too hard in my direction and that we will get on together.  I hope we have a good working relationship.  I look forward to working with everyone in the House.  I refer, in particular, to the new Senators, many of whom I have not yet met, in this regard.  I look forward to meeting them and to fulfilling the role of Leas-Chathaoirleach in the manner that was envisaged when the Constitution was formulated in 1937.

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always a pleasure to address this House.  I congratulate all the new Senators elected and appointed to the House and wish them well during the lifetime of this Seanad.</P>
        <P>The motion before the House seeks to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry established by the Oireachtas into suggestions of collusion by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or other employees of the State, in the brutal murders by the Provisional IRA of RUC chief superintendent Harry Breen and RUC superintendent Bob Buchanan in March 1989.  The original Seanad motion was passed on 24 March 2005 following the passing of a similar motion in the D&aacute;il on 23 March 2005.  The tribunal was established on 31 May 2005 and is chaired by Mr. Justice Peter Smithwick, former President of the District Court.</P>
        <P>There has been some misreporting surrounding the reasons for putting forward this motion.  Its purpose is not to curtail, impede, confine or interfere with the independence of the tribunal in fulfilling the terms of reference of the inquiry.  Neither is it about the winding down of a tribunal, as suggested in the recent headline of a particular newspaper.  Rather, it is about fulfilling this House&rsquo;s responsibilities while fully supporting the work of the tribunal.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the motion, therefore, is to afford Seanad &Eacute;ireann the opportunity to consider the current state of play with the tribunal&rsquo;s work.  It seeks to do so by establishing a timeframe which is reasonable for the tribunal to complete that work.  I do not believe it would have been appropriate, given the respective roles of the Oireachtas and the tribunal, for me to have consulted Mr. Justice Smithwick about the terms of the motion.  Nevertheless, some time ago Mr. Justice Smithwick indicated to me that the tribunal would be able to conclude its work in the timescale now contemplated by this motion.  It will be both in the public interest and in the interest of those bereaved by the callous murders of the two police officers to underpin that in the motion.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding that, if, for any reason, this does not prove possible, the tribunal&rsquo;s chairman can report back to the Clerk of the Seanad that circumstances have arisen which require that timescale to be extended.  I offer a solemn assurance that the Government&rsquo;s response to that <Col N="59"/>will be fully cognisant of and consistent with the need for the tribunal to fulfil its obligations fully and as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>These assurances meet concerns expressed about the public imposition of a deadline.  While for the reason I have given I did not consult with Mr. Justice Smithwick about the specific terms of the motion, I will convey that assurance to him in light of concerns he has expressed to me about any possible effects of an indication by this House of a deadline and those concerns expressed subsequent to the newspaper report I mentioned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From my contact with the chairman and comments by others, the concern about the public imposition of a completion date relates to the possible effect on witnesses of this approach, and, in particular, the publicity surrounding it.  It is unfortunate that a public impression may have been created that this motion is about winding down or curtailing the tribunal&rsquo;s work.  This, in turn, may have led to persons having reconsidered their support for and co-operation with the tribunal.  It is most important such co-operation is given.  Now that I have put formally on the record of this House the actual position, I believe these concerns should be allayed.</P>
        <P>Six years after its establishment and the expenditure of more than &euro;8 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money by my Department, this approach best protects the public interest.  The motion also requires the chairman to prepare and submit an interim report by the end of June.  Again, this is consistent with the tribunal&rsquo;s own timescale which envisages public hearings commencing on 7 June with an opening statement by counsel on that date.</P>
        <P>There has been some misinformed public comment about this, apparently based on the mistaken view that this is a new requirement.  In fact, under the current terms of reference set down in 2005, the chairman must submit an interim report on certain matters as soon as may be after the tenth day of any oral hearings of the tribunal.  The motion, therefore, does not impose any substantive additional requirement or undesirable burden on the tribunal.</P>
        <P>The Smithwick tribunal has, since early 2006, been conducting its inquiries in private.  Given the importance attached to the subject matter of those inquiries, the Government considers it appropriate that the Oireachtas and the public should have an indication of where the tribunal is placed in carrying out the mandate which was conferred on it by the Oireachtas.  It is my view and that of the Government that it serves the public interest to have information from the tribunal as to the current status of its inquiry.</P>
        <P>With hindsight, it may have been a mistake in the original terms of reference to link the timing of an interim report to a number of public hearings having taken place.  I doubt very much the House would have envisaged at the time that this would mean that it would hear nothing from the tribunal for six years.</P>
        <P>I do not consider it unreasonable that the tribunal should be asked to report progress at this stage.  In so far as the proposed interim report is concerned, the motion does not seek to have the tribunal deal with the substance of the matters into which it is inquiring.  Rather, the purpose is for the tribunal to give the Oireachtas an indication of the numbers of persons granted representation, progress to date with its hearings, the number of witnesses it may be calling and other matters which the tribunal considers should be drawn to the attention of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I am anxious the tribunal should be facilitated to conduct and conclude its inquiries in as comprehensive a manner as is possible.  I consider, however, that it is helpful, especially to those most directly affected by these dreadful killings, for this House to indicate a timescale for that.  It is not in the public interest or in the interest of the families bereaved by this IRA atrocity that an inquiry should continue indefinitely.  The seriousness of the matters being investigated requires greater urgency than that.</P><Col N="60"/>
        <P>The tribunal&rsquo;s chairman has informed me he believes the tribunal will be in a position to complete its work in advance of the date now proposed.  If a difficulty were to emerge subsequently with the target date for conclusion, however, the chairman would report that difficulty and the Oireachtas would have the opportunity to consider the matter further.  There is no obstacle of any nature to any such report being made in the future to the Houses of the Oireachtas by the chairman.</P>
        <P>It is against that background that the motion proposes that the tribunal should conclude its work and report to the Clerk of the Seanad by 30 November 2011.  I respect and defend fully the independence of the chairman of the tribunal to carry out his inquiries without fear or favour.  It is central to the remit of the tribunal that having completed its hearings, it reaches its conclusions and finalises its report for submission to the Clerk of Seanad &Eacute;ireann without any interference or its independence being compromised.</P>
        <P>It is, however, in the public interest that its deliberations do not continue indefinitely with no public target date for the completion of its work or without accountability to this Parliament or explanation for the duration of its sitting.  After all, its original remit was to report on a &ldquo;definite matter of urgent public importance&rdquo; on which it is &ldquo;to make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit&rdquo;.  Moreover, its original terms of reference require that when it reports on an interim basis, the tribunal must detail the likely duration of its proceedings in so far as it can estimate it.  There must be some accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the progress of its work and the public expenditure connected with it.  This was clearly envisaged in the motion to establish the tribunal passed by this House on 24 March 2005, some six years ago.</P>
        <P>The amendment to the Government motion is unsupportable.  It proceeds from an entirely erroneous understanding of the intention behind the motion.  First, it is not the case, as I have emphasised, that the intention is to curtail the work of the tribunal.  That is precisely the effect that the amending motion would have.  Furthermore, it would be entirely inappropriate for me, as Minister, or the Government to engage directly with the tribunal about its terms of reference.  That is a matter solely for the Oireachtas.  The Government motion before the House reinforces that position.  Additionally, I fail to see how it is considered possible, in view of what I have said about the tribunal&rsquo;s independence, that I or the Government could undertake consultations with any interested parties as to the terms of reference of an independent tribunal established by the Oireachtas.  The tribunal would clearly be an interested party and I have been at pains to emphasise that it would be improper for me or the Government to consult it about its terms of reference.  Communication with the tribunal on that matter is for the Oireachtas.  The Government motion does not interfere with that position.  The amendment to the Government motion is in terms which would be likely to bring about further delay.</P>
        <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to bring the motion before the Seanad.  I commend it to the House and hope it will receive the support of all Members.</P>

        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; where it firstly occurs and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;notes that:</P><Col N="61"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the Oireachtas established the Smithwick tribunal as a central part of the confidence-building measures which led to major breakthroughs in relations with key parts of the Unionist community;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the work of the tribunal demonstrates that the Irish Government is willing to open up to scrutiny all issues, no matter how potentially uncomfortable they are, concerning actions by the State and its officers in the decades before the ceasefires;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />while press briefings have explained the basis for the Government&rsquo;s proposal to curtail the work of the tribunal, no information has been given to members of the Oireachtas; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />while legal costs must be addressed, no move should be made to curtail the work of the tribunal without a detailed report being submitted to the Oireachtas justifying such a move and following a process of consultation with interested parties in Northern Ireland; and</P>
        <P LI="1">resolves that:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the Minister for Justice and Equality should prepare for the Oireachtas a detailed report outlining all relevant information and arguments concerning the work of the tribunal and how, if the work of the tribunal is curtailed, he proposes to meet the central objective of reaching a clearer conclusion relating to the allegation of collusion; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />consultations be undertaken with all interested parties in advance of any proposal to curtail the work of the tribunal being put to the House.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is an important but tersely drafted motion which does not take into account the human suffering involved or the complex and emotional relations between the peoples of this island and between Britain and Ireland.  Let us not forget that the origins of this tribunal ultimately lie in an international agreement between two countries, namely, Britain and Ireland, taking into account the interests of the people and institutions of Northern Ireland.  There has been no consultation and no effort has been made to ascertain the views of various bodies or persons such as the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the British Government, the Minister for Justice in Northern Ireland, the First Minister or the Deputy First Minister on the issue.  Last month Mr. Peter Robinson was at home in this country while his Queen was on a state visit.  The Government, in bringing forward this tersely drafted motion which provides no explanation of the Minister&rsquo;s position, is massively undermining the relations built in the past 15 years between Britain and Ireland and does not provide any comfort for those involved.  It is a terrible motion.</P>
        <P>The Minister has misrepresented the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment which does not seek to interfere with the terms of reference of the tribunal.  It merely asks that the Minister prepare a report outlining his and the Government&rsquo;s reasons for curtailing the tribunal&rsquo;s work and for consultations to be held with all interested parties in advance of any proposal to curtail the work of the tribunal.  That may well be an international legal obligation of the State because of our relations with Britain are the genesis of the tribunal.  The Government has not done so and as such has massively damaged relations between the parties involved.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that people are concerned about the cost of tribunals.  The mind boggles at the length and cost of tribunals, an issue on which I often spoke as a backbencher in the other House.  One cannot rush in with a sledgehammer as has been done in this case.  There should be no curtailment of the tribunal&rsquo;s work without proper justification and consultation.  The motion undermines the hard work done over many years.  While I do accuse the Minister <Col N="62"/>or the Government of breaching or undermining the peace process, the motion brings to mind previous individual attitudes within Fine Gael to the peace process.</P>
        <P>The Government is all over the place on this issue.  It states the tribunal is to be curtailed, but that it will not force it if there is no agreement on the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Other tribunals such as the Bloody Sunday Inquiry set up by the British Government were not curtailed, despite the fact that they cost a great deal, were lengthy and the source of much disquiet in certain quarters.  They ultimately were seen to have a beneficial impact on communities and relations in getting answers for people, which is what this tribunal should be about.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I urge Members to consider the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment and not to support the terse language used in the motion.  The Minister has many advisers whom I urge to move on from using Civil Service legalese language when dealing with issues such as this.  It is important to point out that the language used in the motion is extraordinary.  I, therefore, urge Members to support the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment to the motion.  Ours is a much more realistic motion which takes into account the complexities of the issues and relations involved, while recognising that tribunal costs and delays are matters of serious public concern.  Let us not forget that tribunal results are also matters of serious public interest.  Many tribunal reports published during the years have sold out at the Government Publications Sale Office and Internet services have been interrupted as a result of the serious level of interest in them.  I have no doubt there will be the same level of interest in the Smithwick tribunal&rsquo;s report when published.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, who will also be in the House tomorrow for Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill 2011, the first Bill to come before the new Seanad.  I look forward to that debate.</P>
        <P>I welcome the context in which we are debating this motion, namely, the unprecedented moves forward in the peace process in recent weeks following the successful visit here of Queen Elizabeth II which clearly marked a major step forward in the development of the peace process and relations between the two islands, which is important.  I am sure Senator Thomas Byrne did not intend to dispute the Government&rsquo;s support for and commitment to the peace process.  As a former law student of mine, I would not like him to be misquoted.  Clearly, the Government is deeply committed to the continuance of the peace process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is also committed to the work of the tribunal.  In any debate on it one must start with an expression of sympathy to the families of the RUC officers, chief superintendent Harry Breen and superintendent Bob Buchanan, brutally murdered in 1989.  To echo the Minister&rsquo;s words, the murders were absolutely brutal and barbaric.  It is vitally important that we seek to investigate any allegations or claims of collusion by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or State agents in the murders.  We are all committed to the work of the tribunal which was established six years ago and has to date cost more than &euro;8 million.  Concerns have been expressed at regular intervals during the years about the delays in its work and the lack of public hearings.  It is reasonable at this point to seek to place some framework on the work of the tribunal.  I am glad to hear the Minister say this is not about winding down or curtailing the work of the tribunal, an important acknowledgement.  I am also glad to hear that the chairman of the tribunal has indicated to the Minister that he can complete the tribunal&rsquo;s work within the <Col N="63"/>timeframe envisaged in the Government motion.  Furthermore, I am glad that the motion provides that the chairman may come back to the Minister or the Oireachtas should the timeframe in this regard need to be extended.  This, too, is important.</P>
        <P>I share the Minister&rsquo;s view that the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment would not be workable.  I would be concerned that the resolutions provided for in the amendment would undermine the work of the tribunal far more significantly than, as Fianna F&aacute;il is alleging, the motion.  The amendment would provide that the Minister would prepare a detailed report for the Oireachtas.  It is up to the tribunal to prepare such a report.  The motion stipulates that an interim report be submitted by 30 June which represents very little difference to the original terms of reference of the tribunal which were that it would produce such a report as soon as may be after the tenth day of any oral hearings.  We know that oral hearings are due to commence on 7 June.  The Fianna F&aacute;il amendment would also require the tribunal to complete its findings and submit its final report by the end of November.  We have heard from the Minister that the chairman has indicated that that timeframe would be workable for the tribunal.</P>
        <P>One should acknowledge in any discussion of the tribunal&rsquo;s work that it has faced serious obstacles, including national security issues, gagging orders and, as reported at one point, an industrial relations dispute.  Clearly, there were issues that contributed to the delays in the process.  One should be mindful that in his opening statement six years ago Mr. Justice Smithwick said he hoped the inquiry would proceed expeditiously, which is what we would all like.  It is in the interests of the bereaved families and other persons interested in the outcome of the tribunal that it proceed expeditiously.  The tribunal has done a great deal of investigative work at this stage.</P>
        <P>We are facing public hearings and a date has been given for those.  It is reasonable to anticipate that the tribunal could complete a full and thorough investigation by the end of the timeframe envisaged in the motion.  I support the motion.  It does not, in any way, seek to undermine or curtail the important work the Smithwick tribunal is doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the opportunity to comment on the motion.</P>
        <P>The public have an underlying expectation that, at a time of tremendous pressure on resources, we do what we can to minimise unnecessary expense, particularly on tribunals.  For that reason, I am concerned that the Smithwick tribunal might be the innocent victim of the notoriety generated by the lengthy activities of another tribunal.  It is important to respond to public concerns and acknowledge that this tribunal has been going on for six years at a cost of &euro;8 million.  That is clear.</P>
        <P>However, I stress the importance of what we are doing with regard to this tribunal.  There is a background here.  It is the relationship between Ireland and Great Britain, and particularly the question of responsibility.  We are seeking the greatest possible measure of co-operation from our British counterparts with regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  It is important, not least for that reason, that we not be seen to skimp on the investigation into this notorious killing of two senior RUC officers in 1989.  That was a date which will live in infamy, to borrow a phrase made famous elsewhere.</P>
        <P>Another issue arises.  It is the importance of maximum consultation with the Oireachtas.  I spoke earlier today about the need for the Government to avoid rushing off to hold press conferences prior to bringing matters before the Oireachtas.  I find myself sympathetic to the proposal of my colleagues on the Fianna F&aacute;il side that a report should first be submitted to the Oireachtas justifying the Government&rsquo;s proposed move.</P><Col N="64"/>
        <P>It is a matter of trying to cut down on unnecessary expense.  That is a big issue at present.  We must also have regard to the specific importance of this tribunal.  I accept that the Minister says he does not see himself as cutting short the work of the tribunal.  I also accept that it will be possible for the chairman of the tribunal to seek an extension of time.  That said, I see the Minister&rsquo;s proposal as a sudden foreshortening.  There should first be a report to the Oireachtas justifying the move the Government proposes to make rather than a relatively short debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas today followed by a whipped vote.  For that reason I support the Opposition amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House.  I thank him for the fair outline he has given on this matter.  I support fully what he said and what Senator Bacik said.  Extensive investigations have taken place in private.  I know matters are very sensitive and it is unfortunate that there has been some misrepresentation of the position.  I hope that does not adversely affect the public hearings or the witnesses who may have to come forward and who, no doubt, have been interviewed.  I hope matters will work out satisfactorily.  A date has been set for the public hearings.  There is no imposition that cannot be met.  In fact, it is rather fair.  I am sure Mr. Justice Smithwick is very happy with matters while he may not be happy with the misrepresentation.</P>
        <P>What is outlined here is reasonable.  The Minister has made it clear that if, due to unforeseen circumstances, there is a delay the tribunal will communicate with the Oireachtas and the matter can be dealt with.  Given the indication from Mr. Justice Smithwick, to which the Minister has referred, I do not think that will happen.  This approach best protects the public interest and does not impose a substantive additional requirement or place an undesirable burden on the tribunal.</P>
        <P>Given these circumstances, we should be calm about this matter.  The Opposition may have been well intentioned.  I do not impugn their motives.  However, this is a most reasonable proposal and will be acceptable all round.  I commend it to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  During the most recent phase of the conflict, more than 3,500 people died.  Thankfully, the armed conflict has ended but the conflict resolution process continues.  That process presents many challenges to all of us, especially those who were party to the conflict.  Our political leaders, and all of us, must rise to the challenges the conflict resolution process still entails.</P>
        <P>Many families are still grieving and seeking answers regarding the deaths of their loved ones.  All families deserve the truth and Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports their quest for truth.  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently supported the Saville inquiry into Bloody Sunday and the inquiry into the murder of Rosemary Nelson.  Sinn F&eacute;in also gives ongoing support to the family of the murdered solicitor, Pat Finucane, and the families of the victims of the Ballymurphy and Springhill massacres.</P>
        <P>In 2008, Sinn F&eacute;in supported the unanimous request of the Oireachtas to allow independent international access to all original documents held by the British Government relating to attacks that had resulted in fatalities in this State as a consequence of collusion between unionist and loyalist paramilitaries and the British State.  Last month, as Members will be aware, Sinn F&eacute;in published a Private Members&rsquo; Bill dealing with the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  We called on the British Government to release the important files relating to those bombings.  I know the Taoiseach has called on the Prime Minister to release those files, but he has refused to do so.  These are legacy issues that we must deal with.  It is widely believed that this attack, which involved the greatest loss of life of any incident in the conflict, was carried out with <Col N="65"/>the involvement of British intelligence.  One of the bombs exploded near to where we are standing today.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in proposed the establishment of an independent international truth recovery process to be convened under the auspices of a credible international third party.  We put forward the option of the United Nations.  Any process convened along those lines should be victim centred.  We need to make sure that the families of those victims, on all sides, get the truth they deserve.  Those who were killed, on all sides, deserve the truth.  The Oireachtas established the Smithwick tribunal of inquiry into the alleged collusion of a member or members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the killing in 1989 of senior RUC officers Harry Breen and Robert Buchanan.  As Sinn F&eacute;in has stated previously in the D&aacute;il, anyone who has any relevant information should come forward to assist this tribunal of inquiry, and it is important that this call be made here again today.</P>
        <P>I do not have any difficulty with the Government seeking an interim report from the tribunal.  However, it is a mistake for the Government to look for a final report by 30 November as this will feed the conspiracy theories that the Government and the Garda have something to hide, and the Minister should be mindful of this.  There are arguments over costs which, when families are seeking truth, are petty and irresponsible.  We need to make sure that all of those families get the closure they want.</P>
        <P>The British Government obviously has a responsibility in regard to collusion and truth, and the Irish Government has a constitutional, legal and moral responsibility to actively promote and encourage this course of action.  We all have responsibilities.  In recent weeks and months, there has been much talk of moving on and all of us collectively want to move on.  I am a strong supporter of the peace process and of the conflict resolution process.  However, for people to move on, especially victims and their families, they need justice and they need the truth.  All of us collectively must rise to those challenges to make sure those families get the truth they deserve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their contributions and in particular Senators Bacik and Coghlan for the support expressed for the motion and for their obvious understanding of its intent.  It is important we do not forget the events that lie behind the tribunal.  The savage details of the cold-blooded killing of two unarmed police officers are set out in Judge Cory&rsquo;s report and, as he said, these shootings were brutal, cowardly and demonstrated a callous insensitivity to both the suffering of individuals and to life itself.  While I would not suggest there is any hierarchy in terms of the degree of brutality attaching to the many murders which were committed in connection with the Northern Ireland Troubles, the murders of these two officers, as described by Judge Cory, leave one feeling particularly numb at the manner of their murders.</P>
        <P>The two men were targeted in a well-planned ambush.  Both Harry Breen and Bob Buchanan were hit several times by a hail of bullets while still in their car.  Bob Buchanan suffered many fragment wounds in the head and upper body, and it is probable that he was dead by the time his car came to a stop.  He had also been shot in the head at close range, almost certainly after he had died.  Harry Breen had been severely wounded but it appears that he had left the car after it came to a stop, waving a white handkerchief.   Eyewitness accounts indicated that a member of the IRA murder squad walked up to him and simply shot him in the back of the head.</P>
        <P>This tribunal is carrying out an important inquiry to establish the truth behind suggestions that garda&iacute; or other State employees colluded in those brutal killings and it must and will be allowed to carry out its work without hindrance.  As I have already stated, it is my understanding that the concern about the public imposition of a completion date relates to the possible <Col N="66"/>effect on witnesses of this approach and, in particular, the publicity surrounding the approach detailed in our motion.  It is unfortunate that a public impression may have been created, fuelled, I might say, by uninformed public comment that this motion was about &ldquo;winding down&rdquo; or curtailing the tribunal.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope that what I have said in this House will reassure those people there is no such intention.  The independence of the tribunal is fully respected in the original motion.  No attempt is being made to prevent it getting at the truth in so far as it can do so.  There is no question that the Government or the Garda engaged in any cover-up of any nature whatsoever.  What we need is the truth and we need to get to the truth for the sake, in particular, of the families who were bereaved by this atrocity.  I have made it very clear that if, for some unforeseen reason, the chairman cannot complete the inquiry in the timeframe proposed, he can report back to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il to the effect that circumstances have arisen which require that timescale to be extended.  This House can then consider the matter.</P>
        <P>I also referred to the fact that prior to the tabling of this motion, the chairman indicated to me that he believed this tribunal would complete its work within the timeframe detailed.  Since the publicity arose, the chairman has corresponded with me to indicate concerns in regard to witnesses attending before the tribunal.  We have responded to that and will be forwarding to the chairman the speech made by me in the D&aacute;il setting out clearly that we want the tribunal to do its work, to continue to act with integrity and independence, and to reach a conclusion and make recommendations on the facts available to it within the terms of the motion originally passed in 2005.</P>
        <P>I regard it as reasonable that a tribunal that has cost the State in excess of &euro;8 million and that has been sitting in private for six years would make an interim report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I note with interest and curiosity the motion tabled by Senator Byrne, who wants me as Minister for Justice and Equality to prepare a detailed report outlining all relevant information concerning the work of the tribunal.  How can I do that in the context of an independent tribunal?  Is that not why we want an independent report from the tribunal to this House, namely, so this House knows about the workings of the tribunal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>We are seeking the reasons that the Minister formed the opinion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>We are entitled to know, under the terms of the motion tabled before the House by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in 2005, what the tribunal estimates as its likely duration, how many witnesses it intends to call, who has been granted legal representation and to be furnished with any other additional information.  I did not notice Senator Byrne indicate to me in any shape or form that it was envisaged when this tribunal was created in May 2005 that it would be silent for six years, with no public indication or report to the Houses of the Oireachtas as to where matters stood with regard to its work.</P>
        <P>I greatly regret Senator Byrne&rsquo;s gross and ill-judged attempt to play domestic politics with the Anglo-Irish Agreement or with Anglo-Irish relations.  His hysterical and grossly distorted misrepresentation of the Government&rsquo;s position and of the motion before this House is to no benefit of this State or his party, and certainly does not give us any indicator of his capacity to understand the depth of the peace process, the commitment of the Government to Anglo-Irish relations and the very close relations that have been clearly fostered by the Government since its formation following the last general election and, indeed, the relations I have as Minister for Justice and Equality with my counterpart, Mr. David Ford, in Northern Ireland.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that we deal with these issues with a degree of common sense.  I will conclude by reiterating that the Government is anxious that this independent tribunal independently completes its work, concludes its inquiries and produces recommendations.  We have no intent of any nature to interfere in that work or to influence it.  However, we believe a tribunal created by the Houses of the Oireachtas has an obligation to report to the Houses as to the progress it is making and as to its likely duration.  We believe it is not unreasonable that, after six years of sittings, we set a date within which it should report in circumstances in which the procedures of both Houses facilitate the chairman communicating with the Clerk of the D&aacute;il at a later stage if he discovers there is a difficulty in completing his work within that timeframe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am personally conscious of the type of difficulties that could occur during the course of the oral hearings of the tribunal and which might result in that type of communication from the chairman.  However, it is important, where a tribunal is created to report on an urgent matter of public importance, which was the phrase used in 2005, that we encourage the tribunal, after six years, to progress its inquiries, complete its deliberations and make its recommendations within a reasonable timeframe. The motion provides for this.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the introduction by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform of Ireland&rsquo;s formal visa waiver programme, which will facilitate and encourage tourism to Ireland from key emerging markets;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes the significant value of the recent visits to this State by Queen Elizabeth II and President Barack Obama in promoting Ireland and Irish tourism overseas, which are being built on by Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s overseas marketing efforts; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />encourages all those engaged with Irish tourism to work together with the relevant agencies, the new Ministers and Government to ensure that the quality and competitiveness of the Irish tourism offering is continually improved.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister to the House; we look forward to hearing from him.  I am also delighted tourism has been made a key priority of this Government.  It is one of the sectors best placed to promote our economic recovery.  The Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to the sector by the importance placed on tourism in the programme for Government and the strong emphasis placed on it in the jobs initiative programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The programme for Government clearly outlines a number of commitments on tourism to improve the product, something we all subscribe to.  We are an island nation and international access is vital to our tourism recovery.  The commitment to abolish the &euro;3 travel tax is subject to a deal being agreed with Ryanair and Aer Lingus to reopen closed routes and perhaps open new routes and bring more tourists into Ireland.  If a deal is not done, there will be no reduction in the tax, as the Minister has made clear, and I wish him well in the negotiations on this issue.</P>
        <P>We will prioritise the tourism marketing fund as an essential pillar of our tourism strategy and will ensure the best return on Exchequer spending.  This Government intends to explore the possibility of a new agreement on visitor visas with Britain, offering tourists the opportunity to visit Britain and Ireland with one visa at a reasonable cost to tap into the tourism market for significant events such as the forthcoming London 2012 Olympics.  Marketing campaigns will be developed in emerging long-haul markets, such as China, Russia, India, Japan and the Middle East using the tourism marketing fund.</P>
        <P>Recovery of market share in Britain also will be a key priority in a revamped tourism strategy.  Traditionally it always it has been Ireland&rsquo;s best market but Members will be aware of the recent slump in numbers.  Improving the e-capability of Ireland&rsquo;s tourism product will be a priority.  The Government will target available resources at developing and co-ordinating niche tourism products and activity packages that are attractive to international visitors and will focus on food, sports, culture, eco-tourism, activity breaks, water-based recreation and festivals.  Events tourism will be prioritised to continue to bring major fairs and events to Ireland, such as the Volvo Ocean Race, the Solheim Cup and so on.</P>
        <P>The jobs initiative announced by the Government last month includes a multi-pronged plan to assist the tourism sector and create further jobs.  Tourism clearly is one of that initiative&rsquo;s main areas of focus, which reflects the issue&rsquo;s importance to the new Government.  The plan includes the reduction in the level of VAT applied to a range of labour-intensive tourism services to 9%, thereby providing a much-needed support to that sector of the economy.  It also allows for the abolition of the travel tax if airlines commit to delivering more tourists to Ireland, the rebating of substantial levels of charges to airlines by Dublin Airport in return for additional passengers being brought into the country and setting up a joint marketing initiative between Tourism Ireland, the Dublin Airport Authority and the airlines.  The initiative also will reduce VAT on the cost of many services, including accommodation and restaurants.  The <Col N="70"/>halving of employer&rsquo;s PRSI for those on modest wages will make it much more attractive for tourism employers to give people the chance to take up work.  The introduction of a tourist visa waiver for people from certain countries with a valid United Kingdom visa will make it easier for tourists from emerging economies to come to Ireland without experiencing the cost or hassle of applying for a separate Irish visa.  The initiative also supports a strong focus through the tourism marketing fund on our major source markets, including the United Kingdom, to take advantage of the additional opportunities presented in 2011 by the visits of QueenElizabeth and President Obama.  It will also encourage work placements and internships in the private sector.  Such schemes give tourism businesses a chance to take on young and enthusiastic graduates and trainees with languages and technical knowledge, while helping the unemployed to develop their on-the-job skills and practical experience.  The new arrangements will make it more practical and attractive for firms to take on placements and for graduates to take up opportunities.</P>
        <P>Great Britain and the United States of America are two of the four key markets for Irish tourism.  As such, the two recent state visits gave Ireland a significant opportunity to showcase its tourism products.  This was done through a variety of visits to, and public events at, key tourist attractions such as Croke Park, the Guinness Storehouse, the Rock of Cashel, the National Conference Centre, College Green and the National Stud, among other locations.  Following the two state visits, research was commissioned to assess their value to Irish tourism.  It showed that President Obama&rsquo;s visit generated 11,586 print and online articles, as well as 4,416 separate broadcast pieces, in the United States and United Kingdom, of which 3,493 of those were in the United States alone.  The visit of Queen Elizabeth generated 15,793 print and online articles, as well as 6,000 separate broadcast pieces.  This coverage is estimated to be worth at least &euro;298 million in terms of its advertising equivalent.  In the first quarter of 2011, the total number of overseas trips to Ireland increased by 8.6% to 1,177,600, which was an overall increase of 92,800 compared with the same period 12 months earlier.  Visitors from North America increased by 11.9% to 153,600, while the number of trips from residents of Great Britain and other European destinations had increased by 7.2% and 8.9% to 564,300 and 399,000, respectively, while trips from residents from other areas rose by 12%.</P>
        <P>The targets for 2011 set by Tourism Ireland are to achieve growth in overseas visitor numbers and foreign revenue earnings of up to 4% and 7.3%, respectively.  Tourism Ireland has reviewed its marketing strategy and operations for 2011 to ensure that while working in close co-operation with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and tourism industry partners, it can return overseas tourism to growth in 2011.  Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s major promotional effort in 2011 is focused on the four key markets that together deliver 75% of overseas visitors, namely, Great Britain, North America, Germany and France.  In addition, Tourism Ireland is engaged in rolling out trade, marketing and publicity campaigns in a further 19 markets, including China and India, albeit with lower levels of resources and investment.  An extensive &euro;28 million first half tourism marketing drive is under way at present in key markets to drive demand for travel in peak and off-peak seasons and to promote city breaks and touring holidays, as well as activities, including golf and business tourism.  The marketing drive highlights things to do and see in Ireland, the fares available from air and sea carriers, the value on offer from tourism industry partners, as well as the Irish welcome.  In addition, it has launched a major marketing drive in Britain and the United States to maximise the global publicity that surrounded the historic visits of Queen Elizabeth and President Obama to Ireland.</P>
        <P>Sustaining and developing the growth of the British market is a major priority of 2011.  With this in mind, Tourism Ireland has increased its marketing spend in Britain by 30% and I understand it will spend more than &euro;17 million in promoting the island of Ireland there this year by <Col N="71"/>ensuring a strong promotional presence on television, radio, online and on social media outlets throughout the year.  Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s overseas publicity campaign this year will generate positive media coverage for the island of Ireland worth up to &euro;200 million in equivalent advertising values.  Its suite of 42 websites in 14 languages will attract almost 12 million visitors who will visit the site to research and plan aspects of their holidays here and to access offers from the tourism industry partners.  Three quarters of a million Discover Ireland holiday guides will be distributed through tourist offices and in several national newspapers, including <i>The Irish Times</i>, the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>.  It also will be available online at <i>www.discoverireland.ie</i>.  The guide will contain more than 230 special offers with a strong emphasis on family breaks.  The holiday guide contains suggestions on family festivals, fun attractions and adventures for kids, including boat trips, dolphin and whale watching, GAA C&uacute;l camps, fun museums, animal magic, sea life centres and water worlds.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister on this highly ambitious programme.  While it contains a great deal more, I lack the time to deal with it during this contribution but I look forward to Members returning to the subject during the lifetime of this Seanad as required and hopefully often.  I again warmly welcome the Minister to this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the motion and wish to share time with Senator Healy Eames.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>In the brief time available, I will emphasise the importance of tourism.  It is an important industry that collectively we probably neglected in recent years.  However, I am delighted it forms an essential component of the programme for Government.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  He has taken a firm initiative in this area that concentrates on the domestic market and on attracting more visitors to this island.  This is the way forward and that message must go out locally to the domestic market.  Senator Paul Coghlan mentioned the current Discover Ireland marketing programme, of which all Members probably are aware as they will have received a booklet in their newspapers over the past week.  It is very important and sends out a message to families and individuals that there is much to do and much one can do in Ireland.</P>
        <P>While reading the booklet, I noted the programme comprises more than just a booklet, as it also has a website.  A mobile phone application is available which gives information on events and accommodation throughout the country.  Such initiatives encourage people to travel and to take short breaks such as day trips or weekend breaks in this country.  The Discover Ireland booklet targets overseas visitors, who are very important to the tourism sector.  The travel tax has been abolished.  I wish the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, well in his discussions with the airlines.  The UK air connection is vital.</P>
        <P>I refer to when I wore a different hat, so to speak, that is, when I was lord mayor of Cork.  The connections from Cork Airport to cities in the UK such as Liverpool, Leeds, Bristol, London and Newcastle are very important and if one such connection is lost, then a significant number of visitors to a region is lost.  I do not know if it would be possible to subsidise those routes but we must remember the importance of those air connections because once they are lost, they are gone for a long time.  They need to be targeted, managed, marketed, massaged and cared for because of their importance.  The visit of the Queen will be of great value in attracting visitors from the United Kingdom, which is our most important international market, and such visitors will use a local connection if it is available in Cork, Dublin or Shannon.  We should not underestimate the importance of regional air connections to the UK.</P><Col N="72"/>
        <P>The product offered to domestic and overseas tourists includes festivals and a variety of cultural and artistic attractions.  I refer to the Volvo ocean race which was a significant event in Galway last year and will return next year.  Such events and festivals put Ireland on the map.  The recent jobs initiative has gone a long way towards improving our competitiveness and value for money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to the House.  It is nice to see him in the right hot seat.  This is a positive and forward-looking motion on which I congratulate Senator Paul Coghlan.  Tourism spans the length and breadth of the country.  It has the potential to benefit every parish and city and, uniquely for an industry, it distributes wealth.  It has the potential to reach into parts of the country which manufacturing companies might not even consider.  I am regularly reminded by people in Clifden that tourism is Clifden&rsquo;s Intel.  Its importance gives rise to implications for access and infrastructure.  We must not forget that people live in places other than in the capital.</P>
        <P>A number of issues impact upon and determine our tourism performance.  The central objective of any tourism initiative must be to get bums on seats and to bring in more tourists which will create jobs in the process.  Every initiative, from the abolition of the air travel tax to the implementation of the visa waiver scheme aimed at specific emerging markets to the all-island approach adopted by Tourism Ireland, is very positive, as is the co-operation with the airlines and other stakeholders.  Tourism is one of the most efficient sectors in creating employment.  If visitors come, they must be served.</P>
        <P>I refer to statistics relating to an hotel in Galway.  Tourism is a labour-intensive sector.  A Galway hotelier informed me that every 50 visitors using his restaurant means he can hire one person.  If this figure is extrapolated it shows that for every one million tourists coming to Ireland, there is a potential for 20,000 jobs to be created.  I hope Ryanair takes up the challenge offered by the Minister when he lifted the air travel tax.  This has been one of the most progressive initiatives with a view to creating more jobs.  The Government is also to be congratulated on its decision to reduce PRSI and VAT rates on tourism related activities.</P>
        <P>The cost of employment must be considered.  I ask the Minister to address the joint labour committees, JLCs, in the context of Sunday working time.  The rate in Galway is &euro;10.12 whereas there is an exemption from the JLC in Dublin where the rate is &euro;8.65.  I ask the Minister to explain the difference because this is not a level playing pitch.  I ask him to address the capital versus rural divide in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Clune has touched on the importance of competitiveness and the unique selling point of our product.  It is essential to create niche markets and I ask the Minister to encourage proposals in this area.  I refer to marine tourism events such as the Volvo ocean race, educational tourism events such as summer schools, and cultural tourism events such as the Writing Ireland initiative in which both the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport and I were involved.</P>
        <P>We must ensure the national infrastructure is adequate in order that visitors can travel to the regions.  I refer in particular to airports.  I have a question for the Minister which was put to me by tourism outlets in the west.  Why is Aer Lingus continuing to bypass Shannon Airport when flying from the United States?  I refer to businesses such as Cashel House Hotel which provides almost all the employment in its area but which is disadvantaged by the fact that Aer Lingus flights from the US do not touch down in Shannon.  I ask the Minister in his reply to deal with the issue of regional development and regional jobs.</P>

        <P LI="1">After &ldquo;improved&rdquo; in the last line to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;supports the conclusion of the Duffy/Walsh report which found that lowering of the basic JLC rates is unlikely to have a substantial effect on employment in the tourism and hospitality sector;</P>

        <P FLI="0">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht suimi&uacute;il againn.  This Fianna F&aacute;il amendment to the motion is tabled in a positive and proactive spirit, a policy enunciated by our leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, on the election of the Taoiseach.  We do not intend to object and oppose for the sake of it.  This is the reason we have accepted the entire body of the substantive motion.  We have added what we regard as important additional segments and I hope they will be supported in return.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is accepted by all that tourism is a very important industry for Ireland, not least in my own county of Kerry.  On that note, may I congratulate my colleague, Senator Paul Coghlan, on his forbearance because he got through his entire speech without once mentioning Muckross or even Killarney, and that is certainly a first.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, in the national interest.  I have collected some statistics which I might as well show off.  The tourism sector delivered approximately &euro;4 billion in foreign revenue earnings and &euro;1.3 billion in tax receipts.  It underpinned 200,000 jobs in 2009, right in the middle of the banking crisis.  This is quite an achievement.  Tourism in general is a good news story.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The chief executive officer of Tourism Ireland, Niall Gibbons, announced last week that trips to Ireland from abroad had increased by 8.6% in the first quarter of the year and visits from non-EU countries had increased by 12%.  These figures are ahead of expectations and indicate that tourism will continue to be a big leader in our economic recovery.  Dublin is regarded as an area for potential tourism growth.  The Aviva Stadium and the new convention centre will contribute to increased tourism figures for Dublin.</P>
        <P>I draw the attention of Members to the Fianna F&aacute;il tourism action plan, not least because the entire Government programme seems to be built on and copied from it.  We welcome this as the sincerest form of flattery and have no objections whatsoever to the Minister stealing our clothes once it is in the national interest.  In that regard, the number of Fianna F&aacute;il policies which were treated with scorn and odium by the current Government when it was in Opposition and that have suddenly become acceptable is phenomenal.  Not only have they become acceptable, they have been dressed up in new clothes and repackaged and are now absolutely wonderful. It has never happened before and I take my hat off to the Government for its brass neck.</P>
        <P>Access to our tourism destinations and the internal transport network are very important.  We support the Government&rsquo;s initiative in removing the air travel tax on condition that the airlines bring in additional passengers.  In that regard, it is very important we protect our smaller <Col N="74"/>regional airports such as Kerry and others.  I refer to Kerry because it is the one I know best and is important infrastructure for us.  It has enhanced our tourism capacity, not only in Kerry but in the south west.  I am sure the same is true of other regional airports.</P>
        <P>The same is true for the Cork-Swansea ferry which the outgoing Fianna F&aacute;il Government put a lot of work and commitment into and which is now back in full swing.  It is important the Minister keeps a benevolent eye on the route because it is a difficult trading market and regime.  It may need further assistance, including monetary assistance, from his Department, which I hope will be forthcoming.</P>
        <P>When people say that Fianna F&aacute;il blew the boom and asked what it did during it, I tell them to look at the national primary roads of the country.  When I was a teacher in Dublin in the 1970s and I wanted to go home to Kerry for the weekend, it took me four and a half hours.  Last Monday I came up in two hours and 40 minutes without exceeding the speed limit anywhere.  It is important when people come into any part of our country, such as Dublin, Cork, Belfast or Galway, that they are able to access all the available tourist destinations.</P>
        <P>Why do people come to Ireland?  I will quote Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and I hope I am not stealing his thunder.  I heard him address a meeting and he said people come to Ireland for three reasons: our people, our scenery and our culture.  Obviously they want to get good value while they are here.  We must protect the natural environment we have and work hard to ensure our beaches, mountains and lakes are unpolluted, crystal clear and in pristine condition for people to visit.  We must also ensure we protect our built heritage, castles and monastic sites and all the other wonderful things people from abroad find so fascinating when they come here.</P>
        <P>The one problem I have is that we have traditionally been known as Ireland of the welcomes and people like the genuine Irish welcome when they come to a guesthouse or hotel.  It was always part of our deal.  In these changing times, increasingly one finds that reception, bar or restaurant staff will probably not be Irish but rather foreign nationals.  That is the way things are; I am not making any adverse comment.  We have to compensate for the reduction in the Irish input in other ways.  Tourists will not fall for phoney Irishness and paddywhackery which we have seen developing in the best tourist destinations in recent times.</P>
        <P>Tourists are discerning.  They want to meet us and see how we operate and enjoy life.  They want to have good food and hear our music.  They want to visit our ancestral places and get good value and a pleasant reception.  This is what is important.  Like 42 other colleagues, I spent many weeks this year driving around Ireland on the Seanad trail or, as it is better known, the Discover Ireland trail.  I stayed in various hostelries throughout the country and, invariably, found that the service and reception were good.  We must talk these things up and be positive if we can.</P>
        <P>Sport is a major growth area for tourism and that is why Fianna F&aacute;il must be praised for the amount of money it put into stadiums and the convention centre.  They were far-sighted decisions.</P>
        <P>I want to comment briefly on the royal visit and that of President Obama.  I say hats off to everyone, including Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, the Taoiseach, the Government, the army, the Garda and the OPW.  Everyone played their part and it would be very churlish of us not to say that.  The spin-off from the visits will be huge.  The statistics are available and there was a very good article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> about the immediate spin-off from the visits.  I do not have time to refer to them now because I want to refer to a final point.</P>
        <P>We know that joint labour committees, JLCs, are important.  There has to be regulation in the payment of staff and it is important for the hospitality sector.  We must be competitive.  Our front bench has agreed to fully support the Duffy report.  However, we are not agreeing to the <Col N="75"/><i>ad hoc</i> extension the Minister, Deputy Bruton, seems to be considering.  I was delighted he was called in by the Taoiseach and said he will revise his decision.  We cannot afford loose thinking about something as important as the wage levels which have been worked out and improved over many years.</P>
        <P>Obviously there is a clear division in Government over the issue.  The Labour Party is not happy about it and I would be amazed if it could be.  Some of the Ministers are not agreeing with each other, and not for the first time, present company included.  There is good work going on and the Minister has our support and co-operation for anything good he does.  We do not mind him stealing our clothes if it is in the national interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the amendment.  I welcome the Minister to the House. I have to pinch myself when I consider that this Government of all the talents &mdash; I do not mean that in the pejorative sense &mdash; includes people such as the Minister who is at a very tender age and has a very bright future ahead of him.  However, he has been thrown in at the deep end to some degree and it reminds me of a previous Fianna F&aacute;il Administration in the 1960s which was seen at the time as the Government of all the talents.  Cycles come and go and I genuinely wish the Minister well.  He has hit the ground running.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the decision by Fine Gael to table this important motion in the opening days of the new Seanad.  It confirms the importance the new Government has placed on tourism and follows on from a similar commitment by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administration.  The initiatives launched by the last Government are now beginning to bear fruit, as confirmed by the first quarter figures which show a 9% increase in tourism numbers, the first in three years.</P>
        <P>However, I am sure the Minister would agree that we cannot read too much into these figures because the first quarter figures comprise about 20% of the overall visitors to Ireland in any given year.  The third quarter figures will confirm whether the tourism industry is back on track.  I am willing to concede that it is clear we have reached the bottom and that real tourism jobs, which dropped from 243,666 in 2007 to 180,000 in 2010, will start to increase this year.  I would be interested to know if the figure is accurate.  It came from the hotel industry and it seems to be a considerable drop.  I did not think the drop would be as significant over a three-year period. I am curious to know how many people the Department assesses as being employed directly in tourism.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that reliable, up-to-date statistics are the lifeblood of any business, in particular in the tourism industry, and a decision by the Central Statistics Office to stop producing monthly figures is having a detrimental impact.  It is vital our State agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, have up-to-date figures to respond quickly to changing trends in what is a volatile market at the best of times.</P>
        <P>Other agencies, such as the Irish Tourism Confederation, which represents hotels, bed and breakfast outlets and the major air and sea carriers, also requires up-to-date statistics to have a more effective strategy and to be able to respond quickly.  I understand the Central Statistics Office, CSO, has cited a lack of resources as the reason for issuing quarterly figures.  As I am sure the Minister will agree, it is unacceptable that the first quarter figures to the end of March have only become available at the beginning of June, while the most important statistics, those for the third quarter which is the busiest time of the tourism year, will not be available until November.  I urge the Minister to use his influence to provide the necessary resources to the CSO.  While I appreciate that in difficult times the Minister must watch every cent spent, I propose that the Central Statistics Office be permitted to immediately recruit students and-or interns to work on the relevant calculations and thereby ensure the availability of more up-to-date statistics.  It should not be difficult for the office to employ students who are in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and seeking employment.  While I do not wish to <Col N="76"/>demean the role of the CSO, compiling statistics does not require one to have three or four first class honours degrees.  My proposal would also provide useful experience for people who are out of work and a solution, albeit short term, to the current problem.  As the Minister will agree, it is vital that up-to-date statistics are available, especially as they are showing something of an upturn in the tourism sector.</P>
        <P>The first quarter figures for sea carriers also show an increase in tourist numbers.  Companies operating on the Irish Sea are expecting an increase in numbers of between 3% and 4% this year, which suggests that the promotional strategy of Tourism Ireland in Great Britain is proving effective.  This year, Tourism Ireland increased its marketing expenditure in the United Kingdom by 30% to &euro;17 million, all of which is taxpayers&rsquo; money.  It also commenced a European media blitz in March.  I compliment the agency&rsquo;s chief executive, Mr. Niall Gibbons, on the proactive manner with which he has been selling Ireland abroad.  His name is becoming increasingly familiar to television viewers and those involved in the media.  He has put his heart and soul into tourism promotion in recent years and I wish him and his team continued success.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note that Ireland ranks seventh on a list of places British holiday makers wish to visit.  While the trickle down effect of the recent visit of Her Majesty the Queen may not be felt until next year, I agree with Mr. Gibbons that our place in the affections of our nearest neighbours provides a solid base for the recovery of our most important market.  On the wider European front, Tourism Ireland is to be commended for launching a major promotional push in our two largest European markets.  Some 40 million potential French and German visitors have been viewing images of Ireland on their television screens since the beginning of April in a promotion encouraging tourists to visit Ireland.  Tourism Ireland could not carry out such promotions without a Government input through the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  I commend the Minister in that regard and ask him to keep the money flowing because promotion is a vital aspect of our drive towards increasing tourist numbers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The motion refers to the introduction by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform of Ireland&rsquo;s formal visa waiver programme which will facilitate and encourage tourism to Ireland from key emerging markets.  This is a reference to the growing potential of Asia.  I had the opportunity to visit Taiwan earlier this year in the company of the Minister of State with responsibility for small business, Deputy John Perry, a constituency colleague who, as president of the Ireland-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Society did enormous work in recent years to improve ties between our two countries.  I learned at first hand that the removal of visa requirements for citizens of Taiwan had resulted in increased visitors to Ireland.  Our close relationship with China and other south-eastern countries and the removal of visa requirements for visitors should result in an increase in tourist numbers, especially in 2012 when the Olympic Games will be held in London.</P>
        <P>I welcome the decision to reduce VAT on the tourism sector to 9%.  This measure provides a wonderful incentive which will result in substantial savings, especially for small restaurants, caf&eacute;s, family run hotels and bed and breakfast providers.  The owner of a small business employing five or six people in the tourism sector in County Leitrim has projected that the measure will result in an annual saving of &euro;60,000.  This indicates that jobs will be protected and employment opportunities will result.  The VAT reduction is a positive policy decision which will make a difference, especially in the north west which traditionally relies on tourism, and prevent small enterprises from going out of business.</P>
        <P>The proposed abolition of the air travel tax follows a decision by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to reduce the tax from &euro;10 to &euro;3.  The condition attached to the abolition proposal is the same as the condition attached to the former Minister&rsquo;s decision to reduce the level of the tax.  At that time, Ryanair made clear that abolition would be followed <Col N="77"/>by increased tourism numbers and new routes into Ireland.  However, in response to a query I raised with Michael O&rsquo;Leary of Ryanair last October as to what exactly his company would deliver on foot of a reduction of the air travel tax or its abolition, Mr. O&rsquo;Leary made clear he wanted the Dublin Airport Authority dismantled and a reduction in landing charges at the State owned airports.  The former Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Mary Hanafin, met the same response in bilateral discussions with Ryanair and the current Minister is obviously encouraging the same response.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister stated that the &euro;30 million raised from tax over the 18 month period will be recycled and spent on tourism promotion.  For the 18 months that this has been reviewed to identify whether Ryanair and Aer Lingus move in the direction we seek, which I doubt they have done, the &euro;30 million will go into the balance sheet of Ryanair, an airline which charges for drawing one&rsquo;s breath when one boards one of its aeroplanes.  What will happen when it transpires in 18 months that the airlines have not delivered?  I genuinely wish the Minister well with Ryanair and Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary and, to a lesser extent, Aer Lingus but I hope he will play hardball with them on this issue.  Mr. O&rsquo;Leary is coming under increasing pressure across Europe as European airports raise their charges which puts the Minister in the driving seat.</P>
        <P>Tourism is the second most important indigenous industry, after agriculture, and a vital artery in the economic life of the north-west region.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>Developing tourism is the most immediate means at our disposal of addressing the unemployment crisis.  I commend the measures taken by the Government thus far, including the abolition of the air travel tax and reduction in the lower VAT rate.  On the decision to allocate &euro;1 million for a Discover Ireland promotional campaign, I refer to comments made by Mr. Niall Gibbons of Tourism Ireland at a recent conference in Galway at which he argued that the Government did not invest sufficiently in trying to capture the emerging markets of China and India.  We need to address this issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney noted that, prior to the visit of the Queen, Mr. Gibbons had pointed out that British tourists did not view Ireland as a destination because they believed Ireland has the same type of infrastructure as Britain, for example, Irish and British cities have the same high street shops.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The British do not view Ireland as a foreign country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>We must promote rural Ireland to attract tourists from Britain which will require us to focus on promoting our lakes, rivers and landscape and the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.</P>
        <P>I support the decision by Irish Rail to introduce a special fare promotion.  This should be extended to Bus &Eacute;ireann by offering bus travel vouchers to any tourist who arrives at a regional airport.  If a tourist has a voucher to travel on a half empty bus, he or she will spend money discovering the magic of our rural areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the decision to waive visas from certain countries with a view to attracting visitors from the Chinese and Indian markets.  As I noted last week, it was significant that NBC covered President Obama&rsquo;s visit to Moneygall for ten minutes.  The future of our tourism product lies in a focus on rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>I feel passionately about the opportunities that could arise from making use of the social welfare budget for tourism purposes.  If, for example, an employer was given 50% of the social welfare payment of every person he employed in the tourism sector, we could save &euro;1.1 billion per annum and create 100,000 jobs in tourism.  This issue should be addressed.  While it may require us to pay a price, it would also deliver a significant reduction in costs.</P><Col N="78"/>
     
        <P>Looking at the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to the motion, as a west of Ireland man, I would have to agree that the acceleration of the western rail corridor is very important, as is road infrastructure to open up the west generally.  In addition, I have been calling for a re-evaluation of the rates structure for the past two years.  As far as I know, there have only been three pilot schemes so far, which were initiated in Dublin, and they all reflected a 35% reduction in rates in those particular county council areas.</P>
        <P>I have one criticism to make of us, as a nation.  Going back 30 or 40 years, areas of the country were alive with tourism but we started to price ourselves out of the market.  Last week was significant in this respect due to some major events, as Senators who must stay in Dublin hotels three nights a week will know.  If one did not reserve a room well in advance, the price may have risen from &euro;59 per night to &euro;290.  This quick-buck mentality will not work, so we must address the situation.  When it comes to tourism and turning the country around, we are in this for the long haul, so the quick-buck mentality should be taken out of the equation.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and hope this is the first of many times that he will visit us.  I also hope that he will bring good news every time he comes here.  His is the one Department from which we can expect to have good news in these bad times.  I will not bore the House by repeating all the initiatives that have already been put in place because Members are well aware of them.  I wish to support the motion in the light of ongoing job losses, including the absence of industrial, financial, commercial and construction employment all over Ireland.  Unemployment in these sectors is prevalent in my own county of Kerry where, in recent weeks, job losses have been announced at Fexco in Killorglin and Aetna in Castleisland.  The focus of recovery should be brought back to tourism, which is the one industry that has grown since the foundation of the State.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s quality scenery, our renowned hospitality, good quality food and top class accommodation attract tourists, so we must protect the tourism product upon which we depend so much.  This can be done by maintaining a balance between protecting the natural environment and ensuring that tourism develops in a sustainable manner.  Ireland has always been promoted as a clean, green tourism destination, famous for its landscapes, environment, natural habitats, bio-diversity and culture.</P>
        <P>Tourism has the capacity and the stock to achieve further growth, while indigenous sectors, especially farming and traditional manufacturing, face difficulties.  The economic importance of tourism cannot be understated, in conjunction with consumer spending, employment and tax revenue.  While the recent jobs initiative will be a major boost to the tourism industry, we cannot ignore the fact that tourist numbers are down, with the biggest decline being in the British market.  The recent visit of Queen Elizabeth II will have highlighted Ireland in a very positive way among people in the UK and elsewhere, as did the visit of President Barack Obama.  Hopefully, we will soon see the benefits of those visits with a welcome injection of much needed tourism revenue.</P>
        <P>Tourism is a key source of income in rural areas, so it is imperative that we retain and enhance our regional airports.  It is vital that the PSO be retained for those airports.  In this day and age it is all about convenience, so the more flights we can put in place, the more attractive <Col N="79"/>and attainable rural Ireland becomes for foreign visitors, thus creating an obvious spin-off.  Meanwhile, more and more Irish people are opting for &ldquo;staycations&rdquo; and it is a known fact that domestic tourists spend four times more than their foreign counterparts.  While F&aacute;ilte Ireland should be commended for its 2011 Discover Ireland promotional campaign, much work remains to be done in marketing the country abroad, particularly in new, emerging markets.</P>
        <P>Activity holidays are becoming increasingly popular and each county is developing facilities to cater for this demand.  The county partnerships are proactive in enhancing, promoting and creating employment in such areas and are always open to developing new initiatives in the tourism sector.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a surfer&rsquo;s paradise, a golfer&rsquo;s dream and a fisherman&rsquo;s haven with limitless potential.  It is our duty to ensure that this potential, which we are capable of, is reached.  We must continue to extend the famous c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to the whole world.  In the words of a recent famous visitor, President Obama, is feidir linn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is welcome to the House and I am delighted he is here.  I will attempt to put down ten different ideas, rather than repeat what has been said earlier.  First, can we instil the boomerang principle in everybody in the Irish tourism business?  I grew up in a holiday camp and I recommend that anybody who has a chance of being born again should do their best to be reborn in a holiday camp.  My father built Red Island holiday camp in Skerries after the war and the principle for English guests was that they paid on arrival.  The objective was to have them come up at the end of the week and say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming back again next year&rdquo;.  We should instil that concept into everybody in the Irish tourist business.  The objective is not to get as much money off our guests on this occasion, but to get them to return the following year.  That does not only apply to hotels, but to everybody in the tourism business.</P>
        <P>Another point concerns food tourism.  Around the world, many people decide where to go based on the attractiveness of food in a given region.  For example, visitors come to Kinsale because of the wonderful selection of restaurants there.  In addition, people will drive out of their way to visit Gregans Castle in the Burren and Moran&rsquo;s of the Weir in County Galway, which have established high standards.  The village of Howth, where I come from, is like that also.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister do all he can to get the Olympic torch to pass through Ireland on its way to London next year?  It should be carried not just to the North of Ireland but also down here, which would provide an extra benefit.</P>
        <P>Is there anything we can do to get ourselves into the Schengen area?  Can we coax Britain or do anything else to achieve that goal?  I know we do not want a situation whereby British visitors would require passports to visit here, but is there anything we can do to encourage them and ourselves to ensure that people will not need passports to come here from other parts of Europe?</P>
        <P>Can we do anything to encourage the British to change to daylight saving, thus adopting central European time that would give us an extra hour of daylight all year round?  If so, that would be of huge benefit for the tourism business.</P>
        <P>I am impressed by the steps that have already been taken with regard to visas.  A year ago, we brought this problem to the then Minister&rsquo;s attention, which was the cost of visas for people coming from the Far East or Russia.  The cost of visas for a family of four coming here from such places would have been &euro;240, even if they had British visas.  I am delighted, therefore, that steps have been taken in that area so that the British visa will also apply to Ireland.</P>
        <P>As other speakers have said, there are great tourism opportunities in China, India and the Middle East.  According to the statistics, some 60 million Chinese plan to holiday abroad each <Col N="80"/>year.  In addition, they spend twice as long on holidays as other nationalities.  Some places around Europe have recognised the potential and are doing marvellous things.  For example, in Geneva, Paris and London, Mandarin-speaking staff are employed in shops to serve Chinese customers.  In this regard, Irish hotels should ensure that their websites have a Mandarin-language option.</P>
        <P>It is amazing to consider that Harrods department store in London has seen a 40% increase in sales to wealthy Chinese tourists since it installed 75 special Chinese credit card reader terminals.   The increase is largely due to the fact that Chinese bank cards are not recognised outside China because they use a separate card processing method via China Union Pay, CUP, card terminals.  According to Harrods, Chinese tourists visiting from mainland China have to bring a lot of cash when they travel abroad because so few places have CUP terminals.  In London, the only other store that has those terminals is Selfridges &mdash; which is basically an Irish store now as it is part of Brown Thomas &mdash; where sales to Chinese shoppers have seen double digit growth since the installation of those terminals there.  Our retailers need to consider something like that initiative.</P>
        <P>Another idea is to bring tourists to rural Ireland through the provision of free air tickets.  There has been much debate in recent months about the need for regional airports, a point to which the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to the motion refers.  Regional airports in Galway, Sligo and Waterford are facing closure this year.  Could we come up with some new ideas to attract new customers to the airports and at the same time bring tourists to some of the less well known areas of the country?  For instance, the Japanese have come up with a radical idea.  On the southern island of Kyushu a group of businessmen, bureaucrats and academics have proposed establishing free flights for people from South Korea, China and Taiwan, subsidised by the Government.  The project proposes launching 35 flights a week between eight airports inKyushu, using ten small jets currently under development by Mitsubishi.  To qualify, passengers must buy vouchers worth about &euro;1,000 to shop, eat, sleep or get medical treatment in the area.  It could be viewed perhaps as the aviation equivalent of giving away the razor and selling the blades.  There is something we could do in that area as well.</P>
        <P>Another idea is to use Irish ex-pats to promote Irish tourism abroad.  There is great potential for the massive network of Irish people worldwide to help promote Ireland as a tourism destination.  There is a network of millions already in place to help promote Ireland.  I have been thinking about how to exploit this.  I came across an initiative in New Zealand introduced by the Kiwi Expat Association.  The ex-pats&rsquo; network has grown to 25,000 members.  Its mission is to contribute to the growth, development and future prosperity of New Zealand by facilitating and sharing the knowledge, contacts and opportunities around the world.  The association has started a scheme called &ldquo;Pass It On&rdquo; which aims to get ex-pat New Zealanders to spread the word about everything the country has to offer.  With funding, distribution and content support from a variety of New Zealand partners, the effort offers monthly prize draws for participants with Kiwi-centric prizes for the winners.  Participants begin by signing up with the effort and then they share stories from the Pass It On site with family, friends and colleagues &mdash; sharable videos, focus on travel and cuisine, creative talent, and business and innovation.  When the recipients of these stories follow the sender&rsquo;s link back to Pass It On and sign up, the sender earns pass points.  These points then become entries in a prize draw that takes place on the second Monday of each month.  Prizes range from small prizes to an opportunity for four New Zealanders living overseas to bring their best foreign friends to New Zealand for a week of &ldquo;money-can&rsquo;t-buy&rdquo; experiences.  This scheme has been ramped-up in anticipation of the Rugby World Cup this year.</P><Col N="81"/>
        <P>The scheme information states: &ldquo;New Zealanders love to promote their country but all too often we talk about the same things &mdash; beautiful scenery, bungy jumping, sailing and the All Blacks.&rdquo;  The Pass It On initiative is designed to give New Zealanders and friends of New Zealand, no matter where they are in the world, some extra incentives to start these conversations and a toolkit to help them tell a better story.  In a similar way,  Irish people can go way beyond Guinness to be able to do what they want.</P>
        <P>On that basis, the steps the Government has taken are very worthy and I support them.  I am interested to note the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment and Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to the motion do not contain the words &ldquo;we condemn the Government motion&rdquo;, rather they add to it.  We all recognise the steps that have been taken are the right ones.  I encourage the Minister to continue in that direction because this is a quick fix.  It is possible to get people working very quickly rather than having to make a huge educational trend on that basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman.  This is my maiden speech in the Seanad and I am delighted to make it.  First, I would like to congratulate the 49 Senators who were elected to the House.  The Seanad campaign is a tough and gruelling one.  Candidates probably get to see the country in a way most tourists do not get to do.  I hope it is a campaign I never have to do.  If the Government had its way, it may even be one I never have the opportunity to do, but we will see about that another day.</P>
        <P>I would like to particularly congratulate the 11 Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees.  Both the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste did the Seanad a service by appointing a large number of people from outside the traditional party political networks.  Governments in the past have spoken a great deal about political reform.  This Government has shown it is serious about it by the Taoiseach appointing the 11 Senators in the way he did.  There are also the changes to the number of committees and the many measures that have already started.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this motion.  It highlights the importance the Government attaches to tourism as a key contributor to economic recovery as well as the practical steps it is taking to enable tourism to generate jobs and exports right across the country.  I have no doubt the Seanad will agree that the tourism sector will be a key driver of Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  It makes a vital contribution to employment, economic activity and exports.  It brings revenue to every part of the country and provides job opportunities to people across a range of skill levels.  Furthermore, it can play a vital role in shaping the international perception of Ireland, as we saw over the course of the last few weeks.  That is why the Government has placed so much importance on tourism as a vehicle for economic recovery both within the programme for Government and the recent jobs initiative.</P>
        <P>The decision to reduce VAT as applied to a range of labour-intensive and tourism-intensive services to 9% will provide a much needed support to the sector and will further improve the competitiveness of the services we provide for tourists, particularly in terms of accommodation and restaurants.  There is a perception internationally that Ireland is an expensive country to visit but that has changed in the past year or two largely as a consequence of the recession.  The fact that we are reducing VAT for those sectors will help a little bit more.  I am glad to note that <i>Hotels.com</i> has confirmed that Irish hotels are among the cheapest in Europe.</P>
        <P>The Government is also trying to help businesses by enhancing their competitiveness by significantly reducing the cost of employing people, by halving the cost of employers&rsquo; PRSI for those on modest wages.  I urge businesses to respond to both the VAT and PRSI cuts by reducing charges to consumers and ensuring services become even more competitive.</P><Col N="82"/>
        <P>Turning to my area of direct responsibility in regard to the jobs initiative, it fulfils the programme for Government commitment to an overseas access scheme which, essentially, is a three-pronged plan to promote inbound tourism.  The first prong is the abolition of the travel tax on the condition that airlines demonstrate a willingness to respond positively to this initiative.  That is why it has not been commenced to date.  There is also an offer from Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, of significant rebates.  Any airline that brings in additional passengers in any of the three airports will not pay passenger service charges in respect of those additional passengers they bring in.  There is also a targeted co-operative marketing campaign between Tourism Ireland, the airlines and the DAA.  By maintaining and rebuilding levels of access to and from overseas markets, we can help tourism to play its part in the export-led recovery which will secure our economic future.</P>
        <P>The first part of the strategy is the travel tax, the second part is the revised growth incentive and the third part is co-operative marketing between Tourism Ireland and the DAA.  The tourism marketing fund has &euro;41 million in total for this year and we wish to maintain our investment in the overseas marketing of Ireland so that it can fully implement its 2011 marketing plans.   As well as the direct investment in advertising and marketing, it is estimated that Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s general overseas publicity campaign will generate very positive media coverage for the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>On the issues raised about flights, I take on board what Members said.  When we are talking about flights in and out of Ireland, it is important to note that flights go out as well and we have to bear in mind that tourists leave the country.  For example, connections to the Canaries and Malta probably take more tourists out of the country than bring tourists into it.  It is important to bear that in mind.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Healy Eames asked why more aeroplanes do not stop at Shannon Airport.  The answer to that question is simple; airlines are not compelled to do stop there any more.  They will only do so if people want to get on or off aeroplanes there in large numbers.  If airlines cannot fill aeroplanes to about 75% of capacity, it is not economic for them to do so.  There are some cases where it is right to subvent air travel but they are relatively few.  It is inevitable that when one subvents air travel, one subvents many people leaving the country and many people on business trips and not necessarily tourists coming into the country.  That must be borne in mind.</P>
        <P>The Cork-Swansea ferry was mentioned.  I have given Cork Port permission to invest further in the Cork-Swansea ferry service, but it will be limited by state aid rules.  It is not possible to subvent ferry services &mdash; if money is given to one ferry service to Cork, it could be at the expense of a service to Rosslare &mdash; but we have approved an investment, which does not fall under state aid rules.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, we have been greatly boosted by the visits of Queen Elizabeth II and President Barack Obama.  These visits have helped to promote Ireland and tourism from overseas.  There have been more than 1,000 downloads of media packages from the Tourism Ireland website on the locations visited by the Queen and the President.  Tomorrow, I will travel to London to follow up on the state visit and to take part in a series of engagements organised by Enterprise Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  Later in the month, I will travel to Frankfurt with Tourism Ireland to tap the important German market.</P>
        <P>These efforts in accessing markets are being complemented by a radical change in our approach to visitors from new and developing markets through the new tourism visa waiver system.  From my visit to India in March, I know there are real opportunities to attract high value, high spending visitors from rapidly growing countries like India, China and Russia.  Although they are the fastest growing outbound markets for tourism, their tourists generally <Col N="83"/>require visas to enter Ireland, as they do for all of our neighbours.  Moreover, given the distances involved, it is not realistic to expect many visitors to travel to Ireland only.  Most will combine their trips with visits to the UK or another European country.  The measure we have introduced is essentially a UK plus visa, in that it allows people from the aforementioned countries and approximately 14 other states to visit Ireland without Irish visas, as they will be using their UK visas.  This will work well and come into operation soon.  Even though it will be marketed around the London Olympics, it will run on a trial period for more than one year to determine how well it works.  It will probably be introduced this summer and run until the end of next year.  We will see how it goes.</P>
        <P>We would like to join the Schengen Agreement or have a Schengen plus visa, but that is not possible because of the UK free travel area.  The UK is clear in that, were Ireland to enter into the Schengen arrangement, the free travel area would be no more.  This would mean setting up passport controls with Britain and Northern Ireland.  This is not something we are willing to contemplate.</P>
        <P>I agree with and endorse the comments on the boomerang principle.  We are working on bringing the Olympic torch South.  The House may have heard some of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s recent comments in this regard.  I do not want to speak out of turn on the matter, but the discussions are progressing satisfactorily.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn&rsquo;s points about the Asian markets are valid.  It is something I have witnessed in Ireland.  In light of the number of Asian people who descend on shops like Brown Thomas and so on during sales periods, I encourage retailers to provide whatever support they can.</P>
        <P>The suggestion re the ex-pat network is a good one.  If the Senator could put together a detailed proposal, it could be considered later this year at the Farmleigh II conference, which is the gathering of important Irish people from around the world.</P>
        <P>It is important to point out that tourism is not just a source of invisible exports.  It can help to keep money circulating in the economy.  Domestic tourism &mdash; Irish people visiting their own country &mdash; is worth more than &euro;1.3 billion to the economy annually.  With the Ministers of State at my Department, I was pleased in recent weeks to launch a strong package of measures for domestic tourism that avail of the synergies stemming from bringing tourism and transport into one Department.  The Discover Ireland summer 2011 campaign goes hand in hand with Irish Rail&rsquo;s offer of 50% discounts for anyone travelling by rail on Saturdays and some Sunday services.  I look forward to working with the CIE companies &mdash; Irish Rail, Bus &Eacute;ireann and the others &mdash; to get them to contribute as much as they can to boosting tourism.</P>
        <P>Other elements of the jobs initiative will support tourism.  For example, regional and local roads are vital for ensuring tourists can reach every part of the country and experience all that Ireland has to offer.  In terms of synergy within the Department, when we consider road programmes, we ask whether a road serves a tourism area, for example, and could we get more tourists into that part of the country if it had better roads.  The jobs initiative contains some proposals for tourism internships.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is actively engaging with tourism enterprises to ensure they take advantage of these schemes.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney was correct about statistics.  We are only getting quarterly statistics, not monthly statistics.  This is a problem, in that we are also getting them a quarter late.  The statistics we would receive today would be for January, February and March.  The tourism business changes rapidly and we need to be able to respond just as rapidly.  For this reason, we will have meetings to discuss the matter with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and to explore the Senator&rsquo;s suggestion of using students or interns from the tourism side to assist in collating the statistics.  Obviously, statistics must be collated well, as those that are not collated properly are of no use to anyone.</P><Col N="84"/>
        <P>Regarding the Opposition amendments on the joint labour committees, JLCs, and employment regulation orders, EROs, no Government decision has been made on the matter.  No decision will be made until later this month and following consultations with employers and unions.  The radical reform of these sectoral agreements would be beneficial to the tourism sector, which is affected by EROs extending to, for example, hotels, restaurants, cafes and golf courses.  The system is antiquated, outmoded and riven with anomalies.  As Senator Healy Eames mentioned, the hotel ERO applies in all parts of Ireland except the cities of Dublin and Cork.  It is not just a capital versus the rest situation either, in that the ERO does not apply in the Fingal, South County Dublin or D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown council areas.  The legal minimum rate in a hotel in Blanchardstown or Swords is much higher than the legal minimum rate in Santry or the Shelbourne.  This unusual situation is due to the fact that, when JLCs were originally set up, the cities of Cork and Dublin had highly unionised hotels that did not want a JLC, since they were doing better through collective bargaining.  How these situations turn over time is interesting.</P>
        <P>The system needs reform.  In contrast with many other areas of the economy, wages in the ERO sectors have increased.  For example, wages in the retail sector have increased while 25% of its jobs have been lost.  Other areas have seen greater flexibility.  I do not want to say more on the matter.  The Duffy-Walsh report has been published and the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation is consulting with the social partners on it.  He will revert to the Cabinet with detailed proposals on which a decision will be made.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and I will undertake to consider the constructive ideas that have been and will be put forward throughout the course of the debate.  One issue on which discussion is difficult but necessary is that of budget cuts.  It is not realistic to believe there will be no cutbacks in the tourism budgets.  Of course there will be.  Anyone who watched &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; and saw the impact of budget cuts on carers, the disabled and those who are dying will understand how difficult it will be to justify spending on, for example, tourism and transport while people are suffering.  Difficult decisions will be made, for which reason we need to know for certain that any investment in transport, tourism and sport will produce an economic return quickly.  It is money that is not going to someone who could die next year or whose child needs a special needs assistance.  I would be interested in knowing Members&rsquo; ideas as to which of the sector&rsquo;s budgets could be reduced while doing the least damage.</P>
        <P>It is not enough for a parliament to say that all of these areas should not be touched and that a government should put more money into this or that.  It is incumbent on a parliament and on an intelligent, sensible chamber such as this one to discuss some of the provisions that could be cut without the sky falling down.  For example, I would be interested in Senators&rsquo; views on how the capital budgets could be reprioritised.  Should we aim to put the money into a small number of attractions that would attract a large number of people or should we continue the current policy of spreading the money over a large number of attractions and counties?  I would also be interested in Senators&rsquo; views on how to restructure the tourism agencies.  There are many such agencies which operate on a North-South basis and at national, regional and local level.  I would be interested in hearing the views of Senators on that matter.  I would also be interested in hearing their views on any other initiatives the Government could introduce in order to stimulate tourism.  What we have done in the context of the jobs initiative represents a very good start.  It is, however, only a start and we intend to do a great deal more, particularly by bringing forward initiatives which would not be expensive to put into operation.  People bring forward great ideas, but they always involve spending money up front with the promise of a great deal more being generated down the line.  However, the real world does not tend to <Col N="85"/>work in that way most of the time.  As stated, I would welcome any ideas which Senators may wish to bring forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  He is very welcome.  I am delighted the Government decided to table this motion because it helps to underline the importance of tourism.  One in every ten jobs in this country relates to the tourism industry.  This is a vital statistic which we sometimes tend to ignore.  It is important to ensure the jobs to which I refer will be retained.</P>
        <P>I come from an area which lies in the shadow of the ancient Rock of Cashel.  I am, therefore, very conscious of the importance of tourism.  I am also conscious of the potential in respect of tourism&rsquo;s future development.  According to the findings of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, neither the collapse of the Celtic tiger nor the difficulties relating to the world economy have had a major adverse effect on Ireland.  It is important to dwell on this fact.</P>
        <P>There is a lovely photograph of the Minister in F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s newsletter.  He looks very well in the photograph which also features the chairman and CEO of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  I refer to this photograph in respect of the Minister&rsquo;s presence at Meitheal, the Irish travel trade fair which took place in April and was the largest trade fair of its kind ever held here.  This indicates that the future looks particularly bright.  Some 275 trade buyers from 20 countries attended the fair which I have attended on many occasions.  I must state this statistic is a source of great cheer for me.  Of the 275 trade buyers to whom I refer, some 56 were new buyers.  This shows that Ireland is still seen as an important tourism destination.</P>
        <P>A major survey of tourist preferences in Ireland was carried out 12 years ago.  It is interesting that the top preferences at the time were people, scenery, culture, history and national monuments.  A recent survey carried out among 500 people provided exactly the same results.  Some 50% opted for people as a preference which was followed by scenery, culture and history.  What we learn from this is that there is a constancy to what is on offer here, which is to our credit.  However, it reminds us that we must also take cognisance of the core strengths of this country as a tourism destination.  This does not mean we should not experiment or be innovative.  It is vital, however, to consider what is exclusive to Ireland.  The evidence indicates that our people, scenery, culture and history are exclusive.  It is that which is exclusive which attracts the discerning visitor.  In the past decade Ireland has been visited by more discerning tourists rather than by people just seeking budget holiday packages.</P>
        <P>Who is responsible for deciding the destinations within the country to which tourists travel?  The answer is tour operators.  If the vast majority of tourists are now staying in the Dublin region, this is as a result of decisions made by these operators.  I apologise to any Dublin Senators who may be present and I am not trying to take any business away from the capital.  I am just &mdash; as did Senator Kelly &mdash; speaking from experience.  When Shannon Airport was running at its peak some years ago and people were coming into the Shannon region, they tended to remain there for the duration of their stay.  As a result, Bunratty Castle, the Rock of Cashel and similar attractions tended to benefit.  Owing to the fact that Shannon Airport is no longer the gateway it once was, the region is definitely suffering.</P>
        <P>In the context of diversity, it is important to remember that what makes us attractive is what makes us different.  Of course, Dublin is different &mdash; it is a magnificent city.  However, there are so many other attractions throughout the country.  As Senator Fidelma Healy Eames stated, the tourism industry is well dispersed.  We are always discussing the importance of decentralisation.  There are some 40 million people of Irish extraction in North America and we are informed that there are some 70 million of Irish extraction across the globe.  Tens of millions have accessed the 1911 census website.  The reason for their so doing is that they are of Irish <Col N="86"/>extraction.  I make this point to illustrate the fact that we have a head start in gaining favour with the Diaspora.  However, we must also keep their needs in mind.</P>
        <P>It was suggested last year that in 2012 the tourism industry might consider launching a replica of An T&oacute;stal which still takes place each year in Drumshanbo and takes the form of a gathering to celebrate our culture.  Perhaps the Minister might indicate whether this proposal is still on the cards.</P>

	<P>These are the innovations I believe to be important.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight another statistic which shows why Ireland is different.  Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann was held in Cavan last year.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland carried out a survey during the course of the Fleadh Cheoil and discovered that it injected &euro;34.9 million into the economy.  That was from a single event.  We must consider where the big bucks are to be found when it comes to tourism.  What occurred at the Fleadh Cheoil can be replicated throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In 2013 Derry will be European City of Culture.  I received letters from Mr. Peter Robinson, MLA, and Mr. Martin McGuinness, MLA, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, respectively, asking that Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann be held in Derry in 2013.  That is important because tourism is now perceived as being on an all-island basis.  I recall a time when, before Tourism Ireland came into existence, people believed all tourism activities ended at the Border.  That is no longer the case.  We can draw strength from the fact that the entire island is open for business.  In that context, I would like the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister &mdash; I hope the Minister will support my suggestion &mdash; to come before the House to discuss the tourism industry with Members.  There would be no need to discuss politics or history.  If they did come, it would be an acknowledgement of the fact that Tourism Ireland is working and that it is reaching into the legislative process.</P>
        <P>The Acting Chairman is indicating that my time is exhausted.  Given that I was mentioned on &ldquo;The Marian Finucane Show&rdquo; for being too long-winded on the first day on which the House met, I had better respect the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s wishes.  Before I do so, I wish to state I believe the Minister will do a great job, about which I have no doubt whatsoever.  Those on the Government benches are aware from their time on this side of the House that this is one of the areas in respect of which we tend to co-operate.  After all, n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile &mdash; there is unity in strength.  It is in that light that we should move forward.</P>

	<P>I propose to share time with Senators Michael Mullins and Martin Conway.  </P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister on the practical approach he has taken to the tourism industry.  I also compliment him on the initiatives that have been introduced.  He inquired of Senators with regard to where we believed cuts might be made.  Tourism Ireland has an advertising and marketing budget of &euro;41 million.  This money should be spent on putting in place ambassadors on the ground rather than on television advertisements.  It is hard to sell the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte on the television when it is much easier to do so on a personal basis.  Recently, a hotelier <Col N="87"/>informed me his chain of hotels had a 40% increase in tourists coming from Great Britain which was due to opening a booking office there and allowed for one-to-one promotion.</P>
        <P>In 2007 the Marine Institute compiled a report, Water-based Tourism and Leisure Product Audit, which outlines the potential in marine tourism.  It stated in its conclusions:</P>
        <P LI="1">Ireland&rsquo;s island status gives it a comparative international advantage in marine and coastal tourism and most of the fifteen coastal counties have the potential to develop strong marine tourism products.  For each coastal county, this report sets out a detailed product assessment together with specific recommendations on filling service/product gaps.</P>
        <P LI="1">The absence of a coastline limits the ability of inland counties to compete on even terms.  However, water-based leisure products such as angling and boating still offer major potential for tourism development throughout the midlands. Despite nature&rsquo;s distribution of assets, inland water-based tourism may be in a stronger position to develop than coastal tourism.  This conclusion stems from the fact that dedicated statutory bodies manage the inland water resources.  On the other hand, marine resources fall under the influence of a large number of agencies with no one body given overall responsibility for co-ordinated development.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The report recommended &ldquo;a need for co-ordinated management of the marine and coastal resource.&rdquo;  However, it seems the report has been left to gather dust.  Will the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Michael Ring, get his officials to dust down this excellent report which contains much potential for job creation and water-based tourism?</P>

	<P>As a new Senator I have been impressed by how we have got our business off the ground.  People want to see the Seanad discuss important topics of the day and make a significant contribution to economic recovery.  The people are crying out for hope, and tourism can be the vehicle for significant economic recovery.  Never before have we had such a head start with the wonderful marketing opportunity provided by the high-profile visits of Queen Elizabeth II and the US President, Mr. Obama.</P>
        <P>Other Members spoke of the wonderful value for money available in our hotels and restaurants, some of it the best value in Europe.  The imaginative decisions made by the Government in recent weeks will help this sector with other savings.  I hope restaurants and hotels will pass these on to their customers.</P>
        <P>Festivals and events are a key element in our tourism business.  The umbrella body for festivals, the Association of Irish Festival Events, AOIFE, is headquartered in Ballinasloe, County Galway.  It assists in the running of 400 festivals across the country annually, many of which have an international dimension.  The organisation is run, however, on a shoestring budget and it has asked me to seek a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, to see how it can add value to the tourism product.</P>
        <P>Between 2013 and 2022 we will celebrate the centenary of many significant national historical events.  This presents us with the opportunity to attract significant and continuous numbers of visitors into the country.  Has the Government any plans to capitalise on these opportunities?  A special task force should be established to ensure these events are properly marketed and benefits are reaped.</P><Col N="88"/>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>The measures in the programme for Government and the jobs initiative already have given all those in the tourism industry significant hope.  County Clare is very reliant on tourism and hotels, restaurants and other service providers there have been given a boost by the jobs initiative.  These significant measures are reflective of the fact that tourism, the natural beauty of the countryside and our human resources are some of the few raw materials we have.  In its first nine weeks in office, the Government has demonstrated a serious commitment to tourism, the likes of which we have not seen before for some time.  We have been lucky with the visits of both Queen Elizabeth II and US President, Mr. Obama, which gave us an international tourism bounce.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In County Clare there is a campaign to have the Cliffs of Moher selected as one of the seven wonders of nature.  If successful, the domino effect for the national tourism product would be phenomenal.  Other countries are putting massive resources into their own campaigns.  In Poland, for example, police are giving out leaflets encouraging people to vote for its short-listed site.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, who I know is proactive in promoting domestic tourism, assign a senior departmental official to work with the Cliffs of Moher campaign to ensure it wins a place among the seven.  Such a win would be a serious strike in the right direction for marketing tourism and Ireland Inc. as a whole.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>We have been far too complacent with our tourism industry.  Since 2007, there have been 25% fewer visitors with a 30% drop in tourism revenues while over &euro;600 million was spent on tourism promotion.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, asked how one gets better value for money.  One has to examine such expenditure against such reductions in visitors and revenue.  Tourism is about product and price, not about quangos or marketing.  The recently published stability programme update adds approximately &euro;10 billion to the tax bill in this country.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, can achieve what he wants by decreasing expenditure rather than increasing taxation.  Can tourism survive if we require an extra &euro;10 billion in taxation?  Excess taxation and costs cause all sorts of trouble.  I welcome the abolition of the travel tax and wonder who came up with it.  Some 10% of people come to this island by sea and 90% come by air.  Europeans wishing to travel to Germany can get there by car or bus.  Travel tax for an island country was a crazy idea and the Government is correct to abolish it.  </P>
        <P>There is a problem with the Dublin Airport Authority rebate.  The Minister intervened with the regulator on 27 October 2009 to secure a 41% increase in airport charges, which is the reason the airlines are sore.  That information was leaked in an ESRI report.  Mr. Colm <Col N="89"/>McCarthy in his report on privatisation stated that Dublin Airport benefits from the support of a regulatory regime.  The maximum passenger charge increased by 41% between 2009 and 2011.  That should not have happened.  If one looks at Mr. McCarthy&rsquo;s numbers, one finds that the 25% reduction in passenger numbers at Dublin Airport Authority airports was accompanied by a 2% reduction in staff and as such staff productivity has fallen.  Mr. McCarthy also drew attention to the fact that the airports have engaged in an immense investment programme which has left them heavily in debt.  The Dublin Airport Authority should not have been exempted from regulation.  This is a quasi-judicial process in which the Minister intervened by letter to secure a 41% increase in charges.  This explains the reason for much of the annoyance.  Mr. McCarthy also points out that the effects of the regulatory settlement ordered by the Minister by letter is that current customers must pay increased charges to reflect excess capacity, a perverse outcome which could not arise in a competitive industry.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in the context of a shortage of money, to examine some of the things we do.  For instance, the 2009 annual report of the then Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism published in May records, under the heading &ldquo;Summary of Major Achievements&rdquo; outlines a reduction of 12% on the 2008 performance.  We have been throwing good money after bad.  We cannot even borrow money any more.  We must re-examine the &euro;600 million spend which resulted in 30% less revenue since 2007.</P>
        <P>Local authorities charge &euro;1,500 in rates for every hotel room.  The McLaughlin report recommends severe cuts in local authority management, in respect of which there is a surplus of approximately 1,000 managers.  That, rather that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government inventing extra taxation, should happen.  There is a problem with the high burden of local authority rates on the tourism sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no doubt that there is a problem in regard to promotion of transport within this country.  Part of the problem arose when in this House on 26 November 2009 the then Minister for Transport invoked Article 25.2.2&deg; of the Constitution and asked the President to sign into law the Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009 at an earlier date than normal.  That Bill guaranteed the entire CIE network as a monopoly without new entrants.  It also guaranteed it every penny of subsidy without any competitive tendering.  Approximately 44% of bus receipts in this country are from independent operators which the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has tried to keep out of business for years and in that regard invoked the Constitution on 26 November 2009.  The Dublin-Galway route once served by the monopoly with one bus a day is now served by 45 buses a day through three different operators.  We have made the cost of getting around this country unnecessarily expensive.  I hope that during my time as a Member of this House, Article 25.2.2&deg; of the Constitution will not be invoked to deny the President time to consider legislation, as to do so is draconian.</P>
        <P>The Wright report on the Department of Finance makes recommendations of wider relevance to governance.  It recommends major changes in budgetary processes that would enhance ministerial accountability to Parliament.  We need to know what we got for the &euro;600 million, the reason Ministers intervened to increase airport charges by 41% and the reason the Constitution was invoked to prevent bus companies from competing.  We must make this product competitive.  Now that no one will lend money to us we must get value for money.  That focus has not been present in relation to Irish tourism.  We must become more competitive if we are to recoup the 30% loss in receipts over the past four years.</P>

	<P>Much of what has been already said is reflected in every county in Ireland.  Donegal has the natural resources to attract tourists.  While it has been promoted to a certain degree we must up our game in this regard.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I have followed the Irish soccer team throughout Europe and beyond down through the years.  It has never been reported that an Irish soccer fan was arrested in any country following a match.  Up to 10,000 Irish soccer fans travel to attend matches in different cities throughout the world, which presents us with an opportunity to market our country.  Following the World Cup in Italy in 1990 many Italians came to Ireland.  Many people also visited Ireland after Stephen Roche won the Tour de France.  I am sure Senator Eamonn Coghlan has been responsible for bringing Americans to Ireland following his success as an athlete in the USA.  We have many resources that could assist us in bringing in more tourists.</P>
        <P>There is an Irish tourist office in every city in the world.  There are also Irish bars throughout the world, including in South America, Australia, Europe, Asia and America.  If one goes into an Irish bar one will see photographs of Kerry, Donegal, Dublin and so on but one will never see a tourist brochure, which would encourage people to visit Ireland.  While most Irish bars are not owned by Irish people we could tap into marketing Ireland through this facility rather than opening a tourist office in every country.</P>
        <P>Many of the big cities in England, including Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham, have large Irish populations, most of whom have never visited Ireland.  I have travelled through many UK airports and have never seen in any of them a stall promoting Irish tourism.  We are missing out because of this.  Approximately 40% of the population of Birmingham, Manchester or Liverpool have Irish roots.  These cities are only 30 minutes from Dublin and 45 minutes from Derry and Belfast.  We tend to focus more on the US market or other parts of the world.  The UK market is our biggest market and we should target it more aggressively.</P>
        <P>Irish fans will probably travel to Macedonia this Saturday for the match.  While not too many Macedonians may travel to Dublin or Ireland following that match, some 5,000 to 10,000 fans may travel to Andorra in October to see the Ireland-Andorra game and this may present us with an opportunity to develop that end of the tourism market.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to discuss this issue with us.  I commend the Government&rsquo;s initiatives so far in relation to tourism.  It is perhaps fair to say it is at local level that we will succeed.  It is, after all, the product people come here for.  When people from China or India arrive here, they want to enjoy themselves.  In that regard, I commend the launch tomorrow in Sligo of an initiative on behalf of all those in the area involved in tourism.  This is the first time they have come together in a really bold initiative to market Sligo.  While this initiative is funded by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, it involves the Leader company, the Western Development Commission, Sligo Marketing Forum, local businesses, Sligo Chamber of Commerce and the county development board, all of which see the potential of joined up thinking.  If there is no joined up thinking and people do not come together and say, &ldquo;We want to sell where we live and be proud of what we have here,&rdquo; the tourism industry will not be successful.  I accept Senator Sean Barrett&rsquo;s point that there is cynicism in marketing.  However, if one is marketing, it is important that one has something to market.  This kind of approach will bring about a win-win.</P>
        <P>The Minister asked about saving money and value for money.  I asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland how it would assess the programme it was launching on 6 June and which will be talked about tomorrow in Sligo.  It stated it would invite the tourism department of Sligo IT to analyse the figures and see precisely where the &euro;120,000 was spent and the impact it had had.  Involving Sligo IT, as another stakeholder in tourism, is to be commended.  The students of the institute will be <Col N="91"/>ambassadors for Sligo and tourism across the country.  I offer this as a suggestion to the Minister.  There must be other places where this is possible.</P>
        <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister mention the need for infrastructural improvement and to prioritise roads that lead to great tourism places.  No one can deny that the north west, Sligo in particular, is a great tourism destination.  Of course, we fall short with the N4.  Those of us who travel it regularly know how bad it is.  I know there is a proposal with the National Roads Authority to improve it.  I urge the Minister to look seriously at the proposal.  Sligo has gateway status, but the N4 is a difficult and dangerous road to travel.  I do not want to be entirely parochial.  However, Sligo Airport looks set to lose its funding and be placed at a potential disadvantage.  If that is the case, we must not be further disadvantaged by the lack of decent infrastructure.</P>
        <P>I commend the initiative being taken in Sligo and the joined up thinking it involves.  I commend it to the Minister.  If we are to succeed in tourism, we must start locally.  We must not rely on F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland or anybody else.  We must start at home on the ground.</P>

	<P>In that case I will definitely be keeping my maiden speech brief.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for being here for this debate.  Tourism is Ireland&rsquo;s most important domestic industry, accounting for one in ten jobs in every part of the country and at every level.  Tourism enterprises range from one or two people employed in a bed and breakfast establishment to huge groups in some bigger parts of the industry which has enormous potential as part of our economic recovery.  As our key markets in the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany start to recover, there will be potential to bring more people and revenue into the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recent years have been challenging for the tourism industry.  They have also been characterised by very strong co-operation between the previous Government and the industry, which should be acknowledged.  Despite the overall economic climate in the past few years, the previous Government appreciated the strategic nature of investment in tourism and ensured the overseas marketing budget was maintained, in real terms, in 2010.  That was significant.  Also, last year F&aacute;ilte Ireland undertook its biggest ever domestic campaign, with great results.</P>
        <P>Cost competitiveness is an important issue.  Hotel prices have come down dramatically and there is good value to be had.  Throughout the country the average cost of a hotel room is &euro;79 per night and the quality of our hotel product is top class and of world standard.  There remains, however, an issue in terms of food and drink prices.  In that regard, I welcome the reduction in VAT announced in the recent jobs initiative.  The May edition of the F&aacute;ilte Ireland magazine includes a visitor attitude survey that shows an increasing awareness that cost competitiveness has improved.  In 2010 some 25% of visitors cited cost as a disadvantage.  In 2011 the figure was 15%.  It is good to see the figures improving.</P>
        <P>Despite being an island nation, we are not good at marine tourism.  I live in a constituency where marine tourism has huge potential in Howth, Sutton and Portmarnock.  This sector should be developed.  With co-operation between the Departments with responsibility for transport, the marine and tourism, it has great potential.</P>
        <P>The gathering was mentioned by Senator Labhras &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  I understand it is more likely to take place in 2013 than in 2012.  There are 75 million people of Irish heritage throughout the world.  Could we convince a tiny proportion of them to come here?  This would be worth pursuing.  We should work with the Gaelic Athletic Association and run games for GAA teams <Col N="92"/>throughout America, Asia and the rest of the world.  Last year Fianna F&aacute;il proposed the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations be extended to a festival lasting a fortnight, attracting high-spend cultural tourists to spend a fortnight in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonnCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Eamonn Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a great honour for me to be nominated by the Taoiseach to the Seanad.  One of my friends said to me, &ldquo;Eamonn, you might have been chairman of the boards, broken world records and won world championships, but that is all in the past.  You are now a Senator.&rdquo;  It is with great honour that I join Senators.  All they have to do now is break a few world records to keep up with me.</P>
        <P>Sport and tourism are two areas of interest to me.  Sport is of interest for obvious reasons and tourism for reasons Senators are not, necessarily, aware of.  Senator John Crown made his maiden speech on the first day of the session.  He said he was not sure whether that was the appropriate day on which to do so.  He  had not been expecting to speak.  I was not expecting to make my maiden speech today.  However, today is 1 June, the first day of summer.  What better way to make my maiden speech in the Seanad?</P>
        <P>Senators are all aware of my interest in sport.  Tourism is also very close to my heart.  In 1977 I was employed by Bord F&aacute;ilte.  I was hired by the director general, Mr. Joe Malone to act as youth and education representative.  I looked after the foreign tour operators who came to Ireland, teaching English as a foreign language to European students.  I also worked in the United States when I asked to move to America to pursue a running career.  I worked with Stonehill College in Massachusetts and helped to bring the first Irish studies programme from the United States to UCD, whereby students could transfer their credits back to the United States while learning about Ireland.  Joe Malone&rsquo;s purpose was to use Eamonn Coghlan and the ambassadorial aspect of his running career to promote Irish tourism to the students of the United States.  He felt that visiting students would be the future leaders in the business, academic and political industries and become ambassadors for Irish tourism when they returned to their countries and businesses.</P>
        <P>In 1978 there were no grants for sportspeople.  The only way I could get time off to compete around the world was to do a deal with my boss in Bord F&aacute;ilte.  &ldquo;Discover Ireland&rdquo; has been talked about as the promotional theme for Irish tourism.  Back then I presented to my boss a T-shirt with the words &ldquo;Discover Ireland&rdquo; on the front and &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Great It&rsquo;s Green&rdquo; on the back.  I do not know if they used that theme.  However, I received permission to travel the world wearing this T-shirt which I presented to athletes such as John Walker, Don Quarrie and Lasse Vir&eacute;n.  These athletes were running around wearing &ldquo;Discover Ireland &mdash; It&rsquo;s Great It&rsquo;s Green&rdquo; T-shirts.</P>

	<P>I became aware of opportunities to promote my country through the medium of my sport.  I brought magazine journalists to Ireland.  I asked them not interview me in New York but in Ireland in order that they could show photographs of Ireland in <i>Sports Illustrated</i> and maximise the coverage of the country in that market.  I will go into more detail on these opportunities with the Minister at another time.  Athletes who are receiving taxpayers&rsquo; money through sports grants which we did not receive can be utilised in the same way today, if we go &ldquo;back to the future&rdquo;.  We can go back to what I was doing through the medium of sport and tourism and apply some of these principles.  I look forward to speaking to the Minister on that point and getting value for taxpayers&rsquo; money through our sports people.</P>

	<P>I have just one point to make as most issues have been raised.  Image is everything.  One of the things I am into in my professional life is packaging.  We know we have this wonderful advantage in that around the world we have an image of being exquisitely green, natural, pure and beautiful.  Members will agree that when tourists arrive, drive around the country and visit some of our villages, there is a lot of plastic signage, with no disrespect to a few big global brands, including those of some high street stores from the United Kingdom.  It is like buying a Barbie doll for one&rsquo;s child in that one can get the same toy anywhere in the world.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister of State to consider a fairly radical idea, namely, getting rid of all plastic signage in Ireland and bringing back wooden signs in every one of our towns.  Let us think of Adare, Kenmare, Kinsale or Kilkenny, which are all places I love to visit because I have this feeling that everything, including the food, will be gorgeous because of the exterior.  It is a small and slightly eccentric idea but, I believe, a strong one.  Let us get rid of plastic and bring in the old traditional wooden signage in order that when people come to visit, they will say: &ldquo;Wow.  This really is the Ireland I have dreamt about.&rdquo;  For the 70 million people throughout the world, that is what they think we are.  Let us not try to look like everyone else.</P>

        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />calls on the Government to expedite the rates re-evaluation review, in light of the burden which the Hotel and hospitality sector faces in the current climate;</P>

        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes that tourists are attracted to visit all parts of Ireland and believes that there is a need to realise fully the potential of All-Ireland Tourism; and</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />calls on the Government, with our partners in terms in the North, to investigate the potential of a single tourism body to deliver the effective, efficient and co-ordinated promotion of the whole island as a tourist destination, and to eliminate <Col N="94"/>any duplication which exists currently between the various tourism bodies, North and South&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus an tAire St&aacute;it agus ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; go bhfuilimid ag tac&uacute; i bprionsabal leis an r&uacute;n agus leis an leas&uacute; at&aacute; molta ag Fianna F&aacute;il.  We agree in principle with most of what has been said but we felt it was important to broaden the debate.  I was happy to hear Senators Deirdre Clune and Fidelma Healy Eames and a number of other Senators refer to the need for infrastructure to support the tourism industry.  This is why we are drawing attention to the OPEX grants for the regional airports, which we discussed with the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, on Monday in regard to the situation in Galway.  We ask all Ministers to take this on board.  We need to keep the airports open to be able to bring in tourists.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, will appreciate, it is crucial the western rail corridor is progressed in order that we can move tourists around the western region.  In addition, the roads infrastructure promised under Transport 21 needs to be brought forward as a priority.  We need to look more broadly than the Twenty-six Counties.  We need to work with our counterparts in the North of Ireland, in particular to ensure the development of the A5 dual carriageway from Aughnacloy to Derry continues.  In addition, I was glad that Senator John Kelly agreed with us that the rates review needs to be undertaken as a matter of priority.</P>

If we supported the 20-year language strategy, we could increase the economic benefit to our country.  We would also add to the image of ourselves as a bilingual, Irish language speaking community.  It is not just the Minister with responsibility for the Gaeltacht who should be supporting the 20-year strategy but every single Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  Ours is a small island of only 6 million people on the periphery of Europe, yet the Irish and Ireland are celebrated and known globally.  For example, Cavan was the second most searched place in the world for accommodation earlier in the year because of Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann, which will take place again in August this year, as Senator Labhras &Oacute; Murch&uacute; mentioned.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; also referred to all-Ireland tourism.  I am sure the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, would be more than willing to come to this Chamber to talk about all-Ireland tourism promotion, which is critical.  Visitors and potential investors to this island do not differentiate between the North and South.  They want to experience the Ring of Kerry in the same way as the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway.  They want to examine the history and story, from Viking Waterford to the Rising in Dublin to the recent success of the peace process in Belfast.  Visitors are attracted to Ireland by the good work of Tourism Ireland, which seeks to promote tourism to the island of Ireland as a whole.</P>
        <P>However, the visitor experience once in Ireland is disjointed between F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the confusing and competing websites of Discover Ireland and Discover Northern Ireland.  Tourists want a seamless, quality experience.  They do not need or understand the confusing separate tourist infrastructure.  The full absurdity of this situation is revealed, for example, when a tourist wants to book to stay in both Fermanagh and in Cavan and is sent to two different websites, which is an issue that needs to be addressed.  We need to end this confusion and competition, which demonstrates duplication and is bad for the tourism industry and for tourists.</P><Col N="95"/>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in his address asked what could be done to cut costs.  Cutting duplication is one of the ways to do this.  We need to be more efficient and effective to promote tourism to Ireland and within Ireland.  A single, comprehensive, quality point of contact is what tourists require.  A single body to co-ordinate and promote tourism, and to target resources away from duplication of administration and into promotion and development of tourism within the island of Ireland is what we need.  This is what we are calling for in our amendment.</P>

We had the opportunity to welcome and hear the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and I now welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, who, unfortunately, we will not have the opportunity to hear speak today, although I had hoped we would.  We tabled an upbeat motion on tourism to which we could all subscribe.  I thank our opponents, all of whom did subscribe to it, although they also added to it, unfortunately.  I will come to that shortly.  Nonetheless, I am glad we are agreed on the substantive motion.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for his input in recent days to the background of the motion.  In the litany of all the beautiful places, including Killarney, someone omitted to mentionWestport, where the Minister of State is from.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State would say that.  My erstwhile colleague and great friend, Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan, complimented me earlier by pointing out that I had managed to make a speech in the House without mentioning either Killarney or Muckross; therefore, I must put that right.  That was to show that I take a national view despite being parochial on occasion.  In any case, Muckross and Killarney are very special and Members will be very welcome there as I know they will all be engaging in the home holiday market this year.  I look forward to seeing them all in Kerry, particularly Killarney.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, more Members wanted to speak than was permitted by the time constraints.  It was a worthwhile debate.  I hope the Minister of State will come back to the House shortly when we arrange another opportunity to deal with other aspects of this subject before the House rises in July.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, we cannot accept the amendments.  I recognise very much the good intentions of the Members opposite.  As was pointed out in regard to the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment, while we have no problem with and fully subscribe to the second and fourth paragraphs, as we heard from the Minister in regard to the first and third paragraphs, no decision has been made on the matter, the consultation process is ongoing with the employers and the unions, and the matter will then come back for consideration and decision by the Cabinet.  The Leader intends to give Members an opportunity to deal with the Duffy-Walsh report.  Let us await the Government&rsquo;s decision concerning which we will hear more in due course.</P>
        <P>Equally, the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment has very laudable objectives.  I do not know about the availability of the money but there is a commitment to the Aughnacloy-Derry road project.</P>

        <P>I refer again to the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  There is wonderful co-operation between North and South, as Senators are well aware.  It is a very useful idea, to which I subscribe, which the Leader and I discussed last week and as Senator Labhras &Oacute; Murch&uacute; suggested, to invite the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to the Chamber in due course to discuss tourism further.  Perhaps on that day the Minister of State might grace us with his presence.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is welcome and I thank him for taking this Adjournment matter, I presume on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children.  My request to the Minister of State is to ask the Minister for Health and Children whether the HSE will address, as a matter of urgency, the serious lack of community health doctors in County Galway, which now is putting the health of children at risk, particularly in two respects: the BCG vaccine and developmental checks for children.  I thank the Minister of State for taking the time out of his schedule to attend the House and I am grateful to the departmental officials for considering and researching this issue.</P>
        <P>My request for this Adjournment matter arises from the alarming situation in Galway whereby the recruitment embargo is having a severe impact on the delivery of patient services and is compromising the public health objectives of the health care system, especially in respect of child health services.  In the past five years five doctors have departed the University Hospital Galway community medical department.  Through retirement, maternity leave or other reasons, they have left a gaping hole in the Department&rsquo;s front-line team.  In the past six months two further medical staff have been lost to the department, with one departing in October 2010 and the other in April 2011.  None of these front-line professionals has been replaced.  In addition, owing to the incentive for HSE staff to take redundancy, further gaps have arisen in respect of the administration and support staff.  This directly affects the accountability and transparency of the hospital&rsquo;s performance.</P>
        <P>The impact of these human resource constraints is showing up in many different cases and obviously on staff morale.  The two issues that require the Minister&rsquo;s most urgent attention, however, are the administering of the BCG vaccine and the monitoring and roll-out of child developmental checks.  As for the importance of BCG vaccination, the current waiting list for at-risk non-national toddlers is 800 and growing.  These children, who were born in Ireland, have one or more parents from a country where there is a high prevalence of tuberculosis.  Furthermore, 50% of schoolchildren do not receive the vaccination.  Consequently, unless this matter is addressed, the Galway region is on the doorstep of an epidemic.  One key point being raised by this Adjournment matter is that 800 at-risk children are not getting the BCG vaccine and this could spread contagion among the general population.  The response and solution that appears to be emanating from hospital management is that staff can be redeployed.  That has yet to materialise, however, and will no doubt have an impact on other areas in the hospital.  Redeployment is too easy a response to every problem because while one can state one will move staff from here to there, unless that is properly co-ordinated, it will not work.</P>
        <P>In respect of the developmental checks, as a matter of public interest and in the interest of complying with international obligations, all children are meant to be checked by the health system.  The objective is early detection and intervention and this is an important check and a human right.  At present in Galway, the startling position is that 50% of toddlers in the county have had no screening, 1,850 toddlers under the age of ten months are on the waiting list at present and 450 toddlers between seven and nine months have not had a developmental check.  An assessment I received from a health care professional who has direct experience of the current crisis states:</P><Col N="98"/>
        <P LI="1">We are now operating at a nonfunctional, unsafe and ineffective level as a Community Medical Department because of the failure to appoint a designated number of community health doctors. [...] There has been a failure to understand the seriousness and implications of the current situation they have failed to respond to the requests and concerns of the principal medical officer and more recently to the concern of the Director of Public Health.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As the HSE locally is ignoring the problems associated with the BCG vaccine and developmental checks, I now bring them to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children.  While I acknowledge he has an enormous task on his hands, one cannot allow to be left unattended children in an at-risk group who urgently need the BCG vaccine and who pose a risk to the entire population or children who could have problems with their sight, hearing or limbs identified at an early stage.  It will be important for the Minister to liaise with the director of public health, who is based in Merlin Park, and with John Hennessy, the HSE west director of operations, to sanction the appointment of these doctors.  While I may be talking out of turn a little, I believe even sanctioning the appointment of two doctors would make a difference to this team.  I have met some of the staff there and they are at their wits&rsquo; end.  They emphasise repeatedly the urgency of this case and what I do not wish to see is the making of a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on this subject.

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his welcome and wish all Members well on my first visit to this beautiful Chamber.  In my capacity as Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with responsibility for horticulture, forestry, food safety and the greyhound industry, I have sent a letter to all Members, either physically or via e-mail, containing my contact telephone number.  As far as I am concerned, I am there on behalf of everyone and it is not my office but theirs.  They should not be afraid to make use of it as I have staff there who will help them out.  This was done for me when I was in Opposition and it was of great help.  Consequently, I urge Members to avail of the forthcoming telephone number.</P>
        <P>I can see that Senator Fidelma Healy Eames is passionate about this issue and I have listened to what she has had to say.  I will read out the reply on behalf of the Minister and will bring any supplementary questions to his attention, as I would be foolish to take on the task of attempting to answer them.</P>
        <P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy James Reilly.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to this House the importance attached by the Minister to the issue raised.  Community health doctors are an integral part of the overall health services provided by the HSE.  The main services provided include child protection services, which include involvement in child protection teams, co-ordination of the medical needs of children in long-term care and medical assessment of children where child abuse has been alleged.  Child and adolescent health services include developmental examination for seven to nine month old infants, child health clinics, school health services and medical audiology clinics.  Community health immunisation services include neonatal BCG vaccination programmes and school vaccination programmes to children in primary schools.  Services for older people include co-ordination of medical services for the elderly and involvement in cases of elder abuse.  Services for persons with disability include medical assessment for disability allowances and involvement in the assessment of need process for children aged up to five, all under the Disability Act 2004.  Social inclusion services include targeted community health medical services for socially marginalised groups.</P><Col N="99"/>
        <P>The recruitment of staff in the health services is subject to the Employment Control Framework 2011-2014.  That framework is required to maintain tight control on the cost of providing public services while protecting front-line services as far as possible.  There are 184 community medical officers employed by the HSE.  This equates to an average of 4.2 per local health office area.  The latest data available from the HSE indicate there are nine community medical officers in the Galway local health office, which is the third highest number in the country.  I am satisfied, therefore, that there are sufficient resources to ensure essential child health needs are addressed.  The HSE is reviewing its community medical services.  This review is nearing completion and is expected to be positive about the future direction of the service with regard to children.</P>

	<P>I acknowledge that this matter does not come within the remit of the Minister of State, but I thank him for his very generous remarks to us.  This response is very worrying because it does not tie in with the facts as I have outlined them.  Will the Minister of State acquaint the Minister for Health and Children with the facts about the shortage of doctors because they do not tie in with what he has stated?  The principal medical officer and the director of public health in Galway is very worried about this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Shane McEntee.  From my experience of being in Departments and taking many Adjournment debates I appreciate that the new Minister for Children may have difficulty in being in the House tonight, but I hope she will have an opportunity to outline the situation to the House in greater detail in the near future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raise the issue of the need for the Minister for Children to outline the progress regarding the Government&rsquo;s proposed wording for a referendum on the constitutional protection of children and her views on the amendment to strengthen children&rsquo;s rights as outlined in the final report of February 2010 of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  The committee was chaired by former Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.  Current members of the Cabinet also participated in the committee, the Vice Chairman being Deputy Michael Noonan, the Minister for Finance.  Other members included Senator Thomas Byrne; former Deputies Margaret Conlon, Olwyn Enright and Paul Gogarty; Deputies Brendan Howlin and Dan Neville; former Deputy Tom Kitt; Deputies Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, and Alan Shatter, now a Minister, former Deputy Michael Woods, former Senator, now Deputy Alex White; former Senator and now Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  I am much encouraged because Deputy Fitzgerald is very familiar with the work of the committee.  Other members included former Senator Geraldine Feeney and former Senator Maria Corrigan.  The former Minister and Deputy, Mr. Dermot Ahern was an <i>ex officio</i> member of the committee.  The former Deputy and Minister of State, Mr. Barry Andrews, was also involved.  I note the number of Deputies and Senators who are no longer Members of the Oireachtas.  It could be a sign that they devoted a great deal of their time to this committee and its work for which they are to be commended.  The 2010 report of the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Logan, was published this morning.  She is very anxious that this amendment be made to the Constitution.</P>
        <P>I am the Fianna F&aacute;il Seanad spokesperson on children and European affairs.  Will the Minister of State convey to the Minister for Children the unanimous support to hold this referendum sooner rather than later and ask him to consider holding it in conjunction with the presidential <Col N="100"/>election in November?  This is a very important amendment to the Constitution.  We owe it to children and future children to include this amendment in the Constitution.  Very detailed research has been undertaken and it is an all-party agreed report which was submitted to the Oireachtas.  The Minister is currently discussing the wording with the Attorney General.  Different views were expressed on the wording of the amendment.  Will the Minister publish the wording as soon as possible for consideration?  We certainly did not live up to the 1916 Proclamation to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  They were neglected in the institutions and the reports prove this.  We all indirectly share in the neglect of children in the past.  I hope the constitutional amendment will go a long way towards ensuring the mistakes of the past are rectified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the co-operation of all parties on this matter.  I am taking this Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Children, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  I am pleased to provide the Seanad with an update on the work of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children and the Government position on the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.</P>
        <P>I emphasise the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the amendment of the Constitution to strengthen its protection of the rights of children.  This Government will ensure that our young people are given the full protection of the Constitution.  The programme for Government reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s intention to hold a referendum to amend the Constitution to ensure that children&rsquo;s rights are strengthened along the lines recommended by the all-party Oireachtas committee.</P>
        <P>In general, the Constitution strikes a balance between personal rights, the status of the family, the rights and duties of parents and the power of the State as guardian of the common good.  The aim of the Government is to expressly include children in this equation.  The road to constitutional reform is protracted and cautious by nature.  This is appropriate, given the need to ensure the Constitution, the cornerstone and basic law of the State, reflects the needs, culture and ethos of the people.  The call for constitutional change to protect children has been championed by Ms Catherine McGuinness in her report on the Kilkenny incest investigation and by the Constitution Review Group in its 1996 report.</P>
        <P>Our society is governed by the Constitution.  It is Government&rsquo;s position that the rights of children have to be balanced with other important principles already contained in the Constitution and which are important in protecting and safeguarding children from harm.  This Government is committed to ensuring that there is no dilution of the equally important concepts of the duties of parents and the core position in society of the family unit.  Any amendment developed will respect the constitutional position of the family based on marriage as the fundamental unit of our society.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children considered wording for an amendment to the Constitution and produced two interim reports which recommended legislative responses to the issues referred to in the proposed amendment.  The final report of the joint committee, published in February, deals with the rights of children under the Constitution and the statute and case law concerning adoption, guardianship, care proceedings, custody and access to children.  The committee&rsquo;s draft proposed wording and the full version of the report may be downloaded from the Oireachtas website, <i>www.oireachtas.ie.</i></P>
        <P>The then Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Mr. Barry Andrews, presented a copy of the third and final report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children to the Cabinet in early March.  This was considered by the different Departments and the Attorney General, to determine the implications for the Government and for their individual responsibilities.  A draft wording was developed at that <Col N="101"/>time but it did not adequately reflect the good work done by the all-party Oireachtas committee.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government 2011 states that the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights is a priority and that the wording will be along the lines of that proposed by the all-party Oireachtas committee.  Since taking office, the Minister for Children has commenced discussions with the Attorney General with a view to preparing a draft wording which will more closely reflect the work of the committee than that which the previous Government approved in draft form.  Following these deliberations, the Minister for Children intends to bring the matter to Government for approval to draft a Bill and to hold a referendum.</P>
        <P>Last week, the Taoiseach stated the referendum would not take place on the same day as the Presidential election.  There is concern that to hold it then may unnecessarily and unhelpfully politicise children&rsquo;s rights.  It is considered that a separate referendum is more appropriate for this important and sensitive issue.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise the matter of the gorse fires which swept across County Donegal and other counties in the midlands and the west in the period over the May bank holiday weekend from the end of April to 6 May.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad that the Minister of State is present because he visited County Donegal, for which I wish to thank him, when he saw first hand the damage which had been caused.  It was very extensive.  The Donegal county manager, at a council meeting on Monday, outlined in detail the costs associated with the damage from the county council&rsquo;s point of view.  He had determined that an additional cost of &euro;400,000 would be applied to the county council for the work it had carried out in supervising and trying to put out fires and assist the local community.  About 3% of the land mass of the county, or 7,700 ha, was damaged by the fires.  In addition, about 550 ha of Coillte owned land was also damaged, together with three private forests in Dungloe, Portnoo and Glenties.  The county council received 425 emergency calls in the six days from 30 April to 5 May and there were ten major incidents, inlcuding in Dungloe, Ballyshannon, Doochary, Ardara, Malin Head, Muckish Mountain, Buncrana, Milford and Stranorlar.</P>
        <!--?oasys _cl13.5- ?-->
		<P>I take the opportunity to thank Donegal County Council, the fire service and Army personnel, of whom 70 were deployed to assist the county council, together with two helicopter units, and all of the community representatives who worked hard to put out the fires.  Small farmers with slurry tankers came to houses where fires were raging.  I spent two nights assisting local people to put out fires with no more than spades and shovels to try to beat back the flames.  The work was done in a unified manner between members of the community, volunteers, the county council, the Army, the Garda and Civil Defence and was second to none.</P>
        <P>We can now reflect on what happened.  It was lucky that no one was badly injured or killed.  Unfortunately, one house was lost in the Ballyshannon area and an enormous amount of damage was caused to agricultural land and fencing, as well as to Coillte lands owned by the State and private forestries.  The difficulty with agricultural land, in particular fencing, is that it is not covered by insurance.  Therefore, farmers will receive no recompense.  They will have to dig into their own pockets to replace any fencing lost.  Many of the farmers I met in the past few weeks told me they did not have money to replace it.</P><Col N="102"/>
        <P>I raise this issue in the hope the Minister of State will work closely with the IFA to try to come up with some scheme to help the farmers concerned.  I am not sure if there is any scope to apply to the European Union for additional funding to provide a once off payment, given that the fires were a rare occurrence.  Farmers need a little help to get back on their feet.  If a compensation package was made available, they would provide some of the funds themselves and the money would be spent locally in the process creating employment in replacing fencing, as well as in local farm suppliers who would supply the material needed.</P>
        <P>I would be going too far if I was to look for funding to replace lost grazing land.  Such a scheme would not be realistic.</P>
        <P>The position in respect of forestry land also needs to be examined.  We have to try to put some plan in place in case a similar incident occurs next year or the year after.  In this regard, we need to work with all of the local agencies involved.  In areas where the fire service is under-resourced, perhaps volunteers, including local farmers, could be trained on a community basis to assist the fire service in a professional manner.</P>
        <P>It is probably a reflection of weather conditions &mdash; frost and heat.  Farmers will also legitimately argue &mdash; I come from a farming background &mdash; that the grazing of sheep on uplands and hills has been discontinued owing to a decision taken in the European Union.  As a consequence, heather was allowed to grow, but its growth was curtailed by frost.  It was almost like using a match.  While we can speculate on how the fire started, we all have reached our own conclusions.  I have spoken to the Garda about the matter and if there was a malicious intent in starting the fires, those concerned should face the full rigour of the law.  I know the Garda is conducting an investigation.  I appeal, therefore, to anyone with information to contact it because lives could have been lost.</P>
        <P>I hope the Government will consider this issue and make an early decision on providing some compensation on a percentage basis for the replacement of fencing.  I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply and look forward to his response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a good day for the Senator to raise the issue.  It is easy to forget what happened five weeks ago.  We are heading into a long weekend with warm weather forecast and we have issued a statement asking people to be vigilant.  I learned a lot during my visit to County Donegal, in particular from those who were in the thick of it.  I went to see the damage that had been caused.  However, it was only when I travelled on the road from Ardara to Dungloe that I realised there could have been loss of life.  It was because of the work done by young people, the elderly and everybody else who got together when fire units were stretched that houses were saved.  I spoke to one man who thought his house was gone and the one thing he wanted to save was an accordion, which was nice to hear.  I saw houses where everything up to the drainage system on the roof and the septic tank had been burned.  A huge amount of damage was caused.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A group of people with ideas came together.  Those who have forestries in the area or lands that can catch fire must form a unit and put a system in place to tackle the problem.  I asked people in County Donegal, through the county council and the IFA, to put together a plan which we could issue to county councils throughout the country.</P>
        <P>At the beginning farmers were blamed.  Then it was claimed rogues had started the fires.  On one tour I saw an oil tanker which had exploded, crossed the forest, causing a fire to start.  There was a mixture of three factors involved.  It is welcome that the Senator has raised the issue, as what happened could happen again this weekend.  We do not intend to let down those involved in forestry, about which I have become passionate, even though I am a dairy farmer by nature.  It is a fantastic industry.  If it is to grow, as the Senator rightly said, we have to have plans in place to deal with such problems.</P><Col N="103"/>
        <P>In regard to the payment of compensation, I urge everybody affected to check their insurance policies first.  I ask people in County Donegal to revert, through the IFA, with accounts of exactly what happened.  Money is tight and I would be foolish to say any is available.  While one should never close the door, much as I would love to be in a position to say it is, there is nothing available.  However, one never knows what might happen.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  Having spent my holidays in County Donegal last year, I was appalled at the wildfires which took place at the beginning of May throughout the country, especially in County Donegal.  I visited the county on 7 May to witness the extensive damage caused to forestry and property near Glenties, Ardara and Dungloe and meet the families and communities placed most at risk.  The aftermath of the fires showed that a small minority of people have a total disregard for the law and an equal, even more worrying disregard for human life.  Only the efforts of the emergency services &mdash; the Army, Air Corps and Garda &mdash; and local volunteers stood between controlling the fires and an even greater disaster.  As we approach the bank holiday weekend, respect for the law on land burning must remain paramount.  Vigilance by rural dwellers must also apply to assist in identifying the lawbreakers and ensure they are brought to justice.</P>
        <P>On compensation for the damage caused to grazing lands and agricultural fencing, my Department does not intend to compensate farmers for the damage caused during this spate of wildfires.  Damage to property is a matter for individual farmers and I encourage landowners who have not already done so to insure themselves against such risks.</P>
        <P>The majority of land fires occur between 1 March and 31 August each year when a legal ban on the burning of growing vegetation on uncultivated land applies under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.  While many fires are started maliciously, the number started through carelessness and disregard for the law by landowners to clear gorse and scrub is equally worrying.  The small minority who are responsible and disregard the law and people&rsquo;s lives and property must be identified and made to face prosecution, fines and imprisonment.  Again I urge all rural dwellers to remain vigilant and take responsibility by reporting any suspicious activity to the Garda.</P>
        <P>At times of high fire risk &mdash; dry and windy conditions &mdash; forest owners especially need to take responsibility by organising checks on their plantations.  They should also ensure their insurance cover is adequate, fire breaks are in good condition and fire plans are in place.</P>
        <P>Arising from the large increase in the number of forest fires which occurred during 2010, a working group was established in my Department in June 2010.  The group, which consisted of representatives from the forest industry, the fire service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, Coillte, Teagasc and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, was charged with making recommendations for ministerial approval with a view to tackling the problem of illegal and uncontrolled burning.  The question of compensation arising from fire damage was not raised as an issue throughout the deliberations of the working group.</P>
        <P>Following a full analysis of the issues involved, ten recommendations were made, the first of which was to change the mindset regarding the use of fire in traditional agricultural practices.  The group recognised that under certain circumstances and based mainly on tradition, the burning of land to clear scrub and other unwanted vegetation has become an accepted farm management practice.  As numerous cases during 2010 illustrated, however, there is a lack of knowledge and expertise regarding controlled burning among some farmers and landowners as well as ignorance of the legality of some of their actions.  As a result, the working group made a recommendation for a publicity and educational campaign to address these fundamental weaknesses with a view to changing the mindset of those who light such fires.  Similar campaigns in France and the United States have proved to be both informative and effective.  My Department has engaged in such an information campaign outlining the hazards of setting illegal fires and the potential penalties under the single payment scheme.  In addition to press articles, <Col N="104"/>advertisements have been placed in the farming press.  Three press releases have also been issued which have concentrated on the risks of forest fires, the aftermath of the May bank holiday wildfires and a current appeal to rural dwellers to remain vigilant over the June bank holiday weekend.</P>
        <P>The other recommendations dealt with advising landowners on fire prevention, forest management and early detection.  It was also recommended that landowners be advised of their obligation to notify their intention to burn to fire services and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Landowners should notify their local fire service control centre in advance of any controlled burn.  This will ensure the fire services are not called out to attend a controlled burn which does not pose any threat to forests, human health or property.  Under section 39(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976, prior notice of an intention to instigate a controlled burn must be given to the sergeant in charge of the Garda station in the Garda district concerned.</P>
        <P>The importance of prosecution of offenders, the need for producer group involvement and the development of a code for controlled burning were also highlighted by the group.  The development of an interagency statement setting out the areas of responsibility of Government agencies, the emergency services and private sector was also recommended.  While I have responsibility for forestry and I am very concerned about this aspect of wildfires, the central role of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in emergency planning and fire also needs to be acknowledged.  The fire services in the various local authorities performed outstanding work in dealing with the recent outbreak of fires.</P>
        <P>It was also agreed by the working group that a map of land-based fire hot spots should be compiled to help target the educational campaigns specifically at these areas.  The majority of instances of uncontrolled burning occur within specific geographical locations, for example, upland commonages.  Targeted campaigns could be focused on these areas for maximum effect.  The fire services and emergency planning section of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has been requested to compile this data, as it is the administrative unit which is best placed to offer an overall view of the land and forest fires profile for the country.</P>
        <P>We all recognise that prevention is better than cure.  It is, therefore, very important that we continue to place emphasis on co-operation between the agencies involved and landowners and rural dwellers to tackle the scourge of wildfires in a practical manner.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for addressing this important issue.  He has indicated the Department does not intend to offer compensation to landowners affected by the recent fires.

Is that an accurate reflection of the position?</P>

I asked organisations locally to put their best foot forward.  While circumstances sometimes change, it is unlikely they will change in this case, although I remain open to persuasion.</P>
