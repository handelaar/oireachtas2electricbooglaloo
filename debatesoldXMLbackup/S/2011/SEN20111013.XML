	<P Just="Left">I have received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to reinstate funding of &euro;150,000 for an autism spectrum disorder unit and classroom at Finn Valley College, County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I have also received notice from Senator Averil Power of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to maintain funding for Laneview Learning Centre, Dublin 17 at the current level in 2012 in order that the centre can continue to provide vital education and self-development opportunities for methadone users in the area.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Health to outline the reason the relocation of a nursing home to meet HIQA standards should be classified as &ldquo;start up/new build&rdquo;, not as a&ldquo;current operation&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I have also received notice from Senator Mark Daly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Health to give an update on the provision of cystic fibrosis adult inpatient beds at Cork University Hospital, in light of the fact that nearly &euro;2 million has been collected by the voluntary organisation Build for Life and a further &euro;300,000 would allow the project to go ahead.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure all my colleagues share my disappointment with the Keane report and the proposals therein, which fall far short of what the Government promised.  It appears from the report that the Government will leave the decisions on debt settlement to the banks, and there is a proposal to set up a toothless agency.  This is unlike the independent debt settlement office which my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, proposed by way of a Bill published yesterday and which will go before the D&aacute;il next week.</P>
        <P>To be fair, all Senators want to assist people in mortgage difficulties as much as possible.  I do not doubt the intentions of the Government but these were laid out very clearly in the run-up to the general election and the programme for Government.  I remind the Leader of two specific elements which were promised and which I have raised directly with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  These include the proposal for 30% mortgage interest relief for individuals who bought houses between 2004 and 2008, which on average would amount to as much as &euro;166 per month net.  This was promised during the general election and although we have consistently asked the Minister when it will be implemented, it has not been done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new Government also promised it would ensure that the State-covered banks would subsume and forgo future ECB rate increases, of which we have had two this year, amounting to a 0.5% increase in total.  None of those increases have been subsumed by the banks, and this amounts to another broken promise.  The Government also indicated that it would create an agency with teeth and legal standing to assist people with mortgage and personal debt issues.  What was proposed yesterday in the Keane report goes nowhere close to doing that.  In the past six to seven months the Government has raised the expectations of individuals who are extremely vulnerable and it has reneged on the promises it made.</P>
        <P>The D&aacute;il will debate this report next week and I assume we will debate it at length.  I ask the Leader to set aside the maximum amount of time next week to debate the findings in the report.  The Minister for Finance said he will listen very carefully to the views of Members of the Oireachtas from all parties, which I welcome.  New Beginnings, which is an excellent group, and many other independent groups are very disappointed with the Keane report.</P>
        <P>We will wait until next week to debate it and I hope the Leader sets sufficient time aside because even in the short time of this Government, my party has published two significant Bills, one of which would protect the family home and which was defeated by three votes in the Seanad.  We have now published a Bill on establishing an independent debt management agency to which the banks would have to answer.  What the Government proposes is that our people will be answerable to the banks.  It has reneged on significant promises it made in the election.  Will the Leader set aside time next week for us to once again put forward the realistic proposals we have?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader reiterate what the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, said at their 100 days in office press conference, namely, that they would not cut social welfare and increase income tax?  Yesterday, the Fiscal Advisory Council called for a &euro;4.4 billion adjustment this year.  If the Leader knows how in God&rsquo;s name the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, will do that without cutting social welfare and raising income tax, he should tell him.  Can the Leader tell me that the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government is still committed to no social welfare cuts and no tax increases?</P>

	<P Just="Left">Like Senator O&rsquo;Brien, I would like a debate on the Keane report but I would differ greatly with him on his analysis of that report.  I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, to come to the House to debate the Keane report with us.  We should have a lengthy debate on it.  However, I welcome the proposals in it which at least offer some sort of concrete comfort to many families in distress with their mortgages and as I have said before, it is extremely rich to hear Fianna F&aacute;il lecture us on the shortcomings of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I call on the Leader to arrange a further debate on prostitution law following the excellent debate we had last night on foot of Senator Zappone&rsquo;s motion on prostitution law.  I very much welcome the fact that during the debate, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, gave a commitment that the Government would spend the next six months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>On a point of order, should we debate what was part of last night&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; time this morning?  People who are in distress and face severe financial difficulties are looking to Members in this House to act responsibly and this is what we get.</P>

	<P>Does Senator Bacik have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am not sure what Senator Walsh is talking about.  I ask the Leader for a follow up debate in six months time on prostitution law with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, or the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to follow up on the commitment the Minister of State gave last night that the Government would spend the next six months engaged in public consultation on the introduction of a prostitution law similar to that introduced in Sweden and Norway in which the purchase of sex is a criminal offence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We had a very good and a very informed debate in this House with a full Visitors Gallery.  There is huge interest in this issue and it is extremely welcome that the Government has given a commitment to spend the next six months engaged in a meaningful dialogue with the many interest groups and individuals who are concerned about this issue.  It is important that the Minister of State, or even the Minister, come to the House in six months time to explain the <Col N="795"/>progress made and outline the Government plans for legislation.  It is an extremely important request to the Leader.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to get the details of a discussion or correspondence the Cathaoirleach had with RTE in regard to a case which I will not discuss.  I refer to the principle of the independence of the Oireachtas and freedom of Members of the Oireachtas to speak on issues that affect them, subject only to the regulation of the Houses in which they serve and to the Chair&rsquo;s rulings which I respect.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that RTE contacted the Cathaoirleach and stated that the Cathaoirleach was happy to be made aware of the long-standing principle of not discussing in the Oireachtas a case that was still before the courts.  What was the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s response to RTE?  Did he tell it to go away, which is what he should have told it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ruled on that matter the day before yesterday.  I will not allow a discussion to take place today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not personal; I am trying to protect the Cathaoirleach because he has widespread support in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter is closed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The correspondence from RTE to him was an attack on this House and on him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I made a ruling on the matter and it is closed.  As the Senator well knows, the particular matter is before the High Court and before a jury trial.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not go into that matter.  It is a matter of public record&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I gave the legal advice I received to the House.  I will not allow a discussion to take place on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The public record states that the Cathaoirleach was in contact with RTE and that he was happy to be advised by RTE as to what should be spoken about in this House.  It is a matter of huge concern to us that RTE would put that pressure on the Cathaoirleach.  I am not criticising the Cathaoirleach.</P>

	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;and that the Leader brings it before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I hope my colleagues do so because it is a matter of serious concern.  RTE has no business telling the Cathaoirleach what is in Standing Orders.  The Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s response should have been very impolite and in the vernacular.  I will not describe what it should have been.  He should have told RTE to go away at the very least.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is very important.  We raise this in support of the Cathaoirleach, not to criticise him.</P>
        <P>We need an urgent debate on mortgages and not with the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose.  He set this fire alight in regard to mortgages during the summer when we said there would be debt forgiveness.  He clearly was not speaking with any expertise or on behalf of his Department.  We do not want to discuss two pilot schemes in regard to mortgage to rent.  We want to discuss the Keane report with the Minister for Finance, if he is available.  I would be happy with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, who is a relatively senior Minister of State.  That debate is very urgent.</P>
        <P>The Government has let the people down.  Fine Gael made a specific promise on mortgage interest relief of &euro;166 per month.  Tens of thousands of people voted for Fine Gael because of that promise alone.  That promise was like the promises given to taxi drivers and Eircom shareholders but people were so vulnerable and in such a bad way that they believed the promise.  It was like the promises made in regard to Roscommon and Blanchardstown hospitals.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Is the Senator calling for a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am calling for a debate on that issue.  We have been pushing to see when this proposal by Fine Gael will be implemented.  We now find that the Keane report is complete rubbish.  The difficulty we have with the Keane report is that many of the members of the group were on the committee which published a report last October.  The Government has not done anything to implement the findings of that report, which is a good one.  The New Beginning group was not invited to contribute to that committee.  It suggested an excellent <Col N="797"/>solution which works on a cross the board basis rather than on a case by case basis.  Addressing the issue on a case by case basis is code for putting vulnerable borrowers in a room with a bank official who orders them to eat this for breakfast and go to that shop.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I raise the issue of commercial rates.  Yesterday, in Buswells hotel we met a delegation from Irish employers for affordable rates.  To say that the retailers this group represents are struggling is an understatement.  I have raised this issue on numerous occasions, including with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Perry, who promised to consider alternative ways of assessing commercial rates in order that blue chip companies could be dealt with in a different manner to small retail units.</P>
        <P>Commercial rates in County Roscommon are valued at &euro;74 per square foot compared to &euro;52 in County Westmeath.  The area surrounding Athlone is divided between County Roscommon and, across the bridge, County Westmeath.  It is ridiculous that there is a difference of &euro;22 per square foot between the rates levied in these areas because nobody will come to County Roscommon to establish a business.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">The hotel sector is also struggling.  Hotels are being assessed on a commercial rates basis for rooms that are not being used.  If they could fill their rooms they would have no problem paying their rates bills. A hotel in my area closed down because it could not pay its rates and water rates, with a subsequent cost of &euro;840,000 per year in social welfare payments.  Small retail units which employ three people face rates bills of &euro;5,000 per year.  If they close they will cost &euro;63,000 in social welfare.  The argument is made that debt forgiveness for small businesses would impact <Col N="798"/>on the local government fund but the alternative is that the Exchequer will have to cover the higher bill for social welfare.</P>
        <P>Irish employers for affordable rates would like the Valuations Acts to be amended to allow employers to appeal a rates valuation on the basis of changing economic circumstances.  I call on the Leader to arrange for a debate on the matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Perry.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>IBEC published a number of proposals today which are worthy of debate.  I suggest that the Leader might find time for such a debate in the near future.  The problem which faces us is that we are not spending in Ireland.  We have a strong export sector but we are continuing to save rather than spend.  I grew up during a time when we were all encouraged to save but it appears now we need to find methods to encourage people to spend and create more jobs.  IBEC suggests that if people had access to a portion of their pensions, perhaps at a reduced rate of tax, they could spend it now.  I acknowledge this proposal presents all sorts of long-term difficulties but it should only involve a portion of that pension.  The proposal is at least worth discussion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">IBEC also proposed that children&rsquo;s allowance be paid with an electronic card that could only be spent on goods here.  It has been suggested that much of the money paid is not spent in Ireland.  I could be accused of coming from a tradition of encouraging people to spend their money in supermarkets but that is exactly where the cards would be used.  It appears that some of the money received in children&rsquo;s allowance payments is not necessarily being spent on children.  IBEC&rsquo;s proposal has the dual benefit of solving what we want to do with children&rsquo;s allowance while giving a boost to the retail trade in Ireland.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Today is World Vision Day, which is observed to highlight ophthalmic health and the challenges facing the blind and visually impaired community.  Unfortunately, 100 blind and visually impaired people are about to hold a protest outside Leinster House to urge the Government to establish a working group that would implement the recommendations in the World Health Organization report commissioned in 2001 or 2002.  Given that our population is aging, blindness and ophthalmic health will become a major issue.  It would be prudent for the Government to consider establishing a working group comprising officials and experts from the field.  I ask the Leader to bring this issue to the attention of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health as a priority.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given that it is World Vision Day, I will end on a positive note by describing my experience in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  For the first time ever a Member has been able to access legislation electronically on an iPad.  I commend the Leader, the Cathaoirleach, the Bills Office and the ICT unit on the work they have done to ensure I have equal access to legislation and other information.  On World Vision Day I have access to the Order Paper electronically for the first time ever in an Irish Parliament.  That is a good day for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas is often criticised but it can be proud of this initiative.  I look forward to robust debates which can be accessed electronically.</P>

	<P>I support my colleagues opposite on amending the Valuations Act 2001.  I also met the organisation which is running the campaign on commercial rates.  I suggested that we would support any amendment to the Act that would allow a right of appeal.  Will the Leader bring such legislation to the House at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Byrne.  I, too, raised the issue of RTE and hope the Leader will ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to investigate whether the station contacted this House to gently remind us to keep our noses out of its misdeeds.  It would be a bad development for democracy if the fourth estate dictated to us what we can and cannot say.</P><Col N="799"/>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on the backlog of EU legislation that has built up since the general election.  We learned at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade that 57 items of legislation are awaiting review by committees.  Since the second Lisbon treaty referendum, 132 items of European legislation have been sent to the Oireachtas.  All parliaments are supposed to make formal submissions after eight weeks but none of the 428 submissions made were by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have passed more items of European legislation without amendment than we have passed in this D&aacute;il and its two predecessors, combined.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>To the public, it must sound like a disgrace that we allowed so much European legislation to pass through these Houses without making one iota of a change to it.  That is a failure of the system and it cannot be allowed to continue.  I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the House for a discussion on the 57 pieces of legislation we are supposed to review before next week.  It is possible that they will all have to be passed within seven days.  That does not sound like a functioning democracy.  As I said at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the committee, it sounds like a rubber-stamping operation.  We do not have the facilities, the legal expertise or the independent advice of the bureaucrats in the European Union that we need to guide us in the right direction.  That will come back to haunt us when the legislation takes effect five or six years from now.</P>

        <P>I would like to ask the Leader a serious question which perhaps he might raise with the Minister for Health.  I understand the competing demands on the Minister&rsquo;s time and our scarce health care resources.  I am talking about an issue on which good progress has been made in the last couple of years.  There is a real danger, however, that the progress made will be eroded.  I refer to the medical specialty of surgery on spinal deformities such as scoliosis and kyphosis, both of which are progressive illnesses which are usually diagnosed in later childhood and will lead to permanent disability or paralysis if left untreated.  In 2007 the waiting time for surgery was three years.  However, great progress has been made since and last year the waiting time was 12 months.  I am afraid the timeframes are creeping out again to 18 months.  The specialists working in this area have met the Minister and officials from the HSE and the Department.  We know the Minister is extremely sympathetic.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to discuss this issue with him.  Will he get a clear direction from the Minister on the plans that have been formulated and the stage these plans are at?</P>

	<P>Contrary to some of the points made by our very worthy opponents, the problem of mortgage arrears will continue until the banks show more flexibility and start lending again.  It will not go away and the State has very few direct options.  I join others in looking for a debate on the matter, as the Government has been urging the banks to show greater flexibility.  Another arm of State &mdash; the Central Bank &mdash; is imposing regulatory requirements that prevent the banks from lending, in effect.  I welcome the enhanced role the report envisages for local authorities.  We need to debate the many aspects of this suggestion.  I think it would be very good if this were to happen.  We need guidance from the Central Bank on the future mortgage market in order that the irresponsible practices that led us into this mess are not repeated.  I hope the Leader can arrange for us to debate the matter at an early stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise an issue relating to the Northern Ireland Assembly.  A number of Senators have previously called for the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to come before this House at some point.  I remind the Leader that we should consider this possibility.  It is important to do so in the context of the &pound;4 billion cut in the Assembly&rsquo;s budget from the block grant from the British Government.  One of the key campaigns of the parties in the North involves the transfer of fiscal powers from Westminster to the Assembly.  That would allow the parties in the Assembly to deal with this problem, for example, by raising taxes.</P>

If Senators are not informed about the actual powers and functions of the Assembly, they cannot do themselves justice when they speak in ignorance about what is happening in the North.  I remind the Leader that policing and justice powers have been transferred from Westminster to the Assembly.  The same needs to happen in relation to fiscal powers.  That cannot be an issue for Sinn F&eacute;in alone.  It has to be an issue for all parties in the State.  They need to work with us to seek these fiscal powers and thereby enable those who are democratically elected in the North, rather than British Government politicians at Westminster, to make decisions on taxation issues.</P>

I take a moment to congratulate the BBC for its programme &ldquo;All Roads Lead Home&rdquo;, broadcast last night, which celebrated natural navigation but in fact was a wonderful showpiece for County Mayo.  It was absolutely delightful and was an hour long advertisement for that beautiful county, for which I praise the BBC.  It shows the media can, at times, make a very positive contribution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to come to the House for a debate on the CAP proposals.  The proposals will be the subject of discussion for many months to come but, as they have been published in their basic form, it is in the interests of this House to contribute to that debate.

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader ask the Minister to attend the House to discuss an issue of great scandal, namely, that of the Priory complex in Donaghmede which was in the news in recent days, where 187 apartment units are uninhabitable because of the condition in which they were left and the severe fire hazard they constitute?  Unfortunately, many people who purchased apartments there are now grossly disadvantaged.  I ask the Minister to consider investigating this issue.  It is not just culpability on the part of the builder and developer.  Many professionals were involved, from the architect, who designed and presumably should have overseen and certified the scheme, to the mortgagors, who would have arranged their own inspections when they gave mortgages to the mortgagees.  On the architectural and the legal side, this shows that there has been a complete dereliction of responsibility.  It is not good enough.  This scheme might be symptomatic of similar problems across the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support my colleague, Senator Daly, with regard to the situation concerning EU scrutiny.  At the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade yesterday, we were informed that 57 EU directives and Bills in the foreign affairs portfolio are outstanding since last February.  As it is now too late for us to make any observations on them, it is suggested we just put them through with a rubber stamp.  Given the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade would have the least number of EU items to be scrutinised, we can take it there are hundreds and probably in excess of 1,000 such items across the various Departments and the public service.  This demonstrates an appalling lack of governance.</P>
        <P>To add to that, responsibility was given to these Houses to play our part under the Lisbon treaty &mdash; in fact, this was debated in the Seanad on a number of occasions, as the Cathaoirleach knows.  I was heartened by comments from the Leader in the early stages of this session that this Seanad would have an impact, would have real substance and be much more energised with regard to issues that came before us.  I have to say the Order of Business today and for the past three weeks has left a great deal to be desired.  There have been huge time gaps between items of business, which portrays a very bad image, while, at the same time, we have a load of European scrutiny documentation that is, like the archives, totally unattended.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wonder whether this is a deliberate ploy on the part of the Government to downgrade the work of these Houses in order that, when it comes to putting the referendum next year, it will be much easier for it to have the abolition of the Seanad passed.  That is an appalling vista when one considers the Government has a majority of 60 seats in the Lower House.  It is dangerous and a recipe for bad governance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to stand up and say this.  I ask the leaders of the Opposition to come together and, where the schedule of business is poor, ensure that amendments to the Order of Business are accepted.  I appeal to them to do this in order that we would, if nothing else, highlight the issue, <Col N="804"/>which would apply pressure.  I know this is not just a matter for the Leader because it is controlled by the Chief Whip of the Dail, who controls the business of this House.  That, unfortunately, is one of the great deficiencies in the manner in which we do our business.</P>

I was somewhat dissatisfied when I saw the briefing by the Minister for Finance which mentioned that the matter was to be discussed in the D&aacute;il, particularly given the interest of, and the time devoted by, this House to the issue of mortgage debt and arrears.  I point out to those who have not had a chance to read the report that two of the Seanad proposals relating to mortgage to rent and mortgage to shared equity are included.  Senator Thomas Byrne should note that Labour Party Members were anxious to support his Bill, but they pointed out that, unfortunately, there were legal issues with it.

	<P>While I am unsure whether there is a precedent, I ask the Leader to invite three Ministers to come to the House, namely, the Ministers for Health and Social Protection, as well as the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, all of whom have responsibility in dealing with the issue of homelessness.  A commitment was given by the previous Government and each party in this House to end homelessness by 2012.  Consequently, I seek the attendance in the House of the responsible Ministers to explain to Members the reason we face an increase in the level of homelessness.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach.  I was saying I had a certain amount of sympathy for Senator David Cullinane&rsquo;s proposal to the Leader that we have a debate on the transfer of fiscal powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly.  I wonder if this is part of the project.  As two thirds of the economy of Northern Ireland relies on the block grant and as two thirds of the working population of Northern Ireland is engaged in the public service and, therefore, reliant on the British Exchequer, one wonders whether the proposal to transfer fiscal authority to the Northern Ireland Assembly might perhaps lead to a collapse of the Northern Ireland economy, which might be part of the Sinn F&eacute;in project.  It is a rather interesting development.  However, I wish to take&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>In the light of the political points made by Senators Tom Sheahan and Ivana Bacik on Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s role in government in recent years, I would welcome the Leader considering the possibility of arranging a debate on the previous Administration and the fact that we have reached our present position.

I refer the Leader to the Global Economic Forum in the Far East that concluded yesterday at which the Chinese Deputy Prime Minister stated we were all in this together as our economies were globally interlocked and that the only way we would be able to get out of the crisis was by working together.  As for any suggestion that what happened during the terms of office of the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administrations led to the collapse of this economy and that of the entire world, I rely on the good instincts of the people who will decide.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be important for the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to appear in the House as soon as possible.  By all accounts, we face a tough budget and one is told that &euro;1 billion is likely to be cut from the social welfare budget.  It is important that this House debate that budget before decisions are finally made.  Right across the board, Members should have an opportunity to make proposals on where savings could be made for the good of the country and its citizens.  This would be a general debate and while I do not believe it has been called for in the House previously, I am sure many Members would have interesting proposals to make.  For example, considerable savings could be made in the social welfare budget by investing in a free book rental scheme for schools.  However, Members must examine the details of such proposals.  In addition, this morning I was interested to note the ESRI had published a study demonstrating that people were not better off while in receipt of social welfare benefits, despite what it is often said.</P>

	<P>In fact, as few as 3% of unemployed persons would have a lower income were they to work.  However, the report contains another figure that is of great concern.  Some 42% of those in receipt of social welfare benefits, that is, 183,000 people, are long-term claimants.  That group should be specifically examined to ascertain what could be done for them.  Rather than considering the entire cohort out of work and claiming social welfare benefits, it must be broken down and categorised to ascertain how specific groups might be helped.</P><Col N="810"/>
        <P>My concern is that members of the Joint Committee on Social Protection often have such discussions, but such discussions do not take place in this Chamber unless the Minister is present.  While it is great to have such debates at the joint committee, one can fool oneself sometimes into thinking everyone knows about it.  Consequently, some of these proposals and ideas must be thrashed out much more tightly.  I, therefore, urge the Leader to bring the Minister into the House very soon.  If &euro;1 billion of a budget cut of &euro;3.6 billion is being sought in this way, it is considerable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">While I acknowledge the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has been a good attendee in the Seanad, it is time to bring him back for an urgent debate on the future of the regional airports.  The bad news from Galway this morning with regard to the pull-out of Aer Arann follows on from a near disastrous set of circumstances in County Kerry towards the end of the tourism season when no flights were operated to and from Dublin for a period.  The Government has not got a sense of the importance of our regional airports.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come to the House for a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Leader and other Members will be as surprised as I was to learn that every time a person purchases an item in a shop and pays with a credit or debit card, it creates and supports jobs in the UK.  I am an independent retailer and when our terminals failed and needed to be replaced and updated I learned to my surprise that rather than dealing with AIB, we were dealing with Ingenico, which is based in Huddersfield or some other place in England.  It appears that AIB has franchised its entire plastic operation to a British company.  We are effectively the owners of AIB and I cannot understand how that situation was allowed to develop.  Some 75% of retail sales use credit or debit cards and we are supposed to be the masters of the smart economy.  Why in the name of God was that done?  I ask the Leader to investigate and come up with an answer.</P>
        <P>Further to what Senator Leyden said about judicial appointments, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, did indignation very well every day when he was in opposition and he drove a very honourable man out of the top job in the Oireachtas, the former Ceann Comhairle, John O&rsquo;Donoghue.

        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe mentioned that the Common Agricultural Policy will be reviewed.  The Leader should invite the European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development to the House to deal with that issue.  It would an appropriate way to deal with the debate in addition to having the Minister come to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is reported today that the number of vacant houses has reduced and that the number of ghost estates has reduced.  I commend the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Penrose, for his work in the area since he was appointed.  As I have done on a number of occasions in recent weeks, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State to the House to give us a progress report on what he proposes to achieve in the next 12 months or so.  I acknowledge that work has been done, some of it in my county, but much more remains to be done in this regard.  Before local authorities take ownership of any more houses, they should conduct an audit of the houses they own at present.  Throughout the Twenty-six Counties houses owned by local authorities are lying vacant, in some cases for up to two years.  Before they take charge of any more houses, they should deal with the houses already in their control.</P><Col N="812"/>
        <P Just="Left">I support the call by Senator Conway a few weeks ago that we should have a debate on the national lottery.  There is at least one game to be played every day.  It seems to be raking in the money but is not distributing very much of it to worthy causes.  I seek an urgent debate on the national lottery.  What is it doing with the money and where is it going?</P>

	<P>I welcome the Keane report as a first step in dealing with the big problems of people who are unable to pay their mortgages in full.  In the D&aacute;il yesterday the Taoiseach asked for further suggestions.  I support Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, Byrne and others in calling for a wide range of measures to deal with the issue.  They mentioned the suggestions from New Beginning.  We should be able to get cross-party support on this major issue.  New Beginning has suggested a cap of 35% of the net income with perhaps leaving &euro;100,000 aside for some time for some people with mortgages.  We should invite representatives of New Beginning to brief us on their proposals and the briefing should take place either in the Seanad Chamber or in an adjoining room.  I spoke to Mr. David Ball of New Beginning yesterday.  He indicated that he and his colleagues would be willing to come and address us on that issue.</P>

	<P>I support the calls for a debate on the mortgage issue which is crippling the country with more than 60,000 families in mortgage arrears.  The Minister for Finance should come to the House to address a range of issues.  The Keane report has taken an excessively simplistic approach to solving the problem and we need to think outside the box to solve it.  I support Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s call for a briefing by New Beginning to take place either in the Chamber or in the AV room, which would be very helpful to all the Members of the House.</P>
        <P>Yesterday the CAP reform legislative proposals were announced.  They will have far reaching consequences for Irish agriculture not least of which will be the transfer of funds from single farm payment to single area-based payments based on the 2014 land area farmers would have.  If those proposals are given legal standing by the Parliament and the Council of Ministers there will be a land grabbing exercise between now and 2014 here and in every other member state.  It is an unrealistic proposal coming from the European Commission on which we need an urgent debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Members on all sides of the House are very energised this morning.  There were quite a number of speakers.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien spoke about the Keane report.  The Minister for Finance was in the House last week, and he took questions from everyone who wished to ask them.  He will be in the House next Wednesday and possibly Thursday to deal with the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill 2011; therefore, Members may have an opportunity to raise some of the points made today.  We will try to arrange a separate debate on the report as soon as possible and see whether the Minister for Finance or the Minister of State with responsibility for housing will take it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In respect of assisting people with mortgage difficulties and the promises made in the programme for Government, I remind Members on the other side of the House that all proposals will be made known to the people on budget day.  That will provide the first opportunity for the Government to outline its budgetary process and whether there will be any cuts in any area.  I can assure Members that to raise &euro;4 billion, there will be considerable cuts in practically every Department.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik requested a further debate in six months on a prostitution law.  We will certainly request the Minister for Justice and Equality or the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Lynch, to come back into the House at that stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Cathaoirleach made a ruling on the issue raised by Senator Byrne and, as far as I am concerned, the matter is closed.  If Members wish to raise it at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the Chairman will decide whether it can be reopened.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Kelly and Daly and others spoke about commercial rates and a possible amendment to the Valuation Act 2001.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will be in the House in early November, and I am sure that is a matter he would like to discuss with Members.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn spoke about people accessing a portion of their pension fund and the possibility of introducing an electronic card for social welfare recipients to purchase goods in the country.  We can raise these matters with the Minister for Social Protection, and there have been several requests for her to come into this House.  She has confirmed that she will be in the House for statements, questions and answers on 17 November; therefore, there will be ample opportunity for Members to raise the many points which they raised today on social welfare, including possible cuts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Conway highlighted the 2001 World Health Organization report on people who are visually impaired, and the fact that today is World Vision Day.  I will certainly inquire about the establishment of a working group, on which I will get back to him.  We certainly appreciate his comments on accessing the Order of Business electronically on an iPad.  As I stated yesterday to Senator Zappone, every facility should be made available for Members to access information, and I am glad that is being provided for Senator Conway and other Members in a similar position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Daly requested that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade be called into the House to deal with the backlog of submissions on EU legislation.  This point was made by Senators Walsh and Burke.  The House should be used more to deal with EU legislation, and we will certainly investigate that possibility.</P><Col N="814"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Gilroy spoke about waiting times for people with scoliosis and other spinal deformities.  The Minister for Health will be in the House on 27 October and the matter should be raised with him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mullen&rsquo;s issue was discussed in the debate on the Private Members&rsquo; motion yesterday and decided upon.  Therefore, I do not think there is any need to comment on it.</P>

	<P>Senators Cullinane, Mooney and &Oacute; Domhnaill spoke about the Assembly in the North.  I think they have differing opinions on it, but perhaps we can come back to it at a later stage for a debate.  I do not think we should be discussing it right now.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe called for a debate on the Common Agricultural Policy proposals.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has been very co-operative with this House.  We had an excellent debate with him a couple of weeks ago.  I agree that we need a debate on those proposals and we will examine the possibility of inviting the Commissioner for Agriculture and possibly our own Commissioner to address the House at a later stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Walsh raised a point about an apartment block in Donaghmede.  He rightly pointed out that there may have been a dereliction of duty on the part of some of the architects, developers and legal people involved.  If there has been any wrongdoing, the people concerned should be brought before the courts.  The plight of some of the people living in the apartments is appalling.  They have spent every penny they have on getting a home, yet they find themselves in these difficulties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Sheahan made a point about the Fianna F&aacute;il logo.  I do not think I can comment on that matter or help him with it.  He certainly energised the other side of the House on the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.  I do not propose to accept the amendment, but I have stated that the Minister for Finance will be in the House next Wednesday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Hayden spoke about a report on homelessness by Threshold and we will try to bring before the House those Ministers for whom she called.  We will certainly have the Ministers for Health and Social Protection, while I am trying to arrange a debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney rightly pointed out that all our problems cannot be laid at the feet of Fianna F&aacute;il, although many of them certainly can.  I have addressed the point in relation to the CAP.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames spoke about proposals for savings in social protection.  The Minister will be in the House on 17 November.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan spoke about the future of regional airports.  We will attempt to get the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport into the House.  I do not wish to comment on his comments on appointments to the Judiciary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Colm Burke spoke about the EU proposals and the debate on the CAP which we will arrange.  Senator Wilson called on the Minister of State with responsibility for housing to undertake an audit of houses owned by local authorities.  That probably has been done, but we will ask the Minister of State to address the matter when he comes before the House.  There was also a request for a debate on funding from the national lottery.  That issue could be raised with the Minister for Finance or any Ministers who come into the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy made a good suggestion that the people in New Beginning give a briefing to Members.   I suggest to the Senator that he invite them in to provide us with such a briefing <Col N="815"/>in the audio-visual room.  The Senator can arrange it and notify Members.  I am sure it will be well attended.  I think I have also addressed the points that Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Paul Kehoe.  I understand it is his first visit to the new Seanad and he is most welcome.  We wish him well in his new role.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>This is my first visit to Seanad &Eacute;ireann and I hope we will have an enlightened debate on the Central Statistics Office.  I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House on the important role official statistics continue to play in developing public policy in Ireland and planning for the future.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for the Central Statistics Office, CSO, I am keen to record the Government&rsquo;s appreciation of the important public service role of the office.  The CSO serves Ireland well and publishes a vast range of statistics for the economy and society and on important topics.  This information is used by Departments, public bodies, EU institutions, the IMF, the OECD and other international bodies.  The international attention given to Ireland&rsquo;s statistics has increased dramatically in the past three years.  Statistics are also widely used by businesses, universities, research institutes and the general public.  The public is increasingly aware of statistics and indicators concerning the economic and social issues that affect our daily lives.  This reflects the times in which we live.</P>
        <P>In times of such major change it is opportune to assess the direction official statistics will take and, specifically, how official statistics can make a greater contribution to informing general public policy.  The CSO is best known for conducting the census of population and I have been impressed by the professionalism of this year&rsquo;s census which was undertaken in April.  The preliminary results, published in June, show that there are 4.58 million people in Ireland.  Surprisingly, this is almost 100,000 more than had been forecast.  The CSO is processing the detailed census returns and will release the detailed results during 2012, with the first report set to be published in March.</P>
        <P>There are two important features of the work of the CSO that I am keen to emphasise: its independence and its confidentiality.  Both principles are enshrined in law in the Statistics Act 1993.  The Director General of the office is fully independent in regard to professional standards and the conduct, content and timing of the information published by the CSO.  This indepen<Col N="817"/>dence is essential to ensure the public can have complete confidence that the statistics are impartial and it allows debate to focus on the implications for society of the numbers published.  The second principle is confidentiality: all information collected by the CSO from households, individuals and businesses is treated as strictly confidential and only used for statistical purposes.  These principles form part of the CSO&rsquo;s adherence to the highest international standards, as set out in the UN fundamental principles of official statistics and the European statistics code of practice.  Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union is one of the most important factors in determining statistical requirements.  Virtually all of the statistics produced by the CSO are required by EU regulations.  The CSO&rsquo;s involvement in the European statistical system enables us to work to common standards and produce information which is internationally comparable.</P>
        <P>Statistical offices throughout Europe and further afield face similar challenges, including how to meet current and growing demands for information, how to become more efficient and work within budget restrictions, and how to reduce the burden on data providers.  It may appear difficult to reconcile these three objectives which amount to producing more with less.  The first objective is to meet current and growing demands for information.  The CSO already publishes more than 300 statistical releases and publications every year.  These include our most important economic indicators such as the quarterly employment and unemployment figures, the quarterly national accounts, and the monthly consumer price index and retail sales index.  These figures receive close attention at all times but more so in the present climate.</P>
        <P>One of the office&rsquo;s most recently introduced series, the monthly residential property price index, has generated a good deal of interest.  The CSO&rsquo;s publications also include larger-scale projects such as the census, the household budget survey and the census of agriculture.  It is collecting information for the OECD programme for assessment of adult competencies.  This will be an important data source on adult literacy and numeracy.</P>
        <P>The CSO produces a vast range of information, all of it highly relevant to current policy questions.  However, it will face growing demands in the coming years.</P>
        <P>At international level, there is an active discussion of the need to augment traditional economic indicators with supplementary information on quality of life, sustainability and the environment.  The Stiglitz report on the measurement of economic performance and social progress, commissioned in 2008 by President Sarkozy of France, made recommendations that have been widely accepted by policymakers and will, in time, lead to demands for new surveys and statistics.  The National Statistics Board has also identified data gaps in important policy areas, including energy and the environment, transport and travel, health, education, short-term economic indicators, and housing and construction.</P>
        <P>The second major challenge facing statistical offices is to work within more limited budgets.  I am pleased to note the Central Statistics Office has been very active in implementing structural changes to make the collection, processing and dissemination of statistics more efficient.  It has fully met all savings commitments to date and I am confident it will continue to do so.</P>
        <P>The third challenge is to reduce the burden on respondents.  I am glad to report that the CSO is taking a comprehensive approach to this issue, particularly for business surveys, by redesigning questionnaires, reducing sample sizes and integrating data from existing sources, where possible.  The burden of business surveys has fallen by 18% between 2008 and 2010.  This is a major step by the Central Statistics Office towards meeting the 25% reduction target by 2012, which was set out in the European Commission action programme for reducing administrative burden.  In this regard, I should add that statistics constitute only a small part of the total administrative burden facing businesses.  Further reductions in burden are under way this year in the annual services inquiry and the June and December agricultural surveys.  In both <Col N="818"/>cases, the CSO is making greater use of existing administrative data to compile the necessary information.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Administrative records are also a valuable resource for new statistical analysis.  The CSO release &ldquo;Foreign Nationals&rsquo; PPSN Allocations, Employment and Social Welfare Activity&rdquo; is compiled from administrative data, as is the &ldquo;Job Churn&rdquo; analysis.  This illustrates the dynamics of the changing level of employment in each sector.  Both releases are highly topical and have direct relevance to policy.  They demonstrate the statistical potential of administrative data.  The National Statistics Board has made the realisation of this potential its primary strategic objective over the past decade.  This has led to many improvements and will continue to be a priority in order that the Central Statistics Office can meet new information needs as efficiently as possible.  This will require not only increased analysis of the available files but a fundamental rethink of how we organise and structure administrative processes and information.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a clear synergy between the better use of data and the Government&rsquo;s reform programme for the public sector.  The reform programme emphasises accountability and the measurement of performance.  Statistics provide sound evidence for this to inform decision making and monitor policy outcomes.  A central part of reform is the need to move towards a more joined-up Government administration, eliminating policy and operational silos by making policy and practice more focused and integrated across Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Central Statistics Office and broader statistical system have a significant part to play in this reform.  I recently met officials of the National Statistics Board to discuss the board&rsquo;s priorities for statistics and I am working with my colleagues in government to advance a co-ordinated approach to official statistics.  The rationale is clear &mdash; joined-up government needs joined-up data.  For the CSO, this involves three major technical issues which have a bearing on the capacity to use administrative data to produce statistics, namely, the manner in which personal data is organised to enable linkage and analysis of information for statistical purposes; the manner in which business data is organised for statistical use; and geographical classifications, including, in particular, the need to introduce a standard post code system.  These are key issues in enabling the CSO to compile statistics more efficiently, while respecting individual confidentiality.  They are also key issues for public administration in general which, if addressed centrally, can contribute to more efficient and customer focused public services.</P>
        <P>Other countries make extensive use of registers in their administration and statistical systems.  Ireland does not have a tradition of official registers, for example, registers of persons, businesses or buildings.  Addressing these gaps in what one could describe as the &ldquo;national data infrastructure&rdquo; would be of long-term benefit to the country.</P>
        <P>I have focused until now on the work of the CSO.  This is fitting as the office has the primary role in producing official statistics in Ireland.  However, the National Statistics Board has recognised that, for the long-term objectives for official statistics to be met in full, it will be necessary for other public bodies, notably larger Departments, to engage actively and effectively in statistical production.  In response to this, all Departments are now required to prepare data strategies and a number of Departments and offices have established statistical units staffed by professional statisticians on secondment from the Central Statistics Office.  In short, an embryonic Irish statistical system has emerged which can play an increasingly important role in supporting the production and use of high quality official statistics throughout the system.</P>
        <P>I stress the critical importance of having good quality statistics to inform policy making and planning.  There is a greater than ever focus on statistical information and we are fortunate in having a highly professional and independent Central Statistics Office to meet Ireland&rsquo;s statistical needs.  The demand for statistics continues to increase, while resources are constrained. <Col N="819"/> Accordingly, we must find better ways to meet demand.  In this regard, the effective use of administrative records for statistical purposes is the highest priority.  The Government is fully committed to supporting the Central Statistics Office and wider statistical system in its endeavours, which benefit all of us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  The Minister of State is particularly welcome given that this is the first time he has addressed the House.  I wish him well in dealing with his onerous responsibilities in the Department of the Taoiseach and not least in his role as Government Chief Whip.  I echo the Leas-Chathaoirleach&rsquo;s comments in expressing the hope that the Minister of State will visit the House on many occasions during the five year term of the Government.  I hope today&rsquo;s discussion offers him an insight into the effective working of the Seanad, notwithstanding the Government&rsquo;s pledge to hold a referendum on the abolition of the House.</P>
        <P>I am impressed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s strong defence of and support for the Central Statistics Office and its work.  I will declare a minor interest arising from the fact that my wife&rsquo;s first job in the Civil Service was in the Central Statistics Office.  She later moved to the Departments of Defence, Agriculture and Social Welfare, as that Department was then known.</P>
        <P>I will cut to the chase.  The Minister of State referred several times to the high level of professionalism of the Central Statistics Office.  In light of his stout defence of the CSO, I note also the following comments, which highlight the difficulty facing the office:</P>
        <P LI="1">The second major challenge facing statistical offices is to work within more limited budgets.  I am pleased to note the Central Statistics Office has been very active in implementing structural changes to make the collection, processing and dissemination of statistics more efficient.  It has fully met all savings commitments to date and I am confident it will continue to do so.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I fully understand the difficult economic circumstances in which we find ourselves and the need to secure savings across all Departments.  This is an agenda that was first pursued by the previous Government when the banking crisis struck in 2008.  Its purpose was to ensure we obtain more efficient use of increasingly limited resources.  The Government has inherited this legacy and is doing the best job it can in the circumstances.  The Minister of State correctly noted the importance of statistics and it is clear that no government, business or administration can work without accurate and up-to-date statistics.  He noted also that joined-up government needs joined-up data.  The major difficulty is that the Central Statistics Office is having a serious staffing problem and has suffered under the Government moratorium on recruitment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is having a detrimental effect in ensuring there are up-to-date data, especially in the area of tourism.  I had the opportunity of addressing this issue with the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague in government, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, who conceded there was a difficulty in this regard.  Specific tourism statistics are vital, particularly given that tourism is our second most successful indigenous industry.  I compliment the Government on the initiatives it took during the summer of lowering VAT and stimulating what has so far been a reasonably good year for tourism, with an increase of 245,000 in visitor numbers in the second quarter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The problem is that tourism is seasonal.  It is vital, therefore, not only for the industry but for Government, in particular the relevant line Departments, to have up-to-date statistics.  Those currently being processed are at least three months, and in some instances six months, out of date.  I understand this is because the number of staff available to process the statistics has been reduced.  As the Minister of State repeatedly signalled, it is vital to have up-to-date statistics.  Perhaps he might address the staffing issue in the context of his remarks about sav<Col N="820"/>ings.  I wonder if the savings are not counter-productive.  Although a relatively small amount of money may be saved, the lack of up-to-date statistics may not only inhibit outside businesses such as those involved in tourism but also restrict actual government in terms of dealing with policy issues that must be addressed in the short term rather than in the medium or long term.  I fully accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s position and he will obviously hold the line as per the moratorium.  However, I am sure he will agree that in certain key Departments there have been breaches of the moratorium for very good reasons.  As the Minister of State correctly identified, the CSO is a vital arm of State, not only for the proper and efficient functioning of Government but also for business and for people operating outside Government.  He might address that issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State referred to the fact that we do not have a tradition of official registers, for example, of persons, businesses or buildings.  He believes that addressing these gaps by what one might term a national data infrastructure would be of long-term benefit to the country.  Perhaps he might expand on that.  Are there plans for an introduction of such an infrastructure?  There have been calls, for example, for a national register of buildings.  There have also been calls in the real estate area for a national register of pricing or prices.  As the Minister of State will know, the current state of the housing market is based very much on anecdotal evidence and evidence provided by what can loosely be termed vested interests, namely, those in the real estate industry.  They are the people on whom we rely to a large extent to establish the current level of the housing market.  Such information is based very much on the experiences of those companies.  I do not for one moment cast aspersions on them but one of the key criticisms of the bubble period was that real estate companies talked up the property market through their advertising.  They spent lavishly on advertising and as a result the media, in particular the printed media, were compliant in keeping the property bubble going because it was in their financial interest so to do.  When the bubble burst, there was a considerable loss of advertising revenue to the national media, especially print media.</P>
        <P>It would be important for the Minister of State to address this gap in the statistics in order that there might be an independent national assessment of the housing market in terms of pricing and a universal assessment rather than the sectional one we have at present.  That might give us some indication.  As the Minister of State and I know, and as most of us know, there are people who are waiting for further decline in the housing market.  There is an indication it may have another 10% or 15% to fall in spite of the fact that first-time buyers in particular are having a great deal of difficulty in getting mortgages.  It seems that the banking sector has dried up in that regard.  One need only look at the statistics published by the CSO which show some 13,000 mortgages issued this year, a figure that hearkens back to the 1970s.  Even given the limited resources of the CSO, it would be helpful to know if the Minister of State has a view on whether it is important to have this assessment.  It would be vital information to give to people throughout the country because it would give some sense of the national figures, be independently based and be arrived at professionally.  I single out that point because the Minister of State raised the issue of a national register.  In the current climate such nationally based statistics, if available, might help to stimulate the market.  People would have more confidence if they realised the market had actually bottomed out.  As of now, we do not know whether it has done so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Overall, I am delighted the Minister of State attended the House to discuss what may be an underestimated, yet is a vital arm of government which impacts on people&rsquo;s lives every day, although they may not realise it.  The Minister of State set out his stall admirably within the budgetary constraints imposed on him and the Government.  In the current spending review he must fight for and be more specific about an increase in resources for the CSO to ensure we <Col N="821"/>have proper statistics, particularly those relating to tourism, in which area I have an interest.  That is vital.  Industry leaders have pointed out, as have Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the need to have further up-to-date statistics.</P>
        <P>I shall offer a final example.  If one is in business in the tourism industry and has figures that are up to date, then one can take marketing decisions that will ensure one&rsquo;s business is kept afloat or can be improved.  However, if one bases one&rsquo;s actions on figures that are six months out of date, it will be very difficult to make a value decision that will be of help, not only to one&rsquo;s personal business but to the national economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I again commend the Minister of State&rsquo;s presentation and wish him continued success in this role and in the much wider role of ensuring we get the country back into a stable, economic and more prosperous environment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, on his appointment as Government Chief Whip.  The word &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; is often used and abused on the corridors of this House but Deputy Kehoe is a gentleman to his fingertips.  I am delighted at his appointment. His presentation today was very enlightening.  We all know the importance of gathering accurate information.  The Central Statistics Office has done a very good job over the years.  The 1901 and 1911 censuses were posted on the Internet and had a an amazing number of hits.  This information is of great interest.  The latest census, carried out earlier this year, was the most comprehensive ever undertaken in this country.  It may have been cumbersome and it took time to complete but the usefulness of the exercise, the information that will be gathered as a result and the knowledge base that will be developed will be most beneficial to this country.</P>
        
        <P>I agree, too, with much of what Senator Mooney said.  In this House we have discussed the importance of having up-to-date statistics.  Senator Mooney mentioned tourism figures that do not emerge as quickly and efficiently as they should.  I agree that monthly tourism figures should be released.  Let us suppose one has a certain marketing budget and one is trying to decide how to spend it.  If monthly figures were released quickly, at least one could redirect or divert resources where, for example, a particular area was not the subject of sufficient focus or another area deserved more attention because it was successful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In all aspects of business, matters of social equality and life in general, statistics are very important.  We often hear estimates given in presentations of, for example, so many hundreds of thousands of empty houses in the country or 10% of the population having a declared disability.  It is not good enough to estimate.  We need facts.  The Minister of State outlined the clear determination of the Government to try to create a statistical framework in this country that will deal specifically with facts.  When one has facts, one can look one&rsquo;s European partners in the eye.  One can also operate internationally because one knows that one has access to the best knowledge available and that this is backed up by properly compiled and collated records.  People may not immediately see the value of spending money on collating statistics and carrying out research.  However, it is money that is extremely well spent.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State comment on the links we have with the Northern Ireland Assembly and with those who are responsible for compiling statistics in that jurisdiction?  It would be much more beneficial if we could operate on an all-island basis when it comes to statistics.  I imagine that good work is being done in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the past, the National Statistics Board has published a number of surveys which contain some very interesting recommendations.  Based on what the Minister of State said, many of those recommendations are going to be taken on board.  We can move forward by having access to the facts and by dealing in those facts.</P><Col N="822"/>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of the social agenda, we are facing into a budget in respect of which difficult decisions are going to have to be made.  If one has accurate statistics, it is easier for one to make such decisions because one knows in advance exactly how people are going to be affected.  Let us consider the position with regard to education.  The information relating to people with disabilities, minority groups, etc., within the education sector could be better.  It will certainly be better when what is proposed is put in place.  As the Minister of State rightly indicated, all Departments have a responsibility to up their game in the context of ensuring that the data they collect is of good quality.  He pointed out that some Departments are probably better than others in this regard.  However, we need to establish best practice throughout the public service in respect of the collation and assessment of data.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our record in respect of this matter compares quite well with other jurisdictions.  Despite the fact that it was probably not provided with the resources it required in the past, the Central Statistics Office is performing extremely well. The framework it uses should be adopted across the board in the future.  I look forward to 2012, when the full and final results of the recent census of population will be published.  It will be interesting to see the answers that were provided in respect of questions that were asked on this occasion but not on previous ones in respect of education, culture, etc.  We have a responsibility to the next generation to ensure that facts relating to our era are properly collated and assessed.  There may be a great many aspects of society about which we are not happy but if we are able to place a true and accurate account into the history books, we will have achieved a great deal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I am sure other Senators wish to contribute, I will bring my remarks to a conclusion.  I thank the Minister of State for his very fine and enlightening presentation.  As Senator Mooney correctly stated, this is an area of government which too often goes unnoticed.  Perhaps there is a need for us, as public representatives, to highlight the valuable work that is being done.  I regularly visit the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s website in order to browse its most recent publications.  That website is extremely informative and up to date and one can obtain from it statistics relating to many matters.  I have a particular interest in tourism and it is intriguing to monitor the various trends relating to the number of visitors who are coming here from abroad, the number of Irish people travelling abroad, etc.  Having access to such information helps one formulate one&rsquo;s thinking.</P>
        <P>There is a need for us, as public representatives, to highlight the positive work being done by the Central Statistics Office and also that being done by business groups and individuals, on a private basis, in respect of collecting and collating information.  The Vintners Federation of Ireland has worked closely with a number of researchers to collect accurate data in respect of the type of products on sale and so forth.  Perhaps there might be an opportunity to work jointly with some of the private research companies in order to ensure that overlaps do not occur and that all the facts collected are drawn together in a comprehensive manner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish the Minister of State well with his brief.  I have no doubt that in four years time we will have a much more advanced programme of statistical collection.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join Senators Conway and Mooney in welcoming and praising the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.  It is extremely important to have a strong Central Statistics Office.  It is also important to recognise its great level of expertise and its many achievements worldwide.  The person missing from this debate &mdash; I am sure he is looking on from some vantage point &mdash; is the late Dr. Garrett FitzGerald, who was the leading customer of the CSO for many years.  He is now frequenting another CSO, namely, the celestial statistics office, and I do not doubt that he is pestering St. Peter and others to ensure that they submit their data on time.</P><Col N="823"/>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated that:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The Director General of the office is fully independent in regard to professional standards and the content and timing of the information published by CSO.  This independence is essential to ensuring that the public can have complete confidence that the statistics are impartial and it allows debate to focus on the implications for society of the numbers published.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This is most important and it has been a feature of the Central Statistics Office during its lifetime.  The first director, Dr. Roy Geary, was absolutely eminent in the sphere of international statistics and he published hundreds of journal articles.  He used to write such articles in the evenings having spent all day carrying out his work on statistics.  Dr. Geary was one of the leading innovators in his field.  His successor, Dr. Donal McCarthy, became the president of University College Cork, UCC.  This is, therefore, an area in which there is massive expertise and the latter has been built upon the independence to which the Minister of State referred.  I ask that he bring back to the Cabinet the message that we should have an economic service, for want of a better term, which is similar to and as independent and professional as the CSO.  The Wright report highlighted the serious deficiencies that exist in the level of economic expertise available to the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sir Gus O&rsquo;Donnell, secretary to the British Cabinet, joined the UK Civil Service as an economist and perfected a system to facilitate information flows from other economists throughout that service.  He is due to retire soon and with a name like his I am sure he would make himself available to advise the Government &mdash; perhaps he could speak in the Seanad &mdash; on how to encourage greater professionalism. The CSO provides the model in the context of what constitutes a successfully operating public agency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State also indicated that &ldquo;all Departments are now required to prepare data strategies and a number of Departments and offices have established statistical units staffed by professional statisticians on secondment from the Central Statistics Office.&rdquo;  On several occasions, particularly in the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sherlock, the House has discussed the problems in the context of quantification, statistics, etc.  The CSO has an international reputation and perhaps some of its staff could come to the Houses to explain to Members &mdash; perhaps in the audio-visual room &mdash; the position with regard to newly emerging statistics and so on.  The staff on secondment to whom the Minister of State referred could also spend time bringing Members up to date on statistics and quantitative methods.  In view of the fact that a large group of students were present in the Visitors Gallery until a few moments ago, perhaps the staff in question could also visit schools in order to educate students on this subject.  There is a need to overcome Irish people&rsquo;s fear of quantification and statistics.  The CSO could lead the way in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When Lord Beveridge retired from his position as director of the London School of Economics, he stated in his farewell address that &ldquo;economic and political theorising not based on facts and not controlled by facts assuredly does lead nowhere.&rdquo;  There is no question but that we need the facts.  Lord Beveridge also stated that it &ldquo;matters little how wrong we are with our existing theories if we are honest and careful with our observations.&rdquo;  The information the Minister of State has brought before the House today is extremely important and all discussions on public policy in Ireland should be informed by far more quantification and data than is currently the case.</P>
        <P>There is a long and honourable tradition of work in the sphere of statistics and quantification in this country.  We have neglected this in a way and pretended that we are backward when it <Col N="824"/>comes to quantification.  Some 38 years before the American Economics Association was established and 44 years before the Royal Economic Society in the UK, undergraduates in Trinity College Dublin founded the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland, with the great John Kells Ingram one of the founders.  The importance of statistics is illustrated in that regard.  That learned society, with very close links to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, is one of the oldest learned societies in the world.  Ingram would also have been known for his patriotic poetry about 1798 but the society was set up during the Great Famine to illustrate how important it was to have statistics.</P>
        <P>The pressure of social problems demanding attention led the society&rsquo;s youthful founders to attempt the establishment of such an institution.  It has not occupied itself with dilettante statistics collected with no special purpose or tending to no definite conclusion but has from the first applied itself in the spirit of earnest inquiry to the most important questions affecting the condition of the country.  An extract from its journal reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">Our business is to discover and demonstrate, by the application of scientific principles, the legislative action appropriate to each phase of society and each group of economic conditions.  At what precise time, and in what particular form, our conclusions should be adopted in practice, is a question of political expediency, which those who are acquainted with the varying exigencies of public life can determine better than we.  But it is encouraging to know that in endeavouring, by our researches and discussions, to overthrow error and to establish truth, we are labouring at no unpractical &mdash; no hopeless- task; that any wise suggestion developed here may one day become a beneficent reality; a living agency for good; and that thus, without sitting in the councils of the State, or mingling in the strife of parties, we may, each of us, do something towards the improvement of the institutions of our country.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Patriotism shines through that and there was a practicality in getting the society up and running, which led to a statistics office.  It is an inspiration.</P>
        <P>Another aspect mentioned by my colleague, Senator Conway, should see the CSO commended.  For years, the statistical abstract had a Northern Ireland supplement.  Unfortunately, after 1922 the two parts of Ireland did not have a dialogue for about 40 or 50 years but the CSO was a terrific exception with a statistical abstract for Northern Ireland as a precedent we have happily followed to the present harmonious state of North-South relations.</P>
        <P>The Central Statistics Office is a model in professionalism and how bodies can reach to other Departments in order to overcome quantitative deficiencies.  That should be extended to our schools and education and there is much expertise in Cork and its university&rsquo;s department of statistics.  It has been a very valuable national asset and people like Messrs. Roy Geary and Michael McCarthy have had an international reputation.  I would commend this body at all times, nearly as strongly as Dr. Garrett FitzGerald used to.  I wish it well in development.</P>
        <P>Perhaps we could get data earlier?  We had all the necessary data to indicate that the banking system was about to implode but so many mountains of data come to us that we may have taken our eye off the ball.  Every time we get important CSO data perhaps we could use the audio-visual room to view it, and perhaps personnel in Cork could explain data to Deputies and Senators.  That would be another improvement on what is already a terrific record.</P>

	<P>I join colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State to the House.  I echo Senator Barrett&rsquo;s sentiments about the model of excellence that is the CSO.  For years it has worked tirelessly and without enormous recognition for what it does.  In many ways statistics are like the glue and we do not think of that; if we did not have statistics we would rapidly fall apart.</P><Col N="825"/>
        <P Just="Left">I will concentrate on specific examples.  I went on a tour of the websites of statistics offices in other countries, and specifically the Office for National Statistics in the UK.  It had a figure for the deaths of elderly people attributable to the winter but I could not find the same figure in the Irish context, although I may not have been looking in the right place.  Between 2009 and 2010, 25,400 elderly people in the UK died in the winter due to the conditions, and we can see in that one figure how straightaway one could start arming doctors, hospitals and social services.  With one vital piece of information policy can be built, which is what is being discussed, and this would take into account issues such as winter fuel payments and flu vaccine stocks.  Without even discussing it further, the great reach of the figure is enormous.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no argument and everybody understands and agrees with this process; everybody knows that with statistics we can build public policy.  The Minister of State has given a great explanation of what is happening behind the scenes, which I am heartened to hear.  A complete industry is now building around statistics and analysis, and statisticians may become household names in future in the way that economists, unfortunately, have become household names and the new commentators in modern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and we as Senators acknowledge that in the Irish context we have a way to go and the work is very much in progress.  It is good to hear that Departments will now build their own statistical units and enhance the statistical base.  That is supported by European requirements.  One may consider the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the US in this regard, which does exactly what it says on the tin, offering an array of statistics and analysis relating to trade, tourism, income and spending that are in some ways unimaginable.  The figures are analysed to give an enormous amount of data.</P>
        <P>Many bodies in Ireland offer statistical information, including Forf&aacute;s, the ESRI and the Western Development Commission, all slowly feeding into what is becoming a more evidence-based policy decision making process.  This is at the heart of the matter, as policy makers and politicians will become more informed, or at least have no excuse if they are not.  Statistics are one of the strongest weapons against clientelism, favouritism and political strokes.  If that is at the heart of what we are investing in, it is a strong reason to concentrate on the value of statistics.</P>
        <P>As the industry becomes more refined and targeted, informed decisions must be taken to decide what information must be gathered, how often and in what ways it can be employed.  There should also be consideration of how to be more economical in gathering information.  We know people do not like filling in forms and providing small detail, and constantly we hear that garda&iacute;, teachers, paramedics and doctors deal with endless paperwork.  In such cases paperwork is the provision of data that can be useful.  It is good to hear from the Minister of State that the burden, particularly on business, is being reduced.  Perhaps it is up to us to find ways to find another label for paperwork and understand it as statistical information that is of benefit to the community in a wider context.  We have never done this and I do not know where the responsibility lies; it may not be with the CSO.  It could be up to us to stop it being called paperwork and remaining a tedious task.</P>
        <P>Technology and the development of appropriate software for analysing data has a significant role to play in this area.  I trust that in the building of further statistical bases in the country, the most appropriate and cost-efficient software will be used to support and encourage the work.  We should not find ourselves in the midst of an argument down the road because software suites in different Departments cannot communicate with each other.  I know the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has spoken about some of the difficulties in her Department relating to gathering data and various parts of the organisation where the <Col N="826"/>computer systems cannot speak to each other.  It would be unfortunate if that happened when the Minister of State is driving an initiative to make more statistics available.</P>
        <P>Statistics can also have a dark side when we have information but do not act on it.  Every day figures are introduced to support an argument and in this House we regularly hear all kinds of statistics relating to banks, social welfare, housing, agriculture and so on.  I take this opportunity to provide an example of how we might not translate statistical information correctly.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I will move shamelessly to consider the north west, a part of the country, it could be argued, where it has been found to be harder than anywhere else for statistical information and evidence to break through into policy. The Look West programme encouraged people to move to or to move back to the west to repopulate it and to create a more energetic society, yet that was not accompanied by good policy on, say, public transport.  There is no railway line there.  From Galway travelling north on the west coast there is no rail line and there is none from Dublin to Donegal.  The map I am displaying is clear evidence of the large hole that is the north west.  There are tremendous roads, all of which have been built using statistical information, which demonstrates public policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate to display maps.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise.  I did not realise that.  The visual impact of a map helps us to understand that when we have such information it is our duty to convert it into policy.  There were good statistical outcomes from surgery for cancer patients in Sligo General Hospital, yet as we all know, and I will not revisit the argument, the policy ended up with there not being cancer services available in that area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, if we look specifically at the Western Development Commission and consider some of the statistics it has gathered, the rural population of the region in the north west is 68% compared with a State average of 39%.  On that basis, we can safely say it is a rural community.  If one then notes that in all counties that come under the remit of the Western Development Commission one third of the population is under the age of 24; people routinely understand that a rural population means an aging community, but that is not the case.  The average statistic of one third of the population in those counties being under the age of 24 is the same average as for rest of Ireland.  That means the region is rural but it also has a young community.  With only those two items of information, one could transform the way in which we appreciate that part of the country.  It could be said that one third of the population under the age of 24 in the north west are routinely ignored by policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we consider the share of tourism for the north west or the western region, it is roughly around 18% of the tourism business for the country, with Galway accounting for 9% of that figure.  These figures cover tourism and the rural community of the region, both elements that present enormous potential as drivers of the economy.  We need policy to encourage, support and drive such development.  The statistics are there to support it but where is the policy that needs to go with it?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Practical steps were taken by the IT in Sligo to build a centre of excellence for sustainable development in which areas such as renewable fuels, wastewater treatment and bog rehabilitation &mdash; buzz words for a green future and job creation that we talk about a good deal &mdash; were examined, yet I am not aware of there being a supporting economic policy, with the statistics that Sligo IT could produce about what it could provide by way of qualified people.  We need to use the statistics we have to build policy.</P><Col N="827"/>
        <P>There is one area in which we could take the advice of the Western Development Commission.  Its recent research into the creative sector, already employing 11,000 people, took one single factor into account.  It noted that two thirds of the businesses already based in the region did not export any of their goods and services.  It has done further research and stated that if there was proper intervention driven by policy, it could generate an additional 17,000 jobs in that western region.  That is a single concentrated item of statistical analysis that could provide jobs in an area where they are needed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Western Development Commission has got funding from INTERREG, with NUI Galway, to develop an export platform to drive exports in this area, which is good.  It achieved that by providing the statistical evidence required for that application and it is then up to the Government to support that work and specifically encourage creation of those jobs.</P>
        <P>I want to believe that today, having a Minister of State in the House and discussing the value of statistics, marks a departure in that the Government accepts that statistics can and do, and must, drive public policy.  They can and do mean that we can have more appropriate and more efficient spending of the funds that are not exactly in great amounts, that we can target them effectively with better statistical information, and that statistics can and do improve our lives, but that any investment in statistical gathering, analysis or interpretation must be accompanied by the appropriate political will.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  I trust the work the CSO does will continue and that over the lifetime of the Government we will make a conscious effort to use those statistics much more effectively to drive policy specifically where it is needed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the opportunity to have this discussion.  The area of statistics and data is one of the least glamorous of government but it is one of the most important.  It is vital when one considers that service provision is often based on information, population figures, and other data much of which comes from the Central Statistics Office.  It is disappointing that there are not more Senators here to discuss these issues because it is important in the context of a range of discussions we have had in this House in recent months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To take the example of children&rsquo;s rights, we had a discussion on it recently and different figures were given for the number of children who had gone missing in the State.  Advocate organisations had one view, the Minister concerned has a different view and the Department has a different figure, so the figures did not stack up and there was a contradiction in many of the figures that were given.  We had a good discussion on the sex trade &mdash; although I do not like to use those words &mdash; last night but again the figures were disputed in terms of how many women were working in that sector.  Advocate organisations represented in the Visitors Gallery had one set of figures and the Minister concerned had a different one.  We had a discussion about the Swedish model of criminalising prostitution and facts and figures were presented where some people used figures for one set of purposes and others used them for a different purpose.  It shows that figures are important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Barrett made a telling point about the information that was available to the then Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Government at the time of the bank guarantee when critical decisions were being made by the then Government in regard to the banks.  A mountain of evidence and data was available that it would be a bad decision and that billions of euros of taxpayers&rsquo; money potentially could be wasted if the wrong decision was made.  Despite the mountain of data available, it is interesting that it was the Financial Regulator and <Col N="828"/>the banks that provided misinformation for the Government and those who were making the decisions.  That led to the catastrophe we now have and we are all living with the consequences.  That more than anything in the history of the State shows up the importance of information and statistics.</P>
        <P>There is also an important point to make about Government policy.  Statistics underpin almost everything a Government does and every decision made by politicians, law makers, those in Departments and Governments.  Senators have given recent examples but I will give a number of further examples.  A debate on decisions to amalgamate the VECs made by the Minister for Education and Skills is ongoing.  The criteria used to arrive at decisions include the distance staff have to travel, the number of students who come through the VECs and the number of schools in a catchment area.  We have the amalgamated VEC of Waterford and Wexford in the south east.  One of the main criteria it seems the Government used to decide that the headquarters should be based in Wexford was that people from Wexford, if they had to travel to Waterford city or county, would have to travel longer than 45 km, which would be in breach of the Croke Park agreement, but people from west Waterford and Waterford city would have to travel to Wexford.   It shows that the statistics can be used in different ways to justify what many would see as a political decision.  That was the point being made by a number of Senators, namely, that it is important when we have accurate data that they are used in a fair way to underpin policy and decision making.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A previous Senator mentioned cancer care.  I cite the example of the south east which, with a population of 460,000, has critical mass.  I recall meeting a delegation of councillors from Waterford city who had met Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin when he was Minister for Health and Children.  He was opposed to the notion that the south east region should have its own centre of excellence for cancer care because he felt there was not the critical mass to justify it.  It was only on closer inspection when we examined international best practice that the Government changed its mind and decided there is a case for the south east and for proper cancer services for Waterford.  That led the Government to changing its mind.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will give some more examples.  In a recent discussion at the Joint Committee on Health and Children I raised the issue of the dependency many people have on prescription drugs, Benzos in particular.  It is important that we are informed as to what is happening, and the Minister must be informed as to what is happening.  I asked the Minister if there were data on the patterns of prescriptions in this area.  The Minister agreed it was a problem and that it needed to be solved but the way to solve it was to know where the problems were with over-prescription to ensure the Department was in a position to deal with it but the information was not available.  That highlights the need for all Ministers and Departments to be properly informed because if we do not have those patterns the Minister is not in a position to comprehensively deal with what is a complex issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A Senator mentioned the need for co-operation North and South.  That is critical because for me the Border is a line on the map.  Mention was made of the north west region but it is critical that we have information being gathered by the Assembly and that the Assembly has information gathered and available from this state.  If we consider transport, for example, a good deal of cross-Border work has been done in that area.  The same applies to the area of health where there is co-operation between the respective health departments to ensure people have the best services.  That applies not just in health but in education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support the call for a stronger link between the Central Statistics Office and its counterpart in the North.  That is important.  It is important also that we pay tribute not just to the staff of the Central Statistics Office, which I agree with previous speakers is a very professional service <Col N="829"/>that does a great service for the State in that it allows all of us to have access to information which empowers us and enables us to have more informed debates in this House, in the Lower House and in council chambers across the State as well as in general discussions, but there is also a wealth of civil and advocate organisations that do research and make data available.  Those data are as important as the information we get from the Central Statistics Office. It is interesting that when we had discussions on a range of issues &mdash; I gave a number of examples of the discussions we had recently &mdash; the wealth of information given to us by those advocate organisations was incredible and allowed us to be better informed in terms of the decisions we make.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">I do not single out any political party either in the Government or the previous one but it was a member of the Government party who made this point already.  It is important that decisions made by the Government are made on the basis of information, data, what is right and not political decisions.  We have seen far too many political decisions made where, if there is a Minister in the constituency, he or she might be better placed to get funding for transport, a health or education service.  That should not be the case.  It should be based on criteria, equality and what is right for all the people of the country.  That is reason we have a national spatial strategy and such policies are in place but often &mdash; and I gave the example of the decision on the VECs &mdash; those policies, spatial strategies, facts and information which are available to Ministers are put to one side and political decisions then made, which is wrong.  It does not matter which party is in government.  All parties should make sure that when decisions are made they are based on criteria, facts and wanting to deliver for citizens on the basis of equality, not on whether there is a Minister in a constituency.</P>

I agree with my colleague, Senator Cullinane, that decisions should be based on the criteria he outlined.  I do not want to make a party political point but I stated here last week, or even yesterday &mdash; the iron chains of memory are failing me &mdash; when Senators said that jobs would be lost here and there as a result of the barracks closures, that the relevant Minister should take into account the fact that the provision of the service is the requirement.  That may sound callous but I agree with the Senator that as we come to have new politics involving all parties that will be the basis of our decisions and statistics become even more important in that regard.</P>
        <P>Regarding my own area, that of education, the programme for Government makes clear that the Government is determined that all young people will leave school able to read, communicate orally, in writing and in digital media, and be able to understand the use of mathematics in their everyday lives and in further learning.  In the foreword of the national strategy to improve literacy and numeracy among children and young people the Minister, Deputy Quinn, states:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . we know that some children are not developing these skills as they should.  Information from national assessments of reading and mathematics, from inspections in schools and from international studies have shown that many students in Irish schools are not developing literacy and numeracy skills to the best of their abilities.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That gives the lie to the idea that we have the best education system in the world.  One cannot argue with the facts.  We cannot allow that to continue.</P><Col N="830"/>
        <P>On the general issue of statistics, I cite the great nurse, Florence Nightingale, the lady with the lamp, who was portrayed in Hollywood film as a sentimental character but who was in reality as formidable as any Blackpool landlady, as anyone who has been to Blackpool for their holidays would know.  She said:</P>
        <P LI="1">I collected my figures with a purpose in mind, with the idea that they could be used to argue for change.  Of what use are statistics if we do not know what to make of them?  What we wanted at that time was not so much an accumulation of facts, as to teach the men who are to govern the country the use of statistical facts.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These words are as relevant to the development of public policy today as they were 150 years ago when Ms Nightingale uttered them in support of her campaign to improve the appalling sanitary conditions in military hospitals.  Measuring Up to the Measurement Problem states:</P>
        <P LI="1">By carefully collecting and analysing mortality statistics of men [They were all men at that time.] admitted to the field hospital of Scutari during the Crimean War, she was able to show that injured soldiers were seven times more likely to die from diseases contracted in the hospital, such as cholera and typhus, than from wounds received on the battlefield.  On returning to England, she found that 20-30 year old soldiers living in army barracks during peacetime were twice as likely to die as men in the same age group in the general population.  She used these figures to launch a campaign which revolutionised sanitary conditions in military establishments, helped transform the career of nursing and secured her election as the first female Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Our Minister for Education and Skills knew what to do with the statistics gathered from information from national assessments of reading and mathematics based on inspections in schools and international studies.  Consequently, the Government has identified a serious weakness that will, if action is not taken, affect the future of many of our children.  As a result, the national strategy to improve literacy and numeracy among children and young people has clearly identified the action required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, to the House.  The significance of statistics in shaping public policy is often overlooked.  Often when we think of statistical information, we think of the work of the Central Statistics Office.  However, we generally only think of the Central Statistics Office when there is a census and forget about the important work it does between censuses.  The Minister of State outlined the manner in which the office serves the State through the provision of economic and social information, which in turn informs public policy of Departments.  This is very important.  I acknowledge the work of the Central Statistics Office on the census this year.  Its work ran parallel with the general election campaign and its officers were calling to people&rsquo;s doors at the same time as politicians.</P>
        <P>Statistics comprise an intriguing area.  Many university professors provide information on the manner in which public policy should be built on statistics.  I agree with this in general but with reservations.  Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe referred to the manner in which the national cancer care strategy was built upon statistical information.  The information suggested centres of excellence should be located in areas with a high population density.  Perhaps the model is more suited to other countries than to Ireland.  In England, for example, the cities are the centres of population.  Manchester, Birmingham and London have huge populations and the policy of having centres of excellence works in them.  However, in areas such as the north west of Ireland, in respect of which statistical information is only being taken from the Republic&rsquo;s side of the <Col N="831"/>Border, one must include Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Mayo before having a critical mass sufficient to justify a centre of excellence.  Some of that area is being served by facilities in the east.  There was a breakdown in the terms and the manner in which the centres of excellence were rolled out.  This is now being addressed through the centre in Derry.</P>
        <P>We must be careful about the manner in which public information is used to inform public policy.  Issues such as rural population must be taken into account.  Often, however, policy is not rural-proofed.  This is done in other jurisdictions such that those living in rural, isolated areas are given consideration over people who live in urban areas where facilities and services are economically viable to the extent that they can be provided by the private sector in addition to the public sector.  This should be taken into consideration in the formulation of public policy based on statistics, particularly in countries such as Ireland.</P>
        <P>I read some of the Keane report.  The information and recommendations in it were formed on the basis of statistical information on mortgage holders and the fact that there are 45,000 mortgage holders in arrears.  While I am not advocating that the Keane report should be supported &mdash; it has many flaws &mdash; I believe it indicates a number of areas that may merit consideration by the Government. These include the circumstances of the almost 60,000 households with restructured loans and the 45,000 who have fallen into arrears of 18 months or more.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report outlines that the Central Bank does not have access to mortgage holders&rsquo; current income levels; it is impossible, therefore, to tell whether the 88% of people who are currently paying their mortgages could absorb further tax increases by the Government or interest rate increases by the ECB.  It would be worth following up on that and identifying, through the ECB or by giving a role in this regard to the CSO, whether the people who are continuing to pay their mortgages would go into arrears if they were  faced with tax increases, new levies or additional hikes to mortgage interest rates.  It is important to obtain this information because we must try to ensure those who are paying their mortgages are supported and do not face additional costs or charges that would militate against their being able to continue to pay their mortgages.</P>
        <P>With regard to pre-budget planning, in which every Department is engaged, the Fiscal Advisory Council outlined yesterday that to meet the deficit target for 2012 of 8.6%, there would be a need for an additional adjustment of the order of &euro;400 million to the proposed cut in spending to &euro;4 billion for next year.  If this is required, it will be far in excess of and in stark contrast to the sum being sought by the troika.  It recommends a reduction next year of &euro;3.6 billion, yet the Central Bank and the Fiscal Advisory Council are now recommending, on the basis of the information available to them, that we should go further than that.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance indicated yesterday that the statistical unit in his Department would consider all these suggestions and carry out its own analysis and make its determination based on the advice and information available to it.  This shows the disparity in regard to information.  While the European Union and IMF are saying Ireland is doing well and meeting all its targets which warrants a reduction of &euro;3.6 billion next year, the new advisory council is saying we need to go further and should consider a reduction of &euro;4.4 billion and an additional &euro;1 billion each year thereafter until 2015.  Both groups are using the same information but the manner in which they are deciphering it is leading to differences.  We should not go further than a &euro;3.6 billion adjustment next year because the people simply could not handle it.  As the Minister of State is aware, people are struggling, at least in my constituency, and if we go further than what was proposed under the agreement with the troika, we will enter dangerous territory.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is an indication of how the gathering of statistics can be highly beneficial.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, almost 3,000 ghost estates have been found and 179,000 units are lying empty.  This information is of critical importance, as a database now is available of what works must be done and how this can be got on target.  The only thing not available is the money to do it but at least the information is available.  Statistical information is hugely important and the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, has an important responsibility in government in pulling together all that information and making it available to all the different Departments and the Department of Finance, in particular.  I am sure he will use his influence to go with the IMF, rather than the recommendations of the advisory council.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his great contribution at the outset of this debate.  It was most enlightening and Members are delighted to have him here.  I wish him the best of luck in his role as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and as Government Chief Whip and I look forward to seeing him in the Chamber again in the coming years.  I also welcome the opportunity to speak today on the importance of statistics in developing public policy and planning for Ireland&rsquo;s future.  It is clear that policies to deal with problems must be produced which are forward-looking and which tackle causes rather than symptoms.  This provides a clear perspective on the vital role statistics can play in the political process.  Very often, there is disconnection between public policy and the citizens of the State.  People view public policy as merely a product of Government, rather than as an expression of the democratic process.  Moreover, they view it as something that is delivered to them rather than emanating from them.  This issue must be addressed during the present Administration&rsquo;s term in government.</P>
        <P>However, it is undeniable that the proper and efficient use of statistics leads to better policy outcomes and the Government must be mindful of this.  I am a great advocate of the old adage that if one cannot measure it, one cannot manage it and it is imperative to formulate a national strategy for the development of statistics that must be fully integrated into the national policy-making processes.  Policy decisions must be based on careful and rigorous analysis using sound and accurate data to ensure that Government policies are effective, which in turn will improve development outcomes for society as a whole.  Some might ask what makes statistics important in policy-making but their use is the only singular way of making public policy decisions that are fully consistent with the democratic political process.  The two brothers of transparency and accountability are an integral part of this and it constitutes an essential part of good governance.  It ensures that sectional interests and, for want of a better word, cronies, do not control decision-making processes.  It ensures that civil servants are accountable to Ministers and that in turn, Ministers are accountable to the public, whereby the latter can monitor whether a policy has been effective or otherwise.  Members must be mindful that statistics help to identify issues such as poverty, inflation, air pollution, unemployment or the number of graduates in Ireland.  Statistics also help to shape the design and choice of policy.  They help to forecast the <Col N="833"/>future, monitor policy implementation and evaluate policy impact.  If policy cannot be measured, it is not good policy, plain and simple.</P>
        <P>Good statistics provide a basis for good decision-making.  They help governments to identify the best courses of action in addressing complex problems, are essential to manage the effective delivery of basic services and are an indispensable core requirement for accountability and transparency.  Good statistics create an environment for development.  They measure inputs, outputs, outcomes and impact, thereby providing reliable assessments of key economic and social indicators covering all aspects of development from measures of economic output and price inflation to the well-being of individuals.  The litmus test of good statistics is their quality and accessibility and the efficiency with which they are produced.  Good official statistics must have many characteristics.  They are good only to the extent that they meet the needs of users.  Official statistics must be available to a broad range of public and private users and must be trusted to be objective and reliable.  Good statistics must also have the breadth and depth of coverage to meet all policy needs and to inform the public so that people may evaluate the effectiveness of Government actions.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, is the main national statistical service.  All censuses and surveys conducted on a nationwide basis are the responsibility of the CSO and to be fair, it does a great job.  However, to make use of the findings of the CSO, it now is necessary to establish a type of steering committee with a view to determining guidelines, policy and priorities in statistical activities.  Such a strategic approach would help to make available statistics for the formulation of national development policies and to align resources to improve statistical capacity at the point of priority needs.  The Government and society need good statistics.  Proper use of good statistics leads to better policy and development outcomes.  The public wishes to have available facts and figures, as do the bodies that are consulted in respect of new policy initiatives or legislative proposals.  Furthermore, whatever form one&rsquo;s initiatives take, such as, for example, grant schemes or regulations, one must ensure they are systematically reviewed to check that they are achieving their desired outcomes.  The added value of a steering committee would be that it would provide strategic planning and priority setting within the context of new policies.  As the World Bank noted in 2000, statistics:</P>
        <P LI="1">help to identify needs, set goals and monitor progress.  Without good statistics, the development process is blind &mdash; policy-makers cannot learn from their mistakes, and the public cannot hold them accountable.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it chuig an Teach.  To make informed decisions, one must have ongoing information on public policy and the most important tool in gathering such information is statistics.  To have a complete understanding of the issues, be they social, economic, environmental or otherwise, it is essential to have accurate information in order that measures introduced accurately match the people&rsquo;s needs.  It is the people that statistics must serve and not anything else.  They fulfil a vital role in shaping our economic, social and educational policies and otherwise.  The undertaking of census 2011 by the CSO displays our strong commitment to producing factual information relevant to the country.  I cannot speak about statistics without mentioning our great statistician, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, who died in the past year.  He stated that he frightened his wife from flying because he used to bring the Aer Lingus statistics to bed with him as reading material.  Members are aware of how he served this country in the production of statistics.  Recognition of our immigrant population was strengthened this year by the availability of the census form in 22 most-spoken languages in the State.  This ensured inclusiveness and that no one was excluded in gathering those statistics.</P><Col N="834"/>
        <P Just="Left">Many Members spoke of the necessity for accuracy in statistics.  In this context, I will go back to the 1800s and a quote attributed to Mr. Benjamin Disraeli, albeit one not found in his literature thereafter, namely, &ldquo;lies, damned lies and statistics&rdquo;.  In the present day, it is not as easy to assert that lies, damned lies and statistics may be massaged in the manner that was possible long ago.  At that time, people dealt in paper management and did not have linked-up thinking and while more such linked-up thinking is required, the advent of information technology provides greater access to it.  Although I agree with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill that more such thinking is required, it is not as easy to massage the figures as it was long ago.  On foot of the advent of computerisation, it no longer is as easy to request X result from a statistic.</P>
        <P>More than ever, one must turn to statistics and gathering of information to direct Ireland out of its current economic crisis.  Statistics are not new in Ireland and it has been mooted that the prosperity experienced by some in the 1990s was generated from the creative and innovative responses arising from research carried out by the ESRI.  That institution should be mentioned today because of the volume of research it conducts in Ireland.  I acknowledge that some speakers have suggested that had better use been made of that research, we might not be in the fix in which we now find ourselves but that said, statistics are important.  Increasingly, we are faced with complex questions to answer and decisions to make and we need to know exactly what is going on in the economy and in society.</P>
        <P>The current situation is somewhat more challenging in that our loss of sovereignty means we depend a great deal on the European Union.  European statistics are a major factor for Ireland and our statistics play a big part in the European context, especially whether the economy is growing.</P>
        <P>At a conference in Brussels last March, entitled Statistics for Policymaking: Europe 2020, the importance of official statistics was made clear by many of the speakers.  It was stated that Europe&rsquo;s overall response to the crisis will require sound, high quality data and statistical analysis on which sound decisions can be made.</P>
        <P>Statistics are crucial when setting targets and using indicators for monitoring and evaluation purposes.  In particular, statistics are essential in measuring trends in competitiveness and following economic developments, particularly imbalances.  It is most important that statistics are up to date.  I will not go into any more detail on that because many Senators have spoken about the importance of up-to-date statistics.</P>
        <P>A scoreboard of economic indicators, which now could be produced weekly, would inform us about the progress we are making as well as signalling areas that need more attention.  If we had had that in 2009 and 2010, there would have been red flags flying, signalling areas that needed attention.</P>
        <P>Many Senators spoke about the dearth of statistics between North and South.  I bring to the attention of the House that valuable information is being provided under the All-Island Research Observatory, AIRS, and the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis, NIRSA, under the tutorship of NUI Maynooth.  This involves linked statistics with the Ordnance Survey Northern Ireland, OSNI, the All-Island Research Observatory, AIRO, NIRSA and the CSO.  We have mentioned the importance of the CSO, but work is also being done in all those five bodies.  They are starting to link data using co-ordinates on maps and GSO filing.  I thank the Minister of State for the work he has done with those organisations.  We are moving forward but more needs to be done.  With computerisation, we will be able to do much more in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Turning the focus away from the national statistics, I want to bring statistics back to the county level.  I am indebted to the manager of South Dublin County Council, of which I am a former member, who, when he came to the authority, set up the county statistics office, which <Col N="835"/>is doing a valuable job.  As the Minister of State will be aware, it is expensive to keep a county statistics office but with the advent of technology, it is possible to merge it into other departments and that is being done.  That local authority and two or three others have been chosen to be part of a pilot project in conjunction with NISRA to keep valuable statistics on a county-wide basis.  With the breakdown of the constituencies and the work that is being done, it is hoped it will be possible in the next couple of months to bring the level to that of 50 or more households where one will get accurate information on those, perhaps on medical cards and social order.</P>
        <P>I will finish by addressing the approach to IT in the Department and gathering statistics.  I read an article recently by Mr. David McWilliams in which he stated that many indigenous companies were debarred from tendering for IT or business with the Government owing to legislation.  There are many small indigenous IT companies that could help the Government if the tenders were broken down into small elements, which is what we need the statistics on.  If tenders were broken down into smaller components, we would not have to wait forever or it would not cost what the Garda system or medical systems cost to put into action.</P>
        <P>There can be no denying that statistics are our signpost for recovery.  It is only when one understands a problem fully that one can solve it effectively.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach to the Seanad today and thank him for coming to speak to us on the matter of the importance of statistics in developing public policy and planning for the future.  Statistics are used in every part of life.  Most people associate statistics with watching a match on television and what comes up at the end of the match, for example, how long a team was in possession, how many wides they hit, how many points were scored and red cards.  The Minister of State is used to seeing such statistics when Kilkenny play Wexford in hurling.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The title of the debate is indicative of the professional approach that underpins the policy formulation of the new Government.  As the Minister of State said, &ldquo;joined-up government needs joined-up data.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I agree with the previous speakers who all stated that statistics must be used in delivering Government policy.  Too often in the past decade, decisions were made based on back-of-an-envelope planning to facilitate jobs for the boys or for political gain.  We are paying the price now for that approach or attitude to public policy and planning, most notably with the serious problems with the oversupply of housing in many counties and the spectre of so-called ghost estates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Statistics are one vital aspect of public policy formulation.  I commend the Central Statistics Office for its invaluable work in providing statistical information on a range of matters of public importance.  The work of the CSO is a vital aid to legislators such as ourselves.  Politicians are fond of referring to anecdotal evidence, meaning the feedback we get from people on the ground, and it is always helpful when the CSO comes up with a finding that confirms that anecdotal evidence and gives it greater legitimacy.</P>
        <P>As the Fine Gael spokesperson on transport, I am particularly interested in the role of statistics in formulating transport policy.  Recently, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, came to the Upper House to debate the Road Traffic (No. 2) Bill.  In his Second Stage speech, the Minister referred to a number of statistics and translated the <Col N="836"/>impact of legislative change in the road safety area in a statistical analysis.  For example, he told us that in 1972 there were 640 deaths on Irish roads equating to more than 50 deaths per month.  He then referred to a number of significant pieces of legislation in the area of road safety, particularly in the area of drink driving and penalty points, and noted that in the period coinciding with the raft of road safety legislation, 2001 to 2010, the number of fatalities on Irish roads fell by 48%.  However, the statistics used by the Minister only present part of the story and the statistics alone are not enough.  They need to be supplemented.  For example, a large range of factors are likely to have contributed to the fall in road deaths, including safer cars, better roads, changes to the driving test, etc., and it is always important to use statistics in conjunction with other research when formulating public policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Nonetheless, in some cases the figures can speak for themselves.  The number of persons using a particular train at a particular time, for example, makes clear the need to increase or reduce the service.  The number of accidents at a particular accident blackspot makes clear the need to improve the safety of the road at that location.  The Minister is facing into many difficult decisions in the budget and I am sure that statistical information can help identify priority areas but, equally, I hope the statistics will not be the only factor at play.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Neill for giving me the opportunity to say a few words.  I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well in his job.  I hope he is not too busy as Government Chief Whip as that would be a bad political sign for us, but I hope he is busy in these less politically dramatic parts of his portfolio.</P>
        <P>It is an interesting discussion on the CSO and statistics in general.  Obviously, I agree with virtually everything said but there are a few brief points I want to present.</P>
        <P>While the Minister of State and his colleagues in the CSO, with their base of statistics, can be of considerable help to his Government colleagues, it will be up to each of them across their Departments to lead the policy.  Statistics are necessary and they are fine, but we cannot be led entirely from a statistical base.  Whether it is housing, education or transport planning, a certain degree of political decision making must occur and we should then use the statistics to assist the implementation of those decisions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the fiasco of the housing market which we have endured in the past decade, one can argue that if the people had observed the statistics, we would not have ended up with the current housing crisis, but it is equally fair to say that neither a Minister with responsibility for housing nor the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government ever took the political decision to build up the small villages, preserve the rural towns, and allow or not allow rural planning.  These types of political decisions need to be made by the various Ministers and we can use the statistical base to push them through.  As the Minister of State will be aware, we are commencing an important national debate on the future of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We can either decide to consider the issues arising purely from a statistical basis and decide there will always be X number of big farmers and Y number of small farmers or take the political decision that we want to maintain rural Ireland and the maximum number of farming families.  A combination of political decisions and statistics must be applied to turn the economy around.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution indicates that joined up thinking is now being practised.  I commend all involved in this, whether the head of the CSO or the person who recorded the census.  All are playing a key role in giving us a base of information.  It is up to us to use this information politically by making decisions across Departments for the good of society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for the positive contributions they made to this debate.  This discussion reveals the high level of interest in this House and in society in general in official statistics and the CSO.  For good <Col N="837"/>reason, people are more aware than ever of statistical facts and figures.  The CSO publishes a vast amount of information on economic and social issues that affect each and every one of us.  At a time of great change and difficult decisions, this statistical information is needed more than ever.  We can plan for a better future and progress in building our economic well-being with this information.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s programme for public service reform and its emphasis on greater accountability will make greater use of statistics to inform policy.  The statistical system needs to be responsive to policy makers while also maintaining its independent voice.  I am impressed by the CSO&rsquo;s professional approach and its ability to provide an independent and impartial service.  The census of population is one of our most important information sources for planning.  The preliminary headcount figures have already been published and detailed reports will issue in March 2012.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney spoke about staffing problems in the CSO.  Like every Government agency, the CSO is committed to making structural changes, including in the area of staffing.  I assure the Senator, however, that the professional work it has carried out since its foundation continues.  More is being done with less at all levels of government.</P>
        <P>Several Senators spoke about the importance of collecting data for the tourism sector.  I have spoken with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ring, and their officials on this issue.  The CSO makes available a considerable range of information they can use to improve tourism.  The CSO board encourages Ministers to find out what types of information are available and some have already met the board.  This useful information can be brought to the Cabinet and used to develop policy by various Departments.</P>
        <P>As Senators will be aware, there is a strong relationship among North-South bodies and Departments and meetings are held regularly between Ministers from the North and the South.  Like other Government agencies, the CSO has a close working relationship with its Northern counterpart and the two agencies are planning to publish a special census 2011 report on Ireland North and South in late 2012 or some time in 2013.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Reference was made to the various ways that census data can be used.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill spoke about the housing market, which is a welcome addition to the CSO&rsquo;s research functions.  We have come through turbulent economic times over the past several years but the CSO has reacted by producing research that will be useful to the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  It also collects a significant amount of data on businesses and industry, particularly in respect of small and medium-sized enterprises.  If we are to address our current economic problems, small and medium enterprises-sized will be vital to our recovery.  I have encouraged the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Perry, to find out from the CSO what information it can supply.</P>
        <P>I have learned a great deal from today&rsquo;s debate.  The CSO continues to face significant challenges but I have no doubt it will continue its great work over the next several years.  The census 2011 figures will be released early next year.  Many people are afraid to fill out the census form because they thought it might be used against them.  Last night, I received a telephone call from an individual who blamed the CSO for a social welfare payment being stopped.  I assure the House that the CSO is completely independent and the information collected in the census is absolutely confidential.  I stand over that as Minister of State with responsibility for the CSO.  Its staff, from chairman down, work in a professional manner and treat all information received with confidentiality.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and appreciate the input of Deirdre Cullen, the CSO official who accompanied me to this debate.  This was my first opportunity to address the <Col N="838"/>Seanad but I hope I will have further opportunities to discuss matters with Senators.  As Government Chief Whip I was accused this morning of preventing legislation from coming before the Seanad.  I was surprised at this because the last Seanad was adjourned on numerous occasions.</P>
        <P>I assure Senators that the Leader of the House, Senator Cummins, is putting me under extreme pressure to have business come into the Seanad which has a very important role to play.  I have a very good working relationship with Senator Cummins and if anyone on the other side of the House has any problems with the way the Government Whip&rsquo;s office works I can sit down with him or her and go through how legislation works and how it is introduced into the Seanad.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My motion relates to funding that was approved for the autism unit in Finn Valley College, Stranorlar, County Donegal, which has more than 300 students.  Funding was approved for the old building of the former school before the new building was built.  That building has recently been completed and the students moved in in September.  The previous Minister approved funding for an autism unit within the former school.  The board of management and County Donegal VEC assumed that funding would be transferred to the new school to provide the much-needed autistic services for the students who depend on such services.  I do not understand why the funding of &euro;150,000 has been withdrawn given that there is no autism unit in the new building.  I ask the Minister of State to outline whether the funding can be reinstated.  I hope he will have good news that the funding originally approved and then withdrawn can now be reinstated or at least that the Department might enter into consultations with the school&rsquo;s board of management to find a way of having the funding reallocated to the school.</P>
        <P>I have a separate issue relating to the same school, Finn Valley College.  The Minister of State recently answered a parliamentary question on an application from County Donegal VEC for approximately &euro;10,000 for the shuttle bus service to the school.  The new school was built 600 m from the old building and yet the school transport drop-off and pick-up point was factored in as being at the old school rather than the new school.  The pupils are now walking to and from the new school.  During the first week seven or eight students walked to the school in the rain but had to go home because their clothes were so wet.  Although the Minister of State has given a reply to a parliamentary question submitted by a colleague of mine in the past 24 hours saying no funding would be available even though the VEC made an appeal, it is a once-off grant of &euro;10,000 and I appeal to him to revisit the decision.</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to outline to the House my Department&rsquo;s position on the allocation of funding for an ASD classroom at Finn Valley College, County Donegal.</P>
        <P>In February 2008, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, advised my Department that it had sanctioned a special class for pupils with autistic spectrum disorder from September 2008 at Finn Valley College.  In June 2008 County Donegal VEC submitted a formal application for funding to provide the additional accommodation.  The application was assessed and in July 2008 final approval was granted and funding of &euro;150,000 was sanctioned on a devolved basis to County Donegal VEC to provide the special class at Finn Valley College.</P>
        <P>In January 2009, County Donegal VEC wrote to officials in the planning and building unit of my Department requesting an extension of time to draw down the approved funding, stating that the procurement process for the installation of the ASD unit was in train.  My Department approved the extension in time and advised the VEC that once the works commenced on site a 70% instalment of the grant would be paid on receipt of documentation as set out in my Department&rsquo;s letter of approval.  My Department subsequently received no request from County Donegal VEC for drawdown of payment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In June 2010, construction commenced on a new 3,452 sq. m school for Finn Valley College to cater for 325 pupils and was ready for occupation in September 2011.  The new school was designed and planning permission had been granted prior to the approval of the ASD unit.  In November 2010, a request was received by my Department from County Donegal VEC to include an ASD unit in the new school building.  Following a technical assessment, it was agreed that it would not be feasible to add the unit to the project at that time, as it had reached such an advanced stage.  The VEC was advised at that time to submit an application for funding for an ASD unit at the new school and to date no application has been received from County Donegal VEC.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand, however, that officials in the planning and building unit have recently been in touch with County Donegal VEC on this matter and that an application for funding for an ASD unit at Finn Valley College will be submitted shortly by County Donegal VEC.  I again thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>
        <P>On the school transport matter, if the Senator makes direct contact with my office I will undertake to examine that case again.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending.  I am glad to have the opportunity to highlight the need for the Department of Education and Skills to maintain 2012 funding for Laneview Learning Centre Dublin 17 at the current level.  As the Minister of State will be aware, Laneview is an educational centre in Belcamp, Dublin 17.  It takes referrals from the local HSE methadone clinic located next door.  Its director, Pat Hanna, and his team have put together a very comprehensive education and personal development programme of 22 hours a week.  This involves a wide range of elements, including basic literacy classes and computer classes, both of which are supported by the VEC which supplies tutors.  The clients also participate in horticulture training and spend one day a week working in a greenhouse in Rush where they get an opportunity to learn new skills.  They also do art and drama classes in the centre.</P>
        <P>The availability of a supportive environment with group and individual counselling is an essential element in enabling clients to avail of the education programmes on offer in Laneview.  For many of its clients, Laneview is the first involvement they have had in any form with education since their early teenage years.  Its director informed me that a large number of the <Col N="840"/>participants started using serious drugs at the age of 12 so for many of them it is their first opportunity to avail of real education since they were very young.  The objective of the programme offered in the centre is to help clients to rebuild their lives and reduce their reliance on methadone.  All clients must sign a contract when they are referred from the methadone clinic to Laneview committing to cut down on the amount of methadone they are taking.  The objective is to wean them off reliance on methadone and to improve their home environment.  The Laneview centre works as closely as possible with families to involve spouses and other family members to ensure when the person goes home, he or she has as supportive an environment as possible.  The ultimate objective of the programme is to enable clients to take up education and work opportunities.  Previous clients have gone on to sit the junior certificate, which is a huge achievement for them.  They have also participated in vocational training courses for careers such as hairdressing and other such areas.  There is no doubt that without the supportive environment offered by the Laneview centre, including the counselling elements I mentioned, the people involved could not have done this.  Most clients would never have signed up for a standard education programme nor would a standard environment be suitable for them given their dependence on methadone and their need for supportive services as well as educational ones.  The Laneview centre provides them with educational opportunities which are simply not available anywhere else.</P>
        <P>The ongoing partnership between the centre and the HSE is also crucial.  The clients sign the contract before coming to the Laneview centre.  Regular reviews take place and staff from the centre along with HSE staff every week check people are fulfilling the commitments they made and are making progress.  They also keep an eye on them all the time so people do not end up dropping out.</P>
        <P>I raise this issue because the centre already suffered a major cut in funding of 30% in 2009.  It has pared back its costs as much as possible and adapted and protected its services inasmuch as it can, but it has heard its funding is in line for another severe cut next year.  I urge the Minister of State not to let this happen and to intervene with his colleague the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Further cuts would have huge social costs for the individuals themselves and for their families and communities.  It would also cost the State much more in the long run in economic terms.  Laneview has worked with former prisoners who, with the support of the centre, have stayed out of trouble and avoided reoffending.  The Minister of State is well aware of the high cost of prison places.  If cuts lead to the centre having to reduce its programmes next year or, the worst possible outcome, to close, and one more person ends up in prison as a result, the overall financial cost to the State in the long term would be far greater than funding the centre.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue and I urge the Minister of State to do everything he can with his colleague, the Minister, and other members of the Government to protect this vital service from cuts next year.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and thank the Senator for raising it.</P>
        <P>The Department contributes to the overall aim of Government policy on drugs and the national drugs strategy, which is to provide an effective integrated response to the problems posed by drug misuse.  Part of the Department&rsquo;s contribution to the national drugs strategy is to provide funding for a number of projects in local drugs task force areas.</P>
        <P>Laneview Learning Centre, also known as the rehabilitation and support programme, RASP, was established in 1998 with the aim of addressing drug problems in the Coolock area of <Col N="841"/>Dublin.  In 2005, following a review of its operation, the board of RASP changed the name of its building to Laneview Learning Centre.</P>
        <P>Laneview Learning Centre provides a community-based drug rehabilitation project for adults who are in recovery from addiction.  Through the provision of a community employment scheme it provides a number of placements for adults from the Dublin 17 area who are on a treatment programme with the adjacent Beldale Clinic, operated by the HSE.  The project provides a programme which has both an educational content and a rehabilitation emphasis.</P>
        <P>This year, for the educational component of the programme, the Department has allocated &euro;138,847 towards the RASP project at Laneview Learning Centre.  This is the same as the 2010 allocation for the project.  This funding primarily goes towards the cost of one staff salary, the cost of leasing premises and other programme costs.</P>
        <P>Senator Power will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is undertaking a comprehensive expenditure review across all areas of Government spending.  This process will inform budgetary decisions and the Senator will appreciate that I am not in a position at present to state what funding allocation will be made available by the Department to the Laneview Learning Centre in 2012.  A decision regarding the provision of an allocation to Laneview Learning Centre for 2012 will be taken by the Department in the context of the overall budgetary process for 2012.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department acknowledges that the RASP project at Laneview Learning Centre provides a significant service for stabilised recovering adult drug users.  The project provides a programme which has both learning content and, equally, a strong rehabilitation emphasis. The Department will inform the project of decisions on its future funding as early as possible.</P>
        <P>In addition to the funding provided for the Laneview Learning Centre and five other projects in local drugs task force areas, the Department makes a significant contribution in support of the prevention pillar of the national drugs strategy through the mandatory social, personal and health education curriculum at primary level and at junior cycle at second level; through the initiatives under the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, action plan to prevent early school leaving and achieve better educational outcomes for students, given that early school leaving is a major indicator for those engaging in substance misuse; and through the guidelines on substance use policies issued to all schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department remains committed, within the resources available to it, to provide support for the national drugs strategy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Michael Mullins.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</P>
        <P>This is a straightforward case of asking the Minister for Health to outline why the relocation of a nursing home in order to meet HIQA standards should be classified as a start-up case or a new build and not as a current operation.  The nursing home has been in operation since October 2002 and must move because of HIQA requirements because the building it is in is under a preservation order.  Just because it is moving premises, the Department of Health wants to classify it as a new build.  This is blatantly unfair and I am bringing the case to the attention of the Minister of State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The nursing home is Pointe Boise in Salthill, which is located in a small streetfront site with a preservation order on the building limiting any development.  In 2002, when it commenced operation, it was described in the local press as state-of-the-art, but by 2005 it had become apparent that as standards and expectations improved, it did not have the resources to upgrade the fixtures, fittings and facilities because the 24 bed home was only breaking even.</P><Col N="842"/>
        <P>In 2007, the draft national standards were published and the nursing home first became aware of medium-term difficulties with the building.  In June 2009, the national quality standards were introduced which require all homes to provide a range of facilities by June 2015, including a treatment room, a quiet space, a private meeting room, communal toilets, additional wheelchair toilets for visitors, an assisted toilet per floor and a number of other physical facilities.  These are not available in the nursing home and cannot be because of the tightness of space and a preservation order.  Some rooms may be unsuitable and contrary to the regulations owing to the loss of usable floor space from sloping ceilings and steps into rooms.</P>
        <P>The environmental health officer also requires building works to be completed to include separate catering facilities, staff changing facilities and fitting mechanical ventilation.  An important point is that on 8 March 2011, the fire officer, having inspected the building, presented a comprehensive action plan for completion which, among other actions, involves sizeable building works.  The entire situation makes the future of this nursing home in the building unviable.  However, the future of the nursing home as a running operation for patients and families is viable.</P>
        <P>The building occupied by the nursing home is on a lease which expires in nine months time.  The lease includes an option to vacate, renew or purchase.  The sensible option for the business is to relocate.  Since 2007 it has been exploring opportunities to provide better care facilities in line with the new standards, and this has resulted in the building of a new home on the grounds of St. Mary&rsquo;s college, which is a large secondary school.  This would provide a nursing home for some of the priests.  Since 27 August, it has been registered with the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, as a nursing home specifically designed to comply with new regulations and at a scale of economy to be viable at the average Galway city fair deal rates.  Those involved are pleased with the HIQA report.</P>
        <P>The HIQA registration process included a two-day inspection on 12 and 13 July.  The report states that the inspection covered both nursing homes &mdash; the current Pointe Boise and the new location on the grounds of St. Mary&rsquo;s &mdash; because all of the residents and staff will relocate to the new home.  In their reports, the fire officer and environmental officer noted that the old nursing home needed substantial work.</P>
        <P>The home was scheduled to open its new nursing home on the grounds of St. Mary&rsquo;s college on Saturday, 24 September.  It is unique, in that a nursing home relocating premises to comply with legislation and care standards has not occurred previously.  The building was completed in June, the home was registered by HIQA on 27 August and 24 September was selected as the opening date, as it would best suit residents and their families in moving.  However, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, negotiates the fair deal cost-of-care rates with individual nursing homes on behalf of the Minister for Health.  On previously presenting the situation to Mr. Joe Carroll of the NPTF, the fund signalled that the home could be considered as a current operation.  However, the home engaged with Ms Fiona Walsh for all of last week.  At a meeting last Friday, she refused to agree to continue the current fair deal cost-of-care rates.</P>
        <P>This is a problem.  The home is unable to move and has no idea as to whether it will ever be able to do so.  The collateral damage is significant.  The home would have created 33 new jobs as a result of the move and has already recruited the first group, with induction training and human resources work completed.  The home has the unwelcome task this week of informing those people that there are no jobs available.</P>
        <P>Some 31 extra beds will be available in the new premises, with ten admission assessments already completed and a further 15 older people scheduled to be so assessed.  Many of the latter are in Galway hospitals or the Galway Hospice.  The home must inform them that it can no longer provide care.  Unless the new home gets the NTPF&rsquo;s subvention of the current operation, it cannot afford to make the move.  The irony is that the home could have solved the <Col N="843"/>problem with the University College Hospital, Galway, UCHG, accident and emergency unit and saved the Department of Health a considerable sum had the right decision been taken by the NTPF on Friday.  Some 36 people occupying a ward in UCHG are awaiting fair deal funding.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State decide to have the operation classified as a current operation rather than a new build or a start-up, which it clearly is not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and support Senator Healy Eames&rsquo;s case.  Additional jobs would be created and extra beds would help the awful accident and emergency unit situation we are reading and hearing about in the national media every day as well as the lack of available beds in UCHG.  The home will not be viable unless it can get the rates it expected as an existing business.  The situation is cut and dry.  The home informs me that it cannot afford to open unless it gets that rate.  If it does not open we will lose jobs and fail to free up beds in UCHG.  It would be a shame to see a fine facility lying idle when the community needs it.  Will the Minister of State discuss the issue with the NTPF to resolve it?  As the home has been operating for the past ten years, it seems strange that it cannot be classified as an existing business to give it a competitive edge and enable it to open the new facility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible or, where not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  The facility referred to by the Senators is a new, purpose-built private nursing home.  It will replace another 28-bed private nursing home in the vicinity.  It will also provide additional capacity in the area.</P>
        <P>The provider of the nursing home being replaced has notified the chief inspector of the plans to conduct an orderly wind down of operations.  All of its residents have chosen to transfer to the new nursing home.  The new home will accommodate 60 residents and incorporate an integrated day-care service with places for a maximum of 12 residents daily from the local community.  The new nursing home was registered by HIQA on 27 August.</P>
        <P>To be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the nursing homes support scheme, a private nursing home must be registered as a designated centre with HIQA under the Health Act 2007, have agreed a price for long-term residential care for the purposes of the scheme with the NTPF and hold a valid tax clearance certificate.  The agreed price criterion is necessary because of the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person&rsquo;s contribution.</P>
        <P>The NTPF has statutory responsibility for the negotiation of prices with private nursing homes.  It is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, must ensure value for money for the individual and the State.  It negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.  This method of negotiation is necessary to ensure that the State obtains the best value for each individual in a nursing home and to comply with competition law.  I understand that negotiations between the nursing home referred to by the Senators and the NTPF are ongoing.</P>
        <P>That the business plan was based on the old rate is understandable.  People could find themselves in some difficulty because they did not get the rate they assumed they would.  It is a good facility that will meet standards and increase capacity.  I will take the Senators&rsquo; concerns to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.  Were I running Pointe Boise Nursing Home in Salthill and I moved my operation to Pointe Boise on St. Mary&rsquo;s grounds, I would have a legal case to ask to be classified as an ongoing operation as opposed to a start-up or new build.  The Minister of State has acknowledged that what the home is prepared to provide is necessary.  It seems like an open and shut case.  Will the Minister of State bring the matter to the Minister of Health&rsquo;s attention?  Can he intervene with the NTPF or is it independent?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The NTPF is independent in its negotiations.  The situation poses difficulties.  As I outlined, the winding down of one operation and the starting of another would be a clear separation, although I am not saying that this is justification.  I do not dispute the Senator&rsquo;s assertion, but there must be other instances of the like around the country.  We do not want to set a precedent by entering into a special arrangement with one provider, as all other providers would expect the same treatment.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>No.  While I am not certain this is the first instance around the country, let us assume it is.  However, it will not be the last.  I am not opposed to setting precedents, as I believe things are only done when precedents are set.  However, we need to be careful.  The fair deal scheme is an expensive one, rightly so, as it seeks to provide care for vulnerable older people and because we expect the best.  Negotiations are ongoing.  I will bring the Senator&rsquo;s concerns to the attention of the Minister, although I am not certain there is much he can do.  Through negotiation a resolution can be achieved.</P>

    <sTitle>Cystic Fibrosis Services</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  I wish to raise with her the provision of adult cystic fibrosis in-care beds at Cork University Hospital.  She will be aware that in Ireland one in 19 people carries the cystic fibrosis gene.  When two parents carrying the gene have a child, there is a one in four chance that it will be born with cystic fibrosis.  While we are unique in that we have a higher incidence of cystic fibrosis than any other country in the western world and our record in this regard is shameful.  The statistics indicate that average life expectancy for CF patients in the Republic is 16 years, whereas in the North it is 26 years and in Canada, 36.  The level of care one receives often determines one&rsquo;s life expectancy.  An organ donor transplant system is being put in place.  While our organ donation record is good, it could be better.</P>
        <P>On the provision of 11 beds in a ward currently vacant at Cork University Hospital, the Build4Life organisation has raised almost &euro;2 million to fit it out.  This is an entirely voluntary organisation &mdash; it has no paid staff.  Mr. Joe Browne from Castleisland who has been pioneering this effort for many years received an allocation of funding through the previous Minister for Health and Children from the national lottery.  However, to start and complete this project a further &euro;300,000 is required from the Government through the national lottery.  When PRSI, all taxes and so on have been paid from the total sum of &euro;2.3 million, the organisation will have returned &euro;450,000 to the Exchequer.  As such, an allocation of &euro;300,000 from the Government, on top of the &euro;2 million already raised by the Build4Life organisation, would result in a <Col N="845"/>return of &euro;450,000 to the taxpayer.  However, all the indications thus far from the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, are that the Government cannot make any funding available.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While in a time of austerity one might say we cannot afford &euro;300,000, when one considers there would be a return to the taxpayer of &euro;450,000 following the spending of  &euro;2.3 million, it would make sense.  Added to this is the moral argument that as a result of the provision of isolated beds people with cystic fibrosis would receive the care they deserve, resulting in a better quality of life and an altering of the shameful statistic of average life expectancy of 16 years.  I, therefore, look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
        <P>I note that when in opposition the Minister made a number of pledges as to what he would do in this regard.  Unfortunately, while he was available for meetings when in opposition, he is now unable to sit down with Dr. Plant, the cystic fibrosis specialist.  Dr. Plant gained vast experience in Seattle and despite bringing that expertise to Ireland, he is not being given the resources he needs to ensure those with a low average life expectancy in Ireland, unlike others in the Six Counties, will have a good quality of life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, and thank the Senator for raising it.  I am glad to have an opportunity to outline the current position and speak about the scandalous neglect in this area in the past ten years, particularly at a time when we had more money than we knew what to do with it.  The then Government could have resolved this issue, but it chose not to do so, which is a scandal we also need to address.  The neglect of persons with cystic fibrosis is scandalous.</P>
        <P>The Government firmly believes the needs of cystic fibrosis patients must be recognised and respected.  The Minister for Health has stated his Department&rsquo;s policy that there must be sufficient inpatient beds to treat all people with cystic fibrosis who require hospitalisation.  I am happy to say construction of the new 100 bed unit at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital is well under way and due to be completed next year.  The new building which will have single en suite rooms and isolation rooms will play a vital role in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis and a range of other conditions.  Cork University Hospital has the second largest adult cystic fibrosis centre in Ireland.  That centre caters for the needs of 145 attending adult patients from the Munster region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In September 2007 Dr. Barry Plant was appointed as director of the adult cystic fibrosis programme at Cork University Hospital.  Since his appointment, he has worked closely with various HSE services, philanthropic organisations such as Build4Life and the CFAI and scientific research agencies in advancing the needs of these patients.  In June 2008, in consultation with the cystic fibrosis multidisciplinary team and the cystic fibrosis community locally, he submitted a statement of need for cystic fibrosis services to the executive management board of Cork University Hospital.  This document which was approved by the board outlined a strategic plan to develop cystic fibrosis services in the hospital, including the provision of day and inpatient facilities.</P>
        <P>The cystic fibrosis day centre caters for most clinical needs of cystic fibrosis patients.  It includes five isolation rooms, a dedicated cystic fibrosis gym, a multidisciplinary team room and consultant rooms.  The day centre was opened in May this year.  The capital costs for this development were provided for through a partnership approach between HSE South and the Build4Life organisation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Dr. Plant is working with the executive management board of Cork University Hospital to develop a designated inpatient unit, with en suite rooms for cystic fibrosis patients.  A location has been identified for a combined designated adult inpatient facility and respiratory unit in a vacated ward on the Cork University Hospital campus.  Provisional plans and costings have <Col N="846"/>been made, with an estimated build cost of approximately &euro;3 million.  The hospital is working in partnership with Build4Life to co-fund this development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To date, Build4Life has raised more than &euro;2 million to support cystic fibrosis capital developments at Cork University Hospital.  HSE South is examining ways to secure additional capital funding to complete the unit in the context of decreasing capital budget allocations in the current stringent climate.  The need to develop the adult inpatient facility remains a board and HSE South priority and the HSE will continue to work with Build4Life to complete the project.</P>
        <P>The Minister recently met the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and is keenly aware of the needs of people living with cystic fibrosis.  The Minister is available to meet the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Build4Life organisation has sought a meeting with the Minister who, to date, has refused to meet it.  As I pointed out, if the Minister allocated &euro;300,000 from national lottery funding, as his predecessor did, the spend of &euro;2.3 million would result in a tax return of &euro;450,000.  There is no timeline for the provision of this service.  The final line of the Minister&rsquo;s reply reads, &ldquo;The Minister . . . is keenly aware of the needs of people living with cystic fibrosis.&rdquo;  People with cystic fibrosis die.  They do not live with it.  The Minister spent a long time in opposition and although I do not mean to beat him over the head about what he promised while in opposition, it would make financial sense for the Government to allocate &euro;300,000 for the project because it will get &euro;450,000 back.  The Minister of State is taking the matter on behalf of the Minister but as he has not given any timeline for his Department or the HSE to put this project in place, it does not augur well for those living with cystic fibrosis.  While we wait for him to make this a reality and allocate funding, people with cystic fibrosis will die.</P>
        <P>The funding has been raised by voluntary organisations and only &euro;300,000 is required from the Government.  The Government would get that money back with &euro;150,000 on top so anybody looking at that would think this makes much sense and the project should go ahead immediately.  Nevertheless, the Minister is indicating that these people must continue to live with cystic fibrosis and people may die while they wait.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no disagreement about whether the unit is required.  The Senator&rsquo;s language is not the type that should be used.  I know people with cystic fibrosis and they have enough difficulty in their lives without listening to that sort of negative comment.  There is no disagreement about the unit, which must be built, along with the isolation rooms.  We all know what needs to happen.  There is no timeline in the reply but it will be done in the shortest possible time.  It will not take the ten years it was left to linger by the previous Government.  It will come about much sooner and I agree entirely with the Senator that the quicker we get this done, the better the outcomes and greater the result.  There is no disagreement in that respect either.</P>
        <P>Dr. Barry Plant is an incredible physician in treating cystic fibrosis and his patients consider him a friend.  He has a relationship with them that is quite unique because his understanding of their condition is unique.  We know what needs to happen and the issue is being worked on.  We hope to bring a resolution in the shortest possible time.  We are currently in negotiations on sorting out the budget for the next three years because of the mess in which the country has been left.  As part of that process we cannot allow projects like this to slide down the drain despite that mess.  The process must be completed but the question is how we get the money to do it.  I agree entirely with the Senator that any delay is unacceptable but unfortunately there will be a slight delay.</P>
