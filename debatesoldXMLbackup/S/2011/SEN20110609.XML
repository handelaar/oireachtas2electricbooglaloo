	<P>I have received notice from Senator Terry Leyden that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to make a statement on the Government&rsquo;s response to the Irish Human Rights Commission recommendation and the statement by the United Nations Committee against Torture on the matters advanced by Justice for Magdalenes.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Thomas Byrne of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to discuss his plans for Navan hospital and the need to engage with the local community in County Meath.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to clarify the Government&rsquo;s intention on the future of two-teacher schools and their importance in maintaining a vibrant rural community.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, a procedural motion to extend the number of matters that can be taken on the Adjournment to four, to be taken without debate.  That was a recommendation from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  We will have four Adjournment motions each day rather than three, with four minutes each for the proposer of the motion and the Minister in reply.  That is an improvement that will be welcomed by everyone. No. 12, motion No. 1, is an all-party motion initiated by Senator John Crown regarding the detention by the Bahraini authorities of health care professionals, which will be taken without debate. No. 2, statements on the 20 year strategy for the Irish language, will be taken after the Order of Business and conclude at 2 p.m., with the contribution of each spokesperson not to exceed ten minutes and that of every other Senator not to exceed eight minutes, and the Minister to be called upon to conclude no later than 1.50 p.m. No. 3, Biological Wea<Col N="282"/>pons Bill 2010 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, will be taken at 2 p.m.  We agreed yesterday that we would take the Bill as there are just two procedural amendments from the Government to be tabled on Committee Stage and we should conclude it in a short time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the change to the number of Adjournment debates proposed to the House today by the Leader.  It is important that there would be four Adjournment matters allowed every day as it would allow more Senators to raise issues that are of concern.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the agreed motion on Bahrain, it is a well worded motion that has been agreed by the House today.  I thank Senator Crown for his work in that regard.  If it is possible, will the Leader seek an update from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on his dealings with the Bahraini authorities in that regard?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Earlier in the week this House condemned a brutal murder in Donabate in north County Dublin.  It saddens me to hear of another murder in Clondalkin last night.  That is two murders in one week in the city of Dublin.  We all realise this is something that cannot be stamped out immediately but I am sure the Government and the Garda authorities are doing everything they can in this regard.  The murder of two fathers, who have been taken from their families prematurely, shows the absolute disregard for the value of human life.  I roundly condemn these brutal killings and I wish the Garda well in its investigations.   On my own behalf and that of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I extend deepest sympathy to the two families.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It has come to our attention that under the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2011 the universal social charge is included as a deduction when a means test is being done for a family income supplement.  In other areas and for other allowances related to social welfare, the Bill, as published, does not permit the deduction of the universal social charge for the purpose of a means tests.  The Minister for Social Protection,  was extremely vocal as a Deputy when the universal social charge was introduced and prior to the election promised to have it reversed.  That has not been done, which is fair enough; that is life.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the amendments tabled by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in the Lower House on making the universal social charge deductible for the purpose of means tests for all social welfare allowances is accepted by the Government.  Are there plans for the Minister for Social Protection to come before the Seanad in the coming weeks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Social Protection will be in the House in two weeks time to discuss a major Bill.  I join Senator O&rsquo;Brien in expressing sympathy to the family of the man shot dead in Clondalkin.  It is sad to see in one week two such murders being committed in Dublin.</P>
        <P>I welcome very much the all party motion, initiated by Senator John Crown, on Bahrain.  It is most appropriate that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade comes to the Seanad at some stage, perhaps before the end of the session to discuss what can be done from an Irish perspective about the situation in Bahrain.  All Members are deeply concerned about the treatment of the doctors who are being prosecuted because they assisted in giving medical treatment to people.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the reports of the abuse in a south Dublin nursing home and the wider questions those reports raise.  <i>The Irish Times</i> today carries a report from HIQA that residents of a south Dublin nursing home were subjected to abuse.  There are wider issues, not only about treatment of the elderly in nursing homes, which is itself very serious but also about the treatment of whistleblowers.  One of the commitments in the programme for <Col N="283"/>Government was to introduce a Bill protecting whistleblowers and this report shows the necessity for that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">May I respond to a comment made by Senator Mullen yesterday?  I would not normally respond to personal comments but he asked for a response on something I was reported in the newspapers as having said on male genital mutilation during the World Atheists Convention last weekend.  Perhaps not surprisingly, Senator Mullen, was not present. My paper was on another topic but I mentioned the Bill on female genital mutilation and somebody in the audience asked me what I thought about male genital mutilation, his words.  I said I thought it was of a different scale and of a different order entirely to female genital mutilation but personally I do not believe that the cutting of a child's genitals for anything other than medical reasons is ever justified.  I stand over that and I have had a good deal of support from individual members of the public on that stance.  As a person who can barely bear to watch my children being vaccinated for very good reasons&mdash;</P>

	<P>Is the Senator looking for a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not, I am simply giving an answer.  I look forward to Senator Mullen&rsquo;s support for any other measures that might be taken to ensure that we do not subscribe to views that are offensive to members of any other religion.  For example, the fact that we have a Christian prayer at the start of business in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il could be seen as problematic for Members of other religions or for Members of no religion and that is something we might well seek to debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy Leader can propose a constitutional amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>That would not take a constitutional amendment, but I would certainly agree with a constitutional amendment on the offence of blasphemy, which is another matter that we have debated at length in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinMcAleese"><NameTxt>Senator Martin McAleese</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A Chathaoirligh, it is a privilege to contribute to the work of this Chamber and I thank the Taoiseach for the opportunity to allow me to do so.  I thank the Seanad staff for their assistance to newcomers like me in recent weeks.  I offer my best wishes to all Members of the Seanad and hope this Chamber&rsquo;s connection with the people and its contribution to their welfare will be enhanced by what is said and what is done in the name of this Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am sure that nobody would wish this Seanad to endlessly debate its own future.  It would be wiser, would it not, to let the people debate the future of the Seanad and let the Seanad debate the future of the people, the future of our country?</P>
        <P Just="Left">For as long as this Seanad endures it has the potential to be much more than an enclosed space where Senators talk to each other, but rather an open space where we draw into official public discourse those who in these times of trial are sustaining family and community life, progressing our civic society, generating business and commerce, evolving our intellectual and cultural life and instituting the fresh thinking which can help us solve our many problems and evolve models of best practice.  This Chamber can be a source of encouragement to all those in positions of leadership from street level right up to national level and in all spheres of influence so that every single ounce of energy is harnessed to guide and drive us through this very exacting period of our history.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Seanad is a ready-made platform for regular public discourse with authoritative people invited here from all walks of life, whose experiences place them well to help us frame seminal, formative and pioneering debates.  I was delighted to hear the Leader support such an initiative <Col N="284"/>last Tuesday.  Nowhere is the transformative power of dialogue and ideas more evident than in the peace process.  The growing harmony now being experienced most be more enduring than mere respite and I urge all those not yet engaged with the peace process simply to think again.  This Chamber can be a pivotal host of regular, respectful North-South interchange.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We face a decade of sensitive centenaries which with good forward planning could considerably consolidate peace on our island and we can play an important role in developing the peace dividend in terms of all island trade, commerce, shared services and collaborative initiatives, which promote mutual prosperity on the island.</P>
        <P>I look forward with enthusiasm to working with colleagues in the Seanad to make this Chamber a place to which Irish citizens look for inspiration, reassurance, and encouragement.  We are custodians of the trust of a good and great people.  It is up to us by our actions as well as our words to make the mission of the Seanad relevant to their lives, their needs, their dreams and our Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is an honour to follow those words of Senator  McAleese.  I will not touch on the words except what he said about &ldquo;fresh thinking&rdquo;.  I would love to instill the idea that this House can create fresh thinking.  This is approximately the 70th anniversary of Dunkirk in Britain.  Let us remember what happened in Dunkirk.  The people of Britain were on their last legs and suddenly a degree of confidence and enthusiasm and belief in themselves came about.  We are in a similar situation, a situation where we are facing a threat as big as Dunkirk was to Britain, but we can do something about it.  This House can set an example.  The one thing I do not want is that we call on the Government to do everything.  We can set an example of doing it ourselves.  This came into my mind yesterday when speaking about that island in Japan where there were threats to the airport.  They got together and decided to do something about it themselves without looking for the government to subsidise it.  We, the citizens, can do something about it.  Instead of calling on the Government to do it, we could initiate a truly enthusiastic vigorous effort to support our local industries, shops and producers.  I know this is the Order of Business and the Leader may be wondering what we can do here.  I would like time to be allocated to debate active citizenship.  Last year President McAleese talked about active citizenship, which is about the citizens saying that we can do it rather than asking someone else to do it.  I have been through a number of towns in the past year and have found that some towns are spotless and some towns are very untidy.  I hear people complaining that the council does not clean the streets often enough.  One will find other towns where the shopkeepers and people who live there get out and clean the streets themselves.  They do not litter them or if they do, they get out and clean themselves.  When one person does it, then his or her neighbour does it also and it acts like a catalyst &mdash; that enthusiasm and belief in ourselves that we can do that sort of thing.</P>
        <P>One thing we can do is to buy Irish.  The Government is no longer allowed to support a buy Irish campaign because we cannot use State money to do it, but individually we can do it.  In my experience in the supermarket business, we ran a buy local campaign and the local people discovered that they did not know certain items were made in their area or that a local factory employed so many people.  I call on the Leader to ask the Taoiseach to come to the House to give us the chance to have that debate.  I am not looking for any help or money.  I am not looking for anything other than his ears in order that he could spearhead and drive that active citizenship to encourage us to do something ourselves.  I believe this is the House that can do it.  We can earn our keep and earn the respect of the country if we lead this.  With enthusiasm, vigour and energy we can overcome the difficulties we are facing now, not by calling on someone else to do it but by doing it ourselves.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to follow up on a matter raised yesterday by Senator Whelan on the shortfall in the number of junior doctors.  He mentioned his area of Portlaoise and the midlands in general.  My information is that there will be a shortfall of 450 junior doctors on 1 July.  In other words, 450 places will not be filled.  I understand this has come about as a result of centralising the applications system with little consultation with the people who manage individual hospitals.  There has also been late advertising of posts.  In addition, people coming from outside the European Union need to sit an examination to determine if they have adequate English.  While everyone accepts that is very important, there is a delay in holding those examinations for those who are successful in getting posts.  The training status has been removed in many junior hospital doctor posts.  As a result, people are not even applying for the vacancies advertised.</P>
        <P>I want the Minister to come to the House to explain how he proposes dealing with this matter between now and 1 July.  I quote from an e-mail sent to me yesterday:</P>
        <P LI="1">This centralised process has been a fiasco for niche jobs in small services such as ours.  Medical Manpower continue to have their head in the sand despite increasingly frantic concern expressed by myself and others... over the past few weeks.  We are either ignored or fobbed off with extremely brief emails indicating that they are just about to advertise.  When we initially pointed out that they had overlooked our service and its posts about six weeks ago, we requested that we be permitted to advertise &amp; recruit locally ourselves.  We were refused such latitude.</P>
        <P FLI="0">With 450 posts going unfilled from 1 July, this issue needs to be addressed and the Minister needs to come to the House to explain how it will be done.  We also need accountability regarding the people who made the mistakes in centralising the application process with delays in dealing with the job applicants and the advertising of the positions.  It is an important issue that needs to be dealt with immediately and I ask that the Minister would come to the House in the next few days to give an explanation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week I raised the issue of nursing homes and in particular the ownership structure of nursing homes.  I am not aware if it is a problem in this country but it is a major problem in Great Britain.  While the situation in the Rostrevor nursing home was bad enough, imagine what the burden on the State would be had that company or family owned 40 or 50 nursing homes.  That issue needs to be addressed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, committed to introduce whistleblower legislation for the health sector.  While it is good for her to talk about that, when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government such legislation was already brought in and was included when the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, was set up.  There are questions over why HIQA, having given the all-clear to the Rostrevor nursing home last year, had to seek a court order this year to close it.  I am glad it took that action, but it is hard to credit that circumstances would change so dramatically in a number of months.</P>
        <P>I am glad to be able to address the issue of Navan hospital on the Adjournment.  I note that the political campaigners in Sligo got the bad news last night from the Minister for Health that there would be no change in the national cancer strategy, which I support as it is in the interest of patients.  I hope that when these false promises are shown to be the false promises they were, we will never again have the disgraceful political campaigning on the backs of sick people and cancer patients, which we saw in the run-up to elections in a number of areas.  I am proud to have supported the national cancer strategy throughout even though some services were lost in the best interests of patients in my area.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="286"/>
      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>This is my first time to speak in the 24th Seanad and I do so with a great sense of anticipation, joy and profundity.  I say profundity, because I understand, as I know all Senators do, the responsibility and privilege of this position.  I am one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees, or as Senator Crown likes to call us an &ldquo;Enda-dependent&rdquo;.  Such a nomination is an affirmation of 33 years in third level education, the arts and culture, and broadcasting.  I hope to serve the nomination very well.  I hope to serve the House with clarity of purpose, vision and action, and also with an articulate and melodic voice.</P>
        <P>I hope to bring two distinctive and distinct qualities to the House.  They are qualities that Einstein thought were good.  Anything good enough for Einstein is good enough for me.  The first is imagination &mdash; the kind of imagination that allows us to know that change can happen, that it can move things on, move them out and move them up, that it can unearth and unfurl, that it can be put into practice and be seen to happen, and that it can be qualitative, calculable and accountable for the people.  The second quality is energy &mdash; energy to propel, infuse, motivate to action and push forward, with all other Senators, the route to that change.  Without the energy of action, nothing happens.  Language and argument are not enough; because we give something language does not mean it will happen.  I intend to bring imagination and energy to the House.</P>
        <P>In the past week we have heard from Senators as well as from television, radio and newspaper reports the human tragedy that was the Magdalene laundries.  Many Senators, Deputies and Ministers have been involved in bringing this national scandal out into the open.  Senator McAleese spoke about the possibility of inviting on a regular basis representative groups from Irish life into the House to inform, engage and reveal truths.  I request that the first of these should be Jim Smith, the man who went through the State archives and found the evidence of State complicity in the incarceration and labour exploitation of women and girls in the Magdalene laundries.  I also suggest the brilliant lawyer, Maeve O&rsquo;Rourke, who wrote the submission as to why the State was responsible and presented it in Geneva allowing the United Nations Committee Against Torture to tell the Government that the issues of a thorough investigation and compensation had to be addressed.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>A UK Labour Party councillor for Hackney, Ms Sally Mulready, who leads the survivors&rsquo; group has also told us what the State must do.  These are the examples that the Seanad needs to platform in its regular public discourse and about which Senator Martin McAleese spoke.  I am very privileged and humbled to have been chosen to be in the Seanad.  Circumstances in the country cannot be shocking because a commission, or a television or radio show tells us they are; we need to know ourselves when they are shocking.  It is our problem and we need to deal with it.  I respectfully suggest and request that the Leader consider my proposal as one of the first steps in restoring the relevance of the Seanad to the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair was lenient with the Senator in making her maiden speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very difficult to follow the maiden speeches of Senators Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell and Martin McAleese, whom I commend for their thought-provoking and powerful contributions.  Senator Martin McAleese called for this House to act, be relevant and ensure it does its business.  When Senator Feargal Quinn spoke about active citizenship, I was reminded that Margaret Thatcher had suggested there was no such thing as society or communities, that there were only individuals.  How wrong she was.  It is good that we in Ireland value society and our sense of community.  We are very proud of this.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Ivana Bacik and others in condemning what we now see as a catalogue of abuse in the Rostrevor nursing home, which has surfaced in the media.  We should be conscious <Col N="287"/>of this and act upon it.  The Senator was correct to highlight that, while the abuse in the nursing home was tragic and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms, there were wider issues.  People who work in such institutions should be able to come forward and tell outsiders or inquiries what is happening therein.  I am sure abuses are not occurring in the Rostrevor facility alone.  I am sure similar abuses are taking place elsewhere across the State.  In recent weeks we have dealt with issues arising from historical cases of abuse in institutions in the State.  Let us ensure that in ten or 15 years Members of this House, if it still exists, and the D&aacute;il will not be talking about the abuses in nursing homes about which we are now reading and hearing.  I refer to older people who should be treated with respect and dignity being treated in a truly shocking fashion.  There is a need for us to have a full discussion about nursing home provision and standards, and also about the ability of members of staff in these facilities to come forward and state what is happening therein.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I raised two issues, but they were not addressed by the Leader of the House.  One concerned the review of the taxi industry by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  This is an important review and we should have an opportunity to be part of the discussion.  I also called for a debate on housing, which is fundamental to society.  It is one of the big issues affecting people.  The latest CSO figures suggest there is an urgent need for us to debate it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Leader aware of the Government&rsquo;s timescale for legislating for the tax elements of the civil partnership legislation?  I understand it is now intended to provide for these changes in a finance (No. 3) Bill, but I am concerned about the delay in bringing the Bill forward.  The State has been recognising foreign civil partnerships since January and domestic partnerships since April.  The delay in legislating for the tax rights and responsibilities of couples in civil partnerships is unfair.  I hope that when the finance (No. 3) Bill is brought forward, its effect will be retrospective.  Legislating for civil partnership was one of the key achievements of the last Government.</P>

	<P>I recognise and celebrate the role of Members of this House, particularly Senators David Norris, Katherine Zappone and Ivana Bacik, in advancing the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people over a long period.  I urge the Leader to make the necessary arrangements for the finance (No. 3) Bill to be introduced in the House at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the very interesting contributions made by two of our distinguished new colleagues in the House this morning.  I was particularly taken by a comment of Senator Martin McAleese on the obligation on us all to have respectful or sensitive commemorations of the various historical events that will occur in the next decade or so.  Almost six years ago I asked in this House that the then Government begin preparations for the centenary celebration of the 1916 Rising.  That celebration will have to be approached in a very careful and sensitive fashion.  This House is a forum in which we could debate and consider the types of commemorations that would be most appropriate.</P>
        <P>I support my colleagues who have asked for a detailed debate on nursing homes.  In the previous Seanad I frequently raised the issue of the care of the elderly.  Even when we were bringing forward legislation to deal with nursing homes and make financial provision therefor, <Col N="288"/>I expressed my profound concern that our only aspiration as a society appeared to be to provide what I described as a &ldquo;clean bed in a clean nursing home&rdquo;.  If that is our only aspiration for elderly people, we are in a very sad place.</P>
        <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me a little latitude.  There is a powerful editorial in today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Irish Examiner</i> referring to indifference.  A major speech entitled, The Perils of Indifference, was made many years ago by Jewish scholar Elie Wiesel.  We are now demonstrating the perils of indifference to the elderly.  We need to reflect on this as a society and have a very constructive, inclusive debate on our aims for the elderly.  These aims must be more ambitious than simply providing a bed in a nursing home.  A nursing home must be an inclusive place in an inclusive society.  I would welcome an urgent debate on nursing home care, but the debate on the elderly should be far wider than this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the sentiments of my colleagues who condemned the abuses in the Rostrevor nursing home.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health to the House to discuss not only abuses in nursing homes but also abuses across all institutions of the Health Service Executive, including general and psychiatric hospitals.  He should seek to carry out a review of historical cases of abuse that may have been reviewed internally in the relevant institutions but which may have been put to bed when evidence went missing.  There are legacies of abuse in such institutions.  I have a very close friend, a psychiatric nurse, who tried to raise issues associated with the abuse of patients, but he was cast aside and had to leave his job as a result.  While there is much talk about whistleblower legislation, we must ensure it is enforced.</P>
        <P>I echo Senator Averil Power&rsquo;s comments on legislation on civil partnership.  Before the collapse of the last Government, there was a commitment to make the required legislative changes in the Finance (No. 2) Bill this year.  I ask that the changes be legislated for speedily.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>During the Adjournment debate last Tuesday night which was ably facilitated by the Leas-Chathaoirleach I spoke about a funding problem affecting a suicide prevention initiative in Cork.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs could offer no comfort to me on the matter and it seems funding will not be restored.  During my contribution at that time I made clear my intention to ask the House to lay aside time for a full debate on this most pressing of issues.  The issue of suicide is the greatest single challenge facing us as a community where 527 people a year die by suicide, and many who work in this area believe that figure is considerably underestimated.  The Cathaoirleach might advise me or facilitate a full debate on this most pressing of issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Leader been able to establish the status of the historic buildings in Moore Street?  I raised this matter two weeks ago because it is becoming somewhat urgent at this stage if we are to prepare to have a development in Moore Street in time for 2016.  The Leader will recall that in the last weeks of the previous Seanad we had an exceptionally good debate in this Chamber with all parties subscribing to the views being put forward, but what was particularly significant about the debate was that in the Gallery were relatives of all the 1916 leaders, the first time since 1916 that the relatives came out in a united fashion to back any single proposal.  Meetings took place with the Taoiseach at that time, the appropriate Ministers and the officials from the Departments and it was clear we were gradually reaching a stage where there was support for the plans being put forward by the committee at that time.</P>
        <P>It would be a significant development because it would be an important focal point of the centenary.  This is where the leaders surrendered in 1916.  It is the Alamo of Ireland in many ways.  It would be very important because it would give people the opportunity to visit the <Col N="289"/>buildings and experience what happened at that time.  It would be good for schools which could have projects on it.  Above all else, however, from a tourist point of view, we have seen in the surveys that history is in the top three interests for all tourists coming into the country, and I could see these historic buildings being exceptionally successful.  I do not know if the Leader has had the opportunity of establishing the status and, if not, I can understand that, but he might have a discussion with the Taoiseach on this matter because the group promoting this idea should be met.  They may have been met already but I would like to think we would not let the opportunity pass.</P>
        <P>I understand there are also opportunities for investment moneys being made available and therefore all the money would not come from the public purse.  The GPO seems to be sidelined to some extent.  I might be wrong in that and when we get the report we will know but the GPO was very much to the fore in the initial prospective plans.  I believe the plans for the centenary are now reaching an advanced stage.  I would very much appreciate it if the Leader could ascertain that information for us.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be remiss not to comment on the two maiden speeches of both Senator O&rsquo;Donnell and Senator McAleese.  It is evident that the Taoiseach chose well.</P>
        <P>I wish to make two points.  First, I was disturbed to read media reports in recent days of significant overpayments within the Health Service Executive.  Funds are tight and people are suffering enough but to see computerised self-generated systems significantly overpaying in terms of contracts, staff and so on is worrying.</P>
        <P>Second, I agree with previous speakers on the issue of care of the elderly, what is happening in nursing homes and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, report.  It would be important for the Minister for Health to come to the House and update Members on what is happening with HIQA.  It is disturbing that closure orders have been served on three nursing homes since 2009, and from what we are hearing there may be many more, but we need a national discussion on the important issue of care of the elderly.  I agree with Senator Bradford that it is not a straightforward position of putting people in nursing homes.  Older people should be able to live in their own homes independently for as long as is humanely possible.  They are the people who created this society and given us the future we are going to have and it is important that we would have a national debate on this issue.  I suggest the Leader should talk to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, about setting up a structure whether it be a commission on the status of older people or finding some way of ensuring we have a debate and that we, as legislators, ensure the tools are available for older people to live a full, healthy and interactive life, with access to entertainment, sport and whatever else they wish for as long as possible.  We have let down older people in recent years and we have an opportunity to redress that but a debate is necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to refer to two contributions earlier before making my main point.  First, the Leader and the House would do well to take on board the cogent and eloquent contribution from Senator Martin McAleese.  The sentiments outlined in his contribution would chart a way forward for the Seanad.  His words clearly illustrate the reason the Presidency has become relevant and respected by the people in the past 14 years.  We could do a lot worse than embrace fully what Senator McAleese said.</P>
        <P>Second, I concur fully with my colleague, Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  He has championed the cause of those buildings in Moore Street which were pivotal in the retreat from the GPO in 1916.  While I am sure the wish of the previous Seanad will be endorsed by this House that those buildings would be preserved as part of our heritage, in terms of the emphasis the Government is placing on tourism and the part history can play in that, it is essential we would <Col N="290"/>have a commitment with regard to the preservation of those buildings.  I support that suggestion.</P>
        <P>Last December the European Court of Human Rights found against Ireland on the failure to implement legislation following the X case.  Given that we recently had fairly trenchant comments from Thomas Hammarberg, who is named as the Commissioner for Human Rights for the Council of Europe, which surely must be a misnomer given some of his comments, and given that the Government is currently preparing a report to set out to the Council of Europe in the coming weeks how it intends proceeding with regard to that issue, it is imperative that before anything is sent to the Council of Europe it is discussed in these Houses.  The will of the Irish people has been clearly stated with regard to abortion.  Commitments have been received internationally and enshrined in international agreements, and people voted on the Lisbon treaty on the basis of commitments made in that regard.  It is imperative, despite some minority liberal thinking within the coalition Government, that the majority will of the Irish people would not be aborted in regard to this issue.  I ask that the Minister would come to this House prior to any report issuing from the Government to the Council of Europe and that we would have a full debate here on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on two issues on which I have strong opinions.  The first concerns our wind energy policy.  I will not go into detail on that now but will do so when we have a debate on the issue.  I ask for a debate on our wind energy policy because unless we shout &ldquo;stop&rdquo; regarding our current policy on wind energy and re-evaluate it, this country will have so-called ghost wind farms in the same way as we have ended up with ghost housing estates.  That issue deserves serious debate in this House.</P>
        <P>The other debate I call for is on the supposed independence of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I call for such a debate purely because of the inconsistency of its decision making.  I received a four page email this morning from a family which has been trying for four and a half years to get planning permission to build a family home.  It has been granted planning permission by Roscommon County Council on four occasions in that four and half year period but refused on four occasions by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The supposed independence of that body deserves to be debated.  If we debate the issue, I will cite many incidences to show that An Bord Plean&aacute;la will make one decision today and a different one tomorrow in similar cases.  The issue is worthy of debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Many Senators, led by the Leader of the Opposition, raised the issue of nursing homes and the HIQA report.  What we have learned from this and similar reports during the years is appalling.  As we have a debate arranged on the fair deal scheme next week, we will incorporate the issue of nursing homes also and bring in the Minister to deal with the subject.  It will provide an opportunity for the concerned Members to debate the contents of the report in the House.</P>
        <P>Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and Thomas Byrne spoke about provisions included in the social welfare Bill which will be debated in the House in two weeks.  Therefore, everybody will have an opportunity to raise these issues again.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senator Martin McAleese on his maiden speech.  I certainly share many of his ideas and those of other Senators which I hope we can address fairly soon.  I look forward to engaging in dialogue with Senator Martin McAleese and others on them.  We need to freshen the House and use the energy in it to focus on these issues.  Senator Feargal Quinn raised a similar theme in referring to the need for active citizenship.  I will have a word with the <Col N="291"/>Taoiseach on the matter.  Obviously, we do not have the Taoiseach in the House very often, but I think he would be willing to come here.  I will raise the matter with him.</P>
        <P>Senator Colm Burke spoke about the deficit in the numbers of junior doctors this year and the centralised application process.  I will raise this issue with the Minister for Health, as it presents a major problem which must be addressed.</P>
        <P>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell made her maiden speech.  I hope we will hear her melodic voice in this Seanad in the coming years.</P>
        <P>I am all in favour of change for the good of the House.  Standing Orders 92 to 95, inclusive, deal with the setting up of a petitions committee, but the House has never acted upon them.  They allow a petitions committee of the Seanad to engage in dialogue with the public and to then report back to the House.  We should get such a committee up and running as a first step.  We can be the catalyst for dialogue between the House and the public, which is what many Members want.  We will examine the matter at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to see how we can set up such a committee and I will be willing to discuss it with any Member who wishes to do so.  I am certainly in favour of its establishment.</P>
        <P>Senator David Cullinane spoke about the taxi industry and housing.  We will look at having a debate on these subjects with the relevant Ministers in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Michael Comiskey raised an agricultural issue.  Perhaps he should seek to raise it on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>Senators Averil Power and Kathryn Reilly raised the issue of tax rights to be provided for in a finance (No. 3) Bill.  As the programme for Government lists this as a priority, I will try to find out what the status of the Bill is and when it is due to be taken in the House.  The Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011 will be before the House next week, on which I have arranged for a three hour debate.  As many Senators have asked questions about the economy, there will be an opportunity for them to debate them at that time.  By extending the time allocated for the debate to an unprecedented three hours, I hope everybody who wants to do so will have an opportunity to speak on the Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator John Gilroy raised the issue of suicide, on which I have agreed to arrange a debate.  Senator Mary White, among others, has raised it previously.</P>
        <P>Senators Labhras &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Jim Walsh spoke about the status of the historic buildings on Moore Street.  I will try to get an update on the matter and get back to them next week.</P>
        <P>Senator John Kelly spoke about wind energy projects and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the independence of which has been a topic for debate on many occasions in the House.  We will arrange to have the relevant Minister in the House in the next few weeks for a debate on wind energy.</P>

Thuig m&eacute; gur ag ceathr&uacute; chun a d&oacute; dh&eacute;ag a bh&iacute; m&eacute; le bheith anseo.  Is d&oacute;igh gur fearr go mall n&aacute; go br&aacute;ch.</P>
        <P>T&aacute;im thar a bheith bu&iacute;och as an deis a fh&aacute;il labhairt sa Teach seo inniu maidir leis an Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge.  Ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; gur on&oacute;ir mh&oacute;r at&aacute; ann domsa a bheith ceaptha mar Aire St&aacute;it sa Roinn Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta le freagracht ar leith do ghn&oacute;tha&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta.

        <P>I dtosach b&aacute;ire, is mian liom s&uacute;il a chaitheamh ar an staid ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  L&eacute;irigh an Staid&eacute;ar Cuimsitheach Teangeola&iacute;och ar &Uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht go bhfuiltear iompaithe go m&oacute;r i dtreo an Bh&eacute;arla sa Ghaeltacht agus go bhf&eacute;adfadh nach mairfeadh an Ghaeilge mar theanga phobail agus theaghlaigh sa Ghaellacht ach ar feadh 15 n&oacute; 20 bliain eile mura nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; gn&iacute;omh ar bhonn pr&aacute;inne chun c&uacute;rsa&iacute; a leas&uacute;.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, mar dhuine de bhunadh na Gaeltachta, t&aacute; taith&iacute; phearsanta agam ar mheath na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Teasta&iacute;onn &oacute;n Rialtas seo gn&iacute;omh f&oacute;nta a dh&eacute;anamh faoin strait&eacute;is 20 bliain chun todhcha&iacute; na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht a shl&aacute;n&uacute; i gcomhar leis an phobal ar an talamh sna limist&eacute;ir Ghaeltachta &eacute;ags&uacute;la.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mar at&aacute; r&aacute;ite faoin strait&eacute;is 20 bliain, t&aacute; forbairt ch&oacute;ras cuimsitheach plean&aacute;la teanga ag an leibh&eacute;al pobail sa Ghaeltacht mar ghn&eacute; l&aacute;rnach den strait&eacute;is le cinnti&uacute; go mairfidh an Ghaeilge mar theanga phobail sa Ghaeltacht.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, t&aacute; s&eacute; beartaithe go nd&eacute;anfar for&aacute;il faoin mBille Gaeltachta do shainmh&iacute;ni&uacute; reacht&uacute;il nua ar an Ghaeltacht a bheidh bunaithe feasta ar chrit&eacute;ir theangeola&iacute;ocha le hais an tsainmh&iacute;nithe mar a sheasann s&eacute; faoi l&aacute;thair at&aacute; bunaithe ar limist&eacute;ir shonracha gheografacha.  Tabharfar st&aacute;das reacht&uacute;il faoin mBille Gaeltachta do cheantair Ghaeltachta le st&aacute;das teangeola&iacute;och &eacute;ags&uacute;il acu.  Mar is eol don Teach, forbra&iacute;odh pr&oacute;if&iacute;l shochtheangeola&iacute;och do na cine&aacute;lacha seo de phobail teanga faoin Staid&eacute;ar Cuimsitheach Teangeola&iacute;och.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach freisin nach mbeidh an Ghaeltacht teoranta ag na ceantair a bhfuil st&aacute;das reacht&uacute;il Gaeltachta acu faoi l&aacute;thair.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, tabharfar st&aacute;das reacht&uacute;il faoin mBille Gaeltachta do chine&aacute;l nua de cheantair &ldquo;Gaeltacht gr&eacute;as&aacute;in&rdquo; a bheidh lasmuigh de na ceantair Ghaeltachta reacht&uacute;la at&aacute; ann cheana f&eacute;in.  Is ceantair iad seo a mbeidh a bhformh&oacute;r i bpobail uirbeacha agus a mbeidh toirt bhun&uacute;sach chritici&uacute;il de thaca&iacute;ocht phobail agus St&aacute;it acu don Ghaeilge.</P>

Go bun&uacute;sach, d&eacute;anfar for&aacute;il sa Bhille Gaeltachta d&rsquo;Orduithe, arna nd&eacute;anamh le faomhadh an Rialtais, ina sonr&oacute;fa&iacute; na ceantair a bheadh le h&aacute;ireamh sa Ghaeltacht, mar cheantair &ldquo;Gaeltacht gr&eacute;as&aacute;in&rdquo; n&oacute; mar Bhailte Seirbh&iacute;se Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach nach n-aireoidh aon phobal Gaeltachta faoi l&eacute;igear n&oacute; faoi bhagairt mar thoradh ar an sainmh&iacute;ni&uacute; reacht&uacute;il nua do limist&eacute;ir Ghaeltachta a bheidh bunaithe feasta ar chrit&eacute;ir theangeola&iacute;ocha.

        <P>N&iacute;l aon dabht ach gur comhartha muin&iacute;ne &eacute; an cinneadh Rialtais in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.

Rud a bh&iacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach n&aacute; go raibh chomhchomhairle i gceist leis na heagrais agus le daoine eile a raibh baint acu leis an nGaeilge.  Is cuimhin liom go ndeachaigh an coiste Oireachtais go dt&iacute; an Ghaeltacht chun bualadh leis na heagrais sin.

	<P>Thank you very much.  I apologise.  Three weeks ago I did not know I would be standing here and I have another pressing commitment.  I trust the House will understand.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the strategy and its ambitions.  I hope I can be one of its successes by building on the Irish I learned at school and, in a future debate, I may be able to contribute as Gaeilge.  That is a challenge I have set myself.  I very much welcome the information provided by the Minister of State.  The Cabinet sub-committee is central to driving the implementation of the strategy and I am happy that it has been established and has met twice.  I look forward to hearing more about it.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the fact that the Minister for Education and Skills is a member of the sub-committee.  The backdrop to the debate today is the many thousands of students sitting the junior certificate Irish examination, including my nephew.  I hope all our students, including him, do well.  However, I refer to the issue of how Irish is dealt with in the education system.  I welcome the changes being made, but we need to do more to ensure Irish remains a living language not only in gaelscoileanna but throughout our education system with children being exposed to the language in preschool and through the media and so on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I lived for three years in Brussels, which is a bilingual capital.  It taught me that all advertisements have to be in two languages.  My husband is Dutch but I did not know him at the time.  I gained great exposure to Flemish during my time in Brussels because I had French and I was able to compare both languages.  Subliminally, one&rsquo;s vocabulary increases.  There is something to be said for subliminal exposure aside from formal education.  For example, in our system, Irish classes are held for set periods of 30 or 40 minutes.  The language should seep through our education system in smaller, fun and creative ways in order that Irish becomes a living language for children from an early stage.  They should not be restricted to set periods where they have to learn, rehearse and recite.  They should be encouraged to play games and engage in activities.  A number of sports organisations are doing this and that is welcome.  There must be a greater focus on the aural aspect of the language and we need to be creative in how we do that.</P><Col N="304"/>
        <P>The Minister of State announced that there will be a new statutory definition of &ldquo;linguistic borders&rdquo; based on studies.  Will he elaborate on the criteria that will be used and on the studies?  I tried to research them but I was unable to establish whether they had been published.  Perhaps he can advise us on this.  I welcome his planned approach to Gaeltacht networks where Irish is spoken so that an appropriate environment can be created and they can expand.</P>
        <P>I very much look forward to future debates on the language in the House.  I hope we will be able to support the Minister of State in the implementation of the strategy.  It is rightly ambitious.  This is a good time for us to have this discussion but we need to examine the strategy&rsquo;s implementation and ensure the language gets to live.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Little did I know 20 years ago when he attended my wedding in Gweedore, County Donegal, that I would have anything to do with politics and I would be in the Seanad today addressing him on matters relating to the Irish language.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I married a native Irish speaker from Gweedore who is an Irish teacher and I am ashamed that I would feel it easier to address the Minister of State in Spanish on matters relating to the Irish language than in Irish.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, I firmly believe that most Irish people have a genuine gr&aacute; for the language.  It does not necessarily follow, though, that they are in favour of the current compulsory nature of the syllabus in our schools.  It has not worked and this was recognised back in 1924 by the former Minister for Education, Mr. Eoin MacNeill, when he commented, &ldquo;You might as well be putting wooden legs on hens as trying to restore Irish through the school system&rdquo;.  The language needs to be made readily accessible and attractive to all those who wish to enjoy and learn it because to compel is to repel.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In contrast to this compulsory system, I would like to highlight the effectiveness of every Gaeltacht in the country.  Each year more than 25,000 students attend Gaeltachta&iacute;, generating &euro;50 million in these areas.  These people voluntarily choose to learn their native language.  I applaud the fact that education is a core part of the action areas in the 20 year strategy.  Encouraging people to learn Irish for the sheer love of it would be a good start but we must level with people.  I am reminded of an advertisement campaign a few years ago which stated, &ldquo;Learn Irish, it&rsquo;s easy&rdquo;.  It is not easy to learn any language and it is definitely not easy to learn Irish but that does not mean it is not rewarding in numerous ways.</P>
        <P>The proposal that a total of 20% of places in colleges of education be reserved for those educated through Irish or those who do well in the leaving certificate in Irish is an important development but a weighting or higher points should be given to examination subjects, including Irish that are more relevant for the tertiary courses being applied for by students.  For instance, someone applying for a degree in languages should be afforded more points for Irish and other languages than someone who has taken science subjects primarily.  Similarly, those applying for science degrees should gain more points for biology, physics and so on, than for less relevant subjects.  This would steer students towards courses that would more reflect their academic strengths.  The requirement to have Irish to gain entry to some colleges has denied some students the opportunity to explore and excel in their own chosen field of study.</P>
        <P>The language has an important role in our culture and society.  We need to give people the opportunity to embrace this culture and not attempt to force it on them.</P>

        <P>&ldquo;The value of linguistic diversity is recognised internationally and safeguarding languages such as Irish is thus a crucial task in maintaining cultural diversity worldwide&rdquo;.  That is part of the process of the strategy as outlined.  The commitment of this and previous Governments to focus on changing the Irish curriculum in our schools is designed to ensure more emphasis will be placed on spoken Irish, as well as the written language.  In 2010, 62% and 78%, respectively, of males and females who took the honours paper in the leaving certificate received a grade C.  That is to be welcomed because it is a good grade.  The Government proposes to allocate 50% of the overall marks to the oral exam in the leaving certificate, which I welcome as it is a good recommendation.  The goal to double the number of speakers of the Irish language by 2018 is welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Labhair duine &eacute;igin faoin siollabas at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair.  The proposed two strand approach to the teaching of the Irish language is good and this can be done by creating two subjects out of the current syllabus &mdash; the Irish language and Irish literature and culture.  This proposal is included in the programme for Government and I would like to see it implemented.</P>

        <P>We have seen an upsurge in the number of gaelscoileanna, which is most welcome in the promotion of the Irish language.  However, there is a fear among a great many involved in gaelscoileanna about the proposed criteria to be met in setting up a school.  While the proposals may be welcome in setting up primary schools to cater for diversity, Irish language bodies such as An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta, Gaelscoileanna Teo, Conradh na Gaeilge and Guth na Gaeltachta have outlined the difficulties that will arise for minority schools such as gaelscoileanna if new schools are to be established on the basis of surveys and recommendations because the preference of the majority will be to attend an English speaking school.  That aspect of the matter should be looked at again.  I ask the Minister for Education and Skills to include the position of the Irish language bodies which have spoken out in the foreward to his report on the Commission on School Accommodation in order that their position will not be under threat.  The linguistic criterion and geographical location must be taken into account.</P><Col N="309"/>

	<P Just="Left">D&iacute;osp&oacute;ireach f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.  Is cuid d&aacute;r saibhreas cult&uacute;rtha &iacute; an Ghaeilge agus n&iacute; m&oacute;r do gach Seanad&oacute;ir a chuid a dh&eacute;anamh chun an teanga a chaomhn&uacute;.  I mo chontae f&eacute;in, i bPort L&aacute;irge, t&aacute; Gaeltacht na Rinne agus is m&oacute;r an tairbh a bhaineann pobal an chontae ar fad as, &oacute; thaobh an chult&uacute;ir, an teanga agus na turas&oacute;ireachta de.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is important for us to have a discussion on the future of the Irish language and the 20 year strategy.  The Irish language is very important in terms of our rich cultural and heritage past and for the future of the country.  Earlier in the week we had a discussion on the potential of tourism and the need to promote tourism in the State.  The Minister of State would agree that the Irish language and the Gaeltacht represent an attraction for many visitors.  I can certainly speak on behalf of the people in Gaeltacht na Rinne, Contae Phort L&aacute;irge, who have benefited greatly in terms of the lift to tourism.</P>
        <P>All people, including elected public representatives, have a responsibility to promote and use the language when they can.  I support Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s point that people should be encouraged to use whatever we have.  In County Waterford the Gaeltacht makes an immense contribution to the entire county, but especially to west Waterford in cultural, tourism and language terms.  I have made some good friends here in the Seanad, one of whom is Senator Darcy.  I invite the Senator to come to the Gaeltacht in An Rinn, where I have no doubt he will have no difficulty in finding a bed and will not need to sleep in a bath.  He would be very welcome and I would love the have the opportunity to show him beautiful An Rinn and west Waterford if he wishes to take up the invitation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a hurling man, I can say that Sinn F&eacute;in has no intention of using this issue as a political football.  However, there are real political issues that need to be addressed in the context of the future of the language.  I am sure the Minister of State would also welcome a frank and robust discussion on the future of the language.  This is an important debate in examining the best path forward for the language and to ensure we do not make the mistakes of the past.  Many Gaelgoir&iacute; who want to play their part in promoting the language and those in communities, about which Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; spoke, talk about the fact that for too long the State has <Col N="311"/>paid lip service to the Irish language, which is something we need to consign to the past.  A number of previous speakers spoke about the educational system and that so many children &mdash; there were some in the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery earlier &mdash; come through the educational system without the ability to speak our national language.  I am one of those, a product of that system.  Thankfully, my son who is four is going to a na&iacute;onra and will go to a gaelscoil, which will mean he will have a better opportunity than I had.  Every school should be a gaelscoil essentially and every child should have the same opportunity to learn, appreciate and love the language as we ought to.</P>
        <P>I will comment on some of my concerns about the Government&rsquo;s strategy.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about elections to the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The Minister praised the contribution by the 17 elected members of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to date, which is very welcome.  The question was posed as to whether the election process is the best way to ensure proper representation.  The election of people who live in Gaeltachta&iacute; is the best way to ensure proper representation in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  I fail to see how appointing people can work.  If people in Passage in east Waterford, whom I have nothing against, had a say in who should represent the people of the Gaeltacht in that county, it would not be right, nor would it be right if people outside Waterford had a say in who should represent the Gaeltacht in Waterford.  The fairest and best way to ensure proper representation is to have direct elections in which the people of the Gaeltachta&iacute; are afforded an opportunity to vote.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be aware that there is much talk about the abolition of this House and, potentially, the merging of local authorities and a reduction in the number of Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la.  The proposals for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta are regarded as part of the proposals for stripping away democratic power at local level.  I pay tribute to the person from County Waterford who is directly elected to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  That person does a fantastic job advocating on behalf of the people of the Gaeltacht.  If we acknowledge this, as the Minister has done, we should not try to fix something that is not broken.  I refer in particular to the election process.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about proposals in respect of the enterprise functions of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and about the role of Enterprise Ireland.  If the people who are responsible for creating jobs have no connection with the Gaeltacht, they are unlikely to give it sufficient priority.  The Minister of State should consider this.  Those responsible for creating jobs in the Gaeltachta&iacute; need to understand the value of the language, not just culturally but in business terms.  They should have the ability to market the Irish language.  We spoke about this previously in terms of business and tourism.</P>
        <P>I ask Senators to support the efforts of my party to secure proper legislation for the Irish language in the North.  As Senators will know, some resist our efforts in the North and trivialise them at times.  We are trying to establish an Irish language Act in the Northern Assembly and I hope our effort will have cross-party support in this House.  I support the work of the former Minister of Education in the North and the new Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n of Sinn F&eacute;in.  I hope there will be continual engagement between the latter and the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy McGinley.  I hope there is cross-party support in this House to ensure citizens who live in the North, who regard themselves as Irish and value the Irish language as much as we do, will have the same rights and opportunities as people in this State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Martin McAleese, who made his maiden speech today, spoke about the need for further cross-Border co-operation.  Where we can work together, we should.  Promotion of the Irish language is certainly such an area, and I appeal to the Minister of State to do what he can in that regard.  I thank him for coming to the House and for his contribution.  I hope he <Col N="312"/>will take on board some of the constructive criticisms of the 20 year strategy, as raised by me and Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil m&eacute; in am don d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.  I dtosach b&aacute;ire, ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Is iontach an rud &eacute; go bhfuil an dualgas seo, dualgas cur chun cinn na Gaeilge sna Gaeltachta&iacute; agus sa Ghalltacht, curtha air go h&aacute;irithe, mar is cinnte gur duine &eacute; an tAire St&aacute;it leis an cur chuige agus an cumas lena chuid dualgas a chomhl&iacute;onadh, go h&aacute;irithe ag am deacair mar seo nuair at&aacute; ganntanas acmhainn&iacute; agus go leor eile.</P>
        <P Just="Left">N&iacute;l s&eacute; i bhfad &oacute; labhair muid faoin strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge anseo sa Seanad.  Mar sin, n&iacute;lim chun m&oacute;r&aacute;n a r&aacute; faoin strait&eacute;is f&eacute;in sna c&uacute;pla n&oacute;im&eacute;ad at&aacute; agam.  Ba bhre&aacute; liom an m&eacute;id seo a r&aacute; &aacute;fach.  De r&eacute;ir an staid&eacute;ir agus an taighde teangeola&iacute;och at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag Acadamh na hOllscola&iacute;ochta thar ceann an Rialtas deiridh, is maith an rud &eacute; agus is f&iacute;or th&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; an dul chun cinn nua n&oacute; an treor&uacute; nua at&aacute; ag an Rialtas agus ag an strait&eacute;is i leith cur chun cinn na Gaeilge, n&iacute; ar leibh&eacute;al t&iacute;r eola&iacute;och ach ar leibh&eacute;il teangeola&iacute;och de.  Amach anseo beidh tr&iacute; leibh&eacute;il de Ghaeltacht ann.  An leibh&eacute;al is l&aacute;idre a bheidh ann n&aacute; &aacute;it ina mbeidh daoine a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilge go laeth&uacute;il agus go rialta agus ina bhfuil institi&uacute;d&iacute; l&aacute;idre Gaeilge, ag feidhmi&uacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, lonnaithe ann le go mbeidh seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; ar f&aacute;il.  Ach t&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach nach mbeidh daoine sa limist&eacute;ar Gaeltachta sin agus gur cuma m&aacute; t&aacute; Gaeilge &aacute; labhairt acu n&oacute; nach bhfuil.  Caithfidh an Ghaeltacht a bheith bunaithe ar phobal at&aacute; toilteanach, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in Gaeilge a labhairt ach an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Sin at&aacute; i gceist agam nuair a deirim go gcaithfear an t-aitheantas a thabhairt don Ghaeilge ar bhonn teangeola&iacute;och.</P>
        <P Just="Left">T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach go dtugaimid an taca&iacute;ocht d&rsquo;&aacute;iteanna sa Ghaeltacht ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge l&aacute;idir chun an st&aacute;das sin a choime&aacute;d agus a dhaingni&uacute;, cur i gc&aacute;s in &aacute;iteanna mar Leitir M&oacute;r, &aacute;it ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge an-l&aacute;idir, n&oacute; n&iacute;os l&aacute;idre n&aacute; in aon &aacute;it eile.  T&aacute; &aacute;iteanna eile, agus t&aacute; a fhios seo ag an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh, nach bhfuil an mh&eacute;id ch&eacute;anna Gaeilge &aacute; labhairt iontu, cur i gc&aacute;s Na Forbacha.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam c&eacute;n c&eacute;atad&aacute;n de dhaoine ansin a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilge, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir 30%.  Cad at&aacute;imid chun a dh&eacute;anamh chun an rogha a thabhairt do na pobail sin a shocr&uacute; an bhfuil siad le bheith sa Ghaeltacht n&oacute; nach bhfuil.  M&aacute; t&aacute; daoine chun roghn&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh i bhf&aacute;bhar na Gaeilge agus i bhf&aacute;bhar an Ghaeilge a bheith beo sna pobail sin, caithfear an taca&iacute;ocht agus na hacmhainn&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ar an &aacute;bhar sin, t&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach go leanfaidh r&oacute;l &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; fosta&iacute;ochta, agus t&aacute;im s&aacute;sta gur mar sin a bheidh s&eacute;.  M&aacute;s buan mo chuimhne, labhair an Rialtas deireanach faoi &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge, ach n&iacute; shin an t-ainm a bheidh air.  Is maith an rud &eacute; go bhfuil dualgas ar leith i leith na teanga ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s agus go bhfuil sin aitheanta.  Riamh anall chuir &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta maoin ar f&aacute;il, cur i gc&aacute;s nuair a chabhraigh s&eacute; le TG4 agus mar sin de.  Ceisteanna fosta&iacute;ochta a bh&iacute; i gceist agus chuir siad acmhainn&iacute; le haghaidh traen&aacute;la agus mar sin de ar f&aacute;il.  Dar nd&oacute;igh, bh&iacute; ceist na teanga laistiar de sin sa ch&uacute;lra.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeidh r&oacute;l ar leith don teanga i measc na dualgais at&aacute; ar &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, ach caithfidh an nasc le fosta&iacute;ocht a bheith ann.  M&aacute; t&aacute; daoine ag dul isteach go Gaillimh gach l&aacute;, ag labhairt Gaeilge sa bhaile agus ag labhairt B&eacute;arla don chuid is m&oacute; i nGaillimh, beidh s&eacute; an-deacair ar na daoine sin teacht ar ais agus bheith ag labhairt Gaeilge sa bhaile.  N&iacute; mar sin a chaomhn&iacute;tear an Ghaeltacht mar &aacute;it ina bhfuil Gaeilge labhartha.  Sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil c&uacute;rsa&iacute; fosta&iacute;ochta chomh t&aacute;bhachtach.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach go mbeidh r&oacute;l ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta chun fosta&iacute;ocht a chur ar f&aacute;il sa Ghaeltacht agus go mbeidh an r&oacute;l sin lean&uacute;nach agus daingnithe.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeidh fosta&iacute;ocht sa Ghaeltacht m&aacute; t&aacute; an teanga le bheith beo.  Ba bhre&aacute; liom ceist eile a chur maidir le Foras na Gaeilge.  Chun an fh&iacute;rinne a r&aacute;, n&iacute; saineola&iacute; m&eacute;.  Tuigim go bhfuil Foras na Gaeilge bunaithe ar Chomhaont&uacute; <Col N="313"/>Aoine an Ch&eacute;asta, &oacute; 1998.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go dtaca&iacute;onn Sinn F&eacute;in go m&oacute;r le Foras na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; mo chairde &oacute;n bpairt&iacute; sin in aice liom.  T&aacute; daoine ann i gcomhluadar na Gaeilge a chuireann ceisteanna faoi &eacute;ifeacht an fhorais.  Faigheann Foras na Gaeilge na milli&uacute;in euro go bliant&uacute;il.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go raibh &euro;20 milli&uacute;n &aacute; chaitheamh acu ag am amh&aacute;in.  N&iacute;l an figi&uacute;r is deireana&iacute; agam.  Is &eacute; seo an &aacute;it chun na ceisteanna seo a ard&uacute;.  N&iacute;l m&eacute; ag r&aacute; go bhfuil na freagra&iacute; agam.  Nuair a bh&iacute;odh &euro;20 milli&uacute;n ag Foras na Gaeilge, mar eagra&iacute;ocht maoinithe do heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; eile, cuireadh b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir &euro;8 milli&uacute;n ar f&aacute;il dos na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; Gaeilge.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin ceart go leor, ach c&eacute;ard a tharla don chuid eile den airgead?  An raibh aon phlean&aacute;il cheart d&eacute;anta?  An ndearnadh aon rud m&oacute;r leis an airgead sin?  An bhfuil Foras na Gaeilge &eacute;ifeachtach?  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil daoine ann a d&eacute;arfaidh go bhfuil.  M&aacute;s &eacute; sin an freagra, glacaim leis.  Ba bhre&aacute; liom ionada&iacute;ocht a dh&eacute;anamh d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d a chaitheann a saol ag obair ar son na Gaeilge agus a chuireann ceisteanna mar seo.  B&rsquo;fhi&uacute; na ceisteanna a fhreagairt, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir, n&oacute; d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht eile a bheith againn.  T&aacute;imid ag feidhmi&uacute; gan na hacmhainn&iacute; c&eacute;anna a bh&iacute; againn.

T&aacute; an cheist &aacute; ard&uacute; agam &mdash; is &eacute; sin an m&eacute;id.</P>
        <P>Ba mhaith liom labhairt faoi ruda&iacute; eile a ritheann liom i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta a bheith againn gan a r&aacute; ar&iacute;s go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach an Ghaeilge a fhorbairt, cib&eacute; &aacute;it ina bhfuil s&iacute; &aacute; labhairt.  Caithfimid deis a thabhairt do dhaoine sna h&aacute;iteanna ina bhfuil an teanga n&iacute;os laige &iacute; a chur chun cinn.  M&aacute; t&aacute; s&eacute; sin le bheith d&eacute;anta i gceart, caithfear daoine a bheith fostaithe sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s a bhfuil na scileanna cu&iacute; acu don phlean teanga.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir na hathruithe at&aacute; riachtanach a dh&eacute;anamh muna bhfuil saineolas laistigh den Rialtas, go h&aacute;irithe an Rialtas buan, ag daoine le scileanna, an cur chuige ceart agus eolas faoin chaoi inar f&eacute;idir an pobal a oili&uacute;nt sa ch&oacute;ras plean&aacute;la don Ghaeilge.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh saineolas i measc an phobail maidir le plean&aacute;il teanga.  Ba cheart go mbeadh go leor daoine laistigh den Rialtas agus an St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s in ann d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le pobal na Gaeilge chun an obair fhi&uacute;ntach seo a chur i gcr&iacute;ch.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais, t&aacute; go leor daoine ag caint faoi na hathruithe t&aacute;bhachtacha sa siollabas.  Ba bhre&aacute; liom go dtiocfadh an l&aacute; ina mbeadh an Ghaeilge riachtanach i gc&oacute;na&iacute; sna scoileanna.  N&iacute;l aon phoblacht cheart, i mo thuairim, muna bhfuil s&iacute; riachtanach.  Aonta&iacute;m gur ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn an siollabas a athr&uacute; ionas go mbeidh n&iacute;os m&oacute; b&eacute;ime ar Ghaeilge labhartha agus c&uacute;rsa&iacute; t&eacute;ipe, srl., mar a bh&iacute; ann i gc&oacute;na&iacute; &oacute; thaobh na Fraincise agus dteangacha eile sna me&aacute;nscoileanna de.  Deirtear go dtarl&oacute;idh s&eacute; i 2012, nuair a thabharfar 50% de na marcanna don Ghaeilge cliste labhartha.  N&iacute; leor &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh muna bhfuil ard&uacute; sa chaighde&aacute;n ag an am c&eacute;anna.  Is f&eacute;idir le daoine marcanna n&iacute;os airde a fh&aacute;il, ach n&iacute; hionann &eacute; sin agus a r&aacute; go bhfuil caighde&aacute;n n&iacute;os fearr ann.  Caithfimid d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar chaighde&aacute;n m&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge sna scoileanna.  M&aacute; t&aacute;imid chun an cheist chonsp&oacute;ideach sin a ard&uacute;, caithfimid d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar na hacmhainn&iacute; agus na riachtanais at&aacute; in &aacute;it do dhaoine at&aacute; ag foghlaim na Gaeilge agus ag cur snas ar a gcuid Geailge sna hinstiti&uacute;id&iacute; tri&uacute; leibh&eacute;al sar a th&eacute;ann siad amach ag m&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th, mar shampla, nach bhfuil s&eacute; riachtanach d&rsquo;fhoghlaimeoir&iacute; m&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge dul go dt&iacute; an Ghaeltacht sa samhradh?  Is cuimhin liom nuair a rinne m&eacute; iarch&eacute;im san iriseoireacht, bh&iacute; orm a chinnti&uacute; go raibh m&eacute; in ann 40 focal a chl&oacute;scr&iacute;obh in aghaidh an n&oacute;im&eacute;id.  Bh&iacute; orm an riachtanas sin a chomhl&iacute;onadh sar a nglacfa&iacute; liom ar an gc&uacute;rsa sin.  Sa chaoi c&eacute;anna, m&aacute; t&aacute; daoine ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a m&uacute;ineadh sna scoileanna, caithfidh ruda&iacute; &aacute;irithe, seachas siollabas an institi&uacute;id tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al, a bheith riachtanach.  Mar shampla, ba cheart go mbeadh s&eacute; de dhualgas orthu dul go dt&iacute; an Ghaeltacht go rialta le feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mar fhocal deiridh, bh&iacute; tr&aacute;th ann nuair a bh&iacute; beagnach gach duine sa Roinn Oideachais, mar a bh&iacute;, in ann gn&oacute;tha&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh le daoine tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Athra&iacute;odh na rialacha 30 bliain &oacute; shin <Col N="314"/>n&oacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute;.

Buille marfach a bheadh ann.  N&iacute; hionann sin agus a r&aacute; nach mairfeadh an Ghaeilge.  Mairfidh an Ghaeilge os rud &eacute; go bhfuil gaelscoileanna, srl., ar fud na t&iacute;re.

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to deal with a point raised on Second Stage regarding the class A fine of &euro;5,000 and the maximum term of imprisonment of 12 months.  I listened carefully to the Minister&rsquo;s remarks about somebody being peripherally involved in this context.  However, I am concerned about the consequences.  The Bill has been introduced to prevent the use of chemicals of mass destruction and biological contaminants.  Obviously, if they are used and somebody is charged under the legislation, it is intended that he or she has used them for hostile purposes.  My understanding of the Bill is that it is only in such circumstances that a case can be mounted.  Given the seriousness of the matter, where innocent people&rsquo;s lives would be put at risk, anybody even peripherally involved would be held culpable for a very serious offence.  A fine of that small size or a term of imprisonment of up to 12 months does not appear to be commensurate with the offence or any contemplation I can devise of involvement that could be deemed to be peripheral.  I cannot recall whether it was Senator Ivana Bacik or the Minister who offered the example of somebody who might be living with a person who was manufacturing or transporting or in some way culpable under this legislation and he or she might not know about it.  Where a person did not know about it, he or she should not be successfully prosecuted.  However, if he or she did know and did not do his or her duty by informing the authorities, it should not be treated as a minor offence.  I cannot envisage what might constitute an offence under this legislation that would be minor.  </P>
        <P>We must be unequivocal in our statements on how we will police the intention of the State to protect its citizens.  Only recently a number of Members met Justice for the Forgotten which represents the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  It was the finding of an all-party Oireachtas group in the last Oireachtas that the State had failed the people concerned over the course of many Administrations.  There are many such instances, not just here but also in other jurisdictions.  I am strongly of the opinion that if somebody is culpable and can be successfully prosecuted under this legislation, I cannot envisage any circumstances in which the offence could be minor.  It would be a most serious offence and should, therefore, be subject to the most serious penalties as a consequence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Senator&rsquo;s concern.  Under this section, it is only on summary conviction that the class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months would be imposed, whereas there is a more serious penalty for conviction on indictment.  Almost certainly, if somebody was directly and knowingly involved in these crimes, it would be an indictable offence.  The intention of paragraph (<i>a</i>) relates to where somebody might unwittingly have been brought into this somehow or other by somebody with whom they were associated, to ensure there is a possibility of leniency where there was a genuine lack of knowledge of what was happening on that person&rsquo;s part.  There is also the more serious penalty.  Senator Ivana Bacik who is a legal expert in many ways&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not go that far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;pointed out yesterday that it was most likely to be an indictable offence if somebody was convicted under this legislation.</P><Col N="320"/>
        <P>As with much other legislation, there is provision for a lesser, non-indictable offence.  That is the thinking behind the two levels of conviction.  Certainly, it is not the intention to be in any way lenient with a person who is found to be knowingly culpable under the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the point made by the Minister of State that this provision would be normal for ordinary, run-of-the-mill offences.  As I have no legal qualifications, I am approaching this provision as a layman and concerned citizen.  First, I cannot understand why somebody would not be convicted on indictment if he or she had any involvement in this activity.  If somebody is convicted, even summarily, it means he or she presumably had some knowledge or participated in some way.  The legislation should be sufficiently strong in order that it will send a clear signal to the effect that if one is remotely knowledgeable of something like this happening, one does have responsibilities and that there can be no peripheral connection with it which simply leads to a small fine or a short term of imprisonment.  Perhaps there are such circumstances, but I cannot visualise how somebody would be convicted while at the same time not having had an involvement, given that if he or she had faced up to his or her citizenship responsibility, it would have avoided what might have been a very serious loss of life.  I will not press it any further but I am trying to extract from the Minister of State and the Department the circumstances in which summary convictions may be applicable.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach is a legal expert and may be able to enlighten me on it.  Perhaps it is my ignorance of the law but I am concerned and that is why I am pressing the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason for the first alternative is to give discretion.  For example, if someone worked in a laboratory and had some connection with some material that was subsequently transported or used under the Act, the judge would be able to impose a lesser sentence or fine even if the person was in some way connected.  This provision gives the judge discretion.  Section 8 contains a presumption relating to conduct referred to in section 2(2):</P>
        <P LI="1">In proceedings for an offence under this Act, where a person has stockpiled, acquired, possessed or retained or transferred to another person, or attempted to stockpile, acquire, possess or retain or transfer to another person, a microbial or other biological agent, or toxin (whatever its origin or method of production), of such a type and in such a quantity that it is reasonable to conclude that it has been developed or produced or is intended to be used for a hostile purpose&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the agent or toxin is presumed to have been so developed or produced or to have been so intended, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) the person is presumed to have known or been reckless as to whether or not it has been so developed or produced or was so intended</P>
        <P FLI="0">There is a doubt as to whether the person would have known and this gives the judge the discretion to be more lenient where there is a doubt whether the person knew.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a lower threshold.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps that explains it better.  When it is related to section 8, one gets a better understanding of the intention.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>If my reading of the section is correct, if a person has previously been acquitted of the offence, the person cannot be charged again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>In another jurisdiction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>That applies the double jeopardy principle.  More recent criminal justice legislation has removed the double jeopardy principle.  People can be charged a second time when previously acquitted of an offence.  Why do we embrace the principle of double jeopardy in this legislation?  This is a very serious offence and it does not seem to be consistent if we are prepared to set aside the principle for other criminal acts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There are principles that apply with regard to double jeopardy.  I am not sure of the legislation to which Senator Walsh refers but it may apply to specific circumstances.  My understanding is that double jeopardy applies generally in international law.  Does the Senator have information on the specific legislation to which he refers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation concerned gangland crime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It was debated within this House in the past two years or 18 months.  It received a good airing in the House because the principle existed as long as the State.  It was introduced to ensure that people who were acquitted could be charged again when new information or data came to light through investigation.  There appears to be a contradiction.  I do not want to diminish the seriousness of criminal activity but very few crimes are more serious than offences under this Bill.  If someone has been acquitted elsewhere and the State has information sufficient to mount a prosecution case, the double jeopardy principle should not prevent it from happening unless there is a very good argument for it.  It appears to be inconsistent and I hope that is not the case of one side of the Department failing to be consistent with other areas of the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>My officials advise me that the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice was sought and the advice was that this clause should be included in the legislation.  We can provide Senator Walsh with some engagement on the specific reasons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Eminent as the Attorney General is, this is not something to which I subscribe.  It seems the double jeopardy rule should not apply in this case.  If provisions have been made for less serious offences, there should be no prohibition on prosecution for serious crimes such as this.  We should get the persuasive advice of the Attorney General.  It shows a lack of consistency and dilutes the seriousness of an offence under the Biological Weapons Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The double jeopardy rule generally applies and the gangland crime legislation was an exception.  There are specific reasons gangland crime is an exception.  I understand the concern of Senator Walsh.  The advice of the Attorney General is generally not published but there may be a way of conveying to the Senator the reasons behind the advice.  I do not have the advice in the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="322"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I respect that.  I do not want to prolong this debate.  Offences under this legislation could be carried out by an independent group without connections but are more likely to be carried out by those acting in concert with other terrorist gangs.  There is quite a parallel between gangland legislation and the reasons for setting aside the double jeopardy rule.  I cannot get my head around how we can find ourselves allowing double jeopardy to play a part where we are pursuing a case that would not be pursued unless there was sufficient evidence to mount a prosecution.  I ask the Minister of State to test the advice of the Attorney General in case it is a standard lawyer embrace of principles that may need to be tested by the legislator.</P>

        <P>This issue, relating to the Magdalene laundries, is of grave concern.  A recent statement by the United Nations Committee Against Torture indicated it was the responsibility of the Irish State to investigate abuses in the Magdalene laundries under Articles 12 and 13 of the United Nations convention against torture and that there should be a way under Article 14 to ensure redress for survivors.  The report was published this week by the committee, which monitors states&rsquo; compliance with the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  A Government delegation answered questions on its record at public hearings in Geneva last month, which was the first time Ireland has taken part in monitoring by the committee.</P>
        <P>The committee&rsquo;s recommendations are not legally binding but carry moral authority, particularly for countries such as Ireland that pride themselves on their record of promoting human rights.  There is also our role in the United Nations to consider.  The committee, which is staffed by human rights experts from the United Nations, expressed in the report &ldquo;grave concern&rdquo; at the failure by the State to protect the girls and women who were involuntarily confined between 1922 and 1996 in the Magdalene laundries.  It concluded the State&rsquo;s failure to regulate and inspect these institutions, where it is alleged physical, emotional and other abuses were committed, amounted to &ldquo;breaches of the convention&rdquo;.  It also strongly criticised the State for failing to investigate allegations of abuse at the laundries.  The report recommended the State carry out a &ldquo;prompt, independent and thorough investigation&rdquo; of the alleged committal of women to Magdalene laundries.  It indicated that in appropriate cases, it should &ldquo;prosecute and punish the perpetrators with penalties commensurate with the gravity of the offences committed&rdquo;.  It also indicated that the State should ensure all victims obtain redress and have an enforceable right to compensation, including the means for a full rehabilitation.</P>
        <P>In its submission to the committee, the Government stated that the vast majority of women entered the laundries &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo;, which is an exaggeration, &ldquo;or if they were minors with the consent of their parents&rdquo;.  Such claims can be easily refuted.  The State argued that the alleged events happened &ldquo;a long time ago&rdquo; in private institutions and the only situation where women were detained in a laundry by law applied to one institution.  It was argued that &ldquo;we have found no evidence of any complaint by or mistreatment of women remanded there.&rdquo; The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, stated he would examine the committee&rsquo;s report with his Cabinet colleagues.</P>
        <P>Although not a Minister at the time, Deputy Shatter stated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 17 December 2009:</P>
        <P LI="1">Does the Taoiseach intend to introduce legislation in the new year to amend the redress board legislation to extend it to those who suffered barbaric cruelty in the Magdalene laundries?  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform now has irrefutable evidence that this State and the courts colluded in sending young women to what were then known as the Magdalene asylums.  They ended up in the Magdalene laundries and were treated appallingly.  Some of them have never recovered from the manner in which they were treated and their lives have been permanently blighted.  Initially in this House the Minister for Education and Science denied that the State had any involvement in this.  There is now absolutely irrefutable evidence as a consequence of court records and files that have been examined in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the State was directly complicit in many women being placed in these totally inappropriate circumstances.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s motto is: &ldquo;Look forward with hope.&rdquo;  As I said before, I hope we can look forward with hope in this regard.  Deputy Shatter now has responsibility as the Minister for Justice and Equality, and it is ironic in this political business that something said by an Oppo<Col N="324"/>sition spokesperson may come back to haunt that Deputy.  I ask the Minister to stand over his words.</P>
        <P>The current Government may argue that its predecessor did not take action but the previous Government made a case to the United Nations Commission and we are now going on those recommendations.  The previous Government did not have such recommendations.</P>
        <P>I received correspondence from Mr. James Smith, associate professor at the English department and the Irish studies programme at Boston College.  He outlined that there were ten of these institutions, including the Sisters of Mercy in Galway and D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the Sisters of Charity in Donnybrook in Dublin and Peacock Lane in Cork, the Good Shepherd Sisters in Waterford, New Ross, Limerick and Sunday&rsquo;s Well in Cork, and the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of Refuge in High Park, Drumcondra, Dublin, and Sean McDermott Street, also called Gloucester Street, Dublin.</P>
        <P>I am a former pupil of the Convent of Mercy and I have nothing but the height of praise for it.  There were many wonderful nuns operating in the system but young girls were also treated appallingly by the State.  Many of these are now dead without having seen justice and many were institutionalised all their lives, with the saddest of stories to report.  I ask that the Government be very fair to those who are left.  It will have the support of every Member in both Houses if it issues an apology to those women, carries out whatever inquiries are necessary and provides compensation that would be of assistance.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is away on European business and could not attend in person.  He has asked me to address the issue on his behalf.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke recently in the D&aacute;il on this important matter.  He asked me to point out that he has long believed the issues raised by or on behalf of those women and girls who were resident in the Magdalene laundries must be addressed.  He has great sympathy for those women who feel wronged and, in common with his Cabinet colleagues, wants to help in bringing closure to this for the individuals concerned.  Members will know that the UN Committee Against Torture issued its concluding observations on Monday, 6 June following Ireland&rsquo;s first examination in Geneva last month under Article 19 of the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  The committee in its statement acknowledged Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to engage in a constructive manner and commended us on significant progress in recent years in a number of areas, including the prevention of domestic violence and human trafficking.  Its concluding observations cover a wide range of areas from prison conditions to the total prohibition of corporal punishment, the Magdalene laundries, the follow up to the Ryan report and the processing of applications for refugee status, all of which impact on the remit of several Departments.</P>
        <P>Specifically on the Magdalene laundries and the topic of this debate, the committee recommended that the State should institute prompt, independent and thorough investigations into all allegations of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that was allegedly committed in the laundries and, in appropriate cases, prosecute and punish the perpetrators with penalties commensurate with the gravity of the offences committed and ensure all victims obtain redress and have an enforceable right to compensation, including the means for rehabilitation.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with his Cabinet colleagues, the Minister has noted and will closely examine the concluding observations and recommendations of the committee.  They deserve our full consideration.  It is the least we can do for these women and the difficulties they experienced from living in the laundries.  The Minister is also taking into account the assessment published <Col N="325"/>by the Irish Human Rights Commission on 9 November 2010 of the request by the Justice for Magdalenes, JFM, group to carry out an inquiry under section 9 of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000 into the treatment of women and girls who resided in Magdalene laundries.  The Irish Human Rights Commission decided not to carry out a statutory inquiry itself, which it is entitled to do under the legislation which established it and which was requested by JFM.  It recommended that a statutory mechanism be established to investigate the matters advanced by JFM and, in appropriate cases, to grant redress where warranted.  It stated that such a mechanism should first examine the State&rsquo;s involvement in and responsibility for those entering laundries, their conditions, their departure and end-of-life issues.  In the event of State involvement or responsibility being established, a larger review should be conducted and redress considered.  This assessment, which was the subject of an Adjournment debate in the D&aacute;il on the same evening, raised issues for a range of Departments as well as the four religious congregations who operated the Magdalene institutions.  The Irish Human Rights Commission did not make a finding as to whether or to what extent there were abuses nor did it make any finding as to who was responsible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality previously met individuals who were resident in the laundries, with interest groups campaigning on their behalf.  The Minister asked me to assure the Senator that they have all been listened to, no one doubts their integrity or commitment and their position is clearly understood and respected.  Any records that are available to the Department have been made available to the groups concerned.  Furthermore, the Minister gives his assurance that his Department will continue to provide whatever assistance it can to individuals and groups seeking access to records, many of which, unfortunately, are poor or incomplete.</P>
        <P>There were many different circumstances that led to women becoming resident in the laundries.  Unfortunately, due to the lapse of time and lack of available records, there are difficulties in establishing the facts of what actually happened and the numbers involved.  We know there were ten Magdalene laundries in this jurisdiction which were privately run by four different religious orders and which predate the foundation of the State.  They were not State institutions and their records are a matter for the individual religious congregations, which of course adds to the difficulty for everyone in establishing a clear picture of what went on and the numbers involved.  It seems, however, that the majority of females who entered or were placed in Magdalene laundries did so by private arrangements and without any direct involvement of the State.  It appears many of them entered due to poverty, family or other circumstances.</P>
        <P>As regards the involvement of the criminal justice system, all of the available evidence at this stage suggests that the number of women who entered such institutions through that system was small and that the periods of remand were for days rather than weeks or months.  The Minister is aware of only one institution, St. Mary&rsquo;s Magdalene Asylum on Se&aacute;n McDermott Street in Dublin, which was approved for use in October 1960 as a remand institution for female persons pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act 1960.  It is worth noting that no complaints have been received from any of these women.</P>
        <P>The Minister believes a comprehensive examination of the facts is now required and, with that in mind, has been preparing proposals for the Government on the question of Magdalene laundries.  I can confirm that his proposals were substantially completed last week and a draft memorandum for Government has been prepared.  The memorandum took into account the report of the Irish Human Rights Commission and has now been amended to take into account the observations of the UN Committee Against Torture which were only published on 6 June.  The memorandum was circulated earlier this week for consideration by his Cabinet colleagues at the next appropriate Government meeting either on 14 June or, if that is not possible, the following week.  Members can be assured that full consideration will be given to the implications of these reports and the Government decision will be communicated in due course.</P><Col N="326"/>
        <P>Once again, I thank the Senator for the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I assure him the Government is sympathetic to these women, understands and respects their position and will do what it can to advance matters and help bring about closure for those involved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter derives from a large-scale campaign organised in County Meath to protect services at Navan hospital, which is greatly valued by people in the county.  In following up promises made by Fine Gael in particular in advance of the general election, the campaign group permitted the Minister for Health a reasonable period to master his brief, but I understand he has not yet issued a response to the four requests that have been made to meet him.  I understand contact was made this morning with a view to organising a meeting between HSE officials and the Save Navan Hospital committee but this was not considered acceptable.  During the last Government it was easy to arrange meetings between local groups and Ministers, who always made themselves available along with their senior civil servants.  The Save Navan Hospital committee and representatives of the community held a useful meeting with the then Minister, Mary Harney, and senior officials from the HSE.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed the Minister for Health is not here because I saw him earlier in the House.  I am sure he is busy, however, and I hope the Minister for Education and Skills will arrange on his behalf for the local community to meet him in regard to the restoration of elective surgery, which was promised by Fine Gael before the election.  Fine Gael also pledged that the new regional hospital for the north east would be constructed in Navan within the first five years of that party being in power.  That was one of many election promises which were made on health matters.  I referred earlier to the inappropriateness of making promises that cannot be kept, particularly in respect of sick and vulnerable people.  I ask the Government to keep the promises it made or else to explain why they will not be kept.  One explanation we will not accept is that circumstances are worse than the Government thought they would be.  The people know what money is available and tax receipts are above target currently.  None of those excuses will wash.  We want straightforward answers.  Communities in County Meath seek a meeting with the Minister and look to the Government to commit to implementing the promises it made.  The Government should be held to account on this because it made promises subsequent to the EU-IMF arrangements and in full knowledge of the state of the public finances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, and I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.</P>
	<P Just="Left">Navan hospital continues to function as an acute general hospital.  It provides inpatient services such as general acute medical and elective orthopaedic, including complex joint replacement surgery and it has an intensive care, cardiac care and high dependency units.  Day services include medical and surgical, elective endoscopy and elective orthopaedic.  The hospital has a 24 hour accident and emergency department, a 12 hour medical assessment unit and an outpatient department incorporating orthopaedic, gynaecology, ophthalmology and paediatric clinics.  Other services include day medical cardiology, day diabetic, radiology, laboratory, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy services.</P>
        <P>Navan hospital is an integral part of the Louth-Meath hospital group and the Minister is determined that it will continue to play an important role in the delivery of clinical services in the Louth-Meath area and to patients in other parts of the north east.  To fully consider the <Col N="327"/>issues involved, the Minister will take account of the current organisation of acute services in the region and the important clinical programmes being developed by the HSE.  He acknowledges the need for communication with the local community at this time and understands that, if required, HSE staff will be available to meet community representatives, as he will himself, should that prove necessary.</P>
        <P>The Minister is committed to ensuring acute hospital services at national, regional and local level are provided in a clinically appropriate and efficient manner.  In particular, he wants to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely in smaller, local hospitals.  There is need to ensure the most appropriate organisation of acute services in each region.  The Minister believes that the clinical programmes being developed by the HSE are vital in this regard.  These inter-related programmes aim to improve service quality, effectiveness and patient access and to ensure patient care is provided in the service setting most appropriate to individual needs.</P>
        <P>The Minister has made it clear that he expects to be briefed by the HSE on proposals to withdraw services from individual hospitals.  He has also made it clear that patient safety must be the overriding priority.  He wants patients to be treated at the lowest level of complexity that is as safe, timely, efficient and as near to home as possible.  These factors will inform future decisions on the provision of acute hospital services.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister but I am disappointed that the Minister for Health has not committed to meeting the people of County Meath.  This is the sixth time he has been asked.  He has in the past committed to doing so but he has not made a commitment in this reply.  While I regarded Ms Mary Harney as an excellent Minister for Health and Children, she could not have put this better herself.  This reply is exactly what she would have said to the House.  There have been no changes and the current policy will continue.  All of the pre-election pledges have been discarded in the dustbin.  This is not acceptable.</P>

        <P>I am sure the Minister had warm ears earlier when he was in the House during the debate on the Irish language strategy and the important role he has to play in that regard.  I appreciate him taking the time to take this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to raise the need for the Minister to clarify the Government&rsquo;s intention on the future of two-teacher schools and their importance for maintaining a vibrant rural community.  There are 570 two-teacher schools, which comprises one in six of the State&rsquo;s primary schools.  The McCarthy report proposed to merge schools with fewer than 100 pupils but, as we have witnessed, while many of his recommendations made sense on paper, they had no logical place in the real world.  The recommendation regarding rural schools did not make sense.  Amalgamation will only achieve a mere 0.47% of McCarthy&rsquo;s suggested savings but at what price to communities?</P>
        <P>The closure of schools tears the heart out of rural communities, as well as being detrimental to the quality of learning children receive.  Research does not support many of the arguments <Col N="328"/>on which policies of closure and amalgamation of small schools have been based and which form the basis of concerns about small schools being expressed currently.  Study findings in the UK have shown that curriculum provision in small schools is similar to that which emerged in studies of large schools.  Small schools have also been shown to make a positive contribution to their communities.  Studies in the UK have shown that any savings made in closing a school can be offset by the cost in transporting students to larger schools and similar costs.</P>
        <P>One of the reasons I have raised this issue is that I am based in the west and the proposals will hit that region, in particular.  For example, 68 schools are under review in County Galway; 68 in County Mayo; 41 in County Roscommon; 20 in County Sligo; 41 in County Clare; and 60 in County Donegal.  While this is an education issue, it is also a rural issue.  Successive Governments have long neglected the west, as evidenced by the standards of our sewerage and water systems, our electricity infrastructure and the broadband service.  The closure of rural schools will sustain this neglect.  We experienced devastation following the closure of post offices.  We need to protect small rural communities and retaining schools is essential in this regard.</P>
        <P>Closing small national schools will also lead to increased class sizes, additional transport costs and a breakdown in community cohesion.  Small schools  are a central part of life in rural Ireland.  Co-operation between schools as clusters can save money and can make the most of their resources without damaging the community.  According to the Irish Primary Principals Network report on the future of small schools, such an approach has been successful in Sweden, Catalonia and France.  I recommend that the Minister takes this report on board, as it highlights the value placed on these schools by their respective governments and that it often makes more sense to preserve such schools and their role in the community than to close them for short-term and illusory savings.</P>
        <P>According to the report, teachers, students and communities would all prefer the <i>status quo</i>.  Why would we change it and potentially do lasting damage to communities, many of which are under enough pressure as it is due to emigration and unemployment for the sake of tiny savings, which would be defrayed by transport and other costs anyway?</P>
        <P>My experience of this issue results from the decisions made by previous Ministers for Education and ludicrous proposals under schemes such as DEIS where schools miles apart were clustered in groups that did not make any sense.  Most of the resource teachers allocated under those schemes spent half their time in their cars travelling around the countryside.  It is a different scenario in rural Ireland.  I seek clarification on the Minister&rsquo;s current thinking on this issue.  Will he take on board the rural nature of the issue?</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising the matter, as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position regarding the value for money review of small primary schools, which is part of the normal review processes undertaken by all Departments on an annual basis on selected areas of expenditure and which is being conducted in line with the standard procedures for such reviews.  These procedures require that the views of stakeholders be obtained.  The interest groups contacted included the school patron bodies, management bodies, teacher unions, national parents&rsquo; council, Irish language groups and other groups who operate in the area of social inclusion.  A public consultation process was also put in place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The review will attempt to explore the general policy options for the reorganisation of small schools, including the sharing of resources and clustering arrangements towards small schools.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="329"/>
        <P>It is important to clarify that this study is part of an overall requirement across all Departments to have a rolling programme of such studies.</P>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, this review was initiated last October by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government and is not driven by any ideology.  The study is simply about ascertaining the facts to inform future policy.  It does not mean that any policy decision has been taken at this point or that any particular outcome is sought.  Given that the Government has recently announced a comprehensive review of expenditure, all Government expenditure and programmes will come under similar scrutiny.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference acknowledge the important role primary schools play in their local communities.  In considering any policy change on small schools, I am conscious that there is a wider dimension to be considered in addition to the cost of maintaining small schools.  The review will examine the location of small schools relative to each other and to other schools of a similar type.  It will also examine the costs of running small schools and the educational outcomes associated with small schools.</P>
        <P>Educational quality for the students must be one of the main criteria in any consideration of primary school size.  We must also consider the needs of local communities and wider social and cultural factors.  The review is expected to be completed by the end of the year and a report should be available to me then at which stage I will consider the outcomes and proposals of the review.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the statements and comments I made previously and the fact that I represent an urban constituency, I am very well aware that on a separate study, which evaluated the educational outcomes between large schools and small schools in the primary sector, the educational outcomes were effectively the same.  There was little or no difference that would warrant any kind of response.  Without prejudice to whatever decision is finally made, rather than have Marlborough Street sending down a directive to local communities in which the schools are located, whatever the conclusions of the study and the implications they suggest, my instinct is to invite communities such as that represented by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and to outline the position to them and ask how they wish to respond and what they think is the best way to proceed.  Together, we must ensure we do not throw out the good with the costly.</P>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer.  I agree with him completely.  We would welcome that engagement.  It is very important that we would engage.  The Department in the past has taken a very different approach and given directives on how things would be.</P>
        <P>I seek further clarification on the wider dimension such as the language ethos of a school, for example, where there might be some schools in the Gaeltacht and others outside it.  Will that be taken into consideration when clustering schools?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">For my part &mdash; this is without prejudice to the report and whatever recommendations it may make &mdash; I feel different schools will have a different ethos.  For example, it was brought to my attention when I attended the primary schools conference in Sligo that for the Reformed Church community in that part of the country small rural schools a far distance apart are very important to the maintenance of their Protestant ethos.  We would respect that.  Likewise, if one has a gaelscoil or a school in a Gaeltacht area, then one would have to take that into account also.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We will try to be as accommodating as possible, but as I indicated yesterday evening in a debate, this country has lost its economic sovereignty.  This republic is no longer in control of its cheque book.  Everyone who works in this institution, every Deputy and every teacher in every school is now dependent on Professor Patrick Honohan the Governor of the Central <Col N="330"/>Bank reporting on a fortnightly basis to the European Central Bank, which is the only bank that will lend us money at anything like reasonable rates, that we are meeting our targets and reducing the deficit between what we are generating by way of tax income, on the one hand, and what we are spending, on the other.  That gap is enormous.  I will indicate the scale of the gap.  The budget of the entire Department of Education and Skills, including salaries and everything else, is &euro;8 billion in round figures.  If we were to eliminate that, which I do not suggest for a moment that we would, we would still have a deficit of &euro;1 billion.</P>
        <P>We must regain our economic sovereignty as quickly as possible.  Across the entire spectrum of expenditure we must look at everything from the point of view that we are spending money that we are not earning and the people who are lending us that money will only lend it on a continued basis until such time, in as short a time as possible, as we get our budget deficit down to 3%.  That is the background that confronts every Minister and every Department.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  What is the timeframe for the review on which the Minister is engaged?  He proposes to engage with communities on a bottom-up approach.  What structure does he propose to put in place to bring formality to it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The timeframe is approximately 12 months.  The process was initiated last October and there was a large number of responses from various groups which I outlined. They will be evaluated by the group conducting the value for money review.  The mechanism for value for money reports is the same regardless of the area of expenditure.  The review was not designed specifically for rural schools with a population of 50 pupils or less.  When I get the report I will consult informally with colleagues and decide on the best mechanism for consultation.</P>
        <P>I am acutely aware of the sensitivity of the school in a rural community and how central it is to the network of communications that keeps such communities together.  As an urban Deputy I must be acutely aware of the situation because I do not live in the same type of place as the two Senators who have spoken.  Many people do and will continue to live there.  They have lost supports in other areas.  I will consult colleagues in the Labour Party, Fine Gael and the Opposition to see how we can proceed.  Whatever the outcome, we need to get community support for whatever decision will be taken.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
