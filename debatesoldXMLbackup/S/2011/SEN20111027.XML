	<P>I have received notice from Senator Paul Bradford that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Health to ensure the income guidelines on the medical card eligibility of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease sufferers allow an appropriate allowance for home care costs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mark Daly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social Protection to clarify the excessive six-month processing time for redundancy payments and the steps being taken to reduce this waiting time.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Averil Power of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to rule out the closure or downsizing of the Garda stations serving the Dublin North-East constituency.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is proposed to take No. 1, statements, questions and answers on health, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 1.45 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed seven minutes, following which questions will be taken from the floor.  The group spokespersons will ask most of the questions which were submitted.  The Minister will then respond, after which the other questions tabled by Senators will be asked.  I do not think an opportunity will arise for Senators to ask questions not tabled and submitted in advance but we will see how it goes.</P>

	<P>I give a guarded welcome to the moves towards a resolution in the EU with the decision and agreement yesterday to deal with the Greek situation.  Yesterday evening, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Creighton, confirmed the issue of debt write-down and burden sharing for Ireland was not even on the agenda.  What is the Government&rsquo;s position on this?  The Government is supposed to set the agenda on <Col N="118"/>behalf of the Irish people.  When the Irish people see the Greeks securing a write-down of50%, at the very least the Government should be in discussions with its European partners with regard to the Irish situation.</P>

	<P>Watch this space.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I will.</P>
        <P>I remind the Members opposite that a senior Minister of the current Government stated not one red cent more would go into the banks until burden sharing was on the agenda.  Will the Leader clarify whether the Taoiseach or the Irish delegation raised any matters yesterday relating to burden sharing and writing down of Irish sovereign debt, in particular the banking debt?</P>
        <P>My next question relates to another pre-election promise made by Fine Gael which was that there would be no reduction in the number of special needs assistants.  Earlier this year, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, stated 475 special needs assistant posts would be withheld.  This was a unilateral decision and it was not written into any agreement.  Of the 475 posts which the Minister held back until later in the year while the needs of pupils with special needs were being assessed, how many have been allocated?  I would like a specific answer to this and if I cannot receive one the Minister of the Education and Skills should come before the House to answer the question.  The Government promised no cuts to the number of special needs assistants but cuts of approximately 10% have been made.  The unilateral decision was then taken to hold back 475 posts and I want to know how many of these have been filled.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>How many of the posts have been filled?  Does the Minister intend to hold back further special needs assistant posts next year?</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>To hear Senator O&rsquo;Brien speak about his new-found concern for the number of special needs assistants when it was Fianna F&aacute;il which introduced the cap on special needs assistants last year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>If we are to hold a debate with the Minister, these facts must be taken into account.  The first fact is that Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the cap and the second is that the Minister held back a number of posts because that is good planning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to arrange a debate early in November on the implications for the economy of last night&rsquo;s summit meeting at EU level.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien was correct to raise the question of the implications for the economy of the write-down of Greek debt but he is premature to suggest it should have been addressed last night.  The critical issue last night was the horrifying spectre of Greece and achieving a write-down of Greek debt.  We should welcome the resolution of that problem.  We can now consider the implications of the write-down for Ireland.  To hear the Senator lecture the Government on what it should do to write down debt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We should welcome that European leaders have come to an agreement on the Greek issue and we must look forward to the implications of this deal for the economy.  I encourage the Government in all it is doing at that level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is welcome that we are holding a debate on health issues today.  It is important that as many Senators as possible contribute to the debate and put the questions we all have to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  I hope Senators and the Minister can keep their contri<Col N="120"/>butions tight in order that Senators from both sides of the House can ask as many questions as possible.  A key question which I am sure the Minister will answer concerns the steps being taken to end the two tier health system and introduce universal health insurance, as promised in the programme for Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We should welcome the deal emerging from Brussels as good news.  Too often in the past, the light at the end of the tunnel turned out to be an oncoming train but on this occasion we can say that our prospects are looking up.  I thank all who contributed to yesterday&rsquo;s debate on the motion on gendercide.  In particular, I pay tribute to several Government speakers.</P>

	<P>I am about to ask the Leader a question because there was disquiet about the inadequacy of the Government&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>There were very few votes against it.</P>

	<P>The House accepted the amendment.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader facilitate Senator Healy Eames and me?  Senator Healy Eames expressed the wish that we could agree a better motion on a cross-party basis.  Time could be provided for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The House made a decision yesterday.  We are not reopening the case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am entitled to ask the Leader to allocate time for a debate on a better worded motion that could attract agreement from all sides.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for seeking to ensure fair play while the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, was responding to certain comments that I made in this House.  I assure Senators that I do not mind if the Minister makes comments in my absence because what goes around comes around.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senators Henry and Bradford and I contributed to breaking a world record in Trinity College Dublin on the rewrite a story campaign for mental health.  It is worth noting that 1,000 people rewrote the story.</P>
        <P>It is important that we grapple with the issue of special needs assistants, which was raised by an Opposition spokesperson.  The question about the precise number was answered in the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education.  As a former teacher and teacher educator who observed special needs assistants as they worked with teachers and children, I consider it right and proper that we have forward planning rather than allocate all the assistant posts without accounting for future needs.  I ask the Leader to facilitate a solid, wholesome and holistic debate on children with special educational needs.  We do a disservice to our children by focusing solely on special needs assistants.  We must ask what is best for the child.  The education of the parent is a key piece of the puzzle.  The parent cares for the child 18 hours per day and 24 hours per day at weekends.  The teacher&rsquo;s job is to educate and the special needs assistant&rsquo;s role is to care for the child, but they are only a tiny part of the jigsaw.  I ask Senators to refrain from playing politics with children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>Last night&rsquo;s eurozone deal on Greece is highly significant for Ireland.  It would be foolish if we did not grasp this moment to further negotiate the terms on offer to us.  The people who offered the deal know we would be foolish not to capitalise on it.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have our best interests at heart.  We do not want to go down the road of Greece because nobody will do business with that country.  This is an important space for Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy Shatter, has indicated in the other House that some Army barracks will be closed imminently.  Senators will be aware that the closure of <Col N="123"/>rural Garda stations is on the agenda.  I understand it has already been decided that stations where just one member is serving will be closed.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Minister and the Garda authorities are considering the closure of other rural Garda stations on the basis of what is called operational activity.  I ask the Leader to attempt to establish or clarify the exact position.  Perhaps that can be done the next time the Minister for Justice and Equality comes to the House.  Senator Leyden spoke yesterday in the context of the imminent closure of Boyle courthouse.  The wholesale closure of services across rural Ireland will have a devastating effect on local economies.  The distances between the remaining Garda stations in which members will be located will be so large that it will be almost impossible for the Garda authorities to properly monitor areas of wide dispersal, like my own county of Leitrim, and ensure people are safe in their own houses.  It is a very real concern.</P>
        <P>Does the Leader know whether the party Whips in both Houses ever meet representatives of the news and current affairs department of RTE to discuss the coverage of Oireachtas proceedings?  Perhaps he can get back to the House with an answer to that question.  I am sure all of us will agree that we owe a debt of gratitude to RTE for the manner in which it carries out its work.  In fairness to RTE, &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; reflects the work of both Houses.  The absence of any coverage of the Seanad in the printed media, with the honourable exception of <i>The Irish Times</i>, reflects badly on this House.  I do not wish to go into the questions that have arisen about balance, fairness and objectivity.  I understand that traditionally, the party Whips met RTE officials on a regular basis to ensure both sides were <i>ad idem</i> in terms of how the coverage was carried out.  Perhaps the Leader might comment on that or inquire into it.  If there have not been any meetings, does he agree that such meetings should take place?  Perhaps a regular schedule of meetings could be set up between the RTE authorities and the Whips of the parties in this House and the other House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, will come to the House in an hour&rsquo;s time.  We have been calling on him to do so for months.  Each of us has raised specific health matters on the Order of Business.  We have always been given a reply to the effect that the Minister will eventually come to the House to answer such questions.  In the interests of fairness and to facilitate good contributions, I ask the Leader to give each Senator at least two minutes to ask questions.  Most of the 60 Senators will have to wait for the spokespersons and the Cathaoirleach to speak.  It would be a question of extending the sitting time of the House today by one hour, at the very most.  The Minister will also have made a contribution.  I ask the Leader to extend the amount of time allowed for questions to at least two minutes per Senator.</P>

	<P>When I was starting in business, my father told me that when one is in business, one&rsquo;s good name is much more important to one than almost anything else.  He mentioned the effect of not paying one&rsquo;s debts.  The deal that was made in Brussels during the early hours of this morning seems to suggest that Greece will not pay its debts.  Some people are saying we should be treated similarly.  The steps taken by the Taoiseach and the Minister yesterday are very important.  I support them entirely.  We have a good name.  We have established a good name.  We could say it was not our fault, but that of the banks, that we ran short of money.  However, we need to make sure we maintain our good name.</P>

	<P>It will not be easy.  I was in Greece a couple of weeks ago.  There was no doubt that a lack of belief in themselves was contributing to what was happening in Greece.  We must make sure that does not happen with us.  It is important that we have established a name for ourselves by the time we go back in 18 months&rsquo; time or whenever we need to borrow again.  I congratulate those who have refused to say we should not pay our debts, <Col N="124"/>who have not argued it is the fault of the banks or somebody else rather than our own fault, and who have not said the Germans should not have loaned moneys at such low rates.  I hope what I am saying will strengthen the resolve of those who say that we made a deal and we should stick to it.</P>
        
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I would like to make another reference to my family.  I have a 20 year old granddaughter who was born in and lives in France.  She is spending this year in China because she wants to be a diplomat in the French foreign service.  This is not something we do in Ireland.  We send our diplomats to China, Japan or Korea for three or four years when they are in their 40s or 50s.  They never really know the language.  They never really get to the kernel of it.  What they do in France is different.  They get people who are prepared to live in, and steep themselves in the culture and language of, those countries.  I suggest we should consider doing the same.  I ask the Leader to draw the attention of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade to what happens elsewhere.  We should encourage a cadre of young people in their early 20s to join our diplomatic service.  We should say we want them to live in countries like China, Japan or Korea in the knowledge that they will become diplomats in the future and be appointed as ambassadors when they are in their 40s and 50s.  It is something we should consider.  We are not looking far enough ahead to where we are going.  We are not realising that new developments are taking place in the Far East.  I do not believe we have done nearly enough to ensure our future is secure there.</P>

	<P>It has been brought to my attention that when NAMA was established, Members of the Oireachtas were restricted from engaging with it.  I understand the legislation was tweaked thereafter.  I am looking for an open and transparent debate on the workings of NAMA.  I have been told that a director of NAMA also acts professionally as a receiver and that a client of his recently took possession of a NAMA property through the tender process at very favourable terms.

I thought that as a country, we had moved away from shady deals of this nature.  I would like an open and transparent debate.  Perhaps the Leader could arrange for senior officials from NAMA to come to Leinster House 2000 for a question and answer session, if that is possible.</P>
        <P>I have been working on the issue of rates for some time.  I have been in contact with officials in the Valuation Office, which is reviewing all rates but unfortunately does not have the manpower it needs.  There has been a 30% reduction in certain categories of rates in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, where such a review has been carried out.  The only problem with the Valuation Office&rsquo;s review of rates is that it will take about ten years for the office to do the whole country.  I suggest that local authorities be allowed to assist the Valuation Office in the review of rates, if at all possible.  Local knowledge is of paramount importance when rates are being reviewed.  As I have said, rates for some businesses in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown have decreased by 30%.  Rates are calculated on the basis of floor area, plus the best achievable rent.  As we all know, rents have dropped by half.  We need to share some of the burden because the Valuation Office does not have sufficient staff.  If local authorities could be engaged to do the Valuation Office review, the mess that is our system of rates could be sorted out in a short amount of time.</P>

We should discuss whether this House can be instrumental in making such a change, as well as the sort of reforms we wanted to bring about and that we all talked about before the election.

As with the Keane report, Government Senators and Deputies are rushing out to welcome this without actually reading the document.  It may in fact be welcome and might require a constitutional referendum that we may support, but we do not know yet and will have to examine its implications.  I would encourage the general public to read the document and to assist that process we should have a full debate here.  There is a significant lessening of the Government&rsquo;s position on corporation tax in the document.  There is also a massive budgetary oversight in this document, which has been agreed by the Government this morning, whereby we will have to stick to what the Commission tells us to do in our budget.  We will have to stick to independent growth forecasts and, in addition, we will not be able to do what the Minister for Finance did last week in rejecting what the fiscal council or the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, said.</P>
        <P>We may have to hold a constitutional referendum on a balanced budget amendment to ensure that we cannot constitutionally go below the European targets.  If a balanced budget amendment had been made to the Constitution in 2008, we would have had to slash social welfare rates by about 40%.

Without having read the document, they are welcoming terms and conditions &mdash; that are being given to other European countries that have to do what we did last year &mdash; which are better than those we had last year.  There is no talk in the document about whether we will benefit from a reimbursement of moneys or a reduction in terms and conditions.</P>

As I told the German ambassador, when he was in the Oireachtas during the summer, and to his colleague from the Bundestag, there is no chance that a referendum will be passed in Ireland.  It is as simple as this: if the Greeks get a write-down on favourable terms and we do not get the same deal, we will have to acknowledge a direct link between our continuing to pay back money in a manner no longer required of the Greeks and the closure of Garda stations and the withdrawal of special needs assistants.  When that is put to the people, as it should be, they will reject the referendum on the basis that Ireland has less favourable terms than other European states.  Nice words from Ms Angela Merkel and others are not simply enough.  Very limited comments this morning indicated that the markets welcome the development.  The thinking behind the referendum is based on the creation of a more centralised Union, basically a united states of Europe.  The constitution that the Union tried to pass was shot down by the Dutch and will not be passed by the people under duress.</P>

	<P>I did not read the document in the middle of the night and do not proclaim to be an expert on NAMA or any matter relating to negotiations.  However, I read a document last night containing very good news.  I want the Minister for Finance to come to his House to explain its detail.  I refer to Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s selling of assets worth &euro;3 billion in America in recent weeks.  The result is that the Government will now definitely not pay the bank &euro;700 million next week.  I would like the Minister to explain the positive ramifications of the sale.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Government for the efforts it has made since entering office on renegotiating with the banks the terms of the loan.  The news to which I refer is a consequence of the negotiations, which have been ongoing since April.  The taxpayer will save &euro;700 million because of the work of the Government on negotiating with the Irish banking organisations.  I welcome the news and hope the Minister can come to the House next week, not only to discuss the negotiations that occurred during the night but the ramifications of the aforementioned good news for the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some days ago, a number of Senators raised the failure of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to sign the commencement order for the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, which was passed earlier in the year.  There was a very good contribution by Senator Power in this regard on the greyhound legislation.  A programme on TV3 on Tuesday night highlighted puppy farming malpractices in the State.  It was horrific to watch it.  I am sure all Members have been e-mailed today and yesterday by various organisations that support the implementation of the legislation.  I checked the status of the commencement order yesterday with the Department.  The answer I got, which I found very difficult to accept, was that it was not signed because the Government is waiting for the Welfare of Greyounds Bill 2011 to pass. There is no link between the two and, therefore, no reason the Minister has not signed the commencement order of the Dog Breeding Establishments Act.  I call on him, through the Leader, to sign it forthwith and allow the legislation to be implemented to address the horrific carry-on in puppy farms throughout the country.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome today&rsquo;s debate on the health service and thank the Leader for organising it.  I am slightly regretful over the time allocations in that an allowance of seven minutes is a little short.  In important financial debates over recent years, spokespersons have had up to 20 minutes.  Given that this is to be the first occasion on which the Minister of Health will be present for a general debate on health, it may have been more appropriate to allocate a little more time.</P>
        <P>I join others in calling for an early debate in the context of the economic decisions taken in Brussels during the night.  It is to be welcomed that the member states are acting together but I have concerns nevertheless.  This is not just a matter I am raising today.  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was present, concern was expressed that a sweeter deal would be done for Greece than was done for us.  I predicted this and it is a very real issue.  We all welcome the fact that the Union may be a step closer to a solution to the crisis, but, having been clubbed over how we would capitalise our banks and over capital ratios and how shareholder value was effectively wiped out in our affected institutions, we must note that there will not be similar consequences for institutions in mainland Europe.  As the crisis continues to worsen and the short sellers of the world realise they are to lose regardless of the outcome, the established nations will have pushed for a deal to facilitate what is effectively a 50% write-down of state income.</P><Col N="131"/>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s point, of course we want to pay our bills but it is vital that the Government not lie down.  I have every confidence in the Government in terms of determining a solution that is best for the people.  For me, the book is open again.  It is open for Greece and may have to be opened for Italy and others.  The terms and conditions that apply to the process for Greece are not as draconian as those applied to Ireland.  It is paramount, therefore, that the Government dig in on this.  While we welcome the agreement made during the night, the Government should dig in.  At the next meeting, Ireland&rsquo;s deal needs to be on the agenda.  We need to secure concessions for the Irish, who have been guinea pigs as the European masters worked their way through the process to determine what works.  Now that those masters have defined the process that will work, they need to reconsider some of the draconian measures enforced in Ireland.  It is imperative that this be done to be fair to the people of Ireland.  I will make a point on inequality in the next debate.  Let absolute equality exist among the nations and citizens of Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to take stock of what occurred in Greece, consider our position and, as my colleague said, wait for the Taoiseach to come home and not be alarmist or have knee-jerk reactions.  I pay tribute to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, on their hard work.  They must be absolutely exhausted.</P>
        <P>I was shocked to learn yesterday that there is no continuing professional development in education. This is not the case in my profession, the legal profession.  While there is ongoing training in the education sector, it is not compulsory.  This says a good deal about how the education system in this country functions.  To me, it makes no sense that it is not compulsory.  I call on the Leader to schedule a debate on the education system at some stage.  We discussed so many issues at a group yesterday which I had not been aware of but one cannot be aware of everything.  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister, Deputy Quinn, to the House soon to discuss it.</P>
        <P>I refer to Senator Mooney&rsquo;s point about RTE.  We should have Noel Curran in here.  It is about time RTE started showing politics as it is, objectively and at an hour that suits people who are sane.  Unless one is a night owl or a lunatic, as we all are, one cannot know what is going on here.  We hear comments such as, &ldquo;The Chamber was empty.&rdquo; and &ldquo;What are they at?&rdquo;  If one sat in the Chamber all day long one would get nothing done.  That is the reality and it is about time the people realised it.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I will ask Senator Noone to pass on the matriculation details for that foreign college of physiotherapy and will have a chat with my daughters about it.  I echo the Senator's remarks.  We had no concert on the matter but I intended to bring up the issue of the necessity for a debate on a particular aspect of the education system which concerns me.  We need fundamental, core curricular reform and a core reform of the philosophy of what we aim to teach our students and of what they should have learned at the end of a secondary or high school education.  At present because of the necessity of pointsmanship, as it were, on the one hand, and of getting subsistence grades to pass, on the other, we are somehow missing the point of the skills which people should have not only to function as citizens or potential members of the workforce, but also as people who understand the environment in which, one hopes, they will live long lives.</P>
        <P>It is critical to try to bring in a mandatory requirement that everyone up to school leaving age, which should be 18 years of age, would have to learn science, in addition to learning the English language and mathematics.  I do not suggest everyone should have to do chemistry, physics and biology to the high matriculation levels in place now.  However, consideration should be given to the introduction of a consolidated broader science curriculum that people who do not intend to specialise in science would complete.  People should be able to understand the big issues of the next century such as ecology, energy policy, population policy and health policy.  People should be able to understand, interpret and perhaps have some informed judgment about the various health opinions that they will hear expressed by mainstream and <Col N="133"/>other health practitioners.  It is important that people have some rudimentary understanding of the realities of biology and the laws of nature.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It should be mandatory for everyone to study a contemporary modern foreign language in addition to English.  I do not intend to get involved in the polemics of the debate about the Irish language.  I left school well skilled in written and spoken Irish, about which I am glad, but I am sad to say that I did not leave with a good proficiency in French other than to exam level.  This requirement should be at the core of our educational curriculum.  In this modern internationalised world in which we live and in which we are so heavily interdependent educationally, financially, fiscally and in terms of the workforce, no one should leave our schools without a decent working knowledge of another contemporary foreign language.  I call on the Leader to bring these points to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills or to invite him to the House to allow us to take part in deliberations on the question of the curriculum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to comment on the important matters raised by Senators Quinn and Crown.  We are not doing enough in the area of education.  With regard to the diplomatic service, last year I had the privilege of being in Georgia in eastern Europe for the local elections.  I was joined by a member of the diplomatic corps, a young girl from Dublin based in Bulgaria.  She was fluent in Russian because she studied in Russia for two years before joining the diplomatic corps.  Another person with whom I worked in Brussels went on to learn Arabic and ended up working for the European Commission and now that person is in charge of all EU projects in Iraq.  In fairness to young Irish people, they are taking on the challenge.  They are studying languages and, as a result, do a great job in marketing Ireland abroad.</P>
        <P>Similarly, there are many young people going to, working and studying in China.  When I was Lord Mayor of Cork we started a joint programme between UCC and two universities in Shanghai.  Now there is an exchange programme under way whereby students from UCC go out to Shanghai for 12 months and some stay on working for a period subsequently.  I take on board the point the Senator made.</P>
        <P>Having been in Georgia for the local elections brought home to me the importance of the democratic system.  Although we criticise it sometimes, there are many good things in this country which, sometimes, we do not appreciate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to raise a matter related to VHI.  I know the Minister for Health is coming to the House today but there has been a breach of competition rules in respect of VHI.  A new hospital has opened in Cork with 75 beds which cost more than &euro;75 million.  It has four operating theatres, MRI scanners and new equipment lying idle because VHI will not agree to give cover to patients who would go there.  The Mater Private Hospital has agreed to take up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have a question for the Leader.  I will write to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children to ask it to bring in VHI and I call on the Leader of the House to support this move.  The agency is in breach of the Competition Authority rules because of they way it is dealing with the matter.  The matter should be discussed and dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the request to have a debate on what was agreed in Brussels last night at the earliest possible stage.  In so far as I am aware of the outcome I welcome the progress made.  However, we must acknowledge there remains a long road to travel.  I agree with Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s comments on the Greek debt situation.  The cry of some people is that Ireland should default.  I concede that cry is not coming from within this House but let us ask ourselves about the cost of the so-called easy option of default by Greece.  As we speak, <Col N="134"/>tens of thousands of Greek civil servants have been sacked, Greek social welfare rates have been cut by 50% and the Greek economy is crumbling.  This is the price they are paying for default and it is a price we have no wish or cannot afford to pay, politically, socially or economically.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Progress is being made and it is no harm to reflect on where the country was at this time 12 months ago.  At the time, the Government was not split in two, it was split in about four parts.  The Taoiseach was about to resign and there was internal combustion within both Government parties.  Banks were collapsing and the economy was falling down all around us and there was almost a state of economic fear among the people.  We have made solid progress in the past 12 months, but there is still a long way to go.  It is important that we debate the Brussels deal with a view to considering where we go from here.  I hope the Leader will facilitate such a debate in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames requested that we come together to agree an all-party motion on the issue discussed during Private Members&rsquo; time last night.  I note with satisfaction that there is an all-party motion, non-Government motion No. 6 on the Order Paper, on a difficult situation in Iran.  Similarly, we should be able to reach all-party consensus arising from last night&rsquo;s discussion on gendercide.  It is fair to say the Government amendment was carried strongly.  However, it is also fair to say, as anybody who participated in or observed last night&rsquo;s debate would agree, that there would have been equal support for the original motion.  I call for a discussion among the party Whips to devise an agreed all-party wording arising from last night&rsquo;s debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Paul Bradford&rsquo;s call for a debate on last night&rsquo;s developments in Brussels.  I am sure we all welcome these developments.  I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, on their contribution to a resolution of the Greek problem.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to note that a proposal raised yesterday in the House by Senator Feargal Quinn in regard to the extension of daylight hours was supported at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality by the Chairman, Deputy David Stanton, and the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter.  It would be appropriate to commence debate in this House on the desirability of accepting that proposal.  This issue is generally raised just as the time change is about to take place.  I ask the Leader to organise a timely debate on the matter, perhaps in the new year.</P>
        <P>An individual has been protesting outside Leinster House since last July.  He is there almost every day looking to engage with any Member who will speak to him.  This person is making outrageous allegations against the Garda, the Judiciary, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Courts Service.  It projects a poor image of the Oireachtas.  Will the Leader explore the possibility with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, of carrying out a preliminary investigation to ascertain whether there is any basis to this individual&rsquo;s allegations?  If there is not, he should not be allowed to position himself permanently outside Leinster House making these allegations.  On the other hand, if there is any substance to his claims, it is a different matter.  It would be appropriate for the Minister to examine the issue in the interests of fairness to the individual concerned who enjoys some support and the bodies and persons about whom he is complaining.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the calls to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House for a debate on the education system.  Will the Leader ensure the issue of multiple intelligences is to the fore of the agenda for that debate?  I have heard calls in the House for <Col N="135"/>compulsion in respect of science, mathematics, foreign languages and other subjects.  The theory of multiple intelligences, on which my master&rsquo;s degree is based, recognises eight intelligences in children and adults.  Unfortunately, we are not to the fore in this country in ensuring the education system caters for all intelligences.  In Germany, for example, much greater heed is taken of the various intelligences.  Each intelligence, be it science, the arts, languages or anything else, is as important as any other.  Likewise, the left and right sides of the brain are equally important.  Some place a greater value on the mathematical side of the brain because of the needs of the economy.  However, we must also acknowledge the social side which recognises the person and places a duty on the Government to everybody on earth.  I ask the Leader to ensure these principles inform the debate.  The theory of multiple intelligences should be recognised in the education system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, among others, referred to yesterday&rsquo;s events in Brussels.  The developments have been generally welcomed, but we need time to digest everything in the agreed programme.  As some have observed, working the deal does not mean passively submitting to it; rather, it means attempting to make the deal serve us in a better way in negotiating on issues.  However, the deal is working for Ireland.  The economy has begun to grow, the public finances have stabilised and the budget deficit is starting to decline.  Investors&rsquo; confidence in our ability to tackle successfully our economic and budgetary problems has greatly improved in recent months, as everybody can see.  It must be acknowledged that we have secured better terms under the deal.  As Senator Feargal Quinn observed, our good name is of paramount importance.  Renegotiating the deal would be enormously costly and disruptive.  The alternative to working it is to repudiate it, which means walking away from a set of international commitments solemnly entered into by the Government.  Ireland is certainly not Greece.  The Government will continue in a meaningful way to secure the best possible deal for the country.  I will arrange a debate on the matter as soon as possible, once Members have had a chance to digest the contents of the report.</P>
        <P>In regard to today&rsquo;s debate on health, 36 questions have been tabled to the Minister for Health who has given an undertaking that if he does not have time to answer all of them, he will provide written replies.  However, I am confident he will be able to deal with all of the issues raised.  I am criticised, on the one hand, for not allocating enough time for spokespersons, while the argument, on the other, is that seven minutes is too much and that a smaller allocation for spokespersons would allow other Members an opportunity to contribute.  I am sure spokespersons will ask the questions tabled by them and their colleagues, after which there will be an opportunity for other issues to be raised.  The Minister has pressing engagements in the remainder of the day and must depart at 1.45 p.m.  As such, extending the time allowed for the debate is, unfortunately, not feasible.  However, we may invite the Minister to return at a later date for further discussion.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator Mooney mentioned the cutbacks in the areas of justice and defence.  Yes, there will be cuts; many of them have been outlined, while others are still to come.  There will be cuts in practically all Departments, which will be outlined in the next number of weeks.  It is unfortunately the case that we have to have these cuts.  We need to trim our sails to run the economy in a proper way, and that is what the Government is intent on doing.  Unfortunately, this will have economic implications for communities in which military barracks, courthouses and so on close.  However, the Government is committed to having balanced budgets in the future and running the economy as it should be run.</P>

The Senator will be forwarded his comments.  However, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will be seeking submissions on the matter in November.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Sheahan spoke about NAMA and also made some important points about the review of rates.  We will certainly ask the Minister for Finance to come to the House to discuss NAMA.  A number of other Members, including Senator Daly, spoke on that point also.  I have already spoken about questions to the Minister. </P><P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe called for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the House. He is due to do so in the next couple of weeks. The Senator may raise the question of votes for people who have emigrated at that stage. </P><Col N="137"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s wise words about the eurozone document were &ldquo;<i>Festina lente</i>&rdquo;.  We will have time to digest this document and have a debate on it. </P><P Just="Left">Senator Landy made an interesting point about the &euro;700 million Anglo Irish Bank bond, saying it would be paid from the bank&rsquo;s own resources owing to the sale of assets. The Senator also called for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to sign the commencement order for the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010. I will certainly take up that matter with the Minister; I cannot see why the Act has not been put into law. I was one of the first Members to raise the issue of puppy farms eight or nine years ago in the House. I will take up the matter with the Minister and update the Senator on it. </P><P Just="Left">I dealt with a number of the points made by Senator Noone. I am glad she did not address her comments in Italian as I would not have been able to answer her. </P>

    <Title>Health Services: Statements, Questions and Answers</Title>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, to make a statement on the health service and answer questions already submitted by Senators.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="138"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Senators for providing me with this opportunity to brief them on a broad range of health issues that they indicated they wished me to address.  First, however, I wish Ms Finola Cassidy who is in the Visitors Gallery a happy birthday. I will begin with some remarks about the financial crisis which the Government is tackling and the resulting challenges for the health service.  At the beginning of the year hospitals had overrun by &euro;70 million their budgets carried over from last year.  In the first three months of the year, for whatever reason, there was a massive overrun in hospital budgets, as activity outstripped normal levels.  In addition, because of the general financial position in the country and the fact that we must now report to the troika, we must save &euro;1 billion on the health service.  Given that background, we are trying to maintain services and, at the same time, institute a reform programme.</P>
        <P>People are always exercised &mdash; rightly &mdash; about various facilities and different aspects of the health service.  They want these to be fixed, rightly so.  However, these matters do not arise in isolation.  John Donne said, &ldquo;No man is an island entire of itself.&rdquo;  Similarly, no part of the health service works on its own.  If a hospital has a problem in its emergency department, it cannot solve that problem within that department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>If it has one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem must be dealt with.  It arose as a result of the mishandling of the health service and the economy by the Senator&rsquo;s party in the past 14 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister closed the accident and emergency department in Roscommon County Hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>We inherited that legacy and we shall deal with it.  Not for the first time, a Fine Gael and Labour Party Government will clean up the mess left behind by a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government. A hospital must fix the problems in its emergency department by addressing their cause.  What causes them are the actual numbers coming to the emergency department and the lack of primary care facilities.  That is an issue we are addressing.  We are putting in place a strategy on which we will deliver, unlike the strategy of 2001 which was left on a shelf.</P>
        <P>Equally, one must change the way a hospital operates in order that more patients can be admitted quickly.  In order to do this one must provide services in the community to allow patients who have finished the acute phase of their treatment to continue their journey back to full health, if that be the case, or in longer term care, if that is what is required.  There is a range or host of possibilities between short-term convalescence, longer term convalescence and other initiatives.  If a diagnosis of pneumonia is made, for example, when the patient will need intravenous antibiotics, the first dose can be given in hospital and the patient can then go home where he or she can be visited by a competent nurse to administer the antibiotics while the patient is monitored by his or her general practitioner.  There is also home help and home care packages available.  All of these possibilities must be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the Government came to power, I promised to set up a special delivery unit.  The reason I was so keen to do this was that I had seen what had been achieved in Northern Ireland where there was an information system that allowed full visibility throughout the health service.  One could see Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s waiting list in Ulster Hospital with the touch of a button on a computer, or Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s list in Belfast.   If one was a two month list and the other was a two week list, the man with the two week list was left alone while the man with the two month list <Col N="139"/>received a visit to find out what the problem was.  This was not used as a big stick with which to beat people but rather as a tool to help them to address the problems they were experiencing.  Was the reason for the delay the fact that the man concerned was undertaking too many reviews, or was it that he was so popular that everybody wanted to see him?  In such a case perhaps some patients could be moved to another list.  The key point is that the Minister is in constant touch with the special delivery unit which reports to him weekly and sometimes daily.  This has had two effects, as I noted at the time.  First, people know there is help available and, second, that there will be consequences if they do not change their habits.</P>
        <P>My adviser was told that it would cost &euro;10 million and take 18 months to introduce such a system here.  The special delivery unit, under Dr. Martin Connor, a doctor of philosophy, not medicine, in conjunction with some excellent people from the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, has managed to put in place a system in 98 days for less than &euro;250,000.  It is not yet complete, but they are getting there quickly.  Of course, the final bill will be higher, but the point is that the team has managed to do in a very short time what it was said would take much longer and cost much more to do.  We are now in a situation that allows full visibility across the system.  We can see how many are waiting for access to inpatient services and for how long they have been waiting in emergency departments at any given moment.  This does not yet apply to all emergency departments, but is to be found in 27.  We can now monitor what is happening and intervene.  Similarly, we can now see Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s waiting list.  For the first time, instead of driving around in the dark, we are driving with full beams.  We can see what is happening, plan and react much more quickly.  Instead of finding out months or a year later that there is a problem, we know now and can address it.</P>
        <P>We are also putting in place a similar type of IT system for financial matters in order that we can monitor a hospital&rsquo;s financial performance at two and four week periods.  This obviously gives us more monitoring ability because many more parameters can be measured.  We will be able to see very quickly when a hospital is moving away from budget and intervene, something it was not possible to do in the past.  Generally, what happened was that in the middle of February things would begin to look a little funny and one waited to see how they looked in March.  In May one realised that half the year was almost gone and budgets had gone seriously astray.  That will not happen again.</P>
        <P>Many Senators have issues concerning their local hospitals.  Eight are problematic, while another seven are considered high risk.  They are receiving intensive support.  I will take questions as Senators raise them, if they have a particular interest in a given hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to discuss, briefly, the position of smaller hospitals and the pervading fear that they will be downgraded and, ultimately, put out of business and lost to their communities.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We are obliged to preside over the safe provision of services &mdash; that is an absolute &mdash; and will do so.  Where we can make a hospital safe, we will do so, but where we cannot, or if there is a facility within the hospital that is not safe, we will not preside over it.  In the midst of all the negativity, however, I wish to point to some positive facts about smaller hospitals.  The Government is developing a framework for such hospitals, the first draft of which has already been delivered.  The Cabinet Sub-committee on health met to discuss this strategy and is due to meet again in the next week or so in order to give further consideration to it.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">An example of a small hospital that has flourished is Louth County Hospital.  In 2009 there were no care of the elderly cases at this hospital, in 2010 there were 162 and to date this year there have been 388.  In 2009 there were 535 episodes of venesection for haemochromatosis which requires removing units of blood at a time, in 2010 there were 800 and to date this year <Col N="140"/>there have been 1,783.  There was no colposcopy service at Louth County Hospital in 2009 but in 2010 some 3,083 cases were dealt with there.  The number of surgical cases at the hospital has risen from 3,416 to 3,659 in recent years.  The number of radiological examinations increased from 534 in 2009 to 1,519 in 2010 to over 3,000 this year.  The number of outpatient sessions has increased from 933 to 974.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">These are the types of services which can be provided safely, conveniently and in a far more cost-effective way in smaller hospitals than in their larger counterparts.  I accept that there has been a great deal of controversy with regard to what has happened in smaller hospitals.  I warrant, however, that there will be a great deal of controversy when we transfer from the bigger hospitals the type of procedures which more rightly should be carried out at smaller facilities.  People should make no mistake &mdash; we will move those procedures.  I have stated on previous occasions that obliging people to attend in larger hospitals for a varicose vein ligation procedure or the repair of an inguinal hernia is similar to sending one&rsquo;s ten year old Volkswagen to the Ferrari testing centre.  There is no doubt that a great job will be done but this is hardly a good or efficient way to use resources.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not want to take up too much of the time because I am aware that Senators have many questions to pose.  However, I wish to state that we are determined to make our health services better.  We know that we can do this and we have gathered around us the expertise to allow us to proceed.  The clinical care programmes were already in existence when I entered office.  They are now flourishing and are playing a major role in addressing many of the inefficiencies that exist in the system.  It is worth noting, particularly in light of past controversies, that it will not be possible to do things as they were done in the past, especially as our way of operating has not delivered.  I will give some credit where it is due.  The previous Government threw a great deal of money at the health service.  It is clear, however, that money alone will not solve the problems.  What is required is change, particularly in respect of the way care is delivered.</P>
        <P>The underlying principle of our policy is that a patient should be treated at the lowest level of complexity in a setting that is safe, efficient and as near to his or her home as possible.  We intend to ensure that this principle will be adhered to.  We have already begun our journey on this road by allowing patients the option of having flu vaccinations administered in pharmacies.  This gives them greater choice and increased access due to the fact that pharmacies have long opening hours.  Similarly, we want to bring those with chronic illnesses out of hospitals and back into the community, where they can be treated in a far more cost-effective and convenient manner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recently visited Mallow primary care centre, at which over 2,000 people with diabetes are being treated at 20% of what it would cost to treat them in hospital.  The results achieved by the centre are excellent and I understand that in four years not one patient has been obliged to undergo an amputation procedure.  Patients' blood sugar levels are monitored at the centre and the level of control is excellent.  In addition, attending there is far more convenient for patients.  Some of the larger hospitals in Dublin have 8,000 or 9,000 people with diabetes attending their outpatient departments.  Why are these individuals attending hospitals when they could attend their GPs and be cared for, in the main, by practice nurses?</P>
        <P Just="Left">These are the matters to which we are giving consideration.  We are determined to make the changes to which I refer.  I accept that these will require alterations to the way in which consultants, NCHDs, nurses and GPs work.  The country is in a difficult position &mdash; although in light of the progress that has been made, the position is not as difficult as was the case when the Government entered office &mdash; and it is incumbent on all of us to put our shoulders to the <Col N="141"/>wheel.  It is particularly incumbent on those who are leaders in institutions such as hospitals, etc., to put their shoulders to the wheel, to lead by example and to show others the way.  We are all in this together.  As stated, no part of the health service exists in isolation, no man is an island and no body in society can state that it does not have its own share of responsibility to bear in the context of rectifying the situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Senators for their time and look forward to answering their questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The contributions of each of the spokespersons for the various groups will be limited to seven minutes.  That is a limit which I will strictly enforce.  Thereafter, other Senators will have one minute in which to pose their questions.  They should not make speeches because that would not be fair to other Members.  On a previous occasion, I wanted to ask a question on fisheries but I did not get the opportunity to do so because the time ran out owing to the fact that everyone who preceded me was too leadr&aacute;nach.  It is important, therefore, that spokespersons should make all their points in the seven minutes available to them and that other Senators should use their 60 seconds to ask questions rather than making speeches.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I want the Minister to answer questions in respect of Roscommon County Hospital.  However, I am being prevented from asking those questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has already wasted most of a minute.  His time is exhausted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I have never doubted his personal commitment in the context of transforming the health service, nor did I doubt the commitment of the previous Minister, Mary Harney, or that of her predecessor in that regard.  When I sat on the opposite side of the House, I had no difficulty uttering robust comments if I perceived that things were not being done correctly, that something was unfair or that money was being <Col N="142"/>wasted.  I assure the Minister that my position will be absolutely consistent in the context of what I am about to say in respect of the health service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fear that the Minister&rsquo;s pre-election position and that of many of his colleagues has changed.  Both the country&rsquo;s budgetary position and the difficulties in the health service have been clear for some time.  As the Minister correctly pointed out, if money alone could solve the problem then we would have the best health service in the world because we invested billions of euro &mdash; more than 50% of the tax take &mdash; in the health service over the years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first criticism I wish to make &mdash; I made it on a daily basis when Mary Harney was Minister &mdash; is that it is inconceivable that we give more than 50% of our tax take to a third-party organisation that operates at arm&rsquo;s length and tell it to run the health service with that money.  That is wrong.  The Minister replaced the board of the HSE when he came to office.  I am of the view that he should now  assume responsibility for the budget to which I refer because he, as the people&rsquo;s representative, should have control of it.  When I write to the Minister in respect of a budgetary matter relating to the health service, it is not acceptable that I receive a reply which states that under the Health Act 2004 which, I accept, we all supported, the CEO of the HSE now has responsibility for such matters and that the Minister has written to him to ask that he respond to me.  That is not acceptable to people who are members of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il or the Labour Party or those who are apolitical.  I believe in the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to change the system.  I want him to change it and I would be doing no one a service if I did not attempt to hold him to account in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not interested in political point-scoring.  However, the commitments given in the lead-up to the election &mdash; regardless of whether these were made by Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe, in respect of a centre of excellence in Sligo, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, or the leader of the Labour Party and T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore &mdash; were reprehensible.  The commitments relating to Roscommon County Hospital and many other aspects of the health service were also reprehensible.  It was patently wrong for anyone to make the type of commitments to which I refer.  I recall people going around wearing T-shirts with the legend &ldquo;Save our cancer services&rdquo; emblazoned on them.  Such T-shirts also exhorted people to give their first preference to party X or party Y because it was going to do its supporters proud and return what had been stolen from them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That was wrong.  It is politically criminal not to state it should not have been done.  Unlike other colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, hung up the telephone on a radio interview when it was put to him.  I know the Minister will not do so.  I ask him to do justice to the people and state it should never have been said that a centre of excellence for cancer services would be built in Sligo when it was never going to happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is the up-to-date situation on follow-up mammography in the parts of the country where people are expected to travel many miles for services?  Commitments given by Professor Keane and countless people in the national cancer control programme have been welshed upon as have pre-election commitments.  The women of the north west and other parts of the country need to know the position on this.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to extend the age limit for BreastCheck to 70 years.  This needs to be done; when will it happen?  Medical politics, intra-hospital, intra-discipline and from one professor to another, would put the politics and internal hand-to-hand combat in political parties such as Fianna F&aacute;il and I am sure Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the ha'penny place.  It is reprehensible.  I have no doubt <Col N="143"/>Senator Crown could give us an insight into some of this because he has great expertise in the area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report written by Hannah Magee on changing cardiac catheterisation health throughout the country has the ambition to have a stent in place in heart attack victims within 90 minutes.  Professor Kieran Daly of UCHD is implementing the recommendations made in this report and it is honourable that it is being done.  Again, centres of excellence are proposed in Dublin at the Mater Hospital and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and in Galway and Cork with stepdown facilities in Limerick and Waterford and the usual gaping void north of the line from Dublin to Galway and in the south west.  Is it the policy of the HSE and by extension the Government that the people of these parts of the country should either move or die?  The people in Limerick had better make sure their heart attacks occur between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday as otherwise their survival chances are reduced.  I always use the analogy from George Orwell&rsquo;s <i>Animal Farm</i> that all people are equal but when it comes to health in this country some are more equal than others.  This is wrong.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to pathology, where is the report which stated pathology services would be centralised?  This would make sense as blood tests taken by GPs would be sent to a centralised location.  It also proposed that pathology services in many hospitals throughout the country would be wound down.  I am not a physician and I look to Senator Crown and others with medical expertise, but I must ask how it is possible to have an acute hospital in an area without pathology facilities.  I am told this is being proposed and I ask the Minister to clarify it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It may well be a good idea to bring in outside managers to hospitals but people are already in place to manage them.  Granted, this is not the case with regard to the CEO of UCHD but other hospitals in the HSE west area have management in place.  What will happen is that other managers will be brought in to show them how to do the job.  This is ridiculous in the extreme.  At the outset, the Minister clarified that the budgetary situation is dire.  I agree with him and I do not envy him his task nor doubt his commitment, but how in God&rsquo;s name can we keep a straight face while telling people the budget is a problem but the HSE will pay from its own resources to bring in management consultants to explain to people how to do their jobs?  It is ridiculous.  The money is needed for the 429 patients on trolleys throughout the country today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some hospitals are better than others in dealing with budgetary constraints put upon them and one of these is Sligo General Hospital and I would like the Minister to acknowledge this.  Today, only two patients are on trolleys in this hospital.  It has managed its budgetary situation exceptionally well in recent months.  It is probably not there yet but it is getting there.  The former Deputy, Eamon Scanlon, announced Sligo General Hospital was one of the 15 hospitals short-listed to be a colonoscopy centre.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, went further and announced it as one of the 12 centres for colonoscopy screening throughout the country.  When will this screening begin and from where is the money coming?  It is estimated it will cost the hospital &euro;250,000 to bring its facilities up to scratch and another &euro;250,000 a year to run the service.  Capital expenditure is required and no doubt if the money is available within HSE resources for outside management consultants I am sure it is there to facilitate this service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister stated that small hospitals throughout the country will not be downgraded in any way.  It is appropriate to use the example of a hospital in the Leas-Chathaoirleach&rsquo;s constituency.  What does the future hold for Bantry General Hospital?  Will the medical assessment unit continue to operate on a 24-7 basis?  Will similar hospitals continue to operate in the manner outlined by the Minister at the beginning of this debate?</P><Col N="144"/>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Leader of the House for facilitating this debate.  I love what he is doing with the Seanad and he knows I am his biggest fan.  However, a general debate on health requires 20 minutes for spokespersons. I know the Minister has a busy schedule and that there is an election on today but two hours is not sufficient for a general debate on health.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledged Finola Cassidy of the Irish Thalidomide Association who is in the Visitors Gallery.  The issue was first raised in the House almost 50 years ago in 1962.  As stated in the programme for Government to which the Labour Party contributed, I hope the issue can be dealt with and advanced decisively.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House.  I ask the House to bear with me as I have the flu.  I hope I will be able to finish my speech.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for the past six months I can confirm to the House that  very constructive debate has taken place on a number of policy areas and the Minister has attended and briefed the committee on a number of occasions.  Many issues face the health care sector and it is important to highlight a report presented to the committee.  According to this report, in the period 2000 to 2010, the annual number of patients treated in public hospitals increased strongly, reflecting an increase in population.  The key statistics confirm that the number of inpatients and day care patients treated increased by 67% from 788,000 to 1.32 million per year; outpatient attendances increased by 78% from 2 million to 3.5 million per year; and births increased by 36% from 54,789 to 74,729 per year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report also states the number of acute hospital beds per 1,000 population in Ireland has decreased since 2000, as has the average length of stay.  Given the increased demand for acute hospital care the occupancy rate for acute beds in Ireland is much higher than the OECD average.  Also according to the report, the resources available to acute hospitals to treat patients have suffered significant reductions in recent years and this is making it more difficult to treat the increasing number of patients presenting for care.</P>
        <P>The total number of doctors working in Ireland is significantly below the OECD average on a population basis.  This gives rise to significant pressures in the delivery of primary care and acute hospital services.  This is what the Minister inherited along with a shortage of junior doctors and a serious reduction in the number of applicants for new consultant posts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was wrong that the HSE encouraged junior doctors to travel to Ireland without first having in place an agreement with the Irish Medical Council as to how they would be registered to practise.  I make no apologies for having highlighted this issue in the past four months.  I was delighted to see that on the day the Minister, the Irish Medical Council and the HSE appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Irish Medical Council and the HSE on how all future recruitment and registration of junior doctors would be managed with clear boundaries agreed between the respective organisations.</P>
        <P>The key issue that needs to be tackled is why the vast majority of the more than 500 graduates per year we produce from our universities leave the country within two years of graduation.  I am delighted some progress has been made in that all of the parties involved including the HSE, the Irish Medical Council, the medical training organisations and universities together with the consultants and NCHDs are to meet in the coming weeks to look at developing a long-term strategy to deal with this issue.  I wish them well in their deliberations and I urge the Minister to do everything possible to ensure we reverse the trend of Irish graduates leaving <Col N="145"/>the country so soon after graduation.  On the issue of hospital consultants it appears that we may be facing another crisis.  In 2008, 130 consultant advertised posts received 649 applications, or more than five applicants per post.  There were only 214 applicants for the 133 posts advertised in the first six months of 2010, or an average of 2.2 applicants per post.  In the second half of 2010 the number of applicants for jobs decreased further.  In 2003 the national task force on medical staff recommended the establishment of 3,600 hospital consultant posts by 2013 and a reduction in the number of non-consultant hospital doctors.  The most recent HSE figures submitted to the Joint Committee on Health and Children on 6 October indicated that the number of consultant posts in the public health system stood at 2,506 in September 2011.  Based on the 2003 recommendations there is a deficit of 1,100 consultants compared with the target set for 2013.  In the interim the population has increased above the level anticipated in the 2003 report.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for the work being done in Cork but I will not speak about this issue in depth because I wish to speak about health care reform.  A number of targets have been set by this Government to reform the health service, including the introduction of a universal health care package.  Despite the many problems which the Minster has faced over the past six months it is important that there are no delays in the implementation of this long-term policy.  It is also important that we continue to develop new strategies to provide a more efficient health care service and, in particular, we should put in place a comprehensive policy to deal with computerisation of GP practices and hospitals to make sure that over the long term each sector of the health service can access information without delay.  The patient medication card which in Denmark offered savings of over &euro;1.8 billion by 2008 is now being introduced in Germany, which has a population of 82 million.  There is no reason we should not set similar goals so that GPs, nurses and hospital doctors can access medical information at the touch of a button, provided they have patients&rsquo; consent.  We can access our bank accounts wherever we travel in the world.  We are living in an electronic era and we must move with the times in terms of how we store and access medical information.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before I conclude I would like to put five questions to the Minister.  In June 2011, the HSE agreed to set up a working group to review the current structures for the employment of non-consultant hospital doctors.  Did this group meet and has it reported?  It was to file a report with Cathal Magee within three months.  In view of the difficulties experienced in recruiting junior doctors will the Minister agree to revisit the status of junior doctor posts and work towards increasing the number of training posts?  Does he agree that we require a clear target for the recruitment of consultants and will he set out a new five year target?</P>
        <P>Given that the majority of nurses have academic qualifications, does he agree there is a need to review the scope of the work they can perform?</P>
        <P>There is an urgent need to increase the number of people who are available to provide home help.  Many cannot work in this area as they do not have the required experience.  Does he agree that the barriers could be tackled by allowing these people to train in local community hospitals under the JobBridge programme?  This would increase the number of people available to provide home help and reduce the number of those who require full-time nursing home care.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for giving up his time to debate these issues in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>There are widespread concerns about the adequacy of the home care services offered by the HSE to geriatric, adult, mental and pediatric sectors of society.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the standard of service on a  small island with a small population is unsatisfactory in the 21st century.  There is grave concern about the lack of <Col N="146"/>governance over the standards applied to services once they are put in place.  It appears that joined-up thinking and communication are lacking between the Department of Health in Hawkins House and the HSE.  This is causing breakdowns in the operation of health services and the implementation of the Minister&rsquo;s objectives.</P>
        <P>In my area of pediatric disability, I am only too aware that parents have to fight sections of the HSE every step of the way to obtain the care to which their sick children are entitled from the State.  I ask the Minister to imagine what it is like to be a sleep deprived parent who cares for an adored and seriously ill child.  The child may be tube fed, which requires 22 hours of attention per day.  He or she may need postural drainage every hour or else will be vulnerable to chest infection, reflux or more serious implications.  A parent in this situation must fight to arrange meetings with the HSE.</P>
        <P>I am not the only person to argue that if the HSE contracted to private care agencies the provision of first rate services the State would make considerable savings and all the stakeholders would benefit greatly.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister consider extending to the families of children with serious chronic illness an automatic entitlement to a medical card?  Persons over 70 years of age are able to renew their medical cards by signing an affidavit that their circumstances have not changed in the previous year.  Ireland&rsquo;s position on medical cards flies in the face of the last two reviews by the United Nations of the provision of child care in Ireland.  Both UN reports recommended that any child with a certified illness or disability should be provided with an automatic medical card.  In Ireland, however, the child&rsquo;s parents or guardians are means tested and if they fail the test they must either cover medical bills that can cost thousands of euro per annum or call on the support of charities.  The parent of a sick child must still pay the ESB bill and television licence.  This is a disgraceful state of affairs given that the well-off receive children&rsquo;s allowance without means tests.  The moment these children turn 16 they will be granted medical cards in their own right as citizens.  Surely a sick child should be regarded in his our her own right.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The only conclusion I can draw is that the Government will protect people over 70 years through legislation but are prepared to let chronically ill children suffer.  I might be bolder by suggesting it has something to do with the fact that children do not have a vote.  This reform would create a great deal of good will for the Government at no great cost to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>Why does the HSE not have a similar national home care budget for sick children as it has for the elderly?  Why are there glaring inconsistencies in the home care packages offered by various HSE areas to the parents of severely ill children?  Such services include nursing hours, carers&rsquo; support, home help and out-of-home respite services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I could speak about a myriad of cases, such as J. J. Ryan from Tipperary or Matthew McGrath from Gorey, County Wexford, whose mummy wrote to me the other day.  To give Senators a feel for her struggle with the HSE, I will quote from parts of her letter.  Matthew McGrath, who is now eight years old, was born a beautiful little boy but was infected with meningitis when he was two and ended up with severe brain damage to the point that he cannot see or hear, has to be tube fed and suffers epileptic fits.    His mother writes:</P>
        <P LI="1">In a long battle, I have battled with the health service to secure funding for the last few years to take our son home.  It is my constant dismay that parents have to fight for this when firstly, the health board have no alternative arrangements for our children .... absolutely nothing and secondly, when 90% of families want desperately to have their chronically ill children at home, within the family unit, as their basic human right.  I am astounded, 6 years <Col N="147"/>on, to still read stories in the media of families fighting to get support to bring their children home.  Why does the wheel have to be reinvented each time and at what expense?  The meetings held in the hospital with our local community health professionals were a fiasco.  Each meeting saw 4 or 5 professionals travelling up to Dublin (at, I suspect, an above average mileage rate) arriving with no suggestions, or proposals and basically saying &lsquo;no&rsquo; to everything the hospital or family proposed (not that we, the family, were ever included in the meeting process).  They show no regard or respect for parents or families of chronically ill children.  At the end of the day it was a matter of standing firm and them realising that we were not going to go away so they had to come to some sort of package deal.  At this stage of the game these packages should be fairly straightforward and should be offered up to parents ....  The list of waste, negligence and sheer apathy goes on and on.  Our fight to keep our son at home with the level of support we need to function as a family goes on and on.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I could continue to read from the letter, but I conclude by asking the Minister a final question.  According to an internal document reported on in the national media on 14 October last, the HSE is considering radical cuts &mdash; cutting home help hours by 600,000 and personal assistant hours by 400,000, providing no further appliances or aids for patients and freezing the issue of new medical cards between now and the end of the year.  The same internal document states that these radical measures &ldquo;will require discussion with the Department of Health before implementation&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to set out the Department&rsquo;s position on these dramatic proposals.  According to the HSE assessment, these cuts will increase the demand on the acute sector and the demand for long-stay care in fair deal beds and the number of delayed discharges, will lead to longer waiting lists and accident and emergency waiting times, and will reduce the ability of older people to remain at home.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister for Health to the Chamber.  He probably has the most difficult job in Ireland, if not the world.  He has started extremely well.  His decisive early decision to disband the board of the HSE sent a signal that he and the Government were serious about health service reform.  The previous Government spoke about reform but, in the main, failed to deliver it.  The development of cancer services is a possible exception in this regard.  As the Minister said, credit must be given where credit is due.  One of the problems facing the HSE is that too many people seem to be almost intractable.  I have a view on this.  Crisis after crisis has emerged since the formation of the HSE.  We can expect more crises to emerge as time goes on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE was established on the basis of a set of assumptions that were not consistent.  When it was established, it was considered that the imposition of a centralised system of management and administration onto an unwieldy set of services, without paying much attention to how this new arrangement might work, was all that was needed.  A fundamental reorganisation of the services should have taken place at the time, but it did not.  I am afraid the legacy of this lack of bold decision-making remains with us.  I am glad the Minister has set his face towards reform.  It will be a difficult road.  All of us should show political courage in this regard.  Difficult decisions lie ahead, not only because of this country&rsquo;s financial position but because the health service needs to be reformed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not good enough for politicians from all parties in this and the other House and outside the Oireachtas to start raising fears among the public for narrow party political ends.  We have seen too much of this.  There was an example of this earlier in the summer when some of the public comments of politicians were nothing short of disgraceful.  I understand that all politicians strive to protect the services of their local hospitals and fight to ensure services are not <Col N="148"/>taken away from them, but surely their arguments must be evidence-based.  If evidence suggests that a particular hospital needs to have its services reduced, all honest politicians have a responsibility to support such a decision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It would be easy for me to stand up here and criticise the HSE.  The temptation to do so is not easy to resist.  I will not criticise it.  The time has arrived &mdash; it was long overdue &mdash; for us to deliver real improvements in these services.  I am aware that longer term proposals for a universal health care model are in the offing.  We need to achieve real results on the ground.  We cannot wait for two or three years to see these real results.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been some very good improvements recently.  Things seem to have improved significantly at Tallaght Hospital, which had been the subject of some fairly bad or poor public comment earlier in the year.  In his response, perhaps the Minister will comment on how these improvements have been achieved.  He mentioned the appointment of a special delivery unit, which is a very positive step.  We look forward to early results in this area.  I smiled when the Minister mentioned that the director of the unit was a philosopher.  I think the Minister and the director will need to be fairly philosophical in their future dealings with the health service.</P>
        <P>The staff of the HSE are doing tremendous work.  I was a front line worker until I was elected to this House.  I know what it is like to hear everyone criticising the HSE and its staff.  It is very demoralising for people who often work in very difficult areas, to hear constant and mostly uninformed criticism of their endeavours.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will focus on two issues.  The moratorium on staff recruitment is having a considerable impact on front-line services.  I am particularly concerned about mental health services because many people, especially nursing staff, are expected to retire from those services by next February.  It is feared that the exciting plans outlined in A Vision for Change will be put on hold or will not be realised in their entirety.  Given that mental health services have historically been underfunded and neglected, we should show purpose and intent by considering exempting the mental health services from the worst of the cutbacks coming down the road.</P>
        <P>I have already mentioned the universal health care model.  It is vital that we end the two-tier health care system that has been allowed to evolve here.  It is inequitable and downright unfair.  The two-tier system is not becoming for a country that proclaims itself to be a republic.  We need to drive on from here.  We need to face down the powerful interests that are at work in our health services and would prefer to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  We need to show political courage when we do this.</P>
        <P>Some of my colleagues will put some questions to the Minister later in this debate.  I congratulate him on his good start and wish him well.  I offer him my support and that of Labour Party Senators in this House.  He will continue to enjoy that support as long as results are being achieved.  However, I should mention that the Minister is not entitled to that support in the absence of results.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>I give the Minister, Deputy Reilly, a particularly warm welcome.  It is critically important to understand that he has a set of credentials that distinguish him from his three most immediate predecessors.  I will not personalise this other than to say that the aggregate work experience, in any part of the workforce, of the Minister&rsquo;s three predecessors in this portfolio was four years.  I do not refer to their experience of working in the health service &mdash; I refer to their total experience in the workforce as a whole.  Although I am totally in favour of the concept of civilian control of all technical aspects of health care, it is a very positive development to have a Minister who understands the problems in the health service at first <Col N="149"/>hand &mdash; he does not need to have them filtered by the opinions of the professional bureaucracy &mdash; and has a clear set of plans to address them.</P>
        <P>I will use several matrimonial analogies during my brief speech.  The first of them is to remind the Minister that we are on our honeymoon.  I wish him all the best.  He will hear little harsh criticism from me during the first year after his ascent into office.  I think he needs a full year to get all the ducks in a row.  I will strongly support him as he tries to address the various problems.  If I sense during our honeymoon that the Minister has been taken captive by the Civil Service, I will be available to ride to his rescue.  He might find the odd criticism being addressed along those lines.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will make an historical point before I ask some questions.  I have made it in this House previously.  Much has been said about the advances made in cancer care in recent years.  Those advances were made by Deputy Noonan.  He was the first Minister for Health to announce publicly &mdash; he did so on his first day in this portfolio &mdash; that this country&rsquo;s cancer services were a shambles.  The speech he made was inspired by one I had made and published in a previous circumstance.  He made a number of very telling points that needed to be made.  He set the wheels rolling for the reform of cancer services.</P>
        <P>The first of my questions relates to the reported management deficiencies in the HSE.  They led to the Minister&rsquo;s decision to appoint private management consultants to oversee the functions of Merlin Park, Portiuncula, Roscommon and Ennis hospitals, and to run the day-to-day operations of the university hospitals in Galway and Limerick.  I have a specific question and a more general one.  Is the Minister at liberty to go into some of the details concerning some of the specific management deficiencies he found which needed this rather radical surgical intervention?</P>
        <P Just="Left">My second question brings me to an issue which I believe and hope will be a theme of the Minister&rsquo;s tenure, that is, the difference between management and leadership.  Those of us who have studied for MBAs have come out of them with varying degrees of enthusiasm for what we learned.  One lesson that stuck with me when I did the health care MBA was that there was a real difference between management and leadership.  Historically, we have had zero leadership in our health service.  It has been top heavy with management but has been heavily deficient in leadership.  The difference is, as they say, that leaders do things right while managers do the right things.  Leaders make policy while managers implement policy.  Much of what passes for leadership in the health system has, in fact, been a cult of high-end managerialism.  I refer specifically to the issue of clinical directorates.  I believe that we have constructed no leadership positions for doctors within our health service.  We have constructed a series of management positions for doctors where they may have authority over who does what outpatients&rsquo; slot or who has access to which operating theatre, but no doctor in Ireland can hire or fire another doctor.  This is wrong.  It is not the way that the best health systems, hospitals or academic institutions in the world work.</P>
        <P>The most classic example was given by the former director of the national cancer control programme who famously said, when he refused to meet local representatives who were discussing the deployment of cancer services, that he was not there to make policy but to implement it.  That is fair enough but we do need people who can lead and develop policy, people who have some inspiration and vision to do this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Setting up a new bureaucracy &mdash; the special delivery unit &mdash; is not the answer to waiting lists in the health system.  The Minister speaks eloquently of the new systems that will identify those areas where there are waiting lists, but I can tell him where they are: it is in Ireland.  We have <Col N="150"/>a six year waiting list for obesity surgery.  We have up to two year waiting lists for some elective specialist appointments in different geographical areas.  These problems are not of the Minister&rsquo;s creation but they all have one core item.  There is a grotesque deficiency of the specialists who are needed to provide those services and a grotesque deficiency of the facilities they need to do them.  There is no contractual reason for this; it is simple arithmetic.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have heard that we are below the OECD average.  I would like to tell my esteemed colleague, however, that we are not below the OECD average, we are at the bottom of the OECD average for all these medical ratios.  The only thing which makes it look better is that we have such an inflated number of junior doctors which are counted in those.</P>
        <P>With great respect to the Minister, it is widely felt that the reforms that were introduced in Northern Ireland were not durable in their outcome.  There was a short-term bump in the efficiency of certain aspects of the system, which is also grotesquely under-resourced.  I am sure the Minister understands that the only thing which saves the reputation of staffing levels in our health service is that the second worst in the OECD are our near neighbours and the only country with which we share a land frontier, Her Majesty&rsquo;s United Kingdom.  The UK has the second worst provision for the number of specialists per head of population of any major health system.  We need to set our bar higher than to say that if the British have done it in Northern Ireland, then we can do it here.</P>
        <P>I have a few quick technical questions for the Minister.  I will not read the entire text for my colleagues although we can make it available.  I have asked the Minister to clarify the future plans for the redeployment of paediatric diabetic services.  This is in response to multiple overtures which I have received from concerned professionals who believe that the care and future health of young diabetics in Ireland is being compromised because we do not have this.</P>
        <P>My next point relates to a matter on which the Minister could make his name internationally.  The former Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, did a very good job in introducing the original smoking ban which was a policy-changing event which made world headlines.  We should go one further by picking a date sometime ten to 12 years from now and say it will be illegal to import, manufacture, sell or distribute tobacco products.  If we invented tobacco tomorrow it would be illegal. The only reason we tolerate it now is because of the existence of a large number of addicts who are fed by very well-off pushers in the tobacco industry.  There is no ethical obligation on us to sustain self-destructive addictive behaviours for the benefit of drug pushers.  That, distilled to its core, is what the current discourse on tobacco is all about.  I urge the Minister to pick a date and agitate with our European partners to do the same.  Make it 2025, or whatever deadline, to make Europe tobacco free.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister sometime during his tenure to get colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills to pay attention to the notion that we have a profound abnormality in the way we structure our medical schools.  We have six medical schools for a population of 4.5 million, which is approximately twice the European average and three times the North American average.  I believe it is the highest average in the world with the possible exception of some small Caribbean islands whose economy basically revolves around one or two medical schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the flip side, none of these schools has anything remotely approaching the faculty levels which we would find in international medical schools.  Although I am having trouble getting the numbers, on aggregate, Ireland has approximately 100 to 120 full-time consultant level positions to staff the six medical schools.  The Harvard medical school has 1,500.  This is a health education system which is cobbled together on the basis of voluntarism.  The system is not <Col N="151"/>immune to the criticism of being extremely self-interested and one which I believe outside agencies will need to examine.</P>
        <P>I have one last technical question.  Why is the Department of Health&rsquo;s administration budget expanding by 16%, with a 92% increase in travel and subsistence, at a time when the numbers of officials are supposed to be decreasing?</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister the best in reforming the health system.  It is a fantastic challenge and I will do everything I can to support him in it, but I ask him to try to set the goal of reforming it in the lifetime of this Oireachtas.  The plan to introduce universal social insurance mixed with private health insurance is not the Dutch model, but is really the German model.  A mixture of public and private insurance is being proposed.  I am sorry if I am being vulgar, and I have made this analogy before, but stating that this will not be introduced until after another election is like promising a young bride that one will be faithful to her after the first five years of marriage.  We need to make it a policy that we will do it within this Oireachtas and will reform the health system while the current Minister has control over it.  He will have my 100% support at every stage along the line in trying to implement that level of reform.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank all the Senators for their contributions, including the questions they have asked. Many of these questions are of considerable interest to people. Even though I know it has not been raised directly, I would like to address the issue of thalidomide survivors.  I know the question will be coming from Senator White in any event.  I also know that some of them are here today in the Visitors Gallery, as we have already acknowledged.  I welcome them to the House.  I met the Irish Thalidomide Association and, separately, the Irish Thalidomide Survivors Society in July.  I informed both organisations that my main concern was to address the health and personal social care needs of survivors living in Ireland.  I have now written to both representative organisations to inform them that the parameters of a HSE health care package are being drawn up by officials in my Department and in the HSE.  My Department will be in touch with the organisations when we are in a position to discuss the details involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I have previously outlined in the Oireachtas, Irish survivors of thalidomide receive a monthly payment from my Department.  Because the thalidomide drug was manufactured by a German company, they also receive a monthly payment from a German foundation.  All these payments are tax free and, on average, they receive a tax free payment of &euro;26,000 each year or &euro;2,166 per month.  The commitment in the programme for Government is to reopen discussions with survivors and that is what I am committed to.  At my meeting with the Irish Thalidomide Association I said that I would have to be guided by legal advice regarding the State&rsquo;s liability.  The Attorney General has confirmed that the State has no legal liability in this matter.  Notwithstanding this position, however, I want to enter into meaningful discussions around the financial gesture of good will towards Irish survivors of thalidomide.  This would be in addition to the health care package already mentioned.</P><Col N="152"/>
        <P Just="Left">However, none of us can ignore the severe financial challenges that the health service is facing.  The likelihood is that these challenges will increase next year and continue, unfortunately, for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>May I be forgiven if some of my replies do not reflect the chronological order of the questions asked?  If I were to answer them chronologically, I would have to cross-reference them with my notes.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry raised a number of issues.  I thank him for support.  He mentioned taking the Vote back.  I am certainly considering the restructuring of the HSE and its abolition.  In the course of doing so and in creating a new structure, the Vote may well return to the Department, to be disbursed thereafter to organisations responsible for smaller budgets.</P>
        <P>Professor Hannah Magee&rsquo;s report, Changing Cardiovascular Health: Cardiovascular Health Policy 2010-2019, was produced in June 2010.  This policy established a framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases so as to ensure an integrated and quality-assured approach in their management, and to reduce the burden of these conditions.  The policy proposed that cardiac and stroke services be reconfigured on a network basis at hospital and emergency care levels.  It also involved an improved ambulance service so 80% of patients would be brought directly to the appropriate centre for initial treatment within the accepted critical timeframe.</P>
        <P>Central to the network concept was the principle that every hospital should deliver a range of cardiovascular services either on site or in formal partnership with others.  Acute and national specialty services would be provided in a smaller number of comprehensive centres to ensure the high-volume 24-7 throughput that is required to support rapid, responsive and accessible quality care.</P>
        <P>The report recommended that emergency percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, be delivered within 120 minutes of first contact with the patient and that this service be available on a 24-7 basis in a small number of centres, sited to maximise patient access and workforce expertise and coverage.  Where it is not possible to meet this deadline, patients should be assessed for thrombolysis as soon as possible.  The report recommends that designation of cardiac networks providing diagnostic and interventional services include non-invasive diagnostic imaging facilities, in addition to echocardiography, catheterisation and angiography.</P>
        <P>The report referred to the role of comprehensive cardiac care services providing interventional investigation &mdash; intervention refers to cardiac catheterisation and stenting &mdash; and treatment over the working day, and stated some will provide 24-7 catheterisation, including stenting and PCI for acute myocardial infarction.  The facilities needed in addition to those for general cardiac centres include two cardiac catheter laboratories as a minimum, with 24-7 availability.</P>
        <P>The national clinical programme in the HSE has considered the requirements for patients in the north west.  The population in the north west needs a permanent catheterisation laboratory to allow for local diagnostic angiography and initial assessment of non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction acute coronary syndrome, non-STEMI ACS, patients.  Based on 2008 HIPE data, there are 225 patients from Letterkenny and 162 from Sligo per annum.  The laboratory should be located in the north-western region.</P>
        <P>The number of patients with STEMI &mdash; major heart attack &mdash; is small, amounting to 47 patients from Letterkenny and 46 from Sligo per annum based on the 2008 HIPE data.</P><Col N="153"/>
        <P>The national clinical programme for ACS is developing a clinical protocol with the ambulance service for the country to allow the appropriate treatment and transfer of patients.  The protocol will set out the clinical circumstances where patients are safely treated locally &mdash; I refer to thrombolysis if the history is short &mdash; and the clinical need for transportation to a primary PCI centre.  The primary PCI centres available for patients from the north west will be located in Galway and Dublin.</P>
        <P>The available data for the affected population militate against a justification for a 24-7 primary PCI centre in the north west.  It should be noted that such a centre would require two catheterisation laboratories, along with at least five cardiologists, on-call nursing and technical staff.  In view of this, the HSE is considering cross-Border co-operation, in respect of which discussions are ongoing with Altnagelvin Area Hospital.  This is one of many areas of cross-Border co-operation I have discussed with the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Mr. Edwin Poots.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On mammography services, we are committed to ensuring that quality and optimal care are paramount in decisions on the provision of services throughout the health system.  I announced in June that a follow-up mammography service would resume in Sligo for women who had previously had a diagnosis of breast cancer.  In the region of 20 to 25 women in the Sligo catchment area require this service each month.  The service will be provided on an outreach basis from University Hospital Galway to Sligo.  It is intended that one radiographer will attend Sligo General Hospital on one day a month to undertake follow-up mammograms for women in this area who currently travel to Galway.  To do so, it is necessary to increase the complement of radiographers in the Galway service.</P>
        <P>While a recruitment pause is currently in place within the HSE, it has introduced an exemption process to enable priority posts to be advanced. The HSE has advised that two radiographer posts for Galway have been exempted from the recruitment pause.  I am advised that interviews for these positions are scheduled for 21 November.  The date for the resumption of follow-up mammography will clearly be determined by the date on which the additional radiographers are appointed and able to take up their positions.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators asked about Galway and Limerick university hospitals.  The HSE has identified a need to have available from time to time senior executives, either team-based or individuals, on a short-term basis to strengthen executive teams, lead a project or programme, provide an injection of skills that are required, or assist in the transformation agenda set by Government.</P>
        <P>In June 2011, the HSE invited tenders from potential service providers to compete for appointment to a four year framework agreement for personnel placement and supply services.  Under the framework agreement, service providers can be asked to source and supply either senior interim managers or more long-term senior management candidates.  At present, the HSE is focusing on putting senior interim managers in place.  The tender process was completed and approved in late August 2011 and the framework agreement was established on 8 September 2011.  Five companies have been appointed under the agreement.  On 10 October 2011, the five companies were invited to participate in a mini-competition to source and propose candidates for an interim management support structure for HSE west.   These are being evaluated.  The competition closed last week and we hope to make decisions very shortly.  This is a HSE process rather than a departmental one and is about strengthening the performance of acute hospitals, which play crucial roles within our health service.</P><Col N="154"/>
        <P>I do not want this to be misinterpreted by anybody.  I am fully supportive of this initiative.  I said the SDU would support clinicians where they are having difficulties meeting targets and where their lists are growing longer.  The SDU should be in a position to provide recommendations on helping management.  It does not involve a witch hunt but a method of supporting management and filling gaps where they exist, as they do in Galway where there is no CEO.  We need to bring our management up to speed.</P>
	<P>Senator Crown spoke about management versus leadership.  The real problem is that of management versus administrators and of administrators being promoted to management without having been given the necessary skill set to do the job.  It is not their fault but we need management.  We will support management by bringing in outside management to help.  The SDU has at its disposal the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The moneys therein will be used in very different ways than they were used heretofore.  Some may still be used in the normal way, that is, to buy services for patients, but other moneys will be used to fund initiatives to address underlying problems, in emergency departments, hospital management, etc., to make the recommendations that work.  It is a matter of thinking differently, thinking outside the box and examining circumstances before acting.  That has been the real boon of the SDU.</P>
        <P>I take on board what Senator Gilroy said and thank him for his support.  I agree that I do not deserve that support if I do not deliver.  The SDU is key to delivering what I have promised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have full confidence in those involved.  They have made great strides to date.   I will attempt to explain much of what we are doing now from a gardening or farming point of view.  One does not realise that one did not do things correctly in the autumn until the spring when the crop does not grow.  We must do things now to reap the rewards in January and February next year and further down the line.  I am pleased that this arrangement is now in place and I hope people will learn from the process and will be empowered by it rather than intimidated or undermined.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have dealt with questions Nos. 29, 27 and 26 but if I have left out any answers I will come back to them.  I was asked specifically about the future of Bantry General Hospital.  It is in a particular, isolated geographical area and it requires a different approach to that of other hospitals.  It is part of the smaller hospital framework document, which has not been finalised.  However, I gave an undertaking that there would be proper communication.  By this I do not mean sending out leaflets informing people what is happening, I mean consultation with the doctors in the hospital and the community and with politicians.  We will lay out clearly for people what exactly is happening so that they can be satisfied that their concerns have been taken on board and that there is an organised plan with timelines that can be adjudicated on.  This is not 100% complete and I am not in a position to go into the detail because that would undermine the process I have just outlined.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke asked a question about non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, and how to reduce the numbers leaving.  I have a particular interest in this area and I have a formal answer to the question as part of question No. 35.  I am concerned that we have many young doctors in the country who believe this is not the place for them to pursue their career.  There are myriad reasons for this.  Part of the cause is down to their senior colleagues and the way they are treated.  Part of it is down to management and they way they are treated.  Part of it is down to the lack of a clear career path.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this country people must wait for someone to die or retire before a consultant post becomes available whereas in other countries they go through a training procedure and then they are qualified to practise as a specialist consultant.  I want that to happen here and I want <Col N="155"/>to create a new specialist grade in order that when one finishes one&rsquo;s specialist registrar training, one is eligible to apply to become a consultant.  If no consultant posts are available the people concerned are forced to leave these shores.  They leave at a time when their families are growing and then when it is time to come back their children have reached the critical age of 12 years.  I gather from talking to most people who have gone abroad, that once their children become teenagers most of them have no wish to come back to Ireland because they believe they belong somewhere else and this makes life difficult.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Apart from that, there is the idea that we should consider some form of retention of our medical students when they qualify in order that we get two or three years during which they would repay the taxpayer&rsquo;s investment in them.  It costs approximately &euro;150,000 to train them.  Let us consider how much money we invest by the time they become specialist registrars.  It is closer to &euro;1 million but we are not holding on to them; we are pushing them away.  I wish to cease this and bring in a specialist grade whereby they can become autonomous clinical specialists answerable to the clinical director but independent of other consultants.  Such people could have a clear career path whereby in four or five years they would become consultants.  That would be subject to peer review and publications in journals and so on.  In other words, I wish to make clear to people here and to any doctors who might be listening to the debate that this would not be like the English grade which is a no man's land where one never gets out.  This is something entirely different, another step along the path to becoming a consultant and one that would be beneficial to our doctors and service.  We will have the expertise of these highly trained individuals here.  I need not say a gret deal more about it.</P>
        
        <P>The issue of medical students and the number of medical schools in Ireland was raised.  Senators will forgive me from crossing over ahead.  The allocation of college places to prospective students is not within the remit of the Minister for Health.  Under legislation, the universities are autonomous and academically independent institutions and they reserve the right to determine their own selection and admission criteria.</P>
        <P>In 2006 the Government agreed to a programme of reform of medical education and training which included a phased increase in the EU intake in Irish medical schools at undergraduate level from 305 to approximately 725 students.  The current EU intake in Irish medical schools is 705.</P>
        <P>Under the Medical Practitioners Act, the HSE has responsibility, in co-operation with the medical training bodies and after consultation with the Higher Education Authority, to undertake appropriate medical practitioner workforce planning for the purpose of meeting specialist medical staffing and training needs of the health service on an ongoing basis.  This includes assessing on an annual basis the number of intern training posts, the number and type of specialist medical training posts and the need for and appropriateness of non-consultant service posts required by the health service.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">The career path of a non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, following graduation normally involves one year for an intern, two to three years for a senior house officer, SHO, one or two years for a registrar and up to seven years for a senior or specialist registrar.  Typically, doctors who graduate from Irish medical colleges undertake a one year internship in the public hospital system.  Following their internship they can apply for senior house officer posts.  Alternatively, they can choose to leave the system at that point or at a later stage.  The HSE has advised that there is currently no shortage of interns in the public hospital system.  However, as Senator Colm Burke adverted to, we have had to recruit doctors from overseas because of the shortage of SHOs and registrars.  Some 450 posts were due to be filled in July this year.  Most of these posts were in service rather than training posts and it appears that the posts are not attractive <Col N="156"/>to Irish doctors.  I am afraid this may be the understatement of the year.  They are not attractive to many doctors at all.  This is what the new Medical Practitioners Act sets about addressing.  We have training posts that everyone is happy to apply for except in the case of one hospital, which I will not name and shame, because no one wants to work there although it is a training hospital.  The word has gone out among NCHDs that it is not a nice place to work.</P>
        <P>The special delivery unit has been tasked by me to bring in a protocol on behaviour for senior clinicians with regard to how they deal with their peers, juniors, other staff and patients.  This is the least we should expect.  When I was in Holland I was most impressed by a 500 bed hospital I visited.  There was no one waiting in the accident and emergency department, there were no hand washing facilities because they were not necessary since everyone was admitted to a room.  We do not have that luxury here but we will work towards it.  The hospital has four full-time staff working in customer relations.  Every year it runs a day course for everyone in the hospital from the neurosurgeon down to the porter and from the matron to the cleaning staff.  They are informed that they represent a business card for the hospital and they had better not let down the hospital.</P>
        <P>We need some of this outlook and this is what the special delivery unit will focus on as part of its work.  There should be standards of appropriate behaviour.  I put it to the staff in my surgery that no matter how bad a day they might be having they should remember that the person on the other side of the desk is there because he or she is sick and he or she is having a worse day.  This is the way it must be and we need more of it.  Many of the problems arise with those who are unhappy with the service they receive because of the attitude demonstrated, despite the fact that many doctors and nurses work under considerable pressure.  It takes only one or two people to give many others a bad reputation.  The vast bulk of our people do an amazing job in horrendous conditions and it is my job to ensure these conditions change as part of the reforms.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke asked about the group which is to deal with NCHDs and the new specialist grade.  The group will meet and I will appoint a chair and it will get on with its work expeditiously.  I have referred to the training posts and the clear targets for consultants.  This is another issue related to the work and the clinical programmes are assessing it.  The acute medical programme has assessed the number of new posts needed.  Approximately 25 posts in specific areas will be needed to get the maximum benefit and this work is ongoing.</P>
        <P>I am keen to explore the scope of the work nurses do with my Department and the nursing profession.  I believe those in the profession are up for change as well.  I am pleased that they are beginning to deliver rosters.  I am aware that certain people suggest this is a distraction but it is core to the way we do our business.  It is not possible to run a health service when someone works their entire working week in three days; that cannot be done.  That is from a different time and place.  I look forward to co-operation in that regard.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Consultants must change the way they work as well.  We have to have an arrangement where consultants are available on Saturday and Sunday to do ward rounds and read X-rays and diagnostic results to ensure patients can be discharged 24 hours a day, seven days a week, not 24 hours a day, five days a week.  I am sure there is a great deal of good will and it is forthcoming.  I encourage people to co-operate in that regard.</P>
        <P>To deal with Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s questions, under the medical card scheme, medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of general practitioner services.  Eligibility is based primarily <Col N="157"/>on means and the overall financial circumstances of the adult or civil partner, as well as any dependants.</P>
        <P>The review process is an important quality assurance aspect of the general medical services, GMS, scheme which distributes in the region of &euro;2 billion of public funds each year.  Two years is the average period nationally for which an individual or a family holds a medical card before a formal review under the GMS scheme.  The medical card review process for the over 70s is based on separate legislation and the process has been simplified to facilitate older persons who have not had a change in their circumstances.  Where changes in circumstances have occurred, the case is reviewed in the normal way.</P>
        <P>I have also taken the initiative to inquire about what happened to the discretionary medical cards issued in the past.  Under the previous health board system, the chief executive officer had discretion to issue a medical card where undue hardship was being experienced, typically where somebody had a serious illness, either terminal or otherwise.  This extended to children.  That facility is gone.  Therefore, we set up a new group within the Health Service Executive in the PCRS consisting of four doctors, including general practitioners and community health doctors, to review applications and issue discretionary medical cards.  That avenue is now open.</P>
        <P>On the broader question of including specific groups which comes up not just in the case of children but in the case of other groups such as the terminally ill, we are trying to move to a position where everybody will have a medical card.  We will endeavour to examine and expedite the cases of those who are considered priorities such as the individuals the Senator identified, but I have come to this House having spent an hour with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are between a rock and a hard place.  Some &euro;1 billion has been taken out of the health budget for this year and we have been tasked with taking more out next year.  I am doing my best to minimise this and as such, will not get engage in megaphone diplomacy here.  We all have our role to play in that regard, but I am trying to explain that we are not in a position financially to do what we would like to do and that we are not in a position to do what we will do as quickly as we would wish.  The situation is unacceptable for many.  Many have made legitimate arguments, but, unfortunately, the money is not available to address all the issues identified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the order of the House, we must conclude at 1.45 p.m.  Between 16 and 20 Senators have indicated their wish to ask questions.  I am conscious, therefore, that we need to start that process by 1.20 p.m. at the latest, if at all possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry; I am trying to deal with the questions raised as best I can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should not apologise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>In other words, we are not closing the door to the suggestions made.  We will examine them and try to expedite them.</P>
        <P>Regarding the national home care budget for sick children, a question was asked about a draft document which indicated we would cut left, right and centre.  There is no question of medical cards being taken from people who are still entitled to have them.  That would not make sense.</P>
        <P>I will try to deal with the remaining questions asked as quickly as I can.  Senator John Gilroy asked about Tallaght hospital.  I want to be clear about this issue.  Everybody knows that the hospital was in dire straits.  Representatives of the Health Information and Quality Authority, <Col N="158"/>HIQA, and the special delivery unit were in the hospital in which we now have new management.  I pay tribute to Ms Eilish Hardiman because last month the hospital stayed within its run rate for the month, notwithstanding the legacy issue.  However, the hospital is in dire straits in regard to its budget.  It is way over budget and there will be changes in that regard.  As a result of the changes Ms Eilish Hardiman has made, on one day there were no patients on trolleys, while for several days the number on trolleys was four.  When I last checked the position yesterday, there were 13 patients on trolleys at 8 a.m., nine of whom had been in the hospital for less than six hours and four for longer.  By 2 p.m. there were five patients on trolleys.  Therefore, great work is being done in the hospital.  What we want to do &mdash; what the HSE failed to do in the past &mdash; is transpose excellence from one hospital to another.  We have the team in place to do this, the SDU, which can show how things have been done in one hospital and transpose the lessons learned to another.</P>
        <P>There is a moratorium on staff recruitment.  However, we have always said we will make exceptions in particular areas where there is a need.  We have done this in the case of mammography services in Sligo.  We will examine the mental health issue, but there is a need for change in that service also.  There are many psychiatric nurses working in institutions.  We could achieve a far better effect and efficiency if institutions were closed and the nurses mentioned were working in the community.  I believe they would agree with me in that regard.</P>
        <P>I should blush at Senator John Crown&rsquo;s honeymoon comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister need not worry; he is not exactly my type.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe I covered the question about services in Limerick and Galway in my opening remarks.  I cannot go into detail, as it would hamper the work of the SDU.  When its representatives go into a hospital, they receive great co-operation and there is honest engagement.  As such, if we were to start publishing reports or making public what has been found, people will start to clam up.  I do not want to interfere with this.</P>
        <P>I have referred to management and leaders.  I accept what the Senator said about the deficiency in specialists and also his comments about there being too much reliance on non-consultant hospital doctors, not on senior doctors.  That issue is being addressed.</P>
        <P>I had intended to cover this issue in my opening remarks, but I will deal with it now because it is very important.  The effect of the special delivery unit in the North of Ireland was not sustained for a host of reasons.  First, direct ministerial involvement disappeared and, second, the underlying reforms required were not introduced.  We will not make that mistake.  We will institute the underlying reforms and leave the SDU in place as the guarantor of quality.</P>
        <P>The Senator raised another issue about the Dutch&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>Diabetes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>There are certain elements of the Dutch system that we like, but there are other elements that we do not like.  We have looked at the system in Holland in terms of the underpinning of a universal health insurance system.  We have looked at the system in Denmark when it comes to having a patient safety authority.  We have looked at the system in the United Kingdom when it comes to the hospital model trusts and in the north of Ireland in regard to the waiting list initiative.  We are taking what we believe is the best from these systems for use in ours.</P><Col N="159"/>
        <P>The Senator referred to diabetes.  An initiative is on the way which, contingent on the availability of funding, we hope to roll out.  Diabetes is one of the chronic diseases that must be addressed as a matter of urgency and tackling it is a top priority for us.  However, I am not a fan of piecemeal contract negotiations.  I want the new contract for general practitioners to be all-embracing and introduced in one fell swoop.  I do not want to have to ask what people want to look after patients with diabetes, hypertension and so on.  We are not going to go there.</P>
        <P>If I have not answered any Senator&rsquo;s questions, I apologise.</P>

        <P>In the last capital programme St. Brigid&rsquo;s unit in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital was to be replaced by a 50 bed unit.  However, it was removed from the capital programme in the interests of political expediency to allow a similar unit to be built in Kenmare.  This was done at the instigation of Deputy Healy Rae in order to gain his support at the time.  When will we return to dealing with issues properly and without political interference?  When will work on the 50 bed unit in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital included in the last capital programme commence?</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  He sent to the people of Roscommon before the general election a letter, in which he gave a commitment to retain the accident and emergency service in Roscommon County Hospital.  How does he feel about that now, in view of the fact that 44 patients are on trolleys in UCHG and 429 throughout the country?  Dr. John Barton, the Minister&rsquo;s dear colleague who wrote his policy document, has suggested he must resign or leave the country because he is not getting enough money for the service at Portiuncula.  Is the 24 hour accident and emergency service safe there?  In the light of the experiences in Roscommon and elsewhere and in the light of the commitments given by Labour Party and Fine Gael Members, will the Minister consider restoring an accident and emergency service on a 24 hour basis, seven days a week to Roscommon County Hospital?  Deputy Denis Naughten resigned, but neither Deputy Frank Feighan nor Senator John Kelly has done so.  The commitment given has been broken by the Minister who should feel embarrassed and ashamed.</P>

	<P>The length of time taken to process medical card applications is outrageous and simply not acceptable.  What proposals does the Minister have to remove the significant delays in the central processing office dealing with medical card applications?</P>
        <P>Since the cutbacks in dental treatment services in 2010, does the Minister propose to increase the funding available given the extra 120,000 people who have subsequently acquired a medical card?  Why is there such a long waiting list for orthodontic treatment for children?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister plan to revamp the home help scheme in order that in all cases the needy will receive sufficient hours of care to avoid the necessity of being institutionalised?  Home <Col N="160"/>helps have recently been prohibited from administering medication or providing drinks via a peg feed, leaving people in danger of dehydration.

	<P>In response to Senator Marie Moloney&rsquo;s question on medical cards, the Health Service Executive has centralised the processing of all new and renewal applications at Primary Care Reimbursement Services, PCRS, in Finglas with effect from 1 July this year.  The executive has stated it does not expect major delays in processing applications.  Completed applications are processed within 15 working days.  Delays occur where applications are submitted without the supporting documentation required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>

	<P>There is a revolt in the camp.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not say what is revolting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My assistant telephoned the PCRS this morning to check the veracity of this reply.  Some 83% of applications are dealt with within 15 working days.  However, there can be delays because the information required is not provided.  If there are delays of the nature mentioned by the Senator and she can cite a specific case, if she gives me the details, I will be delighted to inquire about it.  I am not in the business of misleading the House or the Senator.  At the same time, however, I have to accept what is written in black and white.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will provide the names for the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="161"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will certainly inquire about the case.  I know there were a lot of difficulties, but it is my understanding &mdash; I have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, who was also very concerned about delays &mdash; the position has improved considerably.</P>
        <P>On the long waiting list for children who need orthodontic treatment, this has been a long-standing problem.  I could read a long answer, but the bottom line is that we have inherited a problem, which is unacceptable; initiatives put on the table in the past have not been availed of and we are looking at implementing them to shorten the waiting time to at least have assessments made and treatments provided more expeditiously.  There is a shortage of orthodontists, but we need to use those available in a more clever fashion than in the past.  There have been initiatives taken in the mid-west which have resulted in a significant improvement.  I will revert to the Senator on the issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden mentioned Roscommon County Hospital.  He is right that before the election I gave an undertaking to retain services in the hospital and I did so in good faith.  Since the election, however, HIQA reported in that regard and stated it was unsafe.  I inquired of it, the clinical programmes, the Department and the HSE as to how we could make it safe and was told we could not, that it was not possible to make it so.  Therefore, there was no option but to remove the service.  I do not want to get overly political with the Senator, but the bottom line is that while money was spent on upgrading the front of the accident and emergency department, as has been explained time and again by clinicians, what one sees at the shop front is not what makes the shop work.  What a person sees in an accident and emergency department is not what makes it safe, but the services that back it up &mdash; the presence of a cardiologist with the ability to put in a stent, someone to deal with a fracture or a limb that has been severely compromised as a result of a burst blood vessel, or a stabbing.  That is what makes it safe, not the new surroundings.  It was not possible to provide for this in Roscommon County Hospital and I have no problem putting my hand up on that point.  I told the people that I would take that responsibility and I do.</P>
        <P>I will follow up on the other undertakings given and ensure Roscommon County Hospital has a bright future, that it will start to deal with more day surgery cases and have new services.  Since we last spoke in this House, plastic surgery services have commenced, with outpatient clinics and day surgery cases being dealt with.  There will be capacity to provide for endoscopies and colonoscopies.  There are a number of other initiatives planned, into which I will not go because I do not want to go down the road of promising what cannot be delivered.  I am now in a position where I have full sight of the system.  I know what can be delivered safely in smaller hospitals.</P>
        <P>This is part of the framework document on which we are working.  When we know which of 24 or 25 services listed that can be safely delivered in a smaller hospital, we have to make them fit the geographical and demographical requirements identified.  There is a great future for the likes of Roscommon County Hospital, Portiuncula hospital and the hospitals in Ennis, Nenagh, Bantry and Mallow, as well as all other smaller hospitals, but it is of a different type.  We cannot have an emergency department operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week in every hospital.  That is not possible and it would not be safe.  Let us be sure that when we put up a sign with the words &ldquo;emergency department&rdquo;, patients can expect to receive care to which they are entitled, not a service with significant variations that have consequences, depending on the hospital one attends.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are two issues relating to the hospital in Waterford.  On the provision of palliative care in St. Brigid&rsquo;s unit, a new unit was promised by the HSE, but it was removed from the waiting <Col N="162"/>list.  However, it is now being reviewed again for inclusion in the capital budget.  It will be examined in the coming months.</P>
        
        <P>With regard to palliative care, the Government&rsquo;s policy is based on a report of the national advisory committee on palliative care and is primarily concerned with quality of life.  It is dedicated to a form of active treatment designed to ensure that patients are enabled and encouraged to live their lives to the greatest possible extent in the manner and the setting of their choice.  I propose a vote of confidence in the palliative medicine and hospice movement in this country.  Before this movement developed people went to the hospice to die but that is no longer the case.  Many people go to the hospice and receive the level of care they need that allows them to return home.  Extraordinarily good work is done.  The Government is very much committed to providing more palliative care in the community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The capital proposal is at an early stage and not in the HSE plan.  An outline development control plan for the Waterford Regional Hospital site has been produced which sets out proposed future developments at that hospital and where they will be located.  Phase 1 components of the plan have been identified and are currently at business stage.  This will require approval by the HSE capital steering committee before it can be recommended for the national HSE plan.  As the phase 1 indicative development cost is in excess of &euro;35 million, it will have to go through a cost benefit analysis.  I could give the Senator a full answer later but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Perhaps for today&rsquo;s purposes the Minister might hear our views first.  We will try to fit in everybody&rsquo;s questions and if there is time at the end we can hear more of the Minister&rsquo;s views.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I nearly made a fatal error, one that would have dire consequence, namely, not reply to Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is very perceptive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Her question primarily addressed the recruitment moratorium, the numbers of people who have left and those who may leave before February.  The moratorium is a blunt instrument but we are trying to refine it to make special exceptions in areas where we believe they need to be made.  We are caught between a rock and a hard place, given the IMF-EU troika and its requirements of us.  It will not bring any comfort to this Chamber but health has led the way in that this area has reduced numbers more than others have.  We have also got close to the budgetary requirement of &euro;1 million in cuts, in a manner that most people would not have believed possible.  That is cold comfort to patients lying on trolleys and children waiting for surgery.  As Minister for Health and as a member of a Cabinet that must live under the troika arrangement, I have to live with a hard reality.  This is because of a previous Government that lost us our sovereign financial independence.</P>
        <P>There is a great deal of confusion about the February date.  The Acting Chairman will forgive me if I spend two minutes on this issue.  This is not an early retirement scheme but the ordinary entitlement of any public servant to retire.  People reaching a particular age will do the sums and say to themselves, &ldquo;In February, if I go, I&rsquo;m going to get my lump sum untouched and X, Y and Z in terms of pension.  If I wait till after February the Government has said it will change the rules and we don&rsquo;t know what those rules are yet&rdquo;.  They may jump or they may not.</P>
        <P>I asked the HSE to do a study on the risks to the system looking at the age profile of people who might choose to leave and further looking at the numbers who made inquiries about <Col N="163"/>pensions, who would be considered to present a higher risk of leaving.  I asked the HSE to look at the impact this would have in the various areas and it is doing so.  It is impossible to say with absolute certainty what will happen but we are getting a handle on likely scenarios and will make provision for them.  In other words, we will not end up with a situation where the entire senior nursing management of a particular institution leaves, with the consequent closure of the institution for that reason alone.  There might be other reasons certain nursing units have to close, financial reasons that have nothing to do with this aspect.  I will be honest, as I have been in this House and the Lower House.  I will tell people when an issue concerns safety, when staffing, when finance.  It may not be nice to hear but we will be honest.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and wish him well in a job that proved so difficult for so many of his predecessors.  His problem has more to do with resource allocation than with budgets.  I refer, briefly, to an bord snip&rsquo;s report.  On page 76, in regard to the health service, it states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Group observes that restrictive agreements and work practices, involving trade unions and professional staff organisations, have been a major inhibitor to staffing and pay efficiencies in the health sector, and a block to good quality patient-focused care.  The Group considers that such practices have no place in an efficient, modern health system which is operating under severe budgetary constraints, and in which the needs of patients should be of paramount consideration.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Will the Minister respond to that?  The numbers in the health service were increased from 68,000 staff in 1997, to approximately 113,000, an extra 45,000 staff, yet the Minister complains in this Chamber that he is short of staff.  Who is winding up politicians?  The Florence Nightingales in the Irish health service are not serving themselves other than in a very narrow way.</P>
        <P>A budget of &euro;17 billion, with 25% added when we pay privately, is a large one by OECD standards.  I put it to the Minister that there is too much specialist pleading by the medical sector, all 113,000 of them.  The Department did not realise that competing health insurance <Col N="164"/>companies would save it money.  Its hostility, towards BUPA in particular, was wrong in terms of the efficiency lost by going for monopoly in that field.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that we are going through a financial crisis but there is one good deed the Minister could achieve in the forthcoming budget.  It would not cost much.  He should grant medical cards to cancer patients without their having to go through a rigorous means test.  From years of experience as a community welfare officer I know that general practitioners wrongly advise cancer patients they have an automatic entitlement to a medical card only for them to be told by a welfare officer that a means test is required.  Ultimately, most are granted on discretionary grounds but I would like the Minister to legislate for all.  Community welfare officers never wanted to have to ask very sick people how many hens they had and how many eggs they laid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that we have a two-tier health service and that health care may depend on ability to pay rather than on need?  Does he support universal health care provision?  What steps will he take to put in place a more egalitarian health service?</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s support for the abolition of the HSE.  Will he take on board the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal of replacing the HSE with community health partnerships which would be made up in equal thirds of locally elected representatives, advocate groups that campaign on behalf of patients and State bodies?  What is the Minister&rsquo;s position on the public service embargo and the impact it is having on health services?  Rather than driving down costs in hospitals, hospitals are forced to take on agency staff.  We have seen this in Waterford, in the community care hospital in Dungarvan and in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital, where services may be curtailed because of the use of agency staff.  Rather than reducing costs the public service embargo has increased them.  What measures will the Minister take to address that situation?  I advise him to ease the embargo in the health service to enable hospitals to budget their departmental funding in a better way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I can understand Senator D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s concern about Drogheda hospital.  It is a serious concern for us too.  We have put in place this week initiatives around that hospital to support the earlier discharge of patients and more home care.  We are considering one or two other options also.  The Senator will see an improvement in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in the next few weeks and I will keep in close contact with him.</P>
        <P>Each of the hospitals of which there are eight &mdash; one of them is Galway hospital &mdash; have been asked to put forward their plans to resolve their difficulties in terms of what they believe is needed to address the issue because it is important to ask the people who are working at the coalface what they need.  As always in life, unfortunately, there is some gilding of the lily.  We have examined their proposals and are supporting those that are reasonable and properly costed, and sending back those that are not.  It is quite simple.</P>
        <P>I can tell the Senator as an aside, that one hospital spoke about an extra four hours in its acute admissions unit, the medical assessment unit, that exceeded another hospital&rsquo;s pricing for increasing its medical assessment by 12 hours a day.  There is a little bit of horseplay going on and that will be resolved but the SDU, special delivery unit &mdash; people have gone to all these hospitals &mdash; asked them for their plans and have gone through the plans with them.  I signed off on the ones that were reasonable two days ago in regard to initiatives that will alleviate the <Col N="165"/>situation.  We have left the door open for them to come back with their other proposals, but properly priced.</P>
        <P>Senator Kelly raised the issue of medical cards for cancer patients.  I addressed that in the context of the issue raised by Senator O&rsquo;Brien.  It is an area that should be looked after.  Cancer is a terrifying diagnosis for people although, thankfully, not as bad as it used to be in terms of outcomes.  Many more people survive now than did previously, but we will do anything we can do to alleviate the problems for people, given that regardless of how wealthy one is there are certain services one cannot access without a medical card.  We are examining that and the discretionary group has been instructed that people who are terminally should be considered.  However, we must remember the difference between people who are terminally ill and those with cancer.  As Professor Crown will tell us, many people who have cancer will outlive the Senator and me.  That is not to minimise the diagnosis, but, thankfully, it is not the death it was previously.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane asked if we had a two tier system.  I agree with him 100%.  He asked me what I intend to do about it.  We have laid out a five to seven year plan.  Senator Crown talked about his matrimonial analogy but I take it the other way.  This is the first time we have had political parties and a Government mature enough to say that we would love to fix it in one term but we will not be able to; it may take us two terms.  We are being honest about that.  If we can do it quicker we will, and there is nobody more keen to do it quicker than me.  I abhor the two tier system.  The American health economist, Mr. James Tussing, who was here when the capitation came in to the GMS for general practitioners, returned six years later and said he was pleasantly surprised that it had not resulted in a two tier system in primary care, yet we have it in secondary care.  We are hell bent on addressing that.  We are also hell bent on addressing the issue of waiting times.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to be positive.  I do not want to ignore Senator Kelly&rsquo;s question which I did not hear properly.  I am told it was the restrictive work practices and the bias against people.  There is no bias against BUPA or Aviva.  We want to regularise the insurance market because there are other people coming into it.  We want more competition because we believe competition gives better options for the customer.  If we introduce universal health insurance one of the things we want to do is reduce costs.  I have made it very clear to the chairman of VHI that this must be the focus this year.  There will be new negotiations with hospitals and consultants in the coming year and they must focus on reducing costs, and not just reductions to go 10% across the top or to say that those procedures belong in hospital but we want better value for them.  Those procedures should not be done in hospital; they should be done in general practice.  What are we paying them &mdash; a side room fee as well as a consultant&rsquo;s fee?  No.  We are not paying a side room fee for those procedures; they can be done in general practice.  We might even consider, and this may shock some of my consultant colleagues, that they will be paid less if they do them in a hospital than in a primary care centre.  We intend to bring the service to the patient and get the best value for money for the taxpayer as well.</P>
        <P>There are positive things happening.  I thank everybody for their time and interest in this area.  They say all politics is local but all health is local too.</P>

	<P>Absolutely.  I will respond in writing to all the Senators who did not get an opportunity to ask questions.  There is no question about that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Positive things are happening.  We have now a new colposcopy unit in the Coombe hospital.  We have allocated it the money to do up its labour suite and its theatre, which were located on two different floors.  That was unacceptable.  We have the new unit for cystic fibrosis opening in St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital in April next year but, equally, we have sent the message to the hospitals that no patient should be left waiting longer than 12 months.  Anybody who was put on a waiting list last December has to be treated by the end of this December.  We are very near achieving that.  Next year we will make it nine months and the year after that we will make it six months, then three months.  We intend to go about this in a methodical fashion.</P>
        <P>As I have said in the past, the special delivery unit has given us the headlights.  We are no longer driving around in the dark.  Next year will be a better year although a very tough year because at least we will have full visibility over our fair deal money from day one.  We will keep it centralised and watch what is happening with that.  We will have the monthly and fortnightly reporting on finance systems within hospitals to ensure that if they start to go off we will know very quickly.  Equally, we have full visibility over waiting times.  I do not want to pre-empt anything but we are making very good headway with consultants in regard to changing working practices that will allow us discharge patients on Saturdays and Sundays, make more patients have access to treatments and more patients treated more quickly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank everybody.  I restate my commitment and that of the Government to the health reform programme.  Even if we did not have the financial morass we have to endure we would still have had to change the health service because it would have broken us if we were to continue along the same lines.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I appreciate the Minister is under time pressure.  My question is one I could have placed by way of parliamentary question if there was such a facility in the Seanad but unfortunately there is not.</P>
        <P>I raise the issues of medical cards, the financial guidelines in place and the deductions allowable, with particular reference to those who suffer from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  I appreciate the disease is becoming more prevalent and affects thousands of people nationally.  Although a medical service of a good standard is available to most sufferers and the Minister and his officials are planning further developments in this regard, I have been approached recently by <Col N="167"/>a number of constituents with family members who suffer from the disease and who are ineligible for a medical card because of the income limit.  One case, about which I have not yet written but which I am sure will be appealed, concerns a constituent whose mother, who is in her mid-70s, has been refused a medical card on financial grounds.  I appreciate that the income limit of &euro;35,000 per annum for those over 70 is generous but, in this case, the family must pay &euro;3,000 per month for care and help in the house for the mother.</P>
        <P>A number of deductions can be made in the case of people under 70.  Expenses such as child care expenses, mortgages and the cost of travelling to work, and so on, are taken into account but no such considerations apply to those over 70.  Where home care for almost 24 hours per day is required, there should be a reduction in the income limit in the calculation of medical card eligibility.  I ask the Minister to review the financial guidelines, in particular the deductions that could apply to persons over 70.  I make the case for sufferers from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in particular because of the high level of care required.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.  I am sure this is a matter we can discuss in more detail in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for his inquiry.  I will explain how the Health Service Executive assesses eligibility for a medical card and takes account of one&rsquo;s circumstances.  Eligibility criteria for health services are set out in the Health Act 1970, as amended.  In accordance with the legislation, eligibility is primarily determined by reference to a person&rsquo;s residence and means.  Ordinarily, residents in the State are entitled to full eligibility or limited eligibility for public services.  Full eligibility is determined by reference to section 45 of the Health Act 1970, as amended.  Section 45(1) provides that persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner medical services for themselves and their dependants shall have full eligibility.  Persons with full eligibility and their dependants are awarded a medical card by the HSE.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the Health Act 2004, the HSE is responsible for assessing a person&rsquo;s entitlement to a medical card.  All medical card applications are assessed against the criteria set out in the HSE&rsquo;s national assessment guidelines for medical cards.  Section 45(2) of the Act provides that, in deciding whether a person should have full eligibility, the HSE shall have regard to the person&rsquo;s overall financial circumstances in view of his or her reasonable expenditure in regard to himself, herself or his or her dependants.  Therefore, medical cards are granted primarily on the basis of a person&rsquo;s means and individual circumstances.  As such, all people seeking a medical card must be assessed under the undue hardship principle.  The HSE has discretion in cases of exceptional need to provide assistance to individuals who do not qualify for full eligibility under the national assessment guidelines but where undue hardship would otherwise be caused if they were not awarded a medical card.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In view of the legislation, there are no plans to grant medical cards in respect of particular groups.  I take issue with that and do not believe we can allow circumstances to obtain in which we do not look after people with particular needs.  That is not to say specific groups, such as those with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, can be looked after in the immediate future, but I have said we are considering the circumstances of special groups and would like to be able to do something in this regard.  We are caught between a rock and a hard place with regard to money.  I am sure the Senator already knows there was a &euro;70 million overrun at the beginning of the year, and a three month overrun in the hospitals.  The budget has decreased by &euro;1 billion.  We are, therefore, not in a position to do what we would like to do as quickly we would like, but we will extend the medical card next year to those on long-term illness cards.  Specific groups, including those with diabetes, will be looked after in that regard.  The main benchmark is income guidelines.</P><Col N="168"/>
        <P Just="Left">A group of doctors, comprising the PCRS, has been appointed within the HSE to consider discretionary medical cards.  The case to which the Senator alluded will be referred to it for adjudication.  I hope it will make the decision the Senator seeks.  In the past, discretion lay with the CEO of the health board, but this post no longer exists.  The PCRS will take on that function.  I have asked it to consider, in particular, those with terminal illnesses and other groups such as those mentioned by the Senator.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a first for me also.  It is nice to see the Minister going off script.  This is what Senator Crown referred to when he spoke of leadership as opposed to management.</P>
        <P>My query relates to the processing time of redundancy payments and the steps the Department will take to ensure it is shortened.  There has been a transfer of responsibility to the Department of Social Protection.  The call centre is being staffed by the people processing the claims.  We tried to make a number of calls to it every day for a week but only received an answer once.  This has nothing to do with the staff but is because they do not have time to answer the telephone and process the claims.  We have been told they are now dealing with the claims that arrived in April, which means they will be dealing with the October claims next year.  This is obviously causing severe hardship.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is familiar with the cystic fibrosis issue in the unit in Cork because he met Build4Life and realises the provision of &euro;300,000 would allow the &euro;2.3 million project to go ahead.  The return to the taxpayer would be &euro;450,000.  These are my figures and I would appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s views thereon.</P>
        <P>With regard to mental health, 1,200 nurses are due to retire in February, thereby causing a problem.  The Minister is aware of this.  What does he hope to do about it?  Capital funding for mental health services is due to come from the sale of old institutions.  We are all aware that there is no market any more and that there is no provision in this regard.  Will the Minister clarify how the investment will be funded?  How will A Vision for Change be funded?  There are many recommendations therein.</P>
        <P>On a lighter note, I invite the Minister down to Kenmare to open the hospital, before 2012 or in 2012 or 2013, or whenever his schedule allows.  He will be informing his constituency colleagues.  We would all like to welcome him down to An Neid&iacute;n for the opening of the hospital, the campaign for which started in 1974.  I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should forgive me if I address the question put rather than the numerous ones he just raised.  Senator Sheahan and Deputy Griffin have been extending invitations to me regularly to open the hospital.  I will be very happy to do so at the appropriate time.</P>
      
        <P>The issue the Senator raised is very serious, particularly at a time of economic crisis in which many have been made redundant.  We take it very seriously.  Six months is a frightening length of time to wait when one&rsquo;s financial circumstances are in doubt and one&rsquo;s world is upside down on having lost one&rsquo;s job.  I thank the Senator for affording to me the opportunity to provide clarification on the processing of redundancy payments and the steps I am taking to improve <Col N="169"/>the service being provided.  On 1 January 2011, responsibility for administering the redundancy payments scheme was transferred to the Department of Social Protection from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  The purpose of the scheme is to compensate workers under the Redundancy Payments Act for the loss of their jobs through redundancy.</P>
        <P>Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.  All payments are made from the social insurance fund.</P><TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There are two types of redundancy payment made from the social insurance fund, namely, rebates to those employers who have made statutory redundancy payments to eligible employees and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent or in receivership or both or are in liquidation.  It goes without saying the economic downturn has placed increasing demands on this service, as well as on many others within the remit of the Minister and mine, as the requirement for medical cards increases.  In 2009 redundancy claims reached a peak of 77,000 from the previous norm of approximately 25,000 per year.  In 2010 the levels remained high at 58,731 and this year it is likely there will still be in excess of 50,000 claims.  In general, claims dating from April are being processed; therefore, the waiting time is approximately six months.  The high level of claims has resulted in increased processing times, something the Minister is trying to address in a number of ways that I will now outline.</P>
       <P>On 3 October a new redundancy payments processing system went live.  This system is fully integrated with the Department&rsquo;s service delivery modernisation programme and the focus of the initiative is to streamline the redundancy claim process, thereby improving claim processing times.  Part of the new system facilitates the scanning of both manual and online claims, which will be beneficial to the reduction of processing times.  Online redundancy claims are also facilitated by this system.  Substantial and frequent updates are provided on the Department&rsquo;s website to inform the public of system changes and advise them of processing times.  In recent weeks customers have been gaining familiarity with a new web form design for submitting redundancy claims.</P>
        <P>The Minister is planning to introduce an interactive voice response telephone answering system to stream telephone queries to dedicated teams.  The staffing resources have been restructured in accordance with the modernisation programme.  A specific team has been tasked with dealing with the backlog element of redundancy claims.  The Department has also allocated some temporary additional staff to this area and the Minister intends to add more in the coming weeks, approximately five staff in total, equivalent to more than 25% of the staff currently assigned to processing payments, to tackle the processing of claims.  Many other elements of change are being incorporated into this area of operation to maximise process improvements and improve customer service.</P>
        <P>The Minister and I are acutely aware of the financial hardship faced by many households and it is my expectation the steps outlined will result in improved processing times which will alleviate many of the difficulties being faced by customers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the Minister is aware of the issue.  However, I am concerned that only five additional staff members have been allocated which, in essence, constitutes an increase of 25%.  This is not a huge increase in the allocation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister go back to his Cabinet colleague and ask for an increased allocation?  The allocation of an additional five staff members to deal with the 50,000 <Col N="170"/>claims in 2011 will not decrease the rate by a significant amount.  There are staff members within the system who could be reallocated and I ask that more be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that, on the face of it, five sounds like a very small number.  However, as it constitutes an increase of 25%, I ask the Senator to await developments in the next couple of weeks to ascertain how this affects the service.  If it does not have the desired result, I certainly will convey the Senator&rsquo;s concerns to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, who is particularly concerned about this issue.  As the period coming up to Christmas will be a difficult one, the Government certainly does not wish to leave people feeling uncertain regarding their redundancy payments any longer than is necessary.</P>

    <sTitle>Garda Stations</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the opportunity to raise a serious issue, namely, cuts to the Garda budget this year and beyond and the impact this might have on services to the people of Dublin North-East.  Earlier this year we were privileged to have the visits to Ireland of President Obama and the Queen.  I understand the policing aspects of these visits cost &euro;35 million but the benefits for tourism and other sectors of the economy undoubtedly far outweigh the costs.  At the time we were led to believe by the Government that additional funding would be provided for the Garda budget this year to avoid being obliged to make cuts to normal Garda services to cover the cost of the visits.  This is entirely appropriate, given that there will be a net gain to the Exchequer overall from the visits and it is only right that money should be provided from other areas to ensure the preservation of policing strength this year.  </P>
        <P>In May the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, stated the Government was &ldquo;anxious to ensure that the capacity of the Garda to provide a full and proper service ... would not be [in any way] impaired&rdquo; by the cost of the State visits.  However, almost five months later he has confirmed to the D&aacute;il that there still is no agreement between himself and his colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on providing more money for the Garda budget.  It is now the end of October and the year&rsquo;s end is approaching swiftly.  At this late juncture one may suspect that funding will not be provided for the Garda to cover the costs of the State visits.</P>
        <P>In response to a question in the D&aacute;il last Tuesday from my colleague, Deputy Dara Calleary, Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Front Bench spokesperson on justice, the Minister stated he had asked the Garda Commissioner to examine the possibility of making savings in future years to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na budget by cutting the opening hours of Garda stations and closing some stations nationwide.  In recent weeks there have been worrying reports that the stations in Malahide and Howth are among those in line to get the chop from the Government.  Were this to happen I would be extremely concerned, as would my colleague, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, who looks after the Dublin North area.  Malahide Garda station serves Portmarnock in Dublin North-East and Malahide and its hinterland in Dublin North.  The Government had discussed previously &mdash; in fairness, its predecessor also had been given proposals &mdash; possible savings with regard to small rural stations.  I refer to stations in which only one garda is based in an area and in which the community could be better served by having that garda out on the beat all the time, rather than being based in a building.  However, far from being small stations, the station at Howth has 40 garda&iacute; based in it, while 36 garda&iacute; are based in the station at Malahide.  In other words, these are huge stations serving busy urban areas.  In conjunction with the Garda stations located <Col N="171"/>at Raheny and Coolock, they provide an incredibly important service for the people of Dublin North-East.</P>
        <P>Consequently, I have two issues on which I seek a response from the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, on behalf of his ministerial colleague.  There is much concern about this issue in the area from which I come and people seek a clear and fair answer from the Government at this stage to learn what is being planned behind the scenes.  First, will the Garda budget be afforded additional funding this year to meet the cost of the State visits and avoid essential front-line services being cut nationwide?  Second, will the Minister of State and the Government rule out the closure of Malahide, Howth, Coolock and Raheny Garda stations?  While Malahide and Howth Garda stations were mentioned in the media articles, one has no idea what other stations are being examined by the Government.  The Minister of State should respond clearly on these two issues.  All Members will agree that local Garda stations provide an incredibly important service for the community and even in the context of the recession, if one cuts money from such services now, one will end up paying for it in the long term.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice and Equality and Defence, Deputy Alan Shatter, has asked me to thank the Senator for raising this matter, as it provides him with an opportunity to clarify the position on the important topic she has highlighted.  </P>
        <P>Before I continue, I know Members will join me, on behalf of the Minister, in again sending our deepest sympathy to the family, colleagues and friends of Garda Ciaran Jones who  was swept away while helping members of the public in the most hazardous of conditions last Monday evening in County Wicklow.  Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this dreadful and sad time.</P>
        <P>It is important to put in context the matter raised by the Senator.  Under plans agreed by the previous Government as part of its compliance with the terms of the EU-IMF agreement, Garda numbers are to be reduced to 13,500 by the end of this year and by a further 500 to 13,000 by 2014.  However, what will ultimately determine the sustainable level of Garda numbers is the level of budgetary provision that can be made for the force in the coming years.  Difficult decisions will have to be made right across the public sector to bring the public finances back into balance.  This means the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, like every other public sector body, is going to have to manage with reduced resources.  The Garda Commissioner is, therefore, reviewing all aspects of policing operations, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations.  No decision has been taken on the closure of any Garda station or a reduction of public opening hours in some stations.  However, the Garda Commissioner will have to address these issues as part of the review.  He may have to consider whether, in appropriate cases, a better policing service could be delivered to a local community by having Garda members out on patrol rather than in a station.  The Minister will carefully consider the outcome of the review and the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s policing plan for next year with the objective of ensuring priority is given to the maintenance of front-line Garda services at the highest level possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On behalf of the Minister, I pay tribute to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at this particularly difficult time for the commitment and professionalism it displays in carrying out its duties, as exemplified recently by the selfless sacrifice made by Garda Ciaran Jones.  The Minister is confident that the Garda will continue to maintain the confidence of the public and operate successfully, as it has been doing so effectively since the foundation of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the Minister of State did not rule out the closure of Howth or Malahide Garda stations.  Has the Government a list of Garda stations in north-east Dublin <Col N="172"/>that it is considering for closure or downgrading?  While I accept the Minister of State claims no final decision has been made, when it is, it will be too late for people in the area to make their dissatisfaction clear to the Government.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State confirm if extra moneys will be given to the Garda to cover the cost of the State visits during the summer, as originally promised, so as to avoid cuts to front-line services?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Justice and Equality is in discussions with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, with the Garda Commissioner, on dealing with the cost of the State visits.  We are faced with difficult economic challenges, passed on to us by the previous Government, and money is not that freely available.  However, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, is following up on the issue of these costs.</P>
        <P>As I stated, the Garda Commissioner and Garda management are reviewing policing operations.  When the review is completed, the Minister will let both Houses know &mdash; he has stated he will leave no Member in the dark &mdash; when he has made a decision, unlike the previous Government which did not inform either Members or the public about decisions it had made to cut services or the reasons behind them.</P>
