    <Title>Death of Former Minister: Expressions of Sympathy</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I indicated yesterday that we would pay a brief tribute to the late Brian Lenihan today.  I suggest that each party or group leader be given a maximum of five minutes in which to speak.</P>
        <P>I was deeply saddened to learn last Friday that Deputy Brian Lenihan had died.  He was a man of great intellect and integrity.  He was totally committed to public service.  He bore his illness with courage and fortitude.  Those of us who heard him speak of his challenge on various occasions were struck by his tenacity and continuing to fulfil his public duties while holding the most difficult ministerial portfolio at the most difficult time in the country&rsquo;s economic history.  The widespread and heartfelt tributes that have been paid to Brian in recent days demonstrate the high regard in which he was held across the political system, the country at large and overseas.  Although he was a first-rate academic and brimming with ideas, he always made time to listen to the ideas of others.  He was full of charisma, witty and engaging.  Even at the darkest hours, he was always good-humoured.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Minister of State with responsibility for children, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, ultimately, Minister for Finance, Brian regularly made time to address and debate with the Seanad.  On such occasions, he demonstrated his great grasp of policy and shared his ideas and vision on each brief he held.  He was always respectful of the ideas and vision expressed by Members of this House.  Brian&rsquo;s passing is all the more upsetting because of his young age.  The untimely death of such a young, talented and committed public servant is very distressing for all of us who worked with him.  Of course, at this time we must remember those closest to him.  I extend my condolences to his wife, Patricia, his children, Tom and Clare, and all his family and friends.  I also express my sincere sympathies to Brian&rsquo;s aunt, Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, who is a former Leader of this House.  I know she is deeply saddened by his untimely death.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P>We had an opportunity to say a few words yesterday.  I hope Members will understand if there is some repetition today.  I thank the Leader for his kind words and the Government for the assistance it gave to Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s family.  I refer to the preparations for the funeral and the opening of books of condolence, for example.  My wife&rsquo;s family comes from Dublin West.  When I went to Laurel Lodge on Saturday, I was taken with the depth of feeling in the area.  Some 9,000 people, many of whom are not of any political persuasion or of all, queued for hours to sign the books of condolence.  One could feel how upset people were, particularly in Dublin West, having lost a friend.  Brian was a friend, first and foremost, to all of us.  He took an absolute interest in those of us who started out in politics in 2004.  I was what was termed a &ldquo;lowly councillor&rdquo; at that stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Brian had a deep knowledge of every constituency and every facet of life.  He was always there to help and to assist.  His death is a tragic loss for us in Fianna F&aacute;il and for all parliamentarians.  We have lost a friend and a genuinely great politician.  In some instances, there is a tendency to overstate what people were about and what others felt about them.  The one measure of Brian is that people said good words about him when he was here as well.  He always showed incredible courtesy and respect in his dealings and engagement with people.  He never rushed.  He gave time to everyone.</P><Col N="381"/>
        <P>Brian had immense respect for this House.  It is appropriate that, later this evening, we will discuss the first part of the reform of the Seanad.  Many of my colleagues will be aware that, as Minister for Finance, Brian spent hours in this House, particularly on the night of the bank guarantee.  He respected this House and the mandate everyone held.  At the funeral Mass yesterday, we saw the hundreds of people who had travelled to that beautiful church out in west Dublin.  The heartfelt tributes paid to him over recent days really have hit a public mood in relation to him.</P>
        <P>When he was diagnosed with his illness, Brian had the ability when all of us were working to make one forget that he was battling such a battle because he kept working in the interests of the country.  Every decision he took and every initiative he brought about, from when he was Minister of State with responsibility for children, through the justice portfolio, finance and, indeed, when he was Chairman of the all-party committee on the Constitution, was in the interests of the country.  He was what one would term a true patriot.  He was someone who put his country first in everything he did.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On behalf of our side of the House, I formally express sympathy to Brian's wife, Patricia, his children, Tom and Clare, his mother Ann, his brothers and sisters, especially Conor, a former colleague of ours, and Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, a former Leader of the House, who are deeply upset at this time.  I hope the thousands of people who turned out for Brian and who signed the books of condolence, and the messages, cards and letters that have been sent from all over the world will be of some consolation and comfort to them at this difficult time.</P>
        <P>The second reading at the Mass yesterday was from the second letter of St. Paul to St. Timothy, which, I believe, from talking to people, was one that Brian selected himself.  It finishes: &ldquo;I have fought the good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.&rdquo;  That is really what Brian encapsulated to me.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am glad also to have the opportunity to join in the tributes to the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, on behalf of the Labour Party and on my own behalf because I knew him personally. He will be sorely missed in a number of capacities.  We focus here, I suppose, on his life as a politician, but he had a very successful and eminent career otherwise, and that should not be forgotten.  He was a former law student at Trinity.  He was very bright and an active participant in college life.  He left Trinity and went into practice at the Bar, where he rose swiftly to become a senior counsel.  He was a highly regarded senior counsel at the Bar and a huge number of his legal colleagues - I saw them yesterday at the funeral - came out to pay tribute to him as well.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Brian also had a strong and excellent academic career, taught at Trinity on a range of different subjects and was very highly regarded.  When I first joined the law school, he was a part-time lecturer because he was very busy at the Bar, but he was also active in political life.  There was a famous notice that went up in the law school on the event of his election to the D&aacute;il in the by-election in Dublin West, which stated, &ldquo;Brian Lenihan will be unable to give his evidence lecture today as he is taking up his seat in the D&aacute;il&rdquo;, which I think the students appreciated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On his career as a politician, as Senators Cummins and O&rsquo;Brien detailed already, Brian was an excellent choice as Chair of the joint committee on the Constitution.  He brought all his legal strength and intellectual rigour to that.  He was also a very strong and very successful Minister of State with responsibility for children.  That, as his first ministerial appointment, must be emphasised because a range of people at the funeral yesterday had known him in that capacity, had worked on children&rsquo;s rights in non-governmental organisations and had very good things to say about him.  He brought enormous dynamism and energy and a commitment to <Col N="382"/>reform to that role and to the role of Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform which he held for a short time before he was made Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all were impressed at the speed with which Brian mastered the finance brief, his immense competence and the courtesy with which he dealt with that brief.  Others have spoken about the long nights in this House, the long debates he oversaw and the way in which he engaged with Opposition and Government alike.  With those of us who disagreed with him, he would engage intensively and was always happy to continue debate, argument and discussion outside the Chamber.  That level of engagement, with detailed mastery of his brief, are qualities that will be sorely missed in politics.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I offer my sympathy and the sympathy of the Labour group in the Seanad to Brian's wife, Patricia, a Circuit Court judge, to his children, Tom and Clare, and, of course, to his extended family, among them the former Leader of this House, Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.  This was a man who bore his illness so bravely and apparently so lightly, and it was such a terrible illness.  The level of regard for him is shown in the immense number of tributes that have been paid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On behalf of the Independent group, I, too, pass on my deepest sympathy to the late Deputy Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s family, to his wife, Patricia, to his children, Tom and Clare, and to all his friends and colleagues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to focus on Brian's work as Minister of State with responsibility for children from 2002 to 2007, because that is where I knew him best.  He was a true children&rsquo;s champion.  He was the first to secure a seat at Cabinet for the children&rsquo;s portfolio as a so-called super-junior Minister, but he really transformed that role.  We have seen the progression even more so lately.  During his five years in the post, he was responsible for the creation of the Office of the Minister for Children and he appointed the first Ombudsman for Children.  He engaged rigorously and seriously with the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child&rsquo;s process on monitoring Ireland&rsquo;s performance.  He also reformed areas such as youth justice and early years education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Significantly, I remember Brian's national play policy which saw the creation of a significant number of playgrounds throughout the country.  Often, as politicians, to promote playgrounds does not always seem popular and I think he had to refer to the youth justice and early intervention programme, or something similar, when he was talking to the Department of Finance about playgrounds, but they are so important to childhood and he led that sphere.  One will see those playgrounds throughout the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Brian also introduced the universal preschool year, which he defended as Minister for Finance.  It is an important initiative that I hope will grow.  He also introduced and commenced the national longitudinal study, from which I hope we will reap the rewards of learning of what works for children and what does not.  These seeds have been planted and these trees will bear fruit.  We will see in years to come what he did.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Most of all, I remember Brian's work on the Constitution, both as Chair of the all-party committee on the Constitution &mdash; as a young person, I remember going before him asking for the voting age to be lowered &mdash; but also on children&rsquo;s rights in the Constitution.  In November 2006, the previous Government announced its intention to strengthen children&rsquo;s rights in the Constitution.  This was the time when people were questioning whether this should be done rather than when it should be done.  I remember on 2 January getting the first of quite a number of telephone calls from him because he had spent the entire Christmas consuming and reading every book, article and anything he could on the Constitution.  He was brimming with ideas and I had to come in at the earliest opportunity.  This led to a serious and deep engagement of telephone calls very early in the morning and late in the evening where he would sound one out.  Many of us were used to those sounding-out telephone calls.  For me, it showed his personal commitment to children&rsquo;s rights and to strengthening the Constitution.  When he was Minister <Col N="383"/>for Finance, even with all the difficulties, he earmarked &euro;3 million, which is still earmarked, for the holding of a referendum.  He was a true friend and I will always be grateful for his passion, intellect and dedication to children&rsquo;s rights. As a Minister, he openly, collaboratively and respectfully engaged with non-governmental organisations.  With many others, I will carry on the fight - his fight - to strengthen children's rights in the Constitution and will do so knowing that he gave us a helping hand, and that he did this above and beyond the call of duty.  May he rest in peace.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a nice and simple portrait not far from here in the halls of this House of the late Brian Lenihan senior.  I have often had occasion to look at it, especially when I have had guests in the House, and to think how fitting it was that there would be a portrait of that man because it was unusual to have the portrait of a modern politician who did not hold the office of Taoiseach, Ceann Comhairle or Cathaoirleach.  I have had the sad thought lately, however, on many occasions as I passed that portrait with friends and when on my own, of thinking that the date might come soon when we would wonder whether it would not be fitting to put up a similar portrait of Brian Lenihan junior because it was impossible not to admire him.  He was a natural, a Renaissance man, a man of tremendous intelligence, but his approach to knowledge was both playful and respectful.  It was a joy to listen to him.  It has been said he had a great respect for this House.  He had a great respect for politics and democracy, and he took his brief very seriously indeed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It has been said, I think justly, that Brian probably shone most in his role as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  That was natural because of his own professional background.  Those who suggested a number of years ago that there was something inappropriate about barristers having to deal with the financial challenges facing the nation did not reckon on the speed and ability with which he would master his brief.  He did so quickly and even if there is disagreement about some of the decisions taken, no one could doubt that the decisions Brian Lenihan took were taken with great intelligence and integrity and having regard to the knowledge at his disposal and to the best of his judgment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have said Brian was a delight to listen to and I remember one occasion in particular.  We were marking the 70th anniversary of the coming into force of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  Our former colleague and Senator, Eoghan Harris, wrote about it in his newspaper column subsequently.  It was a joy to listen to Brian on that day because he was talking about a subject he knew so well.  He gave such a rich insight into the Constitution.  Those who seek to detract from our Constitution or diminish its glories would have learned many a lesson worth learning that day from listening to him as he put it into its historical context and explained the nobility and scope of it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Brian was a man capable of making the most dull or complex subjects interesting. With others, I listened in fascination during various debates here, including debates on NAMA and finance.  Perhaps because he was a natural teacher he had the ability to use language.  Even when he used a word that was not in most people&rsquo;s vocabulary, one knew from listening to him that he was using the word exactly suited to his meaning and one also knew what he meant.  That came from his great communication ability.  We all have reason to be thankful to him because he showed what politics could be.  Given his great interests he was a man who could have had many careers but it was always clear from listening to him and being with him that politics was his natural career.  It has often been said, fairly, that our politics is mediocre.  There is much mediocrity about Irish politics and the way we do it here but he was a man who could have played on any stage.  Many of us have reason to be grateful to him.  I was delighted <Col N="384"/>to hear Senator van Turnhout speak from her particular area of expertise &mdash; it is an important area &mdash; about the various and impressive contributions that he made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I admired Brian's role on the all-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, especially the way in which he handled the hearings and inquiries that led to the 2002 abortion referendum which, in my view, should have passed.  However, my focus here today is on the impressive way in which he mastered that brief and brought in all sides, heard their views and the issues were teased out properly respecting the role of the Oireachtas as a place where these issues should be teased out.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a personal note, I always enjoyed meeting Brian and I remember one particular occasion.  It is appropriate to mention it because it took place in the fairly public setting of the Members&rsquo; restaurant.  I was called back one day as I was leaving.  &ldquo;Senator&rdquo; he said.  He would always address one by one&rsquo;s Oireachtas title.  He sought to talk about medals.  One great thing about Irish life is that when people are at a time of challenge people&rsquo;s generosity shows in a big way.  Brian had experienced a great outpouring of sympathy and solidarity from people and had received relics, miraculous medals and letters of support of every kind.  He wanted to ask me about them and he probably knew that I might have some interest in the subject.  I knew enough to know that my job would be best done by keeping silent because the man I was going to talk to knew a good deal more than me about it and, sure enough, he did.  For the next ten minutes he expounded on the subject of medals, cures and so on.  I recall that it was playful but deeply respectful.  He respected and appreciated deeply the solidarity that people were showing to him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My colleague, Senator Quinn, wishes to have it remembered that even in his illness Brian came in here during the last days of the D&aacute;il to help ensure that Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill would pass in the Seanad.  It would be one of many fitting tributes to Brian if that Bill were to be brought forward and completed in the D&aacute;il in early course.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Many others could outline similar stories about how impressive Brian Lenihan was.  It was a privilege to be there with the many people who gathered at his removal and subsequently at his funeral.  The sadness that we all feel for his family, his wife, Patricia, and his children, Tom and Clare, is also a sadness we feel for ourselves.  However, it is tinged with hope that we will meet Brian again, that we will enjoy his great company again, that we will listen to him as he engages with the same wonder and joy that he did with all his knowledge in his all-too-short life and that he will engage in the great mysteries now.

      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Government for affording us the opportunity to express our sympathies on the passing of Brian Lenihan.  His death was met with great sadness, not only within the Fianna F&aacute;il Party but throughout the political spectrum and the island, not only in this state.  I extend my sympathies on behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in party to Brian&rsquo;s wife, Patricia, his son, Tom, his daughter, Clare, his extended family and his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues here today who knew Brian personally and who worked on a day-to-day basis with him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I knew Brian in my previous capacity as a policy adviser for Sinn F&eacute;in.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien spoke of how when they worked on a day-to-day basis with him it was easy to forget his illness.  I am aware personally that he did not let his illness take over his life and that he worked in a Trojan capacity and with great dignity on all the issues facing the Department of Finance.  When I first started my job as a policy adviser and a parliamentary assistant, going into the Department of Finance and meeting the Minister was a big deal.  However, I was met <Col N="385"/>with nothing but respect and friendliness.  Brian Lenihan was a true gentleman and treated us all with respect.  He brought us in and told us how it was but there was no animosity.  It was genuine friendliness and it saddened me on Friday to learn of his passing.  I was with Senator Wilson at the time and I had to reflect personally, remember him and recall how he had treated me and my colleagues in the Department of Finance.  I extend my sympathies to his family, friends and everyone who knew him personally.  May he rest in peace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to be associated with the tributes to the late Brian Lenihan, having known him for the number of years he came into the House.  He was probably the best attendee as a Minister in this House.  He came into the House with every Bill he brought through.  I was always struck by his good humour and his use of the language.  He was never in bad humour, always good humour.  He had great respect for the House and one thing he would have wished for this House was for it to continue.  He always elaborated in the House on the Seanad and how it was an important part of our institutions.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I wish to be associated with the vote of sympathy to Brian's wife, Patricia, his daughter, Clare, and his son, Tom, to his extended family, including Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, a Leader of the House for several years, and to Conor, a Member of the D&aacute;il, who used to come into the House as a Minister of State.  Brian is a great loss not only to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, but to the nation.  Whatever brief he was responsible for, he was always on top of it.  Whether he knew what he was talking about, one always believed he knew exactly what he was talking about.  He had a great use of the language.  As Senator Mullen said of his use of words, we always seemed to understand the words he used at particular times.  It was a joy to listen to him in the House and to take advice from him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was also struck by the fact that Brian seemed to know everyone by his or her first name, an unusual thing in the Oireachtas in which there are 220 Members.  In particular, Ministers do not appear to know Senators, something I have come across on numerous occasions.  However, Brian knew everyone by his or her first name and it is a great tribute to him that he did.  I wish to be associated with the expression of sympathy to his wife, Patricia, and family.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week in the House my colleague, Senator Mark Daly, indicated that he had information to hand suggesting that, in some instances, developers were in a position to purchase back discounted loans from the National Asset Management Agency through offshore companies.  On the Order of Business yesterday the Government Chief Whip, Senator Paul Coghlan, stated his view that Senator Daly had abused the privilege of the House, a charge I do not accept.  The concerns expressed by Senator Daly were raised by the Taoiseach, <Col N="386"/>Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s party leader, earlier this week.  Without making any more of it, I ask that the comments made about Senator Daly be withdrawn, given that the Taoiseach shares his concerns.  Moreover, this is a matter that should be examined by the House in some detail.</P>
        <P>In Private Members&rsquo; time last week we debated a motion on the flat-rate water, utility or household charge &mdash; or whatever the Government intends to call it &mdash; to be introduced next year.  I was grateful to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, for making a statement to the House.  He was not in attendance for the entire duration of the debate, but I understand it is not always possible for Ministers to do so.  However, we on this side of the House are no clearer on what the Government intends to do on 1 January 2012.  Will the Leader confirm whether a flat-rate household charge will be introduced at the beginning of next year?  The Minister certainly did not make the position clear last week.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leader for allowing additional time on Second Stage of the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011, as it is an important Bill which will set in train the Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative.  While I very much welcome aspects of the proposal such as the changes proposed to the rate of VAT and the travel tax, I ask all Members to consider the amendments my party has tabled to the Bill.  The fundamental issue is that the jobs initiative which was initially announced as a &ldquo;budget&rdquo; will be paid for by a raid on ordinary workers&rsquo; private pension funds through a levy of 0.6%.  It excludes approved retirement funds and existing annuities which are generally the preserve of wealthier people.  While I welcome the introduction of a jobs initiative and parts thereof, I absolutely abhor how it is proposed to be funded.  It sets a very poor precedent in punishing the very people who are making provision for their retirement in order that they will be less of a burden on the State when they cease working.  A levy of 0.6% over a four year period will, in the case of defined benefit schemes which are under ferocious pressure, lead to a reduction of 9% to 10% in pensions being paid to existing pensioners.  The Minister for Finance has received a great deal of correspondence from the Pensions Board and various pension schemes asking him, if he is to proceed with the levy, to consider including approved retirement funds in order that there would be a sharing of the burden of this raid on private pension funds.</P>

	<P>I, too, welcome the allocation of three hours for the Second Stage debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011 and the Leader&rsquo;s indication that we will have an opportunity to raise several issues with the Minister.  One of the issues we must discuss is how to fund the jobs initiative.  I welcome Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s indication that the Opposition supports the initiative.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>He also referred to the changes to the rate of VAT and the travel tax.  We must all bear in mind that the Government is between a rock and a hard place in terms of the IMF-EU deal.  It is a real difficulty.  We need to debate the basis upon which we will fund an initiative, but it is clear that such an initiative is needed and that it is very difficult to identify a source of funding, given the constraints as a consequence of the activities of previous Governments in the last 14 years.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader allow a debate on the training of garda&iacute;?  This issue will be debated on the Adjournment this evening and several Members raised it yesterday with the Minister for Justice <Col N="387"/>and Equality in the course of the debate on the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  The announcement that recruitment of garda&iacute; through the college in Templemore will be put on ice for several years is a source of great concern.  The Minister said yesterday that his hands were tied by the IMF-EU deal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Senator indicated, this issue will be discussed on the Adjournment this evening.  Perhaps Senator Terry Leyden will share time with her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I will speak with the Senator.  However, the issue deserves a fuller debate.  The Minister has pointed out that the IMF-EU deal requires a reduction in the numbers of garda&iacute;.  We must examine how best that can be achieved.</P>
        <P>I welcome the announcement today that an investigation will be held into the treatment of women and girls in Magdalene laundries.  The establishment of an interdepartmental committee is an important step towards what I hope will be fuller redress and apologies for the women and girls who spent so long incarcerated in these institutions.  I pay tribute to the Justice for Magdalenes campaign and the individuals who have pushed for this for years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>Never would I have dreamed as a young girl growing up on the western seaboard of the United States of America that I would be given the special right &mdash; that is the definition of privilege &mdash; to add my voice to those of my distinguished colleagues on all sides of the House.  I am grateful to both the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach for this trust.  However, this gift of privilege is also one of power and in my time in the House I commit to a performative notion of power, that is, power understood not so much as something we possess but as practices that can be performed together to change the structures, dominant cultural norms or the laws &mdash; especially the laws &mdash; where they render people excluded, marginalised, unfree or invisible.</P>
        <P>There is an ethical urgency to the work we are doing together and it is imperative that we attend to the various interpretative lenses we bring into the way we order and conduct our business.  I wish to focus on two of these lenses which I hope to bring to my work, shaped largely by my reflective experiences of those I have worked alongside in the past 28 years in Ireland.  First, I wish to bring the lens of appreciation for the diverse ways of being human.  Diversity is integral to the essence of humanity.  For example, the moral worth of a younger person is equal to that of an older person.  An acceptance of this perspective leaves one to conclude that lawmakers ought to scrutinise laws to ensure there is an appropriate and equivalent amount of protection, resources and rights for each human being at whatever point he or she is at on the continuum of age.  If, as I believe unflinchingly, a society of equals in Ireland will only be established by mutually respecting diversity and difference, then I bring a sense of urgency to my position in this House to ensure that laws are passed that accept and normalise diversity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Second, I intend to bring a social justice lens to our economic and financial challenges.  This will encompass a rigorous commitment to efficiency and effectiveness but in a way that is fair and that invests in social, as well as in economic entrepreneurship, in the social and community sectors, as well as in small and medium enterprises, research and development and multinational corporations.  Both types of entrepreneurship are required to get Ireland working again.  The social sector has lessons for the economic one and the business and change management models hold great potential to solve some of our most trenchant social problems.  The Cathaoirleach and Leader should note these are some of the reasons I intend to propose the motion tabled by the Independent group this evening.  I look forward to outlining some of the implications these reflections hold for how Seanad &Eacute;ireann will conduct its business at that time.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="388"/>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be wrong for Members not to welcome the Government&rsquo;s announcement of an interdepartmental committee in response to the initiative of the Justice for Magdalenes group and to examine bringing about what has been well described by the Government as a restorative and reconciliation process.  My hope for the work of the aforementioned committee is, first, that it will be given the time it needs to do its work and, second, that it will enjoy co-operation and goodwill from all parties involved.  I do not doubt but that the religious orders and State parties will be forthcoming in the provision of full information and records to assist the committee in doing its work.  It has been stated that the United Nations Committee against Torture and the Irish Human Rights Commission already have found the State wanting but it is important that the committee should do its work.  It would be interesting to consider whether or at what stage the Seanad could have a debate on the issue, whether Members should await the outcome of the committee&rsquo;s work or whether they should have some input in the meantime.</P>
        <P>I hope there will be a fair assessment of the undeniable cruelties of our past and that the work of this committee may lead us in the direction of avoiding unnecessary playing of the blame game.  I seek an honest examination of all the issues involved, including the poverty that was very much part of the Ireland of the past, a reasonable examination of those orders which provided care when nobody else would, as well as consideration of the responsibility of the families in these cases, who in many cases were extremely derelict in their duties.  There often can be an attempt to scapegoat church and State and while church and State may well be deserving of blame, perhaps insufficient attention has been paid to the role of, and dereliction of duty within, families.  This also must be part of the story.  I wish that committee well and hope its work eventually will bring healing and more to those who undeniably were wronged in the past.</P>
        <P>It also is the case that a referendum on judges&rsquo; pay will be held in October and given the rate at which referendums are being announced, it may not be necessary to hold a constitutional convention as the Constitution will undergo radical reform in any event if all these referendums pass.  On the issue of judges&rsquo; pay an unhealthy populism should be avoided.  There are extremely good reasons for the constitutional entrenchment of judges&rsquo; pay.  In the past, judges were subject to bribery and to threat.  For example, one scholar has noted that Charles I of England got into the habit of putting questions to judges about the legality of his proposed actions and the fear of instant dismissal exposed those judges frequently to the temptation of giving him the answer they knew he sought.</P>

Given the straitened circumstances in which we find ourselves, it of course may be necessary to give constitutional backing to the right of the Government to propose a reduction in judges&rsquo; salaries, but one must remember&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I ask the Leader to consult the Government on whether it <Col N="389"/>might not be necessary to introduce compensatory legislation that might establish with more force than ever that it would be a criminal offence to seek in any way to interfere with the independence of a judge by offering any kind of threat or inducement, direct or indirect, in any way.

I also welcome the decision by the relevant orders of sisters to co-operate with this committee and note the Justice for Magdalenes group has welcomed the Government&rsquo;s decision.  In the circumstances a speedy resolution is important. However, I remind Members the Minister already has made up his mind in this regard as he has stated there is "irrefutable evidence that this State and the courts colluded in sending young women to what were then known as the Magdalene asylums".  The Minister should provide evidence and facts to back up the statements he made in the D&aacute;il on 17 December 2009 because the information I have to hand suggests he already has made up his mind.  He stated then there is "irrefutable evidence as a consequence of court records and files that have been examined in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform" but he has not confirmed that in his actual statement.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise an issue which the Minister for Social Protection must address.  A regulation was passed in the 2008 budget whereby disability benefit can only be claimed for the period of two years.  The ramifications of this decision are now coming home to roost because people are being taken off their disability benefit and being told to apply for invalidity pension, which is very long-term, or disability allowance, which is a means-tested payment.  Two years may seem a long time to be on a disability benefit but it applies in the case of cancer sufferers and those with ongoing serious illness.  A man in my constituency has undergone surgery over a period of two years and he is awaiting further surgery.  His disability benefit has been discontinued.  He was told to apply for an invalidity pension but his application has been refused.  While I appreciate the system may be open to abuse, surely it is preferable for the medical personnel to decide whether applicants are genuinely sick.  I would welcome a debate in the House on this issue which the Minister must address as people are suffering.  This man has paid contributions for 40 years and now he has nowhere to turn to get money.</P>

	<P>I think all Members of this House would have liked to have said a few words about the late Brian Lenihan but, from my point of view, the opinion of the Independent university group was eloquently expressed by Senator Mullen and I do not propose to add further to it because the matter was handled in a very dignified way.  I shall write privately to the Lenihan family.</P>
        <P>I am particularly interested in what Senator Zappone said and she spoke with remarkable clarity, intelligence and dignity.  We must proceed with dignity in this House and I ask the Government parties and the Independent group nominated by the Taoiseach, to get together by lunchtime to see if it is not possible to incorporate the slight Government amendment to this proposal.  We demean the Seanad if we call unnecessary votes.  The amendment tabled by the Government could possibly be accepted by the Independent group.  This very important matter would have greater strength if it were put through unanimously and I think we all would like that to happen.  I ask the Leader of the Government parties and the Independent group to meet through their Whips to see if this is possible as this would avoid an unnecessary vote that would make this House look silly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am very glad the Government has established an inquiry into the Magdalene laundries.  I do not think the remit is quite wide enough and I would prefer it to be slightly wider.  I asked originally for the three things the Magdalene survivors asked for, which are an apology, an inquiry and some degree of compensation.  Those three elements should be incorporated in the inquiry.  I agree completely with Senator Mullen that there should be no scapegoating.  I do not <Col N="392"/>think I have ever done so.  I have always stated that it is a mistake to label any large group of people &mdash; in fact, any group of people &mdash; within which there will be good people and bad people, people who behave responsibly and those who behave irresponsibly.  Some orders of nuns have been mentioned in particular.  Some of them undoubtedly behaved very badly but I have also met representatives of those sisters abroad and they have done this country a great service in their work.  We should avoid labelling people.  I was a little surprised &mdash; I am sure it was not intended &mdash; when Senator Mullen said, rightly, that neither the Church nor the State should be scapegoated.  I maintain they must be held accountable in a dignified fashion for their actions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am glad to say that he is now nodding because it might appear to some people in reading the text that he was scapegoating the families.  Those families were in desperate circumstances.

	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the HSE annual report for 2010 which has been published today.  Given that the HSE budget for 2010 was &euro;14.2 billion and it is proposed to spend &euro;13.4 billion in 2011 in the delivery of health services, it would be appropriate to ask the Minister to come to the House in order that Members, as public representatives, can have some dialogue and discussion with him regarding the published figures for 2010.  There have been some significant achievements by the HSE but I think all of us would have major concerns about some aspects of how the services are being delivered.  We have difficulties in our own area regarding our local hospital and its future and there was some discussion last night about Roscommon hospital.  In light of there being &euro;800 million less to spend on health services in 2011, it would be appropriate to have the Minister come to the House to hear the concerns of the Members on how the HSE does its business and to reflect on the results for 2010 which have been circulated to all Members today.</P>

	<P>I wish to say how sad I am on the death of a good friend and colleague, Brian Lenihan.  There is no more to say as regards anecdotes or praise of the man because it has all been said, but I am very sad still.</P>
        <P>The issue has been raised about the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, coming to the House.  The Minister made himself available in the House for the very uncontroversial and universally supported Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill and I was glad he was able to be here.  However, he was not available to come to the House with regard to the issue of Navan hospital which I raised on the Adjournment, nor was he available when Roscommon hospital was raised in another Adjournment matter.  I know also that when Senator Imelda Henry was speaking about Sligo hospital, he was not available to come to the House.  It is very unfortunate.  It is crucial that the Minister for Health comes to the House to talk about local <Col N="393"/>hospitals.  He spent most of the past two years travelling around Ireland campaigning for hospital services in local areas.  While he has very important work to do with regard to the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill, he should also discuss the local issues which were an important part of the election campaign.  I note that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, made himself available to come to speak about an important financial issue I had raised.  If the Minister for Finance is available to come to the House on an Adjournment matter, the Minister for Health should also be available.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance is away this week doing very important work.  However, the Leader had promised that we would discuss a wide range of issues during the passage of the Finance (No. 2) Bill, such as finance, the IMF and the European Union but we are unable to do so because the Minister is unavailable.  It is important, therefore, to have a special debate on the various issues in that Department.  Senator Bacik misinformed the House this morning that the IMF agreement required a reduction in Garda numbers but the IMF agreement does not mention Garda numbers.  One of the features of the IMF agreement is that junior bondholders be burned, yet Ministers are claiming credit for that every day of the week.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Leader might ask the Government to hurry up the bringing forward of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill to give power to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who was on television last night pontificating about Government policy and what the Government had achieved.  After 100 days in office the Minister has no power because the Bill has not been passed by the D&aacute;il or been brought before the Seanad.  It is very unfortunate that the Minister, when asked last night what he was doing about the deficit, had to give the frank answer, &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo;.  It is a source of embarrassment for the Government that the flagship Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has no power.  The Leader should tell the Government to get a move on.</P>

	<P>I have a concern about the signage plan of the National Roads Authority which is removing iconic signs all over the country.  We do not want our beautiful country roads, particularly those in scenic areas, to be turned into boring American-style boulevards with generic signage and viewpoints throughout.  In north County Clare from where I come there is some iconic signage that has been in place for many years.  One particular sign in the Ballyvaughan area was removed by the NRA a number of months ago.  Given the fact that it was photographed by millions of people from throughout the world, it proved to be one of the attractions in the area.  Many signs erected during the years are part of our street and road furniture, tourist product and what makes this country different.  In recent times the authority has adopted a one-size-fits-all approach in terms of what it perceives to be important and the changes are masquerading under the guise of road safety.  We all believe road safety is important and if signs are causing difficulties for people and creating road safety issues, they must be removed.  However, where there are examples of beautiful signs that are part of the fabric of the country and its tourist product and that have not been the cause of any accidents, there is no reason they should be removed.  I ask the Leader to speak to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government who should ask the NRA to explain why it has adopted a one-size-fits-all approach, failed to enter into dialogue and engage in consultation with communities which have emotional and logical reasons for keeping signs and why the ball is being kicked between it and local authorities in terms of who is responsible for what, as there seems to be confusion about the matter.  There is definitely public anger.  They are all State agencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>On the point made by Senator Martin Conway, I know the sign in Ballyvaughan to which he referred, which is wonderful.  Anybody who has not seen it should have a look at <i>The Irish Times</i> today which carries a great picture of it.  I agree with the Senator.</P>
        <P>For 20 years or more there has been very serious concern along the east coast from County Down to County Wicklow about the Sellafield nuclear plant which has been raised in the House on many occasions during that time.  To a certain extent, when the tsunami hit Japan and there was a nuclear emergency, we were very concerned that the same could happen to any nuclear plant.  When the European Union decided to conduct a safety test on all 143 nuclear plants in Europe, there was a certain sense of relief.  However, it was announced last month by the British authorities that they did not intend to include the plant at Sellafield in the examination.  I do not understand this decision.  The spokesperson for the British authorities sounded like Mrs. Margaret Thatcher who once said, &ldquo;Out, out, out,&rdquo; when she replied, &ldquo;No, no, no.&rdquo;  They claim the plant does not produce nuclear energy and is now a reprocessing facility.  Therefore, they do not intend to include it in the safety audit.  I know the Minister has spoken to the Secretary of State with responsibility for the plant.  However, to the best of my knowledge, he has not received any word which would put his mind at rest.  Will the Leader make sure the Minister receives an answer and tells us whether the plant at Sellafield will be included by the British authorities in the examination of nuclear plants?  I happen to be one of those who believes nuclear power has a future and that we should ensure, if we are to have it as a energy source in the future, it is safe.  There are very serious concerns about its safety.  An effort is being made to ensure safety tests will take place, but the plant at Sellafield has been excluded from the audit.  Will the Leader make sure we receive an answer from the Minister on whether he has succeeded in getting an reply on this issue?  Are we still waiting for a response such as that given by Mrs. Margaret Thatcher &mdash; &ldquo;Out, out, out&rdquo; &mdash; although we have stated we are concerned about the issue?</P>

	<P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to fast-track the referendum on the rights of children?  It is almost six years since the all-party joint committee on the Constitution came to a decision that the rights of children, as enshrined in the Constitution, were not adequate.  There has been a considerable debate on the issue and it would be a fitting tribute to the late Deputy Brian Lenihan who did so much work in this area if the referendum was held sooner rather than later.  I also ask that it be held independently and not cluttered with other referendums.  The rights of children are so important to society at large that a special referendum should be held.  It is a very sensitive issue.  Prior to Brian Lenihan being appointed Minister of State with responsibility for children, the joint committee on the Constitution engaged in a public consultation process for almost 18 months.  The membership of the committee was broadened to include representatives of Sinn F&eacute;in, Independent Members and so on and it was unanimously agreed that a referendum should take place.  Some <Col N="395"/>of the blame must lie with the last Government; perhaps it was too lethargic.  This will be one of the most important referendums ever held in the history of the State.  If we cannot hold it this year, given the Presidential election etc., I respectfully ask the Leader that it be a priority for the Government next year.</P>

	<P>I would like the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to attend the Seanad to discuss the irregularities in the service provided at the Passport Office on Molesworth Street and the difficulties many members of the public are experiencing in trying to have the telephone answered to find out the exact fee for obtaining a passport at a quicker rate, as well as the service available to Oireachtas Members.  It is important that this service is restored, in particular for Members who represent rural areas.  If the system, including the Department and the Passport Office staff, cannot provide the service that was offered at one stage &mdash; particularly for Members travelling from rural constituencies &mdash; then the only alternative is for passport offices to be established in the regions.  In that way, members of the public could obtain a requisite level of service.  It is totally inappropriate that, for example, a group of young Donegal students due to travel abroad this weekend applied for late passports but cannot receive details from the Passport Office as to when the documents will be ready.  They have had to phone an Oireachtas Member for assistance and even then it is difficult to get the co-operation that would be expected from the Passport Office.  We need clarity in that regard. </P>
        <P>The second issue I wish to raise, which was also raised by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, concerns the need for clarification on utility or water charges.  We need urgent clarification on this matter but unfortunately it was not forthcoming following last week&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion.  We need clarity for a number of reasons, but primarily because people need to know whether they will be faced with utility charges from January 2012.  In addition, increased waste charges are being proposed by the Government in the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be coming before this House in the coming weeks.  That will represent a further increase in charges for the collection of household waste nationally.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should attend the House for an urgent debate on agriculture.  It appears that the new Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is not fully sincere about the objectives in the Food Harvest 2020 report.  Last Wednesday, funding schemes available to farmers were suspended, even though 50% of funds available for the &euro;90 million scheme was coming from the EU.  That means that 50% of the available funds from Europe cannot now be made available to Irish farmers.</P>

        <P>I am sure the 0.6% pension levy will be raised under the Finance (No. 2) Bill which will be taken today.</P>
        <P>Senator Mark Daly raised an issue which has already been referred to on a couple of occasions.  I understand that the chairman of NAMA, Mr. Frank Daly, requested and had a meeting with Senator Daly on that matter.  He asked Senator Daly to substantiate the allegations that were made in this House.  Senator Daly, however, was unable to provide any <Col N="396"/>evidence in that regard.  Those statements concerning Senator Daly were made by Mr. Frank Daly of NAMA at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly conference yesterday morning.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not wish to be difficult, but more to the point, an accusation was made that Senator Daly had effectively abused the privilege of the House.  It was put up to him by the Government Chief Whip to make those comments outside the House, which he did.  He was raising a concern that the Taoiseach had also raised.  I am not talking about the overall issue, but I think it was something that should not have been said in the House.</P>

        <P>Senator Mullen made a number of points concerning the Magdalene laundries, which were also referred to by Senators Leyden and Norris.  A committee has been established to investigate this matter and hopefully a restorative and reconciliation process will begin.  I suggest, however, that we should await the committee&rsquo;s report before having such a debate here.  It would not be advisable to do otherwise at this point in time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards judges&rsquo; pay, personally I do not think the proposed referendum is an encroachment on the independence of the Judiciary.  However, Senator Mullen and I can agree to differ on that matter.</P>
        <P>Senators Leyden and Byrne referred to Adjournment motions and the need for the line Minister to attend such debates.  The line Minister will attend the House where possible.  Senator Leyden knows that the practice of having one Minister to take Adjournment motions has been going on for a long number of years.  It is not possible to have the line Minister in for all Adjournment motions but, as Senator Byrne stated, only a week or two ago the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, attended the House for a motion when he was available.  In addition, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, also attended the House for an Adjournment motion.  Therefore where senior Ministers are available they will certainly attend the House, as has happened already.  It is totally unreasonable, however, to expect line Ministers to attend the House for every Adjournment motion concerning their Departments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Moloney rightly raised the issue of disability benefit and problems concerning her constituents in this respect.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill will be coming before the House soon, and she can raise the matter with the Minister at that stage.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullins referred to the 2010 HSE report and I will certainly consider having such a debate.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, has already attended the House and will do so for many other matters that need to be debated in the coming months.</P>
        <P>Senator Conway referred to the iconic sign in County Clare and road signage generally.  It is strange that the National Roads Authority would not have had consultations with the local authority involved before removing this sign.  It is regrettable that did not happen.  I will raise this matter with the relevant Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn raised the important point of Sellafield and the safety audit to be carried out on nuclear plants throughout Europe.    As the Senator correctly stated, the Minister has made <Col N="397"/>representations to his counterpart in the UK.  I will try to ascertain what reply, if any, has been received and will ask the Minister to continue to press this important item of concern for the people of Ireland.</P>
        <P>I believe the matter of the Private Members&rsquo; motion will be sorted out this evening such that we will have one common motion.  We all want to see reform of this House and of how we do our business.  We will all look forward to that debate during Private Members&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan that the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights should be held separately from any other referendum, which is contrary to what Senator Leyden asked for last week.  I will try to ascertain the current position, the reason for the delay and when it is proposed to have this very important referendum.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the matter of the service provided by the Passport Office.  Quite a number of complaints have been made about it and Members have expressed complaints about it in the past few weeks.  I do not know whether it is possible to have the Oireachtas service for rural Members, in particular, but it is a matter we can raise with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill also raised the question of having a decentralisation of the Passport Office.  A very successful passport office operates in Cork.  As to whether it would be necessary to have offices in other regions is a matter for the Minister and I am sure that he will give it consideration.  I will also at an early stage try to arrange for a debate on agriculture and fisheries.</P>
        <P>The committees will be announced tomorrow.  A number of Members have talked to me about the committees and who should and who should not be on a committee and so on and so forth.  I have tried to facilitate every group and every Member.  I hope that tomorrow when all the committees have been announced Members will be happy with the committee to which they have been allocated.  There was a question that some Members may not be members of committees but we ironed that out with the Government Whip and every Member will certainly be on at least one committee in the coming Seanad.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While an amendment has not been tabled in respect of the issue I wish to raise, will the Minister for Health consider the matter?  This morning, I received a comprehensive 31-page legal opinion regarding extraterritorial jurisdiction courtesy of Amnesty Inter<Col N="398"/>national.  The opinion is that of Ms Maria McDonald, BL.  I am unsure as to whether the Minister has seen it, but careful consideration should be given to the issue.</P>
        <P>Section 4(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Bill refers to &ldquo;a person who is a citizen of Ireland or is ordinarily resident in the State, and would constitute an offence in the place in which it is done.&rdquo;  This rules out cases in which the act is carried out in a place where it is not illegal, which means the person could not be charged in Ireland.  This is not the position of the UK legislation, under which the person can be prosecuted if the procedure is carried out in a country where it is not illegal.</P>
        <P>The legal opinion, which was passed on to me by a Seanad colleague, cites a number of cases, in particular a judgment of Chief Justice Mr. Kevin O&rsquo;Higgins.  The Lotus case in international law dates back to 1927 and the Chief Justice referred to it during a case that related to Article 26 of the Constitution and the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 1975.  He stated: &ldquo;It is established in international law by the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Lotus Case that every sovereign State has power to legislate with extra-territorial effect in the sense that it may enact that acts or omissions done outside its borders are criminal offences which may be successfully prosecuted within its borders &mdash; this is sometimes called the jurisdiction to prescribe &mdash; provided that the events, acts or persons to which its enactment applies bear upon the peace, order and good government of the legislating State&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This seems to suggest there is no reason not to incorporate the relevant provisions in this Bill, as was the case in the UK.  While it has been claimed that Article 29 of the Constitution prevents us from introducing such legislation, the legal opinion I have cited seems to hold a different view.  Will the Minister consider it?  It is unfortunate that, according to the figures we have received, 3,000 women in Ireland have undergone the procedure.  More than 1,300 of those are from Nigeria.  Under section 3, a person who removes a girl or woman from the State can be prosecuted.  However, a person involved in carrying out the procedure in another state where it is not illegal can only be prosecuted for removing the girl or woman and not for carrying out the procedure.  I ask that the Minister take another look at this matter.  I will try to make the opinion available to him.  I have already discussed this issue with the Minister&rsquo;s departmental officials who have outlined the reasons this cannot be included.  However, I believe this issue should be revisited prior to the Bill going before the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate my thanks to Amnesty International and Ms Maria McDonald for supplying us with the opinion.  I believe the requirement in section 4(1)(<i>c</i>), that an offence would constitute an offence in the place in which it is done, would benefit re-examination before going to the D&aacute;il.  As stated by Senator Colm Burke, this is not the case in British or Scottish legislation.  I have also raised this issue with the Department and I am conscious there are Irish constitutional reasons the principle of dual criminality is included.  The danger is that this may undermine the import of the legislation.</P>
        <P>In most African countries, such as Nigeria, FGM is an offence.  However, the concern is that in a state like Somalia where there is less state authority this might not be an offence.  There are may also be other states where it may not be offence.  I am conscious also that Article 44 of the European Convention on Violence Against Women, which is quoted by Maria McDonald, provides that state parties should ensure their jurisdiction is not subordinated to the condition that the acts are criminalised in the territory where they were committed.  I know that the Minister, his officials and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office have already looked at this issue but I ask that this matter be briefly looked at again prior to the Bill going to the D&aacute;il.  If FGM is regarded as a crime against humanity or equivalent to torture then there is an argument that <Col N="399"/>the normal rule of dual criminality perhaps should not apply in this case.  I hope the Minister might review the matter one more time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators Burke and Bacik for raising this important issue.  As acknowledged by Senator Bacik, the Department is aware of the work done by Amnesty International and its report on the need for dual criminality provision.  We have sought advisory counsel&rsquo;s advice on the matter.  In the meantime, current advice stands.  However, as Senator Bacik pointed out there will be an opportunity between now and when the Bill goes to the D&aacute;il to look again at this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill includes a requirement of dual criminality governing an act done by an Irish citizen or a person ordinarily resident in the State.  As already pointed out, this does not apply in Scotland or England.  However, they do not have a constitution, we do, which makes this necessary.  That is the advice we have received to date.  Where extraterritorial jurisdiction as opposed to universal jurisdiction is exercised, it almost inevitably includes a requirement for dual criminality.  Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights is of particular relevance as it provides that no person shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed.  I acknowledge that convention has not yet been fully signed up.</P>
        <P>Ireland is involved in a draft Council of European convention on preventing and combating violence against women.  Under the terms of this convention the practice of FGM is condemned and it provides that there should not be a dual criminality requirement.  The removal of dual criminality from FGM legislation could be revisited if the convention is ratified.  Senator Bacik referred to Somalia as a state wherein FGM is not an offence.  However, I can assure her that there is a long list of countries wherein it is an offence, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria &mdash; a country in respect of which there are serious concerns given we have a number of people from Nigeria living here &mdash; Senegal, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda and Zambia.</P>
        <P>I take on board the points raised by Senators Burke and Bacik.  We will take another look at the issue.  We do not want any loopholes in this law that would allow people who perpetrate this terrible violence against women to have any comfort.</P>

	<P>During the course of my Second Stage speech, I mentioned that my officials were reviewing the Bill to strengthen provisions in relation to the victim.  I now propose to make an amendment to explicitly state that victim impact evidence provisions would apply to offences set out in this Bill in accordance with the Criminal Justice Act 1993.  This provision would allow a victim of a FGM offence or, in certain cases, a representative for her to make an oral statement, commonly called a victim impact statement, at a sentencing hearing.  This statement allows the court to hear what impact the offence has had on the victim.  This amendment is in line with current provisions concerning other serious crimes against the person.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome this amendment.  I commend the Minister and his officials for including this provision in the Bill, as the Minister indicated in his Second Stage speech he would.  It is important that victims of FGM would have an opportunity, if they so wish, to speak to the court in regard to the impact the offence has had upon them.  It is very important and significant for victims of sexual and other offences against the person to have this facility in the court room.  I commend the Minister for including this provision in the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the passing of this Bill and the support it has received from all sides of the House.  That is commendable and shows the importance attached to the Bill.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister and the previous Minister for their work and I particularly thank the Minister&rsquo;s officials from the Department of Health who have worked very hard on the Bill since the first version of it was introduced as a private Members&rsquo; Bill last year.  It is important that we pass legislation specifically criminalising this gross violation of the rights of women and children, that there is clarity around the law on it and that we have given good consideration to the provisions of the Bill.  I know it has been through the Department of Justice and Equality and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and, as the Minister said, various advices have been sought from advisory counsel.  I am glad to hear this and believe it is a mark that the Bill will withstand scrutiny and will be robust.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill is of huge importance, not just in sending a deterrent message or a symbolic message for members of different migrant communities here, but also for those working in the front line with such communities, for NGOs working with women and children who may be survivors of FGM and for doctors and the medical profession.  I pay tribute to the many NGOs which have fed into this process and which have worked for many years on the need for legislation, including AkiDwA, the Irish Family Planning Association, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the National Women&rsquo;s Council and all the different organisations I named on Second Stage, all of which have fed into the Bill and made recommendations that have strengthened it at different stages.  I also highlight the role of Amnesty, whose last minute briefing was very helpful to us on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>A great deal of work has gone into the Bill.  I thank all who had an input and again thank the Minister and his officials.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his support for the passage of the Bill and for the Government amendments.  I again thank Senator Bacik for instigating the Bill and thank all parties, including my own, for their support in its passage.</P>
        <P>I will make several general points.  We should all be mindful of the importance of enforcement and of ensuring the laws which are enacted upon the passing of this Bill are effective and comprehensive, and that the resources are available to ensure those laws can be implemented.  If the legislation is to be effective, resources are important and I hope the Minister will be mindful of this.</P>
        <P>It is important that we keep this legislation under review.  While the Bill has just been passed and we hope it will have the intended effect, a number of concerns have been raised.  Senator Bacik referred to AkiDwA and I will highlight some of the concerns it raised.  One of the issues for AkiDwA concerned the defence or protection of mental health, which could conceivably be used not merely for surgical or cosmetic purposes but for the defence of the act of mutilation itself.  The Minister will appreciate it is important that it be clarified that no such defence could be offered and that the legislation is robust enough to ensure that such a defence could not be used.  It is important that we tighten whatever potential loopholes may exist and I hope the Minister will clarify this point.</P>
        <P>I am aware of concerns in regard to the offence of aiding and abetting and the possibility that this may cover all instances of coercion that could occur.  Coercion is a significant issue in the context of FGM.  I am sure the Minister will agree it is important that the legislation offers as complete a protection as is possible in regard to the possibility of coercion, and that this possibility should remain under review and should be taken into consideration by the Minister.  I am sure the Minister is mindful of the concerns raised by AkiDwA and other civil society groups which have been campaigning on this issue.</P><Col N="402"/>
        <P>The laws we are passing are robust enough.  The Bill gives a clear commitment by the State, its people and its public representatives that we will not tolerate this act and that the laws should be robust enough to defend people against these kinds of acts taking place.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that all of the health issues, both physical and psychological, which affect women who have undergone these acts are met by the Department of Health.</P>
        <P>The issue of direct provision was raised at the previous sitting and it is an issue the House could revisit.  I have serious concerns about the whole process of how we treat asylum seekers.  We are dealing here with vulnerable women and serious concerns have been expressed by those who advocate on behalf of immigrants that the direct provision centres can create an &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo; attitude.  This should not be the case.  The issues should be very much in mind and we should be mindful of any violence which may be perpetrated against anybody in these centres by members of their own community or anybody else.  I hope the Minister will reflect on this point.  I ask that the required health services are available to women who are victims of this act as a matter of priority.</P>

	<P>The Chair has given latitude in recent weeks due to the significant number of new Members who may not be totally familiar with procedure.  In an attempt to be helpful to Senator Cullinane and to others, it is normally a courtesy of the Chair to allow the spokesperson at the end, once the Bill has passed, to acknowledge the passage of the Bill.  The remarks Senator Cullinane contributed would be made, I respectfully suggest and for future reference, prior to the final consideration and passage of the Bill.  There is not a facility, once the Bill has passed, to have what is essentially a Second Stage speech.  I am just attempting to be helpful to all Members, not specifically to Senator Cullinane, because it is obvious that one must become aware of the procedures involved.  The Chair will give Senators that latitude prior to the final passage of the Bill, which will be the Fifth Stage.  I hope the Senator will accept this in the spirit in which the Chair offers the advice.</P>

	<P>I congratulate Senator Bacik for bringing forward this matter and for being to the forefront in ensuring it has reached this stage, which is long overdue.  As I said earlier in the debate, this issue was raised with me 19 years ago.  It has moved on in most other European countries and I am delighted Senator Bacik has brought it forward and pressed on with it.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for having his Department take the issue on board.  It is important legislation, particularly given the number of people who have come to Ireland from countries with different cultures.  There may be issues in regard to the procedures that are accepted in a cultural context in other countries and people from those countries may feel the same culture should apply in the new country to which they move.  People are put under extreme pressure and it is important we send out a clear message that these are the laws we have in place.  We must ensure it is an offence for a person to try to take another person out of the country.  It is important this is a comprehensive Bill, which, when enacted, will send out that clear message.</P>
        <P>It is important to acknowledge the work done by the many voluntary organisations through the years in seeking this change in legislation and in following it through all the way and sticking with it.  It is unfortunate it has taken so long.  A draft Bill was brought to the House in 2001 and it has taken ten years for legislation to finally go through.  Perhaps there is an issue in regard to the effective use of the Seanad in dealing with this type of legislation in that we must make sure it is not long-fingered.  I thank the Department and Senator Bacik for ensuring we reached this stage and that the legislation will be enacted in the not too distant future.</P>

	<P>I join others in welcoming the passage of the Bill.  I congratulate Senator Bacik who pioneered the legislation and hope the Bill has a speedy transition through the other House.  Some issues with regard to a legal opinion have been raised and I am sure the Minister will consider that with his officials between now and then.  I hope the legislation moves quickly and that it does not sit between the Whips in the other House.  The officials have said it will move through the D&aacute;il and be enacted very quickly.</P>
        <P>I said in my contribution the last day we discussed this issue that it was a shame that when legislation such as this is brought forward in the Houses, the media benches remain empty.  It is hypocrisy in the extreme for the media to offer a comment on the future of the Seanad, its workings, what it does or should do when it  treats the Seanad with contempt and ignores legislation like this that is initiated and passed here and ignores the leadership being shown here, on this occasion by Senator Bacik.  I will bring forward private Members&rsquo; Bills and other Bills over the coming months and hope the media will choose to engage in the processes which will take place and help to inform the public before they make a decision.  Heretofore, the public has been very much led down a specific path by the media.  However, that issue is for another day.</P>
        <P>I welcome the passing of the legislation and hope it has a quick transition through the other House, notwithstanding the Minister&rsquo;s deliberations on the legal issues which have been raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bacik for promoting this important Bill which sends a loud message about this country&rsquo;s attitude towards the well-being and safety of our citizens and those who wish to become citizens.  I thank all other Senators who took part in the debate and my officials who have been extremely helpful to me and other Senators on the issue.  I also thank my predecessor, Ms Mary Harney, for her positive attitude towards the Bill.</P>
        <P>We will take on board the concerns outlined, but I will not reopen Second Stage of the Bill to address them.  Most issues have been addressed comprehensively, and there will be an opportunity to address them again.  In particular, I will take on board the lengthy legal opinion from Amnesty International with regard to dual criminality.  I take this opportunity to comment on some of the contributions on the manner in which immigrants to this country have been treated in the past and the length of time it takes for a decision to be made on their application for citizenship.  I am happy to announce that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, is addressing this issue in a serious manner.  He has brought proposals to Cabinet, which have been passed, and these will lead to matters being dealt with in a more timely and efficient fashion, to the benefit of all.  It does not do us any good, nor does it reflect well upon us, that people who come here seeking asylum are left in limbo for years.</P>
        <P>I thank all those who contributed to this debate and thank the Cathaoirleach for his courtesy.  I will endeavour to expedite the passage of the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator Burke on his election as Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  As this is my first opportunity to <Col N="404"/>come to the new Seanad, I congratulate my colleagues on all sides after what must have been the most gruelling and difficult election in western Europe, and wish them success over the course of the coming four or five years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011 is to introduce the necessary changes to taxation legislation which give effect to measures announced on 10 May by the Minister for Finance as part of the jobs initiative.  One of the key drivers behind this initiative is the need to underpin the labour market.  We recognise that the employment content of export-led growth is relatively low, notwithstanding its major potential to contribute to our economic recovery.  Accordingly, employment-rich sectors such as tourism are being targeted, additional activation measures are being introduced, and the balance of capital spending is now being tilted towards labour-intensive projects.  The Government recognises that this initiative is not a complete solution but is yet another important step in addressing the problem of unemployment and in boosting confidence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The economic outlook is still highly uncertain.  Nonetheless,  there is now a growing consensus among domestic analysts that our economy is moving on to a positive path.  Improvements in our cost competitiveness are clearly paying dividends in the form of renewed export momentum and inward investment.  We are trading our way out of recession.  Our strengths include our young and well educated workforce, favourable demographics and our strong pro-enterprise, pro-business environment.  The fundamental strengths of the economy remain and will support growth in the medium term.  Building on and developing these strengths is one of the principal drivers of the jobs initiative.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Unfortunately, it will be some time before the improvements in exports have more tangible effects on the ground.  This is because domestic economic conditions remain weak, an inevitable consequence of the unwinding of the excesses built up during the boom.  I do not need to remind Senators that the economy has experienced an extremely sharp downturn in recent years.  Gross domestic product, GDP, has contracted in each of the past three years and is now around 15% lower than it was at its peak in mid-2007.  This reflects a substantial decline in construction activity and falling consumer spending.  Therefore, there is a requirement to improve the job creation environment &mdash; a challenge the Government is meeting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Improving labour cost competitiveness is a key instrument in creating that improved environment.  That is why we are halving the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI until end-2013 on jobs that pay up to &euro;356 per week.  Reducing the costs to employers of taking on new employees is vital if we are to support job creation.  This measure will complement the targeted VAT relief in the labour intensive tourism sector and help create more jobs in that sector of the economy.</P>
        <P>This is not a measure to be covered only by the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, is legislating for the reduction in employers&rsquo; PRSI in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2011.  Equally, the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill may include, as a Committee Stage amendment, a measure for the abolition of the charge to employers&rsquo; PRSI on share-based remuneration, with effect from 1 January 2011.  The imposition of this charge on employers has the potential to negatively affect current employment levels and future investment decisions as it needlessly increases the costs of doing business in Ireland.  Businesses operate under strict budgetary control and in the current economic climate increasing their costs is unwise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Minister for Finance stated, when he announced the jobs initiative in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, this country does not have the resources available to fund large-scale policy initiatives to help to generate economic activity.  He also made it clear that any costs associated with the measures the Government is implementing as part of this initiative must be paid for.  This will be achieved <Col N="405"/>through the introduction of off-setting measures to ensure that the measures are budget-neutral over the period from now to 2014.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We recognise that this means the stimulatory effect on the economy of this package will be less than it would be in an ideal world but its importance is that it represents the first step by the Government towards improving the competitiveness of vital sectors of the economy and enhancing the functioning of our labour market.  We will build on this initial step, with a view to developing this Government&rsquo;s vision of rebuilding a prosperous and productive economy as opposed to the one we were handed when the election was over.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Finance (No. 2) Bill has been drafted specifically to give effect to those taxation-related measures which the Minister for Finance announced in the jobs initiative.  These measures include the research and development tax credit; the suspension of the air travel tax; the introduction of a second lower rate of value-added tax; and the introduction of a pension levy.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Section 1 relates to the research and development tax credit. Senators are aware that the corporation tax regime is a vital element of our industrial policy.  I was glad to see my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who was in the United States in recent days, making it abundantly clear to US investors and business world, and to the international community, that the 12.5% corporate tax rate has an absolute guaranteed position from this Government.  That position enjoys cross-party support in this House and the other place.  If we are to try to reboot the economy with confidence, it is absolutely crucial for us to uphold it.  One should not tinker with, tamper with or alter such a key driver of Irish industrial policy.  In effect, almost 250,000 jobs are at stake, directly or indirectly.  The Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and all other members of the Government have issued a clear message.  Despite the attempts of a small group within the European Union to argue and lobby for a change in our position, we are remaining rock solid in that respect.  The 12.5% rate will remain.  It will not be altered.  Despite the arguments advanced by a minority, there will be absolutely no change in that regard.</P>
        <P>There are various methods by which companies can account for the research and development tax credit.  For example, they can do so as a &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; reduction in corporation tax liability or as an &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; write-off against operating costs.  As part of the jobs initiative, the Minister for Finance announced that he intended to amend the research and development tax credit legislation.  Accordingly, this section amends the research and development tax credit provisions, primarily for the purpose of enhancing the flexibility for accounting purposes for the research and development tax credit on an &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; basis.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness for research and development activities has played and continues to play a critical role in encouraging foreign direct investment and creating employment.  The Government intends to continue to enhance that attractiveness.  The purpose of the scheme which is open to companies of all sizes is to encourage research and development in this country and thereby improve the economy and increase employment.  A credit of 25% of the incremental spend on research and development is available for this purpose.  The scheme has been enhanced in most years since its introduction to improve its effectiveness.  The latest change which is being made in this Bill represents a further such enhancement.</P>
        <P>The fruits of the tax credit scheme are evident when one considers that of the 79 new investments secured by IDA Ireland from existing clients in 2010, 37 or almost 50% were in the area of research and development.  The value of the investment in Ireland arising from these new research and development projects is approximately &euro;500 million.  It also involves a considerable number of jobs.  There have been calls by some for more to be done in this space.  The programme for Government contains proposals for further improvements to the research and development tax credit scheme, subject to the outcome of a cost benefit analysis.</P><Col N="406"/>
        <P>Section 2 of the Bill relates to the air travel tax.  It amends section 55 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 to empower the Minister for Finance to appoint, by order, a day on or after which passenger departures would not be subject to the tax.  As part of the effort to boost tourism, provision is being made for the air travel tax rate to be reduced to zero or suspended.  The commencement of this measure is subject to agreement being reached with the airlines to bring in additional passenger numbers.  My colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, is holding discussions in that regard.</P>
        <P>A review of the measure will be conducted before the end of 2012.  If it is considered unsuccessful, the air travel tax will be reapplied.  Consequently, the relevant legislative measures will remain in place to allow for them to be recommenced if so required.  The cost of this measure, based on an implementation date of 1 July, will be &euro;15 million in 2011, &euro;90 million in 2012 and &euro;105 million thereafter.  The suspension of the air travel tax is just one of a number of approaches being taken as part of the jobs initiative to reboot and revitalise the country&rsquo;s tourism industry.</P>
        <P>Section 3 amends the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 to provide for a second reduced VAT rate of 9%, in respect of certain goods and services, for the period from 1 July 2011 to 31 December 2013.  The rate will revert to 13.5% thereafter.  It is estimated that this measure will cost &euro;120 million this year and &euro;350 million in a full year.  As announced in the jobs initiative statement, the 9% rate will mainly apply to restaurant and catering services; hotel and holiday accommodation; admissions to cinemas, theatres, certain musical performances, museums and art gallery exhibitions; and a range of other things set out by the Minister.  The purpose of this targeted VAT relief is to boost tourism and stimulate employment in the tourism sector.  I am confident that it will give the industry a much needed shot in the arm.  To ensure the sector is delivering, however, the effects of the changes will be assessed and the measure will be reviewed before the end of 2012 in the context of preparing budget 2013.</P>
        <P>Much economic activity within the tourism industry is highly intensive in its use of labour.  This is particularly true of hotels and restaurants, recreation and entertainment.  However, tourism continued to decline last year, in terms of the number of trips and total earnings.  It is undeniable that the industry is facing significantly challenging circumstances.  If we can get things right, however, it will also face a major opportunity.  If it recovers the ground lost in recent years, it can make a substantial contribution to our economic recovery and the creation of employment in all parts of the country.</P>
        <P>Overall, our tourism product is strong.  In addition to its natural attractions, Ireland has a wide range of high quality accommodation to suit all tastes and budgets.  We offer a wide range of sports and recreational facilities and events.  Culture, heritage, golf, angling, walking, cycling and equestrian pursuits are all easily accessible.  In recent years holidaying in Ireland has become more affordable.  These are some of the many advantages we must harness to improve visitor satisfaction and increase the number of people from overseas who choose Ireland as their holiday destination.  While the provision of tourist facilities and amenities is important, the marketing of what Ireland has to offer as a holiday location is also crucial.  We must emphasise that we have a stock of accommodation, entertainment and recreational facilities, many of which have been significantly enhanced by public investment in recent years.  In addition, the capacity of our transport infrastructure has been greatly augmented recently.</P>
        <P>The various tax reduction and additional expenditure measures announced as part of the jobs initiative will be funded by way of a temporary levy on funded pension schemes and personal pension plans.  This levy which is provided for in section 4 will apply at a rate of 0.6% to the capital value of assets under management in pension schemes approved by the Revenue <Col N="407"/>Commissioners under tax legislation.  The schemes affected are retirement benefit schemes, retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts other than those known as vested PRSAs.  The levy will apply for a period of four years, commencing this year.  It is intended to raise approximately &euro;470 million in each of these years.  The levy will not apply to pension funds established here that provide services and benefits solely for employers and members exercising their activities and employment outside the State.  In other words, the levy will not apply to the extent that a scheme is intended to provide retirement benefits outside the State.  In addition, it will not apply where the trustees of a scheme have passed a resolution to wind up the scheme and where the business in respect of which the scheme was established is insolvent.  Provision is made to give pension scheme trustees or administrators the option of adjusting the benefits payable under a pension scheme, on foot of payment of the duty but with safeguards to ensure this is done in an equitable manner.  The chargeable people for the levy are trustees of pension schemes and the insurers and administrators having the management of the assets of pension schemes.</P>
        <P>Section 4 also makes consequential changes to certain provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 relating to the approval conditions that apply to pension scheme providers located outside the State which seek to provide retirement benefits in the State.  Under the existing legislation, such providers are required, unless they have a fiscal representative in the State, to enter into a contract with the Revenue Commissioners to the effect that all duties and obligations imposed by the pensions tax legislation will be discharged.  These duties and obligations are now extended to include the levy.  There was some speculation that the Government would proceed to raid investment funds or deposit accounts.  The Government has no plans in that regard.  The Government regards it as a top priority to safeguard the security of savings and would not wish to consider any step that would impact negatively upon confidence.  Other savings or investment products have not benefited from the generous tax reliefs that pension savings have historically been granted and continue to receive.  Deposit accounts and savings products have already been subjected to additional taxation in recent budgets via the increase in the rate of DIRT and exit taxes, neither of which impacted on pension funds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is conscious of the concerns of the pensions industry about the impact of a levy in circumstances where the pensions sector, in common with other sectors in the economy and society, is finding the current economic and financial environment challenging.  However, the imposition of the levy is for a relatively short period and its purpose is to improve that environment by providing the means to encourage job creation in areas of the economy most likely to deliver that employment quickly.</P>
        <P>The levy is being confined to pension funds because the Government believes the alternatives for increases in taxation elsewhere at this time would be damaging to the economy.  The Minister&rsquo;s officials have consulted the pensions industry and other interested stakeholders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, the Minister made several changes to take on board concerns as expressed.  The main changes are considered necessary to facilitate a more efficient implementation and collection process for the levy and to minimise the administrative cost burden on pension funds.  There is now a single valuation date of 30 June, in relation to most pension funds&rsquo; assets, in each of the four years of the levy.  There is also now a single payment date of 25 September for each of the four years as opposed to two payment dates in each year as originally envisaged.  Those considered and well thought-out amendments, which were brought forward in the other House, came as a result of a considerable degree of consultation with industry representatives.  The Government listened closely to what they had to say and was in a position to bring forward those amendments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is aware that the pensions sector is also concerned, given the temporary levy, about the commitment in our agreement with the EU-IMF to reduce the tax relief on pension contributions starting next year.  This issue will be examined in the context of the results of the comprehensive review of expenditure currently being undertaken by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and any resulting scope for fiscally neutral changes to the EU-IMF agreement.</P>
        <P>I outlined the four measures in the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  I will note for completeness that there are two further sections: section 5 which relates to the care and management of taxes and duties and section 6 which refers to the short title and construction of the Bill.  These are standard entries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I should perhaps also note at this point that the Finance (No. 3) Bill was published on Thursday last.  It provides for changes to existing tax legislation as a consequence of the passing of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010. It is fair to say in passing that the work undertaken by this House over a period of four years greatly helped the passage of that legislation which has enshrined firm rights for persons who now want to legally recognise their cohabitation in the context of Irish domestic law.  I should recognise the enormous contribution of this House over a four-year period in allowing the legislation to progress as it did. That Bill will allow registered civil partners to receive the same tax treatment as married couples in respect of income tax, stamp duty, capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax and VAT.  In addition, the Bill allows for the taxation consequences of the redress scheme for opposite-sex and same-sex cohabiting couples provided for in the 2010 Act.  The Finance (No. 3) Bill comes before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann next week.</P><Col N="409"/>
        
        
        <P Just="Left">After three successive years of declining economic activity we can look forward to positive growth which we fully expect will accelerate as we move into 2012 and beyond.  The recently published Stability Programme Update forecasts positive GDP growth this year, a welcome development following the past three years of substantial contraction of the economy. For 2012, the Department of Finance projects that GDP will grow by 2.5%, with average growth of 3% per annum possible in the period 2013 to 2015.  Underpinning this expected rebound in economic activity is a strong outlook for goods and services exports.  This is in line with expectations &mdash; a recovery in a small open economy such as Ireland's typically takes this form.</P>
        
        <P>The jobs initiative comprises a set of measures that represent our first steps on the road to improving the economy&rsquo;s international competitiveness and promoting job creation.  The Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011, which is before the House today and tomorrow, is intended to deliver the taxation measures outlined in this initiative.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and wish him the best of luck in his endeavours in the next few years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am pleased to be here discussing this Bill.  A couple of items on the pensions levy were discussed in this House only a couple of weeks ago.  Some of the charges with regard to how this is paid for have been discussed in the House previously. However, there are elements to be welcomed within this Bill.  I have no difficulty at all in saying so.  The air travel tax, the reduction in VAT and a number of matters here are measures which I hope will work.  All of us want to ensure that the country returns to growth, which is crucially important, and we start to reduce the live register numbers and get people back to work.  The Government will find support on this side of the House to do that in measures which we believe are correct.</P>
        
        <P>My main fundamental difficulty with this is how this is being paid for.  The Minister of State said that it is not a raid on pension funds, but it is.  There is no way of getting around that.  For example, I received a letter, as the Minister for Finance did, from the retired aviation staff association.  This is merely an example of many thousands of pension funds across the country.  The scheme has 15,000 members: one third are active, one third have deferred and one third are pensioners.  This scheme is under-funded already.  The trustees state that it will be necessary to sell assets and reduce benefits to meet the levy.  It is as simple as that.  That will happen with a substantial number of funds.  More than 70% of defined benefit funds here are under-funded.  The Minister is going after funds that are already struggling.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know the Government has a difficult job to do.  I was involved in four budgets, trying to find money for initiatives.  However, there was much play in the run up to and since the general election about the reduction in the IMF-EU rate and a reduction of 1%, we were told, would deliver &euro;440 million in savings.  This raid on certain pension schemes, and not all, will raise &euro;470 million a year.  They are not too different in the case of the numbers.  However, we were told last week by the Minister for Finance under duress in the D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that any savings on the rate would apply only to moneys not drawn down, and therefore any potential savings would probably be in the region of &euro;160 million.  Then we find out today from the Taoiseach that he has not even discussed this matter with President Sarkozy.  There are many voices and different stories being told about this.</P>
        <P>Setting the precedent whereby the State will go after capital assets of persons who have been prudent and who have done what successive Governments have asked them to do, which is to provide for their retirement, is a dangerous precedent.  If we must levy funds &mdash; no taxation <Col N="410"/>decisions are easy &mdash; why did the Minister not look at levying the tax free cash lump sums?  They are paid on all retirements, whether public or private, whether proprietary directors or a work scheme.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Anyone who retires would pay a levy and it would be for the Government to decide how they would do it.  However, in this instance we are hitting approximately 65,000 pensioners and an additional 1,000 members of pension schemes but we are not going near public sector pensions or approved retirement funds.  In the House last week the Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated he would examine that matter.  The Minister of State will be familiar with the situation of approved retirement funds, ARFs.  I worked in the pensions industry.  They afford generous tax relief for contributions to pensions schemes and generous retirement options, especially for the self-employed and proprietary directors, of which a normal PAYE worker cannot avail.  The very people who are allowed to take out an approved retirement fund are those whose approved retirement funds are exempted from this levy.  They are the people who generally have the money because to take out an ARF one needs a guaranteed salary of &euro;12,700 and an approved minimum retirement fund of &euro;63,500.  Such people have already built up a substantial pension pot and we are letting them off scot free.</P>
        <P>This does not get back to the fundamental point, that is, targeting savings and pensions retirement.  I welcome some of the measures the Minister of State is bringing forward but we are setting a precedent.  The Government will undermine confidence by bringing in a 0.6% levy over a four year period.  At least it has defined the period of time.  I am concerned that it will continue past the four year period as many other levies have in the past and the levy could be further increased.</P>
        <P>The idea that there was broad consultation with the pensions industry is questionable.  The Minister of State used the term &ldquo;canard&rdquo; and it is exactly this because that did not happen.  The Pensions Board was not consulted on this before the decision was made; it was consulted afterwards.  That is a fact; it is not our following a line from the D&aacute;il Chamber but from the Minister who answered a parliamentary question to Deputy Michael McGrath on the matter.  The Pensions Board was not consulted on the pension levy until after the decision was made at Government.</P>
        <P>What do funds do now?  Let us consider the example of the Retired Aviation Staff Association.  It must now sell assets in its fund to pay the levy.  The Minister of State remarked in his speech that &ldquo;Provision is made to give pension scheme trustees or administrators the option of adjusting the benefits payable under a pension scheme&rdquo;.  That is a nice way of saying the Government will allow trustees to cut the benefits of retired members and existing members of the pension scheme.  Effectively, the Government is stating that if a scheme needs to sell assets and seeks to reduce the pension entitlements of the people in the scheme, the Government is giving trustees a free hand and, despite that they promised 50% of a final salary as a pension to a member, now, because of the levy, they will reduce the amount on average by 9%.  That is not small cheese.  People believe this is a 0.6% levy.  Figures from the Irish Association of Pension Funds, IAPF, suggest an average of 9% of a reduction in annuities.  Effectively, it amounts to 10% of take home pay of someone who has retired.  The longer a citizen has been in a pension scheme, prudent and saving for his or her retirement, thereby reducing the burden to the State on his or her retirement, the more he or she is being punished for joining a pension scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Even worse, the pain is not being shared across the board.  Proprietary directors, most of our self-employed and those who have pension funds managed here but who are working abroad will be exempted from this levy.  I understand that it is difficult for the Government to raise <Col N="411"/>money and that not every measure it introduces will be popular.  The Government will find support on this side of the House for unpopular measures in the coming four or five years if we believe they are correct.  That much I can guarantee.  However, this is akin to taking 10% of a person&rsquo;s deposits to pay for a jobs initiative that was previously a jobs budget and exempting more than half the people who have pension schemes from paying anything.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has stated that we should examine the approved retirement fund rules to examine all who are paying into pensions if we believe we should introduce a pensions levy.  As it is currently structured, it is inequitable and the burden will be carried most by those who have contributed for longer to pension schemes.</P>
        <P>I do not believe this is the way to pay for the jobs initiative.  Certain items included in it are welcome but the situation is that approved retirement funds are exempted as well.  Substantial moneys are involved over a period of time and an average pension fund will pay approximately &euro;2,400 over the four year period, which is not small money.  This side of the House will oppose the Bill but not on the basis that there are good things in it.  I believed it was a mistake by the previous Government to introduce the air travel tax and I stated as much at the time.  It is good that it will be gone on the basis of tying in the airlines to increased passenger numbers and more routes.  That is sensible.  The reduction in VAT for tourism is a sensible approach as well.  However, if the Government decides to come up with another jobs initiative later in the year or next year and if it is short of money, can the Minister of State guarantee me that the Government will not hit those easiest to hit, namely, those paying into pension funds, and increase the levy from 0.6% to 1% next year or decide to use another &euro;300 million because it has a capital project that it will not pay for otherwise?  Items within the Bill are more than welcome but we are completely opposed to the way in which the Government seeks to pay for it.  That is why this side of the House is opposed to the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share the last minute of my time with Senator Keane.  I take this opportunity to inform Members that as the Government spokesperson for finance in the Seanad, I am keen to state openly and clearly that I hope to be positive in this role, that we do not get into a Punch and Judy show, the term used by the Leader, and that everyone involved can put forward ideas.  Members can use me as a vehicle to put ideas from whatever side of the House to the Minister and officials within the Department of Finance, and I trust this will be part of the positive work we do in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is important to set the scene.  We have been in recession for three years.  To put this into context, that is a period of 12 quarters in a row going backwards.  Let us compare it with the recession in the 1980s.  In that decade, in which there were 40 quarters, the country was in recession for only three of those 40 quarters.  This is where we are now and this is the difficulty we face.  The calamity that is represented by 440,000 unemployed in the State is not something about which we can stand idly by and not try to do something.  The Bill is a start; that is all.  The social welfare budget is costing &euro;20 billion of the &euro;30 billion that we take in tax.  We must try to do something about it and this is what we are doing.</P>
        <P>I describe tourism as foreign direct investment and there is no easier foreign direct investment anywhere in the country.  When someone travels here, they have money in their wallet or handbag and they bring it in and leave it behind.  Nothing is easier or cheaper.  Our nearest neighbours are in the United Kingdom.  The number of people who visit here from there has fallen by 50% from seven years ago.  In seven years we have managed to lose 50% of our easiest target market.  Why have the figures fallen?  It is because it is too expensive.  Let us consider people on the average industrial wage in the UK.  These are the people who come over on the ferry or who fly in on cheaper flights.  They bring over a certain amount of money.  When they are over here they go for a meal and the main course costs anything from &euro;12 to <Col N="412"/>&euro;19.  In the UK pub grub costs &pound;5.  This is why they have stopped coming.  It is too damned expensive in this country.  They have stopped bringing in money and this is impacting on our foreign direct investment.  This is why so many businesses have closed and so many people have gone out of business in the restaurant and hotel trade and associated industries.  We are trying to do something about it and that is what the Bill is about.</P>
        <P>I recall Senator O&rsquo;Brien describing the travel tax as a bad idea when it was introduced.  It remains a bad idea and we have chosen to do something about it, namely, reducing it to zero.  We are not getting rid of it, however, and it will remain on the books.  The challenge for the airlines is to attract more visitors who will spend money in this country, thus benefiting workers via their wages and business people via the opportunity to make money.  Our society is about enterprise.  I was going to use the word &ldquo;capitalism&rdquo;, but it seems to have acquired a bad name and is suggestive of greed.  The word &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; is much better because it refers to what keeps businesses trading, workers in jobs and people paying their taxes.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with the benefit of increased tax revenues through the airline tax reduction is the reduction in the cost associated with employing staff.  I speak as a business person and employer in saying it is not easy for anybody in business to fill workers&rsquo; wage packets and pay PRSI.  In addition, both employers and employees must pay the universal social charge.  I also welcome the reduction in employer&rsquo;s PRSI.  This will work in conjunction with the other changes to ensure there is a reduction in costs in order that visitors to the State will enjoy better value for money.  Most people take X amount of holiday spending money and will stretch it to fit rather than going beyond it.  We must ensure tourists&rsquo; money goes further.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provisions relating to research and development.  This is an area in which, despite the events of recent years, we continue to enjoy a strong reputation internationally.  It is something we are good at, whether in the social sciences or medical research, but we must work to enhance our expertise further in this niche area.  The changes proposed in the Bill will help in that regard.  However, I have some concerns about the role of IDA Ireland.  Our corporation tax has always been a huge benefit in attracting business to the State and helping IDA Ireland to compete internationally for foreign direct investment.  Research and development is an important part of this, but I question the success of IDA Ireland in that regard.  While our successes in attracting foreign companies are announced with great fanfare, none of us knows what enterprises have slipped through and where IDA Ireland has not been successful.  It is as important that we know how the agency is doing its business and how successful it is in order to ensure we are as competitive as possible.  For example, some weeks ago Amazon announced the creation of an additional 900 jobs in Scotland.  I would like to know whether we were in competition for these jobs and, if so, why we were not successful.</P>
        <P>In November 2010, as part of our budget arithmetic, Fine Gael set forth clearly its proposal for a 0.6% levy on pension funds to fund a job creation initiative.  That proposal was included in our general election literature and we indicated it would be part of the programme for Government.  On all occasions we identified pension funds as a source of income for a jobs initiative which would, of necessity, be cost neutral.  It was not a matter of choice; the money had to be found somewhere.  I wish we could find it somewhere else, but we have not been successful in that regard.  We have implemented the levy in the manner in which we said all along we would.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and thank Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy for sharing time.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State review the provision in the Finance Bill (No. 2) 2011 whereby the level of guaranteed income required for entry into an approved retirement fund, ARF, is being <Col N="413"/>increased from &euro;12,000 to &euro;18,000?  The conditions of qualification for these schemes are being changed in such a way that people on low incomes are effectively excluded from participation, including those who have saved in additional voluntary contribution, AVC, schemes during the years.  The increase in the minimum income threshold to &euro;18,000 will not bring in additional moneys to the Exchequer, but it will prevent those on low incomes, including people in lower grades in local authorities and the Civil Service and low paid workers in the private sector, from opting for ARF schemes.  In addition, funds will be locked in under these schemes until a contributor reaches 75 years of age.  People may be living longer but most wish to access some of their retirement money before they reach that age.  Many such workers will opt out of pension schemes altogether and make no provision for their retirement.  I hope the Minister of State will review this provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>It gives me great personal pleasure to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to the Chamber.  I had a high regard for his contribution both as a Senator and as a Deputy prior to his appointment to such a significant brief.  He and I have worked closely together for several years in the light of our common concerns and commitments on behalf of the people of west Tallaght which forms part of his constituency.  I know at first hand his dedication, expertise and empathy in progressing a multiplicity of issues relating to the constituency.  I look forward to working with him in our new roles.</P>
        <P>I welcome several aspects of the Bill.  In particular, I am heartened that it represents a move towards evidence-based policy and law by way of the commitment to review the impact of the changes proposed.  If the provisions do not bring about what is expected, they will be reviewed.  That is a progressive approach.</P>
        <P>I propose to focus on the decision of the Government to fund the jobs initiative by way of a levy of 0.6% of the market value of pension assets.  Senator O&rsquo;Brien has noted some of the issues that arise in this regard, but I will take a somewhat different perspective.  The only existing pensioners who have pension funds are those in private sector defined benefit schemes and in private sector defined contribution schemes who have not moved into annuities or approved retirement funds.  Senator Cait Keane&rsquo;s comments are important in this regard.  This probably means that should the pension scheme trustees or administrators apply the tax levy to pensioners &mdash; I assume they could instead absorb the levy by reducing their fees or becoming more efficient, but that is unlikely &mdash; the wealthiest pensioners would escape the levy.  I use the word &ldquo;probably&rdquo; because there may be some very wealthy pensioners in defined benefit schemes.  It also is true that the pension levy does not hit the poorest pensioners, as such pensioners only receive the non-contributory State pension.  However, the wealthiest pensioners also escape from the levy as they are more likely to have their funds in approved retirement funds or at least in annuities.  Therefore, the pensioners this measure is most likely to hit are those in the middle with defined benefit pensions and many such pension funds already are in trouble because they are under-funded, a point to which Senator O&rsquo;Brien already has referred.</P>
        <P>Taking a social justice perspective and being attentive to and strongly supportive of the initiatives proposed to create the conditions for jobs, I believe a more equitable change to fund the jobs initiative would be the standard rating of pension contributions.  In particular, this would underpin the labour market as outlined in the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution and would save far more money than this levy will raise.  According to data compiled by the Trinity College Dublin pension policy research group in 2007, employer contributions to occupational pension schemes on behalf of employees amounted to &euro;1.4 billion, while the estimated cost of tax relief and the exemption from benefit in kind taxation was &euro;150 million and &euro;540 million, respectively.  Furthermore, these tax reliefs were concentrated on the top 20% of the owners.  This research group argues and I agree, that the best way to create greater pension equality among <Col N="414"/>high, middle and low earners would be to give tax relief at the standard rate of tax, as is now done in the case of relief on mortgage interest and health insurance.  Does the EU-IMF programme not contain a commitment to standardise pension reliefs?  The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech noted there is a commitment to reduce the tax reliefs and does this pertain to their standardisation?  The solution I put forward does not appear to increase the cost of business and the Government also has a commitment in this regard to which the Minister of State referred in his comments today.  I recommend a more equitable change focused on the standard rating of pension contributions.  By definition this would affect the people paying into a pension fund, namely, those who are younger, rather than those who are drawing it down, namely, those who are older.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011 is welcome in the main.  All Members are satisfied that the air travel tax has been suspended.  In a country that relies so heavily on tourist numbers, the aforementioned tax introduced by the previous Administration was rather regressive and ill-conceived and its abolition has the potential to give Ireland a tremendous boost.  In conjunction with this initiative, I further welcome the proposal to reduce the rate of VAT charged on certain tourism-related goods and services to 9%, which also has the potential to act as a good stimulus.</P>
        <P>However, section 4 provides for a levy on pension schemes and that measure certainly is more challenging.  Clearly, no one likes paying more taxes, charges or levies but I remind Members that these measures, unpopular as they are, are necessary due to the mismanagement and what some might even call the incompetence of the previous Administration.  I share Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s hope that Members can have a reasonable debate on this issue and in some measure avoid a replication of last week&rsquo;s debate in the other House during which at times some Opposition spokespersons were in danger of exhausting the entire lexicon of negative adjectives in their rush to denounce this measure.</P>
        <P>A 0.6% stamp duty on post-retirement products such as annuities, retirement benefit schemes and personal retirement savings funds for four years clearly is an unpopular move and will be so perceived.  It is a position to which the Government has moved reluctantly and which in normal times it would not consider.  However, these are not normal times and when 440,000 people are on the live register, something must be done urgently.  The 0.6% levy will generate &euro;470 million per annum and some relief may be had from the fact that it is time-bounded to 2014.  Under the circumstances, a charge of 0 .6% is not excessive and Members will recall that most pension funds received considerable tax relief in the past and remain extremely tax efficient instruments at present.  Like my colleague, Senator Zappone, I understand the managers of pension funds charge as much as 1.5% per annum in management fees and must rank among the most highly remunerated people in Ireland.  I wonder idly whether one could find a way to facilitate these high earners to display their undoubted sense of solidarity with their clients by contributing a portion of that 1.5% fee to offset the full impact of the necessary 0.6% charge.</P>
        <P>One element of the Bill that caused me some concern is that some of the available post-retirement products appear to escape from this proposal.  I refer in particular to approved retirement funds, ARFs, in which it is thought some of the highest earners have placed their pensions.  Members undoubtedly will hear some famous and perhaps infamous names being <Col N="415"/>tossed about the Chamber today in the same manner as in the D&aacute;il last week.  It seems quite inequitable to me and I am glad the Minister for Finance appeared to indicate last week that he was prepared to revisit the issue in a finance Bill later this year.  He would be correct and I urge him to so do.  I suggest this could be achieved in one of several ways.  While a 0.6% charge could be imposed on ARFs, this would be administratively cumbersome.  One also could consider raising the effective tax rate from the existing rate of 5% to a level that would reflect the value of 0.6% above a certain threshold.</P>
        <P>No Government wishes to impose additional charges but the present Administration finds itself in that bind.  While the Opposition will focus its attention on some elements of the Bill, will simplify the argument and will disagree in the most harsh terms, I hope it will be sufficiently magnanimous to recognise the Government is acting in good faith in extremely difficult circumstances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, to the Chamber.  I particularly welcome the optimism expressed in the contribution made this afternoon by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  The idea of turning a corner or of looking to the future or for things to be positive always is welcome.  As for the research and development tax credit in particular, I intend to return to the House to discuss some difficulties on the ground regarding research and development in places such as the institutes of technology.  Such places are at the heart of research and development, are where businesses will be created and where new ideas will emerge and the Government wants to support them.  However, difficulties exist on the ground that present obstacles to people who wish to do business and it is a subject to which I will return.  In respect of tourism, the removal of the air travel tax is welcome but I urge that whatever negotiations take place with the airlines should be meaningful and somehow quantifiable.  They must ensure the proposal that the airlines will bring in increased passenger numbers is a reality and not an aspiration because the two must go together hand in hand.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to turn away slightly from the Bill&rsquo;s specific content and to discuss briefly the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.  I was heartened to note that earlier this year, Mr. Jonathan Edwards, the MP for Carmarthen East described the MABS model in Ireland as something to which the Welsh Assembly should aspire and he advocated its adoption for Wales.  While people in Ireland are very proud of MABS, if one speaks to those who work on the ground, they will relate that they are overwhelmed.  The programme for Government has committed to ensuring that MABS becomes a fully empowered personal debt management agency with strong legal powers to support families&rsquo; property and to provide protection from creditors where appropriate in order that they have time to sort out their affairs.  The promised personal debt management agency will have quasi-judicial status, thereby putting this urgent need for assistance for ordinary people on a strong footing.  Much of the work of MABS now pertains to personal debt and I make these remarks in light of the optimism Members have heard this afternoon, as for those people such optimism appears far removed from their reality.  Moreover, if a staff of approximately 270 people must deal with more than 20,000 callers annually, Members should do the maths or rather they should not do the maths as it simply does not add up.  If one asks 270 people to deal with more than 20,000 distraught and upset people, one will discern immediately the urgent need.  I urge the Minister and the Department to ensure this legislation is introduced as a matter of urgency within a reasonable timeframe because it will take time to introduce a personal debt agency with quasi-judicial authority, which will still be too long a time for those desperately trying to work out what to do about their debt.  Those working in MABS see themselves as firefighting and talk about their clients being thrown to the wolves.  This is not a happy position to be in; we simply cannot ignore the serious debt problems of thousands of citizens.</P><Col N="416"/>
        <P>In urging the Government to press on with the programme for Government and introduce such an agency with stronger powers, while the Welsh may be looking at the MABS model, we may also learn something from them.  They have established a financial education unit as a step forward to ensure future generations will be more financially literate.  Perhaps we might see a way to introduce such a programme in schools as part of the CSPE curriculum in order that from a very early age children will learn about the management of money.  There is significant support in Wales for the fight against illegal moneylending.  All Members have heard stories about the so-called Lennies in the midst of our towns and cities.  Those affected in communities find it hard to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to a lender and even more difficult to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to them.  The Taoiseach indicated last month that he would welcome legislation to tighten private debt agencies.  We must take care to consider that moneylenders are not wanted in our communities.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State is most welcome.  </P>
        <P>I welcome the objectives of the Bill, although I am concerned about some aspects of it.  In 1989 I had the opportunity to visit Leningrad, then part of the old Soviet Union.  I asked our guide, Ludmila, if I could visit a supermarket.  The one to which I was taken was very dull and plain and did not offer a great range of goods.  When I asked the supermarket manager how many customers he had, he answered that he had 4,687.  I was very impressed that he knew the exact number because it was clear the cash register system was not very modern.  When I asked him how he could be so precise in knowing the number of customers, he replied that this was the number of people who lived in the suburb in which the supermarket was located.  When I asked if they all shopped in his supermarket, he said, &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;  He also said that if the suburb was bigger, the shop would be bigger.  Conversely, if the suburb was smaller, the shop would also be smaller.  In other words, there was only one shop in the suburb.  In those days in that society things were controlled from the top rather than being decided by the marketplace.  What I like about the legislation under discussion is that it is aimed at stimulating rather than controlling the marketplace.  However, I am not happy with one or two aspects of it.</P>
        <P>In the 1980s I was chairman of a hospital board at a time when the unemployment rate was high and the economy was not doing well.  The Government of the day introduced a job creation project.  The hospital was asked to state how many jobs it had created in a given month.  It was asked, for instance, how many porters had been employed.  There did not seem to be an understanding that it was not the Government&rsquo;s role to create jobs.  It can stimulate the economy by ensuring people are encouraged to create jobs, whether in hospitals, shops or restaurants.  I, therefore, recommend the objectives of this Bill because some of the important <Col N="417"/>measures proposed will work very well.  The jobs initiative amounts to much-needed strong action on the part of the Government to stimulate the market economy.</P>
        <P>As a retailer, I am particularly happy to see a cut in the rate of VAT, in hotels and restaurants in particular.  The tourism business can create jobs more quickly than other businesses.  There is no doubt that foreign direct investment leads to the creation of jobs and that the process has been very successful, but it takes time.  However, the Government seems to have recognised that a tweaking of the VAT rate will enable us to create jobs very quickly.  Shops can be opened very quickly if people start to spend money.  The cut in the rate of employers&rsquo; PRSI in respect of lower paid jobs will make it easier for employers to employ workers whom they would not be able to afford otherwise.  Another element that needs to be examined very carefully is rent reduction.  I urge the Government to review the policy on rents, as something must be done about it.</P>
        <P>Something must also be done about the old-fashioned system of Sunday payments, which harks back to the age of the old Soviet Union, as it does not depend on the state of the marketplace.  Many restaurants know that some are willing to work on a Sunday at a certain rate, but they are not allowed to be employed because of arrangements made in the past which state they must be paid a premium rate.  It seems many restaurants no longer open on a Sunday because of the cost of premium payments which are 34% higher than in England.  We should consider what can be done in this regard.</P>
        <P>I remember being in a shop in Dundalk that closed about two years ago.  I asked some of the butchers about their employment prospects once the shop closed and they replied that they might have to emigrate.  I suggested they could try to seek employment in Newry, only a 15-minute drive from Dundalk.  However, they said butchers in Newry were paid only one third of what they were earning in Dundalk.  This gives one some indication that we will not be able to compete unless we manage to bring down our costs.  This has become a high-cost operation and economy.  I have been urging the Government to introduce a measure to analyse whether new legislation will impose more red tape on businesses.</P>
        <P>I suggest that at some stage we should have a debate in the House on the National Competitiveness Council which last year stated it was concerned there was not a strong desire to tackle high costs in certain sheltered sectors.  It also stated a rigorous review of laws, rules and customs governing locally traded sectors was required to identify barriers to promoting enhanced competition and that the State should use its purchasing power to exert downward pressure on professional fees.  This has been a source of controversy recently.  I ask the Government to act and co-ordinate the efforts of a group which could pick out certain parts of law that hinder businesses, competitiveness and the ability of employers to hire more workers and expand.  This could be done easily and quickly and would be extremely inexpensive.</P>
        <P>Since it began six weeks ago I have been involved in promoting the towns of excellence campaign which encourages various towns to improve the level of their customer service.  It is an opportunity for individual towns to attract more business.  Bill Gates has said a company&rsquo;s most unhappy customers are its greatest source of learning.  Years ago I was involved in setting up customer panels in order that I could determine what it was customers wanted.  What was much more valuable was having non-customer panels, in other words people who said they did not shop with me, because it was much more important to learn why.</P>
        <P>A new report on competitiveness from Goodbody Stockbrokers showed that our competitiveness is improving and that unit labour costs have fallen by 9%, relative to the rest of the eurozone in 2009-10 and are expected to decline by a further 4% in the coming year.  The report also discussed other areas.  We have many highly skilled graduates who could transfer the skills they have learned from a number of companies.  I was involved with another group <Col N="418"/>called Springboard which the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, launched recently.  It encourages people who have certain skills that are not necessary or suitable at the moment.  It can be a future benefit.</P>
        <P>The legislation we have means that the research and development tax credit regime is getting a boost and gives flexibility to companies in terms of how they account for the credit.  It is hoped that it will help multinational companies market their Irish operations internally.  We should think of even more ideas to help set the conditions for businesses to create jobs.  For example, the Connecticut State Senate passed a jobs initiative recently.  The so-called first five programme allows the state&rsquo;s economic development commissioner to offer special incentives to the first five businesses that can each bring a minimum of 200 new full-time jobs to the state within two years.  Incentives would also be offered to companies that have made a $25 million investment in Connecticut and operate 200 jobs over five years.  It is an initiative which may be worth following.</P>
        <P>I encourage people not to be shy about setting up a business.  I was involved with a partnership scheme some years ago and discovered when I went to the first meeting that everybody else wanted to contact the IDA, the Government or a Minister to do something for them.  Some of us asked people if they could start businesses themselves, even if they were young people.  I remember one man started a business.  He was a student and in May or June he had a bicycle, rented a ladder and took his mother&rsquo;s bucket and set up a window cleaning business.  At the end of the year he was able to sell it on to somebody else who could generate work.  I mention this because one thing we can do is encourage people to set up their own businesses even if they are very small.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This Bill will enact the provisions of the jobs initiative about which we had a discussion last week in the House.  Many speakers said that the Government does not create jobs, rather it creates the environment in which jobs can be developed and provided.  Labour costs are extremely high and need to be reduced.  We need to address competitiveness issues around labour costs.  It is true that in the private sector generally the unit cost of labour has reduced through necessity.</P>
        <P>The reduction in employers PRSI contributions which will be available from 1 July 2013 will make it easier for employers to take on additional staff.  The reduction in VAT to 9% will be very important, in particular in the restaurant and catering sector which are very valuable tourism products.  The travel tax will be abolished.  I do not understand why a small island nation would tax people to come into and leave the country.  It does not make sense when we are so dependent on air travel.</P>
        <P>I will focus on the research and development proposals which are very important and have been widely welcomed.  They give flexibility, particularly to multinationals who avail of corporation tax rates, in terms of how they account for their research and development and spend.  Companies such as Dell, Intel, Pfizer, Hewlett-Packard and many more have set up research and development centres here.  It is an important statement from those companies.  When one speaks to their representatives from Ireland and Irish employees who are fronting their operations in Cork they are always proud of the companies and point to the investment they make in research and development.  It is a vote of confidence and an endorsement of this country.  It also gives security to the investment that many international companies have made here.  It means they are setting down firmer roots here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The proposals in the Bill for accounting for research and development tax credits are very important.  In the programme for Government there will be an emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly indigenous companies.  There will be a facility whereby they can <Col N="419"/>avail of research and development tax credits.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, mentioned this previously.  A cost benefit analysis is to be carried out.</P>
        <P>The annual report of Forf&aacute;s provides data on the number of companies across the economy that invest in research and development and have become innovative, increased productivity and the number of products they are selling across a range of areas from bread making, to producing cement and software and financial services.  Many companies invest in research and development.  The figures for 2010 show that the spend on research and development for companies who operate here was &euro;1.8 billion, which is very strong compared to previous years.  The level spent on it was maintained if one examines the figures for it in 2008-2009.  It is a positive figure, given the state of the economy.  The temptation is to abandon it but it is very important for companies.  The money spent by businesses and Government on it is an important indicator of our knowledge economy, how we invest in it and how strong the country will appear on international indicators.  I understand about half the money is spent on labour costs and the rest on capital costs, computers and so on.</P>
        <P>The jobs programme has to be funded from somewhere and the issue has been addressed by numerous speakers.  I wish there was another way, but the pension levy is preferable to a tax on income or indirect taxes.  There is no easy way to pay for the initiative.  The jobs initiative is and has to be cost neutral, transparent and open.  We can see where the money is coming from and where it is being spent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We on this side of the House welcome any attempt to deal with unemployment.  It is welcome that at the very least the Government has thought about and acted on jobs, even if we disagree with some of the things it is doing.  It is welcome that the focus in the Seanad, the D&aacute;il and the Bill is on jobs.</P>
        <P>The jobs initiative, which was previously called the jobs budget, falls well short of what was promised by the parties before the election and what is required for the economy and for those who are unemployed.  It is critical that we are not the bearers of false hope to people that there will be a radical change in unemployment levels.  We on this side of the House believe fundamentally that the pension levy, which targets middle income earners, targets the ordinary working people and excludes the very wealthy, such as the FitzPatricks and Fingletons, charges which were laid against us during the last Government.  If the Government believes we should not exclude very wealthy people with approved retirement funds it must vote against the Bill which is socially unjust and divisive.  It is targeting the ordinary people of Ireland.  Those who are paying into PRSAs are ordinary workers, not the wealthy.</P>
        <P>Election promises were made to create hundreds of thousands of jobs.  There was even a five-point plan which promised benefits for pension savers.  It accused us of obliterating middle-income earners and pensioners.  There was no mention of any contribution from funds.  All they talked about were ministerial pensions and I agree that is an issue which badly needs to be addressed.  I suffered electorally because of the ministerial pensions issue, but this legislation does nothing whatsoever about that.</P>
        <P>Some of the Bill&rsquo;s measures are welcome.  The Acting Chairman was generous in dealing with the content of a Labour Party Senator&rsquo;s speech, but I hope that will not set a precedent because it was a totally unrelated discussion about the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.  It is important to keep to the issues in the Bill, which should be the precedent in future for Government parties in dealing with difficult issues.</P>
        <P>While the research and development tax credit is a good idea, the Minister of State is in no position to tell us what jobs will result from it.  We hope, however, that it will stimulate activity in that regard.</P><Col N="420"/>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with the VAT reduction but why is it confined to what are essentially luxury goods?  The reduction may create jobs in the tourism sector, which is to be welcomed, but why are newspapers included in the VAT cut?  It leads one to question the motivation behind that move.  Newspapers do not do much for the tourism industry in particular.  In general, as we have seen, they have been ruthless enough with some of their staff.  I wonder whether they deserve a VAT reduction and if they will pass it on to the cover price.  Newspaper prices seem to rise all the time, but I have not seen any provision in the legislation to insist that the VAT reduction should be passed on to those buying newspapers.  We are giving this tax break to these people, although most of our newspaper industry is multinational at this stage.  There are very few indigenous newspaper companies creating local jobs.  They are all centralising their staff in Dublin, while sacking other staff.  Much of the sub-editing of Irish newspapers is now carried out abroad.  Nonetheless we are including these companies in the VAT reduction, while not including poor, marginalised and ordinary families who must face the cost of household fuels, which also have a 13.5% VAT rate.  The Minister of State may say she cannot do that and state the reasons, but if it can be done for newspaper barons, it can be done for ordinary families.</P>
        <P>The pension levy is called a stamp duty.  One always needed a document for the stamp duty to be chargeable and paid, so they invented a document in this case, which is a mechanism.  I note that Mr. Eddie Hobbs said there was no legal way of charging this amount, but the Government has done it pretty effectively by inventing a document which is chargeable to stamp duty.  As Senator Clune said, money has to be found somewhere, but I hope that is not the Government&rsquo;s attitude.  The Government is in no position to tell us how many jobs will be created, so it should not keep raiding various funds to try to come up with something.</P>
        <P>In passing this Bill, the inclination is to have some good news on Friday.  Instead of having a good news story on Friday after the passage of this Bill, we should have a good news story in the autumn when unemployment falls as a result of this measure.  If that happens, I will congratulate the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, described as a canard the point that the Pensions Board had not been consulted.  Meanwhile, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, told the D&aacute;il: &ldquo;There was no formal consultation by me or by my Department with the Pensions Board in advance of the Government&rsquo;s decision to introduce the pension levy to fund the jobs initiative.&rdquo;  I will leave the words of the Minister for Finance to contradict those of the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>I am appealing to those Senators who believe it is unjust to leave out approved retirement funds &mdash; no matter what the arguments are &mdash; for the wealthiest in society, to vote against this Bill.  The wealthiest include some of the people who caused the problems which prompted this legislation.  I urge Senators to vote against the Bill on Second Stage and on Committee Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Last week, I requested the Minister to attend the House to discuss an issue that is directly caused by the high rate of unemployment across the country, namely, young couples facing eviction from their family homes due to an inability to pay mortgages.  Senator Byrne may say it is not related to the Bill, but it is; it is related to the national unemployment rate.  The Minister of State will be aware that a large number of young couples, many with young children, through no fault of their <Col N="421"/>own, are in serious difficulty with mortgage repayments.  Some people have had their mortgages protected for a year, but that year is now up for most of them.  The difficulties facing people in the recession include unemployment, reduced working hours, pay cuts and increased levies.  The self-employed are also being hit by such problems, which result in substantially reduced household incomes.  As a result, people are being catapulted into mortgage arrears.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I welcome the jobs initiative, I fear it will move too slowly to get people back to work and save family homes.  The number of people being forced to sell their family homes is escalating daily.  It is annoying that the banks, which are now turning the screw on such families, are the very same banks that have been bailed out to the tune of billions of euro.  As the market value of most people&rsquo;s homes has dropped by over &euro;100,000, they will now be left in negative equity.  They will still have to pay back the &euro;100,000 but will have nothing to show for it.  The same people are expected to pay for this country&rsquo;s bail-out.  I believe in social justice, as I am sure the Minister of State does, but where is the justice in this?</P>
        <P>I can cite facts and figures regarding repossessions, mortgage arrears and negative equity, but I would only be wasting the Minister of State&rsquo;s time because she already knows the statistics.  I want to speak about the human side of this situation and the terrible effect it is having on families.  Many people in negative equity will never be able to buy a house again and will probably be blacklisted.  Their only option will be to go on a social housing list and apply for rent allowance.  Why not establish an assessment procedure before they have to give up their homes?  Where people can demonstrate a genuine inability to pay, why not introduce a scheme where rent allowance can be paid to help save the family home, thus keeping a roof over their heads?  Such a scheme would keep people off the social housing list and when they are in a position to do so, they could take over the full amount of the mortgage again.</P>
        <P>Many young couples are desperately trying to keep their troubles hidden from their family and friends because they feel ashamed at the prospect of losing the family home.  We must help them, but I am fearful of the effect this Bill will have on them.  Some people are so desperate to meet their mortgage repayments that they are letting out the family home and renting cheaper accommodation for themselves.  I ask the Minister of State to consider introducing some income tax breaks for these families.</P>
        <P>This week, it was announced that emigration to Britain was up 25% last year, at almost 14,000.  The last thing we want in this country is another flight of the earls.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, Labour Party Senators are raising worthy issues, including MABS and mortgages.  I am happy to sit here until late tonight to discuss those important matters, but Standing Orders require that Second Stage speeches should be confined to the general principle of the Bill.  If the Labour Party tactic on difficult questions, such as targeting the pension pots of middle-income earners, is to avoid the issue altogether, it is unacceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton &mdash; and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, who was here earlier &mdash; to the House.  I welcome the Bill before us, which contains measures that will assist this country back to economic health. Although I accept the measures in it will contribute to the nation's economic health and will get more of our people back to work, it is critical that all the measures that we take in government, including those in this legislation, are subject to independent review and analysis.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to reviewing the measures in the Bill.</P>
      
        
        <P>Colleagues in the Seanad have raised concerns about the legislation.  Meals out for the rich may be one of the unintended consequences of this legislation.  We may be accused of robbing the old to pay for the needs of the young or robbing the pension funds of the lower paid while letting the rich off scot-free.  There is always the possibility of the best intentions having unintended consequences.  It is with this in mind that I request the Minister to consider the reinstatement of the Combat Poverty Agency as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We are in danger of becoming obsessed with all things financial and running the risk of ignoring the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable in our society.  History has demonstrated that not all boats will rise with the rising tide and not all people will suffer equally in a recession.  It is important, therefore, that we understand the effects of the policies we are making.  We need to look beyond projections to see how real people are affected.  Without independent research telling us, we can be overlooking problems that may be brewing under the surface, that in the long term will hinder rather than help the development of the country and that will have a high human cost.  It is not enough for Departments to conduct their own research.  Independent published analysis which brings information into the public domain and allows for proper debate is necessary.  Neither is it wise for us to listen to those who shout loudest.  While I respect Senator Quinn, I am not of the view that the revival of the economy will be achieved by defeating the joint labour committees, JLCs, and reducing the incomes of the most vulnerable.  Poverty is often hidden and difficult to assess and the Combat Poverty Agency had a proud tradition of bringing forward the best quality research and putting Governments and their policies under review.</P>
        <P>Since 2009 the agency has been effectively disbanded.  It has been shunted from Department to Department and its staff scattered to the four winds.  This has been a very short-sighted policy.  Unlike the last Government, we in this Government are not afraid of independent review and assessment of our actions and we are not willing to push criticism under carpet.  I therefore call for the urgent reinstatement of the Combat Poverty Agency to ensure the measures we take in this Government, including this legislation, can be defended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I address Bill, I must express a good deal of sympathy for the Government, given the necessity to try to achieve revenue neutral measures. This is at the heart of what is being proposed in the legislation in terms of funding the jobs initiative.  This straitjacket means that many measures urgently needed in the economy will be unfeasible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Policy creation in this country is often short-sighted, but in this case the new Government has made an attempt to support enterprise in a constructive fashion.  First, the research and development tax credit changes are very welcome.  Although only a technical amendment, it will hopefully have the effect of giving a greater measure of flexibility in the tax treatment of investments in research and development, and undoubtedly this will be particularly welcomed by the high-tech sectors of the economy.  This measure will not have a major impact on Government revenues, but it certainly reinforces the message that we are serious about maintaining a cutting edge sector in the economy.</P><Col N="423"/>
        <P Just="Left">The second measure in the Bill, the suspension of the air travel tax, is to be criticised only in so far as it does not go far enough, and by that I mean complete and permanent abolition rather than suspension of the tax.  The original imposition of this tax was a problem at the time and it is a pity the Government has not taken this opportunity to opt for its full abolition.  Tourism is a sector we must encourage at every opportunity.  The huge economic benefits here are complemented by the goodwill that a revitalised Ireland of the welcomes, so to speak, would spread in Europe.  I note the Minister, Deputy Noonan, spoke in the D&aacute;il of a 39% fall in tourist numbers from the UK.  Given the strength of the euro against sterling, British visitors will think twice about visiting, but to discourage them further by taxing air travel would be ludicrous.</P>
        <P>As an aside, I was always amazed at the number of Germans fascinated by the adventures of Heinrich B&ouml;ll in his <i>Irish Journal</i>, which documented his travels here in the 1950s.  This book was one of the most popular German language books published for decades and is still in print today.  It is on such hooks that tourism campaigns are and should be hung, and any goodwill generated in Germany towards us could only be welcome at this time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regardless of whatever traditional interest there is in Ireland as a holiday destination, the notoriously frugal Germans are likely to be concerned about our prices.  According to a recent report from the World Economic Forum, Ireland remains one of the most expensive places to holiday in the world.  Only Denmark, Finland, Norway, Luxembourg and Switzerland are seen as more expensive when it comes to purchasing power parity.  The strong euro is a major factor in that, but it underlines the need to increase value wherever possible and places the welcome measures to abolish the travel tax and reduce labour costs and VAT in this sector in context.</P>
        <P>On those grounds the reduction of VAT for some tourism related activities is equally welcome.  In the long term, all consumption-based taxes like VAT must be reduced.  Ireland&rsquo;s success, by which I mean the sustained period of growth before the property boom, was based on a low tax economy, and while many shrill commentators have tried to link that phrase in the public imagination with the unsustainable rise in public spending, the fact remains that we as a State should endeavour to allow each worker and citizen the maximum fruits of his or her labour, and from that I believe economic success will flow.  Consumption-based taxes have a disproportionate effect on poorer families who tend to spend a greater proportion of their earnings than those who spend proportionally less and save more.  I am aware of the constraints that are on us as a nation but I hope we will soon find our way back to this position of workers and families having maximum control over their own earnings.  Today&rsquo;s measure is to be warmly welcomed and my hopes are that it will become a permanent reduction across all VAT bands.</P>
        <P>I want to address the portion of the Bill that I oppose, which is the attack on savings represented by the pension levy.  I listened with great interest to various Senators, and Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien in particular raised some interesting correspondence.  I mentioned that policy in this country can often be short-sighted, and this section is an example of that.</P>
        <P>In the past, our citizens were strongly encouraged to invest in pensions to offset the looming pensions time-bomb and this was the basis for the establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Saving for the future was seen as vital given our ageing population, and it was felt that to encourage this saving, the tax system should contain some incentives.  For all classes of people, saving for the future became common, and at the time we patted ourselves on the back for avoiding the trap into which other nations with older populations had fallen.  Now, circumstances have changed and rather than a pensions time-bomb, we face the current economic crisis.  I accept that Governments need to get revenue from somewhere, and I note the position of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that this levy is designed to fund the new jobs initiative.  Equally, I note that the measure will raise more revenue than the initiative will cost, and <Col N="424"/>I suspect that this is no accident.  I also suspect, perhaps cynically, that this levy will be with us for some time to come.  The last time something similar was levied was in the 1980s, its term was extended beyond its original planned lifespan.  In that case a levy was raised against capital gains within pensions at a time when significant gains were made in a short period.  In this current proposal we are taxing assets at a time when most funds are in deficit.  It is an unfair attack on savers who have suffered much already.  According to the pensions industry, this levy, if extended over the life of the investments, could cost savers about a fifth of their final pension, and, to reiterate, I suspect that this levy will be here for some time to come.</P>
        <P>Perhaps there is even a moral argument against this measure.  I note that the Minister of State spoke of how provision will be made to allow pension scheme trustees or administrators the option of adjusting the benefits payable under a pension scheme on foot of the payment of the duty.  Of course, that will happen.  We are looking at some defined benefit schemes becoming redefined benefit schemes.  We have crossed a certain line here.  People invested in pension funds on a particular basis and understanding and now, retrospectively, these steps are being taken.  We cannot simply make a grab for any available source of revenue like we were some sort of banana republic.  Savers invested in these schemes because they accepted in good faith the deal offered by the Government and in full knowledge of the Government&rsquo;s fear that it would not be able itself to fund retirees unless large numbers of those retirees had personal savings.  Now those savers are to be punished for their earlier responsible behaviour.  This is very bad public policy.</P>
        <P>It always amazes me that the group constantly forgotten are the hard-working, lower middle class PAYE and self-employed workers, as Senator Zappone said.  These people are mortgaged to the hilt and have typically been hit by both tax increases and income cuts.  Even in the best of times they did not have huge disposable income.  These are the people who will suffer on foot of this measure.  The richer will not notice it, the poorer will not have invested in the first place but the so-called squeezed middle, to borrow a phrase from our neighbour, will take the hit.  While I commend the Bill&rsquo;s positive measures, I strongly oppose the pension grab contained in section 4.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the legislation, which affords us an opportunity to say a few words about what should be the main concern of the House and the body politic for the crucial coming years, that is, job creation.  We are moving towards an unemployment level of almost 500,000 people, a scale of human misery we cannot sustain and cannot allow.  During one of the House&rsquo;s debates on job creation 12 months ago, I suggested that all legislation appearing before the House, regardless of the originating Department, should be employment proofed.  In other words, we should examine every rule, regulation and legislative measure on the basis of whether it creates or costs jobs.</P>
        <P>The Finance Bill forms part of the Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative.  During the next few years, we will see a large draft of legislation and measures designed to put Ireland back to work.  It is what we all must aim towards because we cannot solve our public spending crisis, budget <Col N="425"/>deficit problem or banking debt problem unless people are working instead of claiming social welfare payments and living on the margins of society.</P>
        <P>The Bill&rsquo;s measures are modest.  It would be unrealistic to expect any Government that had been in office only for a few weeks to be in a position to introduce a large raft of new legislation and new thinking, but the Bill is a positive first step and, during the coming years, I hope to see much more activity on the job creation front from the new Government.</P>
        <P>The Bill&rsquo;s four measures are straightforward.  The first three &mdash; the research and development tax credit, the suspension of the air travel tax and the reduction in the lower rate of VAT &mdash; are not contentious and have been requested by Senators and Deputies for the past 12 months.  During a debate in the House last week, I was glad that our friend, Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Senator White, asked why these measures had not been taken already.  Those relating to the air travel tax and VAT can only be positive.</P>
        <P>During the Tallaght strategy of the late 1980s, a Fianna F&aacute;il minority Government took the first steps in reducing the general rates of taxation.  Everyone was pleasantly surprised &mdash; I am not sure why they would have been &mdash; that this resulted in enhanced economic activity and job and wealth creation.  We must do everything possible to generate economic activity, which the lower rate of VAT and the suspension of the air travel tax will do.</P>
        <P>I will reflect briefly on the pension levy.  I listened to Senator Mullen with interest.  I have a difficulty with the concept of a pension levy, notwithstanding the fact that the broad package of measures must be funded.  We would be unrealistic and irresponsible were we to pretend that we could introduce measures for which someone else would pay.  We must pay for them ourselves and the Bill&rsquo;s methodology for doing so is the pension levy.  However, we must be careful about the signals that can be sent by the pension levy.  We do not want to frighten the horses, if the House will excuse the pun, or send a message to the effect that people who have been cautiously creating wealth by investing in pension or saving funds will be hit with an unexpected and, perhaps, unfair attack on those funds.  We will have a better opportunity on Committee Stage to debate this matter in more detail with the Minister and to get firm assurances from him that the levy will only be for four years and will not be built upon.</P>
        <P>We are all practising politicians and amateur economists, but we are receiving queries and telephone calls from constituents who are worrying about the security of their savings.  I would love to be able to give them the answer, but I do not have the necessary economic expertise.  I look forward to debating this question more fully with the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Regarding our discussion on the pension levy and the pensions industry, while Senator Byrne will claim I am straying beyond the narrow confines of the Bill, we need a full debate on pensions as an economic topic.  In the last Oireachtas, work was done on pension reform, a matter that needs to be considered.  We must ask how the money in pension funds is applied, how it is spent and what benefits accrue.  This is a debate for another day.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation.  It is a step in the right direction, but we must keep reminding ourselves that we have many more steps to take if we are to put Ireland back to work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, and prior to her the other Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to the Chamber.</P>
        <P>This week marks the first 100 days of the Government which was elected by the people with an unprecedented majority to lead in a time of crisis and to deliver change.  However, the Finance Bill comprises just 14 pages, fails to deliver change and hope and is remarkable not by what it includes but by what it fails to include.  In the statement of common purpose in the programme for Government, the governing parties stated &ldquo;both our parties are committed to protecting the vulnerable and to burden-sharing on an equitable basis&rdquo;.  We can judge this <Col N="426"/>commitment to protecting the vulnerable and equitable burden sharing by the contents of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Senators have mentioned the pension levy.  While I want to avoid repetition, the matter deserves further emphasis.  The central tenet of the Bill and the jobs initiative is the imposition of a 0.6% levy on pension funds for the next four years.  It is estimated that the Government will raise &euro;470 million per year via the levy.  However, the pension levy is not about &ldquo;burden-sharing on an equitable basis&rdquo;.  It is deeply inequitable.  It excludes the approved retirement funds, ARFs, used by many high earners to invest in their pensions and makes no differentiation between the pensions held by ordinary workers and those of high earners.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has long advocated the standardisation of pension tax reliefs at the lower rate.  Not only would this remove an unjustifiable inequity in the current system, it would generate significant revenue for the State to invest in economic recovery.  Based on figures from a 2009 ESRI report on pensions, standardising pension tax reliefs would generate an additional &euro;1.1 billion, of which &euro;616 million would come from the top 10% of earners.  The same report estimated that, in the same year, 82% of all pension tax relief went to the top 20% of income earners, which demonstrates the grossly unequal nature of this relief and the need for its reform.  The Finance Bill is a lost opportunity to deliver an equitable approach to pensions.  As Senator Bradford stated, we need a debate on pensions.</P>
        <P>The Government claims it will use the pension levy to fund the jobs initiative, but that initiative can be said to be too little, too late.  It fails to measure up to the pre-election promises of the Government parties.  For example, it is a far cry from Fine Gael&rsquo;s election promise to create 100,000 jobs over five years and 45,000 new employment and training places to target youth unemployment.  It is also a far cry from the strategic investment bank and the 60,000 training and employment places promised by the Labour Party.</P>
        <P>For a Government obsessed with bond market confidence, it fails to recognise people&rsquo;s loss of confidence.  A sizeable section of our community has little or no faith or confidence in the Government&rsquo;s actions.  As has been highlighted, we learned this week of a 25% increase in the number of people who moved to live in Britain last year.  Some 13,920 people moved to Britain last year.  The overwhelming majority were aged between 18 and 34 years.  Young, educated and skilled people are leaving the State in their droves, yet they are the very people we need to drive economic recovery.  We have heard that our greatest export market is Britain.  The figures show that our greatest exports are our young people.  Behind these bald statistics are their families, friends and communities which are losing a generation of young people owing to an economic crisis created in bankers&rsquo; boardrooms.  The jobs initiative has fallen short of what is required to create jobs for the young people concerned and the Government is, once again, falling back on the safety valve of emigration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We believe and international experience has demonstrated that economic growth will be generated only by investment in a major stimulus package.  For this reason we should revert to the jobs fund if we are to properly invest in job creation measures.  A &euro;2.9 billion stimulus package in the next 12 months would not alone be affordable but is urgently needed if we are to save and create badly needed jobs and assist small and medium-sized businesses and hard-pressed families.  In this regard, Sinn F&eacute;in would use &euro;2 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to fast-track labour intensive infrastructural projects to create jobs.  We would also inject a further &euro;500 million, in the form of a family stimulus package funded from additional tax revenue, into the economy.  The aim of this package of measures would be to support working families and those on social welfare to boost consumer spending, the lack of which is crippling the domestic economy.  The abolition of the universal social charge would release a further &euro;400 million of spending power back into the domestic economy.  Again, this <Col N="427"/>type of radical and progressive economic policy change is missing from the Bill and represents another opportunity lost.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the reduction to 9% in the rate of VAT for tourism related goods and services, which is a welcome boost for the tourism sector.  However, any potential gain must be viewed against the proposal to increase the top rate of VAT to 23%, a  regressive tax measure which will have a crippling effect on Border economies, including my own county of Cavan.  We should be capitalising on opportunities to ensure the harmonisation of tax policy.</P>
        <P>We are now 100 days into the term of office of the new Government and this finance Bill falls short of what is required.  Measures such as the pension levy will not help us in any way.  Sinn F&eacute;in, therefore, will not be supporting the Bill.</P>

        <P>I am delighted to hear the Opposition defending the banks.  Anyone who knows anything about investment banking will know that investment bankers earn phenomenal amounts in commission and bonuses.  The figure of 0.6% to be taken from pension funds every six months could be made up by the investment banks which are making a great deal of money.  While Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il are happy to back the investment banks, no one from that side of the House has yet suggested investment bankers should take a cut in the commission and bonuses they receive.  Everyone else has taken a hit.  News reports in the United Kingdom and the USA have highlighted the amounts being made by investment banks.  We should not stop at taking 0.6% from pension funds but should pressurise investment banks to put back in some of the money they are earning.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has stated the standardisation of pension reliefs would bring in &euro;1 billion.  This would do the exact same as that for which Sinn F&eacute;in is criticising the Government because people would continue to lose money in their pensions because they would not have any to put into their schemes.</P>
        <P>I welcome other aspects of the Bill, including the reduction in the tourist tax.  This is of importance to County Donegal which depends on people being flown into Galway and Dublin.  This provision will help to boost tourism in the county.</P>
        <P>The Irish Banking Federation has stated loans are being made available.  In this regard, it has quoted an 88% approval rate.  However, approval of and taking out a loan are different.  As I understand it, while people are being offered money, they may only be offered &euro;30,000 of the sum of &euro;50,000 sought, which is of no use to them.  Currently, when a person is refused a loan by a credit institution, he or she can appeal the matter to the Credit Review Office.  I ask the Minister to consider providing that that office be the first point of call for loan applications.  People could then submit its report with their loan applications.  Often, they just give up when they have been refused by a bank.  Their confidence would be boosted if they could obtain approval for a loan from the Credit Review Office prior to applying to the bank for it.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton.  </P>
        <P>I welcome the measures contained in this finance Bill which seek to promote tourism.  However, as Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy stated, our prices are not enticing tourists to come here.  He also pointed out that while lunch in the United Kingdom cost &pound;5, it cost &euro;13 here.  In the past many of our tourist operators were forced out of the sector because of over-pricing.  There is <Col N="428"/>evidence that this is happening again.  Both last week and this week one could get a hotel room in almost any hotel in Dublin city for &euro;59 per night.  This weekend, because there is a concert taking place in Dublin, a similar room will cost &euro;299 per night.  In one case, the cost has been set at &euro;399.  Also, apartments which normally can be rented for &euro;75 per night will next Saturday night cost &euro;499.  We need to address this problem.  If we want to take full advantage of the benefit that can accrue to the economy from tourism, we must ensure we do not kill off the sector.  Ireland is an expensive country to visit.  We should, therefore, introduce a mechanism to put a cap on what hotels can charge customers.  While I acknowledge market forces to a degree determine what rates should be paid, it is ridiculous that anyone should be expected to pay double the price of a room on particular nights.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are many other initiatives which, if introduced, could assist us.  Many Bus &Eacute;ireann buses are travelling around the country half empty.  We could offer tourists vouchers to use these buses which would bring them to towns not predominantly known for their tourism product.  Providing incentives for tourists would encourage them to spend more money.  Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen stated the country was known as the Ireland of big welcomes, the Ireland of the c&eacute;ad mile f&aacute;ilte.  When we reach our full potential this time, we must ensure we retain this image.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, back to the House.  I also wish him well in his relatively new appointment.  Following the summer we will have to cease referring to new appointments, but for now the honeymoon period continues for the Government.  Given the huge mandate it received, the criticisms are muted.  I have no doubt that this will continue to be the case at least until the Book of Estimates is published and the next budget is introduced.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to oppose measures for opposition&rsquo;s sake.  My colleagues in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad have focused on the pension levy, as have many other speakers on the Opposition side.  The contributions made from the Government side have been remarkable, given the omission of any reference to the levy.  Members on the Government side have focused on issues not necessarily relevant or germane to the Bill.  However, having recently been on the Government side, I can fully understand the reluctance of Government Senators to be too critical of the Government&rsquo;s proposals.  The issues in regard to the pension levy are well aired.  It is interesting that, when one looks into it in some detail, one discovers the overwhelming majority of those involved in the pensions industry have not welcomed this move.  One of the reasons they have not welcomed it is that, despite assurances to the contrary from the Minister when introducing the proposals, it is suggested it is not a progressive tax primarily because the rate is the same for a person on the bread line as it is for the very wealthy.</P>
        <P>Recent reports suggest the rich still control wealth of between &euro;100 billion and &euro;200 billion here.  It is argued by Mr. James Fitzsimons, an independent financial adviser specialising in tax and financial planning, that the Government would collect as much revenue from the better off without causing hardship.  Mr. Damien Kiberd in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 22 May stated that people pay the levy whether one&rsquo;s scheme is booming, insolvent or just chugging along.  In his reply, the Minister of State might indicate whether there is any discussion about the enormous amount of wealth that is perceived to remain in the country.</P>
        <P>I make this suggestion somewhat guardedly as I remember, when I first went to England as a teenager to work, that one of the political catch-cries of the day was that if you elected a Labour government, the money flew out of the country, and if you elected a Tory government, the money flew back.  I am not sure, given the configuration of this Government, which is of the centre-right and the centre-left, exactly what that perception might now be.  I am cautious, <Col N="429"/>however, and know the Government will be equally cautious to ensure that wealth does not fly out of the country and that it is harnessed for the best interests of the people.  On the face of it, there is a considerable amount of money sloshing around out there, despite the lack of consumer demand and the low rate of consumer spending, and that people are actually hoarding it.  It is an issue the Minister might address.</P>
        <P>I know the Government will justify this on the basis that it has no option and it needs to raise revenue.  While this is seen as being one of the easier ways of raising revenue, the point that has been made repeatedly, and which I repeat, is that there is a possibility people could lose faith in pensions.  For the past ten or 15 years, certainly from the time of the late Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Mr. S&eacute;amus Brennan, there has been a strong, proactive approach by successive Administrations, including this one, to encourage people to take out pension plans because there is a pensions time-bomb of which we are all aware.  The former Minister, Mr. Charlie McCreevy&rsquo;s now forgotten but much lauded initiative of introducing the National Pensions Reserve Fund went some way to attempting to head off the serious implications in some 20 to 25 years time of an increasingly greying population in Ireland and of the State not being able to pay adequate pensions to those who have reached the eligible age.  This is why I suggest the social welfare Bill that will shortly come before the House, which will result in an increase in the age limit for old age pensions, is being introduced now so as not to arrive at a situation where the time-bomb explodes and the Government of the day will not be able to pay pensions.  In that context, it is surprising the Government is now going after pensions through the imposition of a pension levy.</P>
        <P>In defence of the argument that the pension levy should not be imposed, while the Government argues that most of the money in pension funds is invested outside the State, Dominic Coyle in <i>The Irish Times </i>of 23 May stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">This is gombeen economics.  ...the notion that pension funds should be invested entirely within the State is so inane that you would wonder about the wisdom of hopes the people of the State have invested in our new leaders.  To have invested them entirely within the State would have ensured only that pension savings went the same way as other investments in Irish equities and property in recent years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My experience has been that for many years, since the noughties or before, much of pension funds was invested here in Ireland because the banks owned many of the pension companies that were providing them, so it is a point I would not necessarily agree with.</P>
        <P>The positives in the Bill include the abolition of the air travel tax and the reduction in VAT.  My colleagues in the other House have criticised the Government for not reducing the tax on home heating oil, fuel and all the various items to which the 13% VAT rate applies for the general population, including those who are most vulnerable.  However, as I have stated in the House previously, I welcome the reduction in VAT to 9% and believe it will make a real difference, not only by protecting jobs in the tourism and service industry but by enhancing that position.</P>
        <P>With regard to the air travel tax, I was in correspondence with my good friend and a person I have long admired, Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary, who took me to task about comments I had made.  On the evening of the debate on tourism in the House, Senator Se&aacute;n Barrett referred to a very significant hike in airport charges.  There is no doubt the abolition of the travel tax alone will not result in Ryanair and Aer Lingus expanding their routes or increasing visitor numbers to the country.  The nettle will have to be grasped in regard to airport charges, as the hike in these charges since 2009 has been totally unsustainable.  If it continues, I have no doubt Ryanair and Aer Lingus will come back to the Minister to say that while they are delighted that he abolished <Col N="430"/>the travel tax, to keep landing charges as they are is unsustainable, and this applies to the manner in which this was done as well as everything else.  Unless that nettle is grasped, I reluctantly concede there may not the anticipated increase in visitors to this country.  I wish it were otherwise but it seems this will be a deal-breaker for Ryanair and perhaps to a lesser extent for Aer Lingus.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, well in his consultations and discussions with Ryanair.  Ultimately, Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary is a patriot who, despite the fact that for him the bottom line is the dollar, wants to do well by this country.  He lives here and pays his taxes here, unlike some of the better known celebrities who have moved their tax bases to other countries.  For that reason if for no other, continued and sustained discussion between the Department of Finance and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport may result in a positive outcome.  Overall, I welcome those two elements of the Bill but it remains to be seen whether the imposition of the levy on pensions will gain universal acclamation.  I have a feeling it will be an unending story in  the next couple of years.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and congratulate him on his elevation to high office.  As is already doing a good job, we need not hope he will do that.</P>
        <P>The last contribution from the Opposition side was a very positive one.  It is good to see balance, which is most welcome, as is the jobs initiative.  While this initiative might be seen by some as a drop in the ocean, it is drop that will definitely have a ripple effect.  If we have enough drops in the ocean in this economy, it will create the waves we need to get out of the mess we are in as a result of very poor Government performance over the years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of the issues have already been touched on, in particular, the travel tax.  For many months, Ryanair and in particular Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary have highlighted this issue.  It was madness to introduce a travel tax in the first place and one of the striking features of this initiative is that the travel tax is being removed.  There is also a commitment to deal with airport charges, which is another of Ryanair&rsquo;s bugbears.  Nonetheless, we want to work with Ryanair; we do not want to work for it.  It is a partnership approach.  The best government one can have is a government that works in partnership with all the stakeholders, particularly those in business who are trying to create jobs.  I have no doubt the intentions on the Government side are to work with Ryanair.  It remains to be seen if Ryanair is prepared to follow suit and work with the Government.</P>
        <P>Senator John Kelly referred to the ripping off that is taking place in this city, where Saturday night is a particularly difficult night to get a hotel room and monopoly money is being quoted for accommodation.  Similarly, two weeks ago when Members of this House were trying to get rooms in Dublin, monopoly prices were quoted by hotels that otherwise would provide a room for &euro;40 or &euro;50.  To add to this, I was in a particular popular venue in this city on 1 June and at 11.23 p.m. ordered a beverage, for which I paid &euro;5.  I ordered a second at 11.44 p.m. and when I handed over &euro;5 for it, I was told I owed an extra euro.  I have the receipts to prove it.  I will not name the hostelry in question because it would not be appropriate to do so, although it deserves to be named.</P>

	<P>If we want to promote tourism, we need to respect tourists and work with people.  Altering charges and having a till automatically set to up charges at a certain time of night is unethical and inappropriate and should not happen.  </P>
        <P>The Government alone will not solve the problems of the country.  We must all work together &mdash; businesses, workers, agencies and the Government.  The jobs initiative is a very good start, but we need much more.  The next step should be to synchronise the various marketing agencies that market our tourist product abroad.  We have a lot of them and many of them do good work, but there is a significant overlap.  When it comes to national campaigns such as the one to have the Cliffs of Moher included as one of the seven wonders of nature, every citizen has a responsibility to use whatever means possible to ensure we get over the line on 11 November 2011.  It would make a significant difference to tourism.</P>
        <P>In his previous capacity as Opposition education spokesperson, the Minister of State brought forward interesting proposals to promote educational tourism and the teaching of English as a foreign language.  He spoke about the potential for growth in that regard.  Emerging economies such as those of China, Taiwan and other countries have people with significant amounts of money who want their children to learn English.  There is also potential in the American market to develop courses in the arts.  One can see what is being done in north County Clare with the Burren College of Art.  This is something that could be replicated throughout the country.  Every county has glorious, unique factors that could be used to develop various courses and initiatives.  We will always have traditional tourism sources where somebody flies in, spends two weeks in the country and then flies out again.  However, if we want to make a difference, we must be novel and innovative and consider initiatives in terms of international festivals, educational tourism, art and culture tourism and so on.  I hope the jobs initiative which is welcome and a breath of fresh air is successful.  Business people already feel confident and we heard the reports earlier this week on confidence in the tourism sector.  If we work hard and use our resources &mdash; the landscape, our people and our ability to work hard &mdash; and if there is a positive, partnership approach taken by the Government, the future is bright.  However, it will not be easy.</P>

        <P>I am always happy to clear up any confusion for the Labour Party in respect of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s proposals.  Mention was made of our proposals on pensions.  We make no apology for wanting to standardise pension reliefs, which would mean that high earners would enjoy the same percentage of relief as low and middle income families and individuals.  The money saved would negate the need to take money away from the pension schemes of the families we already know are struggling.</P>
        <P>It is important to consider where we are in the economy and the position on jobs.  The unemployment figure now stands at 443,400 or 14.8%, up 1.6% on last year&rsquo;s figure.  The rate of inflation in May was up 2.7% on the figure for the previous month.  Retail sales were down 3.9% in April on the figure for the previous year, which indicates people are not spending because of the austerity measures taken last year and the previous year.  Some 80,000 families are in mortgage distress.  The deficit this year will be &euro;18.2 billion.  New Government debt is &euro;24 billion and the total debt will be &euro;141 billion by the end of the year.  The cost of the bailout is &euro;70 billion, on which the interest will be &euro;5 billion this year.  It is sobering that some &euro;5 billion will be spent on interest repayments in bailing out the banks.  There is &euro;3.1 billion of <Col N="432"/>unguaranteed bonds in Anglo Irish Bank.  Before the general election, Fine Gael called for unguaranteed bondholders to be burned and the money to be used to stimulate the economy to ensure the money was used in the interests of the people rather than bailing out foreign investors and gamblers.</P>
        <P>The Government made great play of the jobs initiative and stated it would be revenue neutral.  However, many argue that it will also be jobs neutral.  They are struggling to see where the jobs will be created.  Senator Martin Conway suggested it might be a drop in the ocean.  Looking at the potential for job creation, it will take us almost 1,000 years to get anywhere near where we need to be in getting the 440,000 people unemployed back to work.</P>
        <P>The pension levy proposed in the Bill is just one example of the daftness of the Government&rsquo;s proposals.  Some pension schemes are insolvent, while others have been devastated.  We are aware that thousands of Waterford Crystal workers lost almost all of their pensions.  Many pension schemes have taken a heavy hit because of the international markets, yet the proposal is to return to the people mentioned and take more money from their pension funds.  That is unfair.</P>
        <P>Before the general election, Fine Gael and the Labour Party were very clear that they wished to abolish the travel tax completely.  Now it will be at the discretion of the Minister and is only a short-term proposal.  This is a row-back.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposed reduction in VAT at the lower rate, but the increase in the top rate, 23%, will negate what will happen at the lower rate.</P>
        <P>Senator Kathryn Reilly spoke about some of the proposals brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in.  We want a &euro;7 billion jobs stimulus plan over a period of three years and suggest the money should come from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Rather than bailing out the banks and putting more money into toxic banks, the money should be used to stimulate the economy.  Similar proposals were made by the Fine Gael when in opposition.  Before the general election it promised the creation of 100,000 jobs.  The Labour Party promised to take &euro;2 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and to set up a national strategic investment bank.  None of this has materialised.  We must take drastic action and start making the hard decisions.</P>
        <P>I agree with David McWilliams &mdash; Senators may laugh &mdash; that the real tragedy is that the promises these parties made during the general election are not being lived up to.  The Government is simply following the agenda of its predecessor.  David McWilliams said recently that the bigger parties and the parties in government were afraid to make the radical decisions needed.  They are afraid to make the big decisions.  Unfortunately, it is Frankfurt&rsquo;s way, the IMF&rsquo;s way and the ECB&rsquo;s way, but that is not the way to secure genuine economic recovery.  If we continue with the policies being put in place, we will see more people leaving the country, more people losing their jobs and the economy contracting even more.  That is where this Government will lead us unless it changes track very quickly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good to see the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, in the Chamber for the discussion on the Finance (No. 2) Bill which will give legal effect to some of the initiatives in the jobs initiative programme introduced by the Government.</P>
        <P>I join some of my colleagues in welcoming many aspects of the legislation, some sections in particular, for example, the proposed elimination of the air travel tax.  However, it is clear from section 2 that no date for this is specified in the Bill.  In theory, it would be a matter for the Government to agree, in conjunction with the airlines, when the proposal should be implemented.  My view and that of Fianna F&aacute;il is that a date should be included.  We welcome the fact it is mentioned but this must be followed by a confirmed date.</P><Col N="433"/>
        <P>We all welcome the proposition in section 3 in regard to the VAT reduction in the tourism sector because all of us know the difficulties being experienced by the hospitality and tourism sector throughout the country, particularly in rural areas.  We realise that too many hotels were built during the boom and some of these are now struggling.  Those that survive, especially small family-run hotels, need a boost, and the reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% will be of benefit in that regard.  I would have welcomed an additional attempt by the Government to have reduced VAT further, if possible, especially on items such as coal and oil where prices affect many people who are struggling in the current economic climate to buy fuel to heat their homes.  That deals with the proposal to give legal effect to the reduction of 9% in VAT.  I shall refer to the pensions issue shortly.</P>
        <P>The Bill will give legal effect to the jobs initiative programme which, in many ways, seems to be a move backwards by the Government instead of a proactive measure.  Without criticising it, it appears to be a rowing back on the pre-election promises of Fine Gael, whose NewERA document was bandied around everywhere from Donegal to Cork and Galway to Dublin and was supposed to create 100,000 jobs by 2015.  On 9 March, the Taoiseach outlined in the D&aacute;il that within 100 days of taking office, the new Government would introduce a jobs budget.  That was a move away from the NewERA document.  The jobs initiative is a further move away from the original two promises made, both pre- and post-election.  Although we welcome this attempt by the Government, there are no specific targets for how many jobs are to be created.  Another area not referred to in the jobs initiative is the pre-election proposal by Fine Gael to establish a strategic investment bank.  There seems to be a question about that now.  Perhaps the Minister of State might also address that issue.</P>
        <P>The Sinn F&eacute;in Senator referred to stimulus.  Although we would all love to have a magic wand that could provide a stimulus to any economy, if we look at the biggest economy in the world, that of the United States, the President of that country provided a stimulus to the economy which has proved to be questionable, even negative.  It has not produced any positive economic impact in terms of job creation in that economy.  Ireland is a very small, open and exposed economy &mdash; the words used by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, yesterday in New York.  By their nature, stimulus packages do not work very effectively in small, open economies.  Stimulus is an important issue but the most important element is to put pressure on the job creating agencies &mdash; IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and others &mdash; to go out and bring back investment to this country.  Investment is there to be won.  I question the work being done by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  I hope part of the new Government&rsquo;s proposals will be to put additional pressure on both agencies to bring in investment.</P>
        <P>Much has been said in this House and the D&aacute;il about the pension levy which is effectively a stamp duty of 0.6% on the market value of assets under management in the pension schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  Approved retirement funds, ARFs, are exempt, as are, it would appear, pensions paid out of an annuity, public sector pensions and vested personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs.  Will the Minister of State clarify why PRSAs, which affect very many workers, are not exempt?  The persons involved also have to pay the universal social charge on those payments and, if that is taken into account, there appears to be a double taxation on PRSAs.  It makes no sense to exempt approved retirement funds, on the other hand.  People like Michael Fingleton and Se&aacute;nie FitzPatrick have invested money into those funds for wealth-gathering reasons.  I fail to understand why wealth-gathering pensions are not being targeted.</P>
        <P>On a number of occasions the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on public enterprise in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Michael McGrath, raised the need for consultation with the Pensions Board.  From replies to D&aacute;il questions it appears there has been no, or very little, consultation with the Pensions Board.  Unfortunately, the request made by Deputy McGrath concerning the need for <Col N="434"/>an impact assessment on the pension levy also appears to have fallen on deaf ears.  Perhaps the Minister of State might advise this House why there was no meaningful consultation with the Pensions Board and why the Government will not consider the option of an impact assessment on the pension levy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Conway on two points.  He referred in the first place to hotels in this city that bump up their charges.  We mentioned the assistance to be provided for the hospitality sector, but we know, too, that events, whether sports or cultural, take place in this city, as do concerts, and hotels that charge one price when business is quiet bump up prices for visitors attending concerts and football games in Dublin and other cities.  It is disgraceful that those establishments do that.  Very many people, many of whom are living on the breadline, come to Dublin to attend Gaelic football or soccer games or big concerts.  They are forced to pay exorbitant prices when many of us could get the same room for a fraction of the cost when no such event occurs.  I agree with Senator Conway, and Senator Kelly also referred to the issue.  I would like to see the Government tackle this and take on these elements within the hospitality sector.  They tend to be chains of hotels acting against consumers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I found the debate on this Bill very stimulating, wide-ranging and interesting.  I should first congratulate Senator O&rsquo;Donovan on his elevation to high office and I look forward to working with him and other colleagues over the course of this Seanad term.</P>
        <P>I shall deal presently with the issues colleagues raised but will first paint a broad picture.  Yesterday I attended two very important meetings in Brussels, one being the Eurogroup meeting, the other the informal meeting of ECOFIN.  Right now this country faces an enormous challenge, as Members of this House are fully aware.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I heard Senator Cullinane refer to a commentator who spoke about the importance of what he described as &ldquo;radical&rdquo; solutions.  He suggested that the Government has failed to consider such solutions because it is afraid to do so.  The immediate &ldquo;radical&rdquo; solution that faces this country this year, next year and the following year is the correction of its enormous deficit.  If external support were not being provided through the troika and the financial programme we are currently operating were not in place, this country would face an immediate requirement to balance the books to the tune of &euro;18 billion, as opposed to the &euro;6 billion correction that is being pursued with cross-party support.  That is the reality Senator Cullinane and his party must face.  If one moves away from the financial programme in place until the end of 2013, one will only be able to spend what one is taking in.  That &euro;18 billion imbalance would have to be addressed immediately.</P>
        <P>The Government, which I understand will have been in office for 100 days tomorrow, has not been over-hyping this jobs budget or initiative.  One can call it what one likes.  We introduced it as a modest set of proposals to help to spark the domestic Irish economy.  On the point made by Senator Mooney, it is absolutely crucial to get people spending again.  There is &euro;96 billion in ordinary people&rsquo;s accounts.  I do not refer to the commercial accounts of big entities, but to the accounts of ordinary people who have salted away &euro;3,000, &euro;4,000 or &euro;10,000.  People are frightened to spend in this economy because they are not sure if they will still be in their jobs next week, the following week or next year.  They may have to save because their partners have lost their jobs.  The savings ratio in this country is way out of order by comparison with normal industrial societies.  People are saving as never before.  I suspect all of us appreciate that the Government&rsquo;s task, in trying to reboot the domestic economy, is to bring confidence back to the economy, as Senator Conway suggested.</P><Col N="435"/>
        <P Just="Left">The economy has collapsed in the last three years.  As I said in my opening remarks, GDP has decreased by 15% over that period.  The economy is a very fragile flower.  It is in the accident and emergency ward.  It wants to get out of that ward, to get back into the markets and to get some confidence going again.  In circumstances in which the lender of last resort is operating in this economy, and will continue to be in the near future, the restoration of a sense of confidence is required.  It is important to emphasise that we volunteered to participate in this process, which involves our EU partners, the IMF and other lenders across the international community.  Some people have described the broad economic framework in which we are operating as a straitjacket into which we have been put.  We are part of this package &mdash; it is not something that has been foisted upon us.  It allows us to step back from the markets for a year or so.  The Minister for Finance has made it absolutely clear, on receipt of advice from the NTMA, that he intends to attempt to gain some foothold in the markets and to test Ireland&rsquo;s support in them at the end of next year.  He will go back to the markets in a fuller way in 2013.  The objective of the Government, to put it crudely and bluntly, is to get back to the markets in the shortest possible time.  We will not be able to do so until we arrest the deficit position.</P>
        <P>There is an acceptance across the country that we have to implement the memorandum.  The international markets are making it clear that Ireland is doing whatever it can in the midst of the worst economic recession since the 1930s.  I referred at the outset to the meetings I attended in Brussels yesterday.  I am delighted to be able to report honestly to the House that the absolute understanding of the ECB and the European Commission is that we are meeting our targets at this early stage of the programme.  The programme is only in its seventh or eighth month, but the early indications are positive.  I refer Senators to the quarterly review of our external funding partners, which concluded that Ireland is on the right track and has met its targets to date.  That was the message I picked up in Brussels yesterday.  Ireland is not Greece.  We do not have a debt to GDP ratio of 160%.  It is 100% at present and we expect it to top out at approximately 118% by 2013.  It will be enormously challenging to service that debt for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>In the 1980s, one third of all tax received in this economy was used to make interest payments on the national debt.  In our worst position &mdash; in 2013, when our debt to GDP ratio will be at its height &mdash; the proportion of taxes being spent on interest payments will be no more than 120%.  We need to ask whether that is manageable.  I contend that it is.  We did it in the 1980s.  The problem in the 1980s was that we postponed the inevitable consequences of arresting the deficit.  As a member of a political party that made mistakes, unfortunately, in the period between 1982 and 1987, I am prepared to take responsibility for that.  If we have learned anything from the 1980s, which was a decade of misery, unemployment, high emigration and lack of investment, it should be that if one has a deficit position, one has to fix it.  That can only be done internally.  We do not need people living in Brussels, Washington or New York to dictate to us on that issue.  As a people, we need to decide to live within our means.  Public expenditure doubled over an eight-year period before our tax revenue collapsed completely at the end of that time as a result of an over-reliance on property.  We have to fix the expenditure problem.  Some of it requires increases in taxation.  The party opposite, which signed up to the first part of the plan, has accepted the need for &euro;1.2 billion in tax increases next year as part of the &euro;3.6 billion adjustment.  It is inevitable that some of this will be done by means of taxes.  I contend that the greater part of it cannot be done without cuts in expenditure.</P>
        <P>We are two thirds of the way along the path.  I accept that the previous Government had to take difficult decisions in this regard.  It is not easy.  Two thirds of the adjustment will have been made by the end of this year.  We will have to deal with the remaining one third.  We are making a &euro;6 billion adjustment this year.  That will be very difficult, as everyone knows.  When the Government came into office, it accepted the need for these adjustments and made two <Col N="436"/>important claims in an upfront manner.  We accept the outgoing Government&rsquo;s plan to provide for an accumulated adjustment of &euro;3.6 billion next year.  We think it is important to send a strong signal to the international markets to the effect that a &euro;3.6 billion adjustment, which the previous Government told the markets would occur, will occur under this Government.  We have to do it, which will be difficult given that taxes increased radically last year and expenditure has decreased.  The Ministers, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, and I are facing that task in the context of the comprehensive spending review, which I contend is a radical document.  Previously, the view of the Department of Finance was that if one wants an expenditure reduction of 4% or 8%, one should cut by 4% or 8% across the board rather than going through each Department&rsquo;s Vote line by line to ascertain where efficiencies can be achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to state honestly that if we are to make the planned adjustment of &euro;3.6 billion next year, whole programmes will have to be knocked out.  That needs to be the subject of political buy-in, support and debate.  The comprehensive spending review will involve parliamentary scrutiny of the choices and options we will face in that context.  We have said that a &euro;3.6 billion adjustment will occur next year under the programme.  It is important to stress that we have also said we want to reach a deficit position of 3% by 2015.  I remind colleagues that this is an ambitious target.  If the Government is emphasising that Ireland is not Greece because of the deficit situation, the restructuring that has happened and the adjustments that will happen, it also needs to tell the world, including its international partners, that it will make a success of this programme &mdash; that it will avail of the opportunity the programme presents not only to make crude and difficult spending adjustments but also to do the heavy lifting in terms of public service reform needed to make those savings stick across the various Votes. That is the context we face.</P>
        
        <P>In this tight difficult position, how do we try to engender the confidence within the domestic economy about which Senators spoke and, as I stated, in circumstances where we are not making exaggerated claims about these proposals?  We have set out in this Bill, which is the tax element of the jobs initiative, that certain matters can be tweaked with the VAT and the PRSI system as a means of trying to get job-rich growth that we need is the domestic economy.  Traditionally, the export-led economy, which is high-end in many respects but also important for manufacturers, does not produce the number of jobs that we would expect to get in the domestic economy.  Exports last year were up by 9%.  There is exceptional growth in exports.  The balance of payments show that we are paying our way in the world.  However, the key task is what we can do to get the confidence going that others have spoken about and to get people spending some of that &euro;96 billion that is there, and we have put out these ideas.</P>
        <P>Tourism is a good area of the economy.  We have built up a really good infrastructure.  Thanks to decisions taken by the previous Government, we have a superb tourism infrastructure.  It is a really good product which is much more competitive now than it was in the past.  We have cut back costs and tourists see real potential in this country.  We have lost a significant number of key markets &mdash; the British market being one.  In terms of what we can do to help people to come back to the country, as other colleagues stated, I welcome the fact that there is broad support for the abolition of the air travel tax, for the changes that we have made on the PRSI side and also for the changes we have made to VAT to spark the potential of tourism so that it can be one of the great exports as it was in the past.</P>
        <P>We have had three years of terrible economic contraction amounting to 15%.  We will get growth this year.  Who knows what it will be at the end of the year?  I will not make any exaggerated claims.  The official position of the Government is that growth could be approximately 0.8%.  There are some who suggest a higher figure, but the ESRI and others suggest differently.  At least, there is a broad consensus that we will have growth this year.</P><Col N="437"/>
        <P Just="Left">However, there is much broader consensus that next year the growth will be approximately 2.5%.  That view is held right the way across all of the international commentators, from the IMF to the European Commission, all of which stated that we will see accelerated growth next year in the economy.  Once we get to that position, our sustainable position on debt is much more manageable.</P>
        <P>I hear what colleagues stated on the question of consultation.  The Government produced its plans, but we have had substantial consultation since with the industry and with the Pensions Board.  Many of the amendments that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, brought forward on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il last week were a reflection of that consultation and the buy-in and support that was there.</P>
        <P>On the issue of the pension levy, no one likes to pay more tax and no one likes to pay a levy, but we should put matters in context.  As other speakers stated, my party put forward the idea of a pension levy well in advance of the general election.  It was in our pre-budget submission.  It was in our manifesto.  While it may not have received a considerable amount of publicity in the course of the election, that was not for the lack of saying it.  It was a proposal that we had put forward.  I would also say that it was mooted by the pensions industry in discussion with my party while in opposition.</P>
        <P>All of the bleating, the gnashing of teeth and the exaggerated claims by the pensions industry cannot get away from one simply fact, namely, it would be more than happy with a pension levy of 0.6% if there was no change to the tax relief at the top rate of tax.  As other colleagues stated, that is an issue that must be analysed closely in the context of our discussions with the troika.</P>
        <P>I would ask Senators to keep this in context.  This is 0.6% in a context where many management fees of these pension funds are in excess of 1% or 1.5% on an annualised basis, and the world has not collapsed when the pensions industry was paying itself those kind of bonuses over the course of the year.  As we will see in the course of Committee Stage debate tomorrow, there are opportunities where this small levy can be part and parcel of the fund itself or can be put into the management costs that apply on an annualised basis.  People should get a sense of perspective about this.  This is not a proposal for the long term.  It is a temporary measure.  That is why it is set out in the legislation in that regard.</P>
        <P>In terms of the existing significant tax break, let us be clear.  As I understand it, of the &euro;13.5 billion in tax credits given to people last year, &euro;3.5 billion relate to tax credits to the pensions industry.  Hundreds of thousands of citizens across society use the tax system rightly to gain pension cover.  When one speaks to people in the pensions industry, what they want is a sense of stability that the Government will not continuously come back, raise this levy or introduce some kind of instability to the market which would be bad for the pensions industry.  I would ask people to keep a sense of perspective, but we can deal with that in more detail on Committee Stage tomorrow.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators, including Senators O&rsquo;Brien, Zappone and Gilroy, mentioned ARFs.  It is not the case that ARFs have been specifically exempt from the levy.  The levy applies to the assets of pension funds and ARFs are not pension funds.  As a result, ARFs cannot come within the scope of the pension levy.  Annuities purchased in the name of individuals are also outside the scope of the scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">ARFs are investment options into which the proceeds of certain pension arrangements can be invested on retirement.  ARFs are designed to provide a stream of income to their owners on retirement in the same way as annuities but with more flexibility and control for the beneficiaries over the funds involved.  If drawdowns are not made from ARFs, a notional or imputed drawdown amounting to 5% of the assets in the ARF is deemed to take place each year, which <Col N="438"/>notional drawdown is liable to tax at the ARF owner&rsquo;s marginal tax rate.  Unlike the pension fund levy which is temporary, the 5% notional distribution is permanent. The Seanad might note, however, that on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il the Minister undertook to examine how best to increase the percentage notional distribution of high-value ARFs while ensuring that more modest ARFs would be protected.</P>
        
        <P>The point has been made in this debate by a number of Senators that those top earners who squirrel away vast sums of money through ARFs are not paying any tax on those amounts.  That is not true.  A different form of taxation applies.  It is not done in the way in which the levy has described; it is done by the charge, which last year went from 3% to 5%.  Therefore, they pay an annual charge at that percentage rate.  The Minister made the point that he would consider an increase in the notional charge between now and December if he thinks that advisable, but that is a matter for the December budget.  ARFs do not come under the scope of the levy but they are subject to tax.  It is merely a misconception that has been put out there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Zappone and Reilly mentioned the standard rating of tax relief on pension contributions.  I am sure the Senators will be aware, as am I, that the pension fund levy comes at a time when the gradual reduction from marginal to standard rate tax relief on pension contributions forms part of the fiscal consolidation measures in the agreement with the European Commission, IMF and ECB.  When introducing the jobs initiative last May, the Minister for Finance gave a commitment to examine this issue.  The Government has initiated a comprehensive review of expenditure in order to provide it with a set of decision options to meet the overall fiscal consolidation objectives and realign spending with the programme for Government priorities.  The review is to be completed by the end of September this year.  The Government will then examine the findings and, in consultation with the EU, the IMF and the ECB, will introduce fiscally neutral changes to the detail of the EU-IMF programme of fiscal support.  The Minister for Finance has undertaken to examine the scope for any change to the proposed standard rating of tax relief on pension contributions in that context.</P>
        <P>Senators Michael D&rsquo;Arcy, Quinn and Clune welcomed the amendment to the research and development tax credit scheme.  I agree that this is an important development which will encourage more companies, especially those outside the country, to come and invest here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Keane referred to the increase in the specified income limit from &euro;12,700 to approximately &euro;18,000 in the context of the extension of the approved retirement fund, ARF, option to all defined contribution pension arrangements in this year&rsquo;s Finance Act.  I have noted the Senator&rsquo;s comments.  They are not directly related to the contents of the Bill but the increase to which she refers was well signalled in the national pensions framework published in March 2010.  The argument is to have a sustainable pension which delivers something for people at the end of the day, but the previous &euro;12,700 limit would not have given any significant relief to people in the real world given the difficulties in the economy.  The argument holds that the &euro;18,000 limitation proposed at the time guarantees at least some revenue stream for people on pensions.  We will examine the issue in the context of the overall number of people who have pension cover.</P>
        <P>Senator Zappone made the point that the real issue is how to guarantee additional pension cover in a circumstance where those comprising whole swathes of the private sector have no pension cover at all and who will, ultimately, depend on only one pension, the contributory pension.  That is an issue for wider public debate but I note the Senator&rsquo;s comments.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s comments in connection with IDA Ireland and the need to have a focused campaign of job extension and opportunities throughout the country.  The combined influence of Ireland&rsquo;s increasing competitiveness and business costs, the commit<Col N="439"/>ment to the 12.5% corporate tax rate, the transformation of our client operations and activities and our investment in science, technology and innovation will continue to attract and increase the level of inward investment in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I endorse Senator Quinn&rsquo;s comments and his suggestion that the role of Government is to stimulate the economy rather than create jobs directly.  That is the point.  The only way we will get back some of the jobs we have lost and create opportunities for young people who have lost jobs throughout the economy is to have the right policies in place rather than the idea that we can subsidise employment.  That will not create the jobs of the future.  Senator Quinn referred to the need to encourage individuals to set up companies.  The seed capital scheme continues to be available for those in PAYE employment or those who have been made redundant to encourage such individuals to start up their own business.  Senators may be aware that the seed capital scheme is part of the business expansion scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe raised the issue of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and financial advice available generally.  I understand the Welsh Financial Education Unit is providing a rolling programme of advice and support for the planning and delivery of financial education for seven to nine year olds in schools.  There is always merit in improving the financial awareness of individuals of all ages, including those of school-going age.  In a period of limited resources, however, it may be more appropriate to focus on individuals with actual debt and financial difficulties.  The State provides significant resources to MABS annually.  The financial commitment amounts to &euro;18 million this year.  More than 250 full-time and part-time staff are employed to give direct assistance to people who find themselves in debt or a difficult financial position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the comments made by colleagues on all sides.  I look forward to the next stage of the debate tomorrow during which we can tease out in a more meaningful way the contributions on Committee Stage.  The Government is being upfront with people.  These proposals are modest.  They are well focused and are about engendering confidence in the domestic economy which has collapsed in the past three years.  They will ring-fence those sections of the economy where we believe we can re-boot opportunities quickly.  There is broad support throughout the House for the measures as announced.  I realise there is opposition on the question of the pension levy.  However, we must do this in a fiscally neutral way.  It would be dishonest were the Government to spend money it does not have.  We are in this difficult financial position because of the financial programme we have entered into with our international partners.  To do otherwise would be fiscally imprudent and would not sustain the country or provide a way out of the support we have been given for the next two years or so.  The task of Government is clear: to regain the reputation the country once had.  The way to do this is to stick to the programme, which has been internationally regarded as yielding some success for Ireland in a circumstance in which there is such an international crisis, especially a crisis within the eurozone.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The motion is in the name of the Independent group and will be moved by Senator Zappone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P><Col N="440"/>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann, in light of the commitment in the programme for Government to overhaul the way politics and Government works, recognises the need for change in how it conducts its business and agrees to:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />put in place arrangements so that this House can engage directly with well-informed citizens and residents from all walks of life whose experience and expertise can contribute to debates on issues of public importance thereby adding considerable value to our work as legislators;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />invite to the floor of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, on a case by case and ongoing basis, appropriate leaders and representatives of civic life who have a significant contribution to make to the deliberations of this House; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />include in these arrangements the hosting of respectful North-South dialogue that consolidates the peace process in Northern Ireland, develops a peace dividend for all communities affected by the conflict, deepens cross-Border relationships and promotes a shared approach to the significant centenaries that will arise in the next decade.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The Independent group puts forward this motion for the 24th Seanad which relates to the manner in which some aspects of business could be conducted in the House.  The programme for Government commits to overhauling the way politics and Government works, and this is the context of the motion.  We believe acceptance of the motion will further both the relevance and rightness of what we do.</P>
        <P>The motion seeks agreement on three actions.  The first is to arrange the direct engagement of the House with informed citizens and residents because they have value to add to our work as legislators.  They could brief the Seanad about the efforts they are making to solve problems and to make business, family, cultural and community life as good as they can be.</P>
        <P>Our second proposal is to invite appropriate leaders and representatives of civic life to the Seanad floor to participate in our deliberations.  Third, we propose to host respectful North-South dialogue as part of these arrangements in order to support the consolidation of the peace process in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>As proposer of the motion, I will now set out our rationale for supporting it, after which my colleague, Senator Mac Conghail, will second the motion in light of his distinctive experiences and reflections.  First, these proposals will improve the quality and ethical tenor of our legislative scrutiny.  We wish to open our space to others because, by this simple act, we increase our connection to the people.  Amartya Sen, a Nobel laureate, political philosopher and global economist, writes extensively about the proper conduct of public affairs.  In his latest book, <i>The Idea of Justice</i>, he argues that the pronouncement of lawmakers must survive open and informed scrutiny and that we should come to issues with an open impartiality in order that we can take part in an interactive process of critical scrutiny, open to arguments from others and sensitive to the relevant information that can be obtained.</P>
        <P>By attentively listening to the diverse perspectives of future guests there is the potential that they will shape and inform our own perspectives and judgments and, in certain cases, influence the outcomes of our deliberations.  The Seanad should also take the courageous decision to convene outside the confines of this Chamber.  We could take the Seanad to the people and offer an opportunity for communities to explain and showcase their activities in the comfort of their local halls and community centres.  There could indeed be rich conversations through such a unique and real connection.</P><Col N="441"/>
        <P Just="Left">Second, the actions we propose push out the boundaries of how we can practise democracy.  These boundaries must be widened if we are to rebuild Ireland.  We have just heard some excellent recommendations in the course of the last debate in terms of how necessary it is to rebuild this country.  The 2004 report on Seanad reform recommends a &ldquo;formal system&rdquo; of public consultation to be put in place to allow for &ldquo;consultation with interested groups and individuals early in the legislative process&rdquo;.  The report correctly notes that this would give real meaning to the concept of participative democracy.  Our motion offers resonance with these views, but it goes one step further into the realm of deliberative democracy, a form of democracy in which public deliberation is central to legitimate lawmaking.  Public deliberation is a process of thoughtfully weighing options, discussing and considering all sides of an issue with the public prior to making judgment, law or policy.  J&uuml;rgen Habermas, a prominent proponent of this type of democracy, speaks often of the need for communicative competence in such public deliberations.</P>
        <P>A third consideration is how this type of politics can move us beyond interest-driven groups lobbying for resources or competing for advantages towards a practice of fair exchange between diverse perspectives in order to arrive at right and just conclusions.  However, the justice of these decisions depends on mechanisms which open up decision-making assemblies so that a diversity of voices is heard and in order that those affected by the decisions get the chance to have their voices heard and to agree or disagree with the decision-makers.  Consequently, our motion advocates genuine exchange as distinct from a traditional form of consultation between citizens, residents and lawmakers.</P>
        <P>This is the rationale for putting forward the specific recommendation that appropriate leaders and representatives of civic life come to the floor of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, to the whole assembly of Senators, in addition to inviting them to our community committees.  My colleague, Senator McAleese, has already referred to the transformative power of dialogue and ideas, with special reference to consolidating the peace process in Northern Ireland.  We wish to ensure that such power is available to us in this Chamber.  Senator McAleese will share more of his thoughts in this regard presently.  It is for these reasons that I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the motion.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Is &eacute; seo an ch&eacute;ad uair dom labhairt mar Sheanad&oacute;ir.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il le mo chlann agus, dar nd&oacute;igh, an Taoiseach, as ucht m&eacute; a ainmni&uacute;.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas freisin le gach Seanad&oacute;ir a thug comhairle agus c&uacute;namh dom i rith mo ch&eacute;ad c&uacute;pla l&aacute;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As this is my maiden speech, I take the opportunity to acknowledge my gratitude to the Taoiseach for offering me the privilege and responsibility of participating in the Upper House.  It is an honour for me and my family and also for my community, namely, the arts and cultural sector.  The last director of the Abbey Theatre to become a Senator was W. B. Yeats in the 1920s.  I am not claiming to be a Nobel laureate, but I accept this honour with humility and commitment on behalf of our national theatre.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have also been involved in two recent citizens initiatives, namely, the National Campaign for the Arts and We the Citizens.  What has struck me is how we have become disconnected from one another in our efforts to make our society a better place in which to live.  The need to become better and more active citizens is what motivated artists and community leaders at the turn of the 20th century when many civil society groups came together to make sense of the world and to seek a clearer identity for ourselves.  It was at this time that poets, trade unionists, teachers, politicians and soldiers &mdash; men and women &mdash; engaged in the great lockout of 1913, the foundation of the GAA, Cumann na mBan, the Gaelic League, the foundation <Col N="442"/>of the Abbey Theatre, the Easter Rising of 1916 and many other social and cultural events and organisations.</P>
        <P>We must reignite that spirit, and the Seanad can play an innovative role in this.  I am proud to make my first contribution in the House on a matter of change and innovation as set out in the motion proposed by my colleague, Senator Zappone.  I have Senator Leyden to thank for highlighting on our first day in the House the report on Seanad reform published by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in 2004.  This document makes a great deal of sense and shows that the mood for change is not recent.  We all know that change can be a difficult concept to grasp and handle.  My new role as Senator fills me with a mixture of pride, fear and the pressure of responsibility.  However, change is what we must do, and that was a common theme of many of the Senators who spoke on the first day.</P>
        <P>In my world of theatre we are constantly changing and innovating, partly because artists and playwrights provide us with the challenge of new ideas and new ways of telling our story.  In addition, our audiences can tell us what they want or think and a dialogue can emerge over time that is productive and mutually beneficial.  We are constantly on show.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann must prove itself by auditioning publicly in the forthcoming term to convince the public of its value and relevance.</P>
        <P>I have been involved in a new national and non-party political initiative, We the Citizens, which aims to reconnect citizens with the political system.  Our objective is to establish a citizens assembly which will enhance and support the parliamentary system.  I will speak about this in more detail on another occasion.  We the Citizens held seven public events throughout the country in the last six weeks, from Killarney to Letterkenny and from Blanchardstown to Cork, to see what themes and ideas fellow citizens might have about improving the governance of our country.  These were positive meetings in the sense that citizens are clearly beginning to realise they have a personal responsibility in engaging and participating in local and national decision-making.  In other words, it is about active citizenship.  The disconnect between citizens and politics is one of the issues we have identified in our public events, and the need to increase political participation is now an imperative.</P>
        <P>Seanad &Eacute;ireann, by doing its business differently, can assist in forging a greater connection between citizen and Senator.  Citizens vote once in a while, but what happens in the interim?  How can politicians and citizens engage in a mutually respectful and equal way?  It is about increasing our knowledge of the way Government works and improving civic education among our citizens in order that they can support the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>I heard the issues of transparency, accountability and personal responsibility debated at length during the We the Citizens public meetings.  They desire change and I believe Members also wish to improve on how the Seanad conducts its business.  To change, Members must innovate and in this regard I welcome Senator McAleese&rsquo;s contribution in the Seanad last week.  The Seanad could be the Trojan horse for an increased strengthening of our parliamentary democracy.  The recommendations on page 68 of the 2004 report on Seanad reform that require only amendments to Standing Orders are simple, clear and innovative.  I refer in particular to what my fellow Senator Zappone highlighted, namely, the power to scrutinise legislation and improve the deliberative process.  For the Seanad to have a good audition, however, I believe it also should consider another recommendation contained on page 68 of the aforementioned report, that is, to become the principal reviewer of policy in the Houses of the Oireachtas concentrating on &ldquo;medium-term economic and social planning&rdquo; and having a dialogue with leaders in the community and civil society.  I acknowledge I cannot describe my senatorship as truly democratic since I was appointed and not elected and I have no real <Col N="443"/>mandate from anyone.  However, I consider it to be my responsibility and duty as a Senator to make those connections between this esteemed House and our fellow citizens.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The invitation to the floor of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, on a case by case basis, of appropriate leaders and representatives of civic life who have a significant contribution to make to the deliberations of this House is about celebrating the power and the vision of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The proposal set out in this motion is to innovate and change and is not new.  However, the urgency to renew is pressing.  Members should imagine, weekly or regularly from July onwards, that civic leaders and senior public servants could brief and engage in dialogue with Members in a mutually respectful way.  The 2004 report states quite starkly that Seanad &Eacute;ireann &ldquo;has no distinctive role in the Irish political system&rdquo;.  Perhaps this also was thought of the Irish Presidency until Presidents Robinson and McAleese took hold of that office and innovated.  In my new role as a Senator, I wish to hear in this Chamber, regularly and perhaps even weekly, the views of cultural, social, sporting, educational and community leaders, both North and South, as well as of our emigrants across the world.  It could be called the citizens&rsquo; hour.  The detail and procedure can be worked out by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but its impact and symbolism would enhance the role of the Seanad and the manner in which Members conduct their business overall.  It would make it distinctive and would support the participative democratic objectives of the Oireachtas.  Consequently, having seconded the motion, I commend it to the House.</P>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>First and foremost, while Members on the Government side are in agreement with the body of the motion and are broadly supportive of the proposals therein, I wish to propose&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator intend to move the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">After &ldquo;decade&rdquo; in the last line to add the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;; and that these proposals be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at the earliest opportunity&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The only amendment the Government side suggests is that these proposals be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
        <P>I will turn to the programme for Government&rsquo;s proposals on Oireachtas reform with a focus on Seanad reform.  The Fine Gael-Labour Party programme for Government includes an ambitious programme for political reform in which the Government has committed to radical Oireachtas reform both in respect of reducing numbers in the Oireachtas and of abolishing the Seanad if the public approves this measure in a constitutional referendum next year.  It is proposed to reduce the number of Deputies following the publication of the results of the 2011 census of population.  Until the future of the Seanad is decided in a referendum next year, the Government will support reforms that will create an efficient Seanad.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s 11 appointed Senators demonstrated a break with the past through the appointment of a number of Independent Senators from outside the political system.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Oireachtas reform that has been achieved to date during the first 100 days of the present Government.  The Government plans to increase the number of days on which the Oireachtas sits and action already has been taken in this regard with the Easter recess earlier this year being shortened and bank holiday breaks being removed.  Moreover, there will be a greatly reduced summer recess later this year.  The Oireachtas committee system has been reformed and the number of committees has been reduced to create a committee system that <Col N="444"/>will be stronger and that will bring real focus to the areas covered by the committees.  Moreover, a Joint Committee on Investigations, Oversight and Petitions, which will be chaired by a member of the Opposition, also has been created, and this constitutes a strong addition to the committee system.  In addition, MEPs will have an opportunity to attend and contribute to Oireachtas committees.  Such measures reflect the essence of the motion that has been tabled.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Private Members&rsquo; motion on Seanad reform confirms that the great majority of Members wish to see the Seanad reformed in order that it can work more efficiently and be more effective.  The Government is broadly supportive of the proposals for changing the manner in which the Seanad conducts its business as set out by the Independent group&rsquo;s motion.  As I noted, the only amendment being proposed by the Government side to the motion is that the proposal be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The members of the aforementioned committee will be obliged to review the proposals contained within this motion and to consider how these changes could be best implemented.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfaim&iacute;s an-dul chun cinn a dh&eacute;anamh i saol an tSeanaid seo.</P>
        <P Just="Left">T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam freisin go mbeidh seans ag an gCoiste um N&oacute;s Imeachta agus Pribhl&eacute;id&iacute;, c&eacute; nach bhfuil m&eacute; f&eacute;in ar an gcoiste sin anois, f&eacute;achaint conas is f&eacute;idir athstrucht&uacute;r&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an gCoiste um N&oacute;s Imeachta agus Pribhl&eacute;id&iacute; f&eacute;in.  T&aacute; g&aacute; leis sin a dh&eacute;anamh chun an r&uacute;n seo a chur chun tosaigh.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I greatly welcome this motion and I am pleased it has been tabled so soon in the life of this Seanad because with something new, I always have the impression that when the newness wears off, part of the enthusiasm might also be diluted.  I salute the Independent Senators for having come forward so quickly.  The motion itself is quite specific and focused, which I also consider to be important.  A debate rightly is under way on Seanad reform and I agree with Senator Mac Conghail regarding the last report because I believe one must build on the consultation that took place at that time.  Some might state it was not radical enough and others might suggest it was too radical but the important point is that broad consultation took place and members of the public were given the opportunity of putting forward their views.  The committee which met to produce the report included members who had wide experience of the Oireachtas in general and, by using the report as the basic document, Members might be able to save some time.</P>
        <P>This motion is more specific than that.  It is about using the Seanad in its present form in the most productive, positive and transparent way possible.  In the past, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has considered the petitions system as one way of giving people an opportunity to interact with the Seanad.   This system would mean a contact not at a distance, not by means of a letter and not by watching &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  It might be one of the areas that could be expedited at this time.  There is a model available in other countries for the petition system and it is well worthwhile.  I ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to <Col N="445"/>consider how far advanced that model is because it is tangible and could be introduced quickly.  An explanation of how the system works and the parameters within which it operates would be required but I ask the CPP to consider it.</P>
        <P>I know the Leader and the CPP will not regard it as being somewhat bold on my part to suggest that perhaps the CPP might look at its own operations as well, in conjunction with the motion which has been put forward.  The CPP is the key to the implementation of this motion.  Any morning on the Order of Business, when we have suggested inviting someone into the Seanad in some role, whether for participation in a question and answer session or to address the House, we were always told that this was a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It is therefore important to look at the CPP first of all.  I looked very closely at the Leader to see if in some way he agreed with me.  He did not nod his head but I know he is a man of vast experience and he is also well aware, having sat on this side of the Chamber, of the need for change.  I know the House is in pretty good hands.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will take a few steps back from the motion to take a broad look at the state of the country.  I noticed a sea-change in thinking, in debates and in articles since we first became aware of the recession.  It was like a shock to the system of the whole nation.  As a result, people started to think and reflect just a little more on how the country operates, how the wheels are oiled, how the engine turns over.  This motion reflects that sea-change.  We would not do any credit to this auspicious assembly if we knew that this type of change had happened, that there were new requirements, new demands and new ideas and we did not reflect this within the Chamber.  If we have to depend on television programmes to have that debate, then there is something radically wrong with us as legislators.  We have to take that on board.  In fact, I have often watched some of the television programmes and I think we have a very high standard in that regard.  However, if we start at community level, we know the strengths we have; we know the extent of voluntarism; we know the efforts being made by people to re-position themselves.</P>
        <P>There are opportunities to interact with the public in spite of the constraints.  It is not sufficient in itself to say each time that we are bound by those constraints because if there is a sea-change in society, that same sea-change should be within the Legislature itself.  It never came home more to me than in a debate in the House on a motion to do with 1916 and Moore Street.  I looked back at the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery and all the descendants of the 1916 leaders were sitting silently because they could not interact with us.  This cannot be right.  There was a sense of history in the Chamber.  I went to the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery subsequently to talk to them and I felt ashamed that this was the way we were dealing with these people when they were prepared to come in here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I did not realise the time was so short but I ask the Leader to consider in the future to allow a little longer on a Private Members&rsquo; motion.  I compliment the Independent Senators.  I am quite sure they will keep up the momentum and I also hope there will be a report to the House from the CPP in the very near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion and I commend the Independent group for tabling it.  Like all the Independent group of Senators I am a new Senator.  My frustration has been great in recent weeks due in part to my difficulty in getting used to the process here and my view that much of what happens here is very much stage managed.  I am used to local government where I spent 23 and a half years and where spontaneous debate was often the best debate.  I support what has been said in general, but I wish to make a few specific points about representation and the understanding and involvement of local government within the process to introduce some changes and innovation into the role of the Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Forty-three Members of this House have been elected by county and city councillors, of which there are 883 in total.  We go out to seek their votes over an eight to ten-week period <Col N="446"/>and then we basically forget about them in terms of their input into this House or their input into legislation relevant to them or to their work in local government.  They have no input into legislation because this is not permitted by law.  On some occasions they may make submissions on legislation if it is relevant to local government and depending on the Minister in the Custom House, they may get a hearing once a year when the three associations representing councillors are called up and brought in for the proverbial chat.  However, beyond that, there is no input from local government into what happens in this country, albeit that democracy starts at local government level.  I am delighted the Independent group had seven meetings across the country and had meetings on the political system because the system begins with local government.  The failure of this House and the Lower House to include local government in the workings of democracy is a major failure.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I contrast this situation with that in Spain.  A Minister for territorial policy advises and assists all local authorities in Spain on economic matters.  He issues reports relevant to local government, contributes to the relations between central government, local government and NGOs.  In France, for example, a variety of mechanisms are in place to enable the government to consult local authorities about proposed regulatory provisions through an informal consultation process with the national elected members associations, to reform a mandatory consultation process involving specialised committees instituted by legislative provisions.  For example, any changes in the provision of water by the Spanish Government have to be agreed and signed off at local government level before they can be initiated.</P>
        <P>I have several proposals which I ask the Independent group of Senators to take on board and on which to give their views.  There should be formal and informal arrangements to consult elected members at town and county council levels on all legislation relevant to local government.  The programme for Government currently allows discussions and consultations with MEPs.  I propose that this should be extended to include the representatives of local government, the town and county councillors.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I spent seven years representing the Labour Party on the Committee of the Regions.  It is an arm of the European project based in Brussels which represents all local and regional government throughout Europe.  Its purpose is to consult local and regional authorities across Europe on any proposals from the EU which would be relevant to them.</P>
        <P>As somebody who sat on it for seven years and initiated a number of opinions on various issues that would eventually affect Ireland, I find it very disheartening to see that within the system of legislation here local government is left out.  Several things can be done.  We can include local government.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; when he said that when anything is asked here that does not conform to the norm it is referred to the CPP when we know that it is constrained by the Standing Orders of the House in terms of what it can do.  Effectively, we are getting a &ldquo;no&rdquo;, but a delayed &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P><Col N="447"/>
        <P>We have to examine that process.  We have to ensure that if we want to raise issues such as were raised earlier today that we can find a mechanism to do that.  There needs to be a radical shake-up of the procedures within the House to allow for these debates to go ahead, for the processes in which they can go ahead and to make this House relevant to ordinary citizens, starting at local town councils where people elect councillors through to county councils and city councils.  That is just one important element.  I support anything else that has been said.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  In my maiden speech two weeks ago I suggested that the Seanad could move around the country, thereby making it more relevant to citizens.  I proposed that it would meet first in my county of Donegal.  I am sure the Minister of State would agree wholeheartedly with me.  We could fight over whether the sitting took place in Donegal North-East or Donegal South-West.  Somewhere like Glenties Castle would be an ideal location from a tourism point of view.  We could bring the Seanad, even the last one, to the population and they could see it working.  It could meet in Mayo and Galway as well.  I do not know if the CPP discussed my proposal yesterday.  Such a sitting would have to be cost neutral.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and this debate.  The concept is good but I have some reservations that it could mean that the Seanad could become a giant committee.  We have to differentiate ourselves from a committee system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is an obvious appetite for more engagement with the general public and that is what the motion is trying to achieve.  In terms of this, perhaps a better way of doing it would be to have a petitions committee like in the US or European Parliament.  This would be a committee to which any citizen could suggest changes in legislation.  If a suggested change is considered to have merit it would go initially to the Seanad, become a Bill and eventually go to the D&aacute;il.  This would mean that every citizen would have the opportunity to change the law.  I understand that the petitions committee has been a success in the Scottish Parliament.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the Australian Senate.  We should take an international view when considering how to best reform the Seanad.  The Canadians are currently looking at reforming their Senate and have examined the Australian Senate.  The Australian Senate has been mentioned in the UK as a model to reform the House of Lords.  In Australia, the Senate takes a very active role and the government of the day has very seldom had a majority in the Senate.  This means that the opposition and other minor parties can make great progress in scrutinising government operations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is interesting to read the recent comparison of the Seanad and the Australian Senate by Dr. Liam Weeks of UCC.  He identified three main flaws with the Seanad: it is indirectly elected; the Taoiseach appoints 11 Members, thus ensuring a majority for the Government; and it has no real powers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As I have only four minutes, I am going to keep going.</P><Col N="448"/>
        <P Just="Left">On the other hand, the Australian Senate is wholly different and is probably the third most powerful Upper House in the world.  Its 76 Members are elected by the same method used in the Seanad, namely, the single transferable vote.  However, as many have argued for, the vote is open to all adults and is not limited to politicians and university graduates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Dr. Weeks says that being elected under a form of PR not only gives the Upper House a distinct identity, compared to the Lower Australian House which is elected by STV in single seat constituencies, it also ensures a more balanced representation than in the Lower House, allowing for a greater range of voices to be heard.  Not only that, but the lifetime of the Seanad is entirely dependent on the D&aacute;il which means that it is difficult for the Upper House to carve out a separate and distinct existence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Australia, half of the Senators are elected between general elections in a staggered format.  It is interesting and could be something that we consider in addition to holding elections for both Houses on the same day to ensure that the House is not a retirement home for failed Deputies.  Also, each state in Australia elects the same number of Senators, similar to the United States. In Ireland, the Government almost always has a majority in the Seanad.  However, the opposite is the case in Australia and the ability of the Upper House there to hold the government to account and even frustrate it is very much supported as a crucial component of the Australian parliamentary system of checks and balances.  Since the governing party in Australia rarely has a majority in the Senate, its legislation sometimes gets cooled by the Upper House. Consequently, the government cannot ride roughshod over Parliament and guillotine legislation as can happen in the D&aacute;il.  Instead it may have to engage in a consultative process.  The end result means that there is better policy that feeds off the input of those in parliament, not just Ministers in government.  This is the sort of system that we should strive towards.</P>
        
        
        <P Just="Left">This diversity in the Upper House is one of the vital factors in having a more effective Seanad.  We have enlarged that to some degree with the appointment of different voices by the Taoiseach to the House but we must go further.  I welcome the discussion and by implementing some of the measures I have mentioned we can make this House a worthy and even more effective part of the democratic process.  I appreciate the opportunity to debate this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In reading the motion tabled by our colleagues from the Independent Group I am reminded somewhat of a condemned person reading the warrant of the court which tells him or her that he or she shall be led from the court, then stopping and making sure that wherever he or she is being led to, everyone will have a good chat about things, dress well and create a good appearance without acknowledging that the second part of the judge&rsquo;s pronouncement is that he or she shall be taken away to the place of execution and there the sentence of the court will be carried out.</P>
        <P>The reality is that there is a very big elephant in the room.  With no disrespect, our colleagues could also perhaps consider the possibility that in constructing the motion in this fashion it looks a little like we are giving the condemned person a chance to make a last speech from the dock before he or she goes rather than trying to appeal the sentence of death.  The nature of the manner in which they have been appointed to the Seanad may be one which precludes some level of independence from the programme for Government.  Time may prove me wrong on that.</P>
        <P>I am now looking at the Seanad from the inside but I still feel a little bit like a political outsider.  In looking at it from the outside, one finds a body which is dominated by two parties which are completely ideologically identical.  We now have two groups of Independents who <Col N="449"/>are not only internally ideologically inconsistent but each claims to be independent.  It is a very irrational system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In looking forward, we need to reform the entire Oireachtas.  The Seanad has not been the proximate cause of the problems which confronts our country.  It may have been asleep at the tiller and not have done a very good job in scrutinising the actions of the D&aacute;il, but the sins of commission which led to the destruction of our economy and the desperate situation in which our public services will find themselves later this year result from the actions of the Lower House.  With no disrespect to individual Members of the Lower House, we are seeing an urgent <i>cri du coeur</i> for fundamental Oireachtas reform.  I do not know if we are the official or provisional Independent group, but I would ask our colleagues to join us in looking from outside the party system at the need for a major national debate, not on how we can bring people into a talking-shop within a condemned Chamber, but on how we can actually reform the Chamber to make it relevant for the future.  In doing so, we should also examine reform of the Lower House.  I suspect that I will be addressing these issues repeatedly over the next few years, but my own core belief is that we need to reform the way we elect Members to the Lower House in order that there is less focus on parochialism.  We need bring in people who have a national perspective while at the same time not denigrating that sacred connection between the electorate and Members of Parliament.  We need to have a Chamber where people are answerable to a local community but also answerable to a constituency.  There would be great sense in having some version of a list system &mdash; either national or regional &mdash; employed for the election of the more powerful Lower House where most legislation originates.  In addition, we could have a regionally, constituency-based, separate Upper House which would give people that sense of connection with the process of central government.</P>

	<P>In parallel with this, we need to reform the way we appoint Ministers.  In our modern, fast-moving age, we clearly need to have people who are skilled in the areas to which they are appointed.  I do not wish to personalise this point, but the previous three Ministers with responsibility for the health portfolio, prior to the current Minister, Deputy Reilly, had a total of four years in the non-political workforce before entering the Lower House.  I do not think that is a satisfactory situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment seeks to refer changes in Seanad procedures to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, but it is not in any way kicking this motion to touch.  The reason we are suggesting that it be considered by the CPP is to put structure on the proposals upon which we agree.  I totally agree with them.  It is, therefore, a matter of putting the proper structures in place to enable the motion to achieve what it says on the tin.  I agree that this House should have direct engagement with citizens.  Two weeks ago, I suggested resurrecting the petitions committee, which never got up and running.  Senator Quinn referred to petitions committees in places like Scotland and Australia where they work well, but still need to be improved.  The debates and petitions committee in the Scottish Parliament sometimes meets from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., but I am not in favour of a situation like that.  We need clear, concise debate and dialogue when we get this petitions committee up and running.</P>
        <P>In referring to that committee two weeks ago, I was unaware that the Government intended to have an Oireachtas Joint Investigations, Oversight and Petitions Committee.  I firmly believe, however, that we should still go ahead with our petitions committee as soon as possible.  It <Col N="450"/>would get this motion working so that such a committee could engage directly with citizens.  If there are any obstacles in the way, for example, if the CPP is constrained by Standing Orders, I will suggest that we change the Standing Orders.  We need action and I will not be an obstacle in the way of having these reforms brought about.</P>
        <P>We need to open our space to others.  The only pity is that this did not happen many years ago.  If it had, we would not be speaking about the relevance of the Seanad or the possibility of the public deciding whether the House should go.  The people will decide this matter.  Regardless of whether we are on death row, as Senator Crown stated, when a referendum is called we must convince people of the value and relevance of this House.  We do not have too much time in which to do so.</P>
        <P>We should definitely bring people, such as European Commissioners, to this House for debates on agriculture and fisheries, as Senators have requested.  There will be a reform of the Common Agricultural Policy as well as of the Common Fisheries Policy in the next year or two.  MEPs have appeared before the House and we can have more of them here again, in addition to Heads of State and leaders of industry.  We must, however, put the necessary structures in place to allow that to happen.  That is why I am suggesting that the CPP, as a matter of urgency, should work on this.  If the CPP has to work two or three days a week, I will suggest to the Cathaoirleach, who will be chairing the committee, that it does so.  It should meet until we have the proper structures in place in order that we can put these proposals into action fairly soon.</P>
        <P>Since this Seanad first met, I have put in place some small but significant changes, to which Senator Sheahan alluded.  We need much more, however.  Politicians do not know it all, and the public is aware of that.  There is a need, therefore, for dialogue and an exchange of views with the public.  The Seanad reform that was envisaged previously dealt mostly with how the House would be elected.  The motion, however, concerns how we will reform our business within the House.  We reform or we die; it is as simple as that.  We must convince the public in that short period of the value and relevance of the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I strongly reiterate that by putting the matter to the CPP, we are in no way kicking it to touch.  We want to put the proper structures in place to allow this very good Independent motion to be acted upon.  I assure the Independent Senators that it will be acted upon, and the sooner, the better.</P>
        <P>I compliment all Senators who have contributed to the debate and especially those who have made their maiden speeches this evening.  This is the type of debate we need in this House, so let us ensure it is not just talk but that we can put our words into action.  That is what we need to do and it is what every Member of the House wants.  I will do everything to facilitate what Members of the House want in this regard.</P>

	<P>Let me say then that there is absolutely nothing provisional about me.  Let me assure everyone that I have the girth of great permanency.</P>
        <P>I support the motion tabled by my fellow Senators, Senators Zappone and Mac Conghail.  Politicians are always asking themselves questions such as how we can do things differently and how things can be different.  My question is very simple but, in essence, it is the same as that posed by my colleagues: how can we transform the House to be more qualitative and more <Col N="451"/>real in its effect for the people who pay our wages?  Those same people do not know what goes on in here.  Having worked 33 years in Irish education, I did not know what went on in here.  I am not blaming those people for that.  I just wonder why that is the case.</P>
        <P>There are two things we need to think about: the form and function of the Seanad, and these must be understood by the public.  The form and the function of the Seanad must be connected to the public.  It could begin, as my colleagues suggest, by engaging the public in the first of the many ways we have outlined in our amendment.  We can talk about transparency and a participative democracy, but these are only aspirations, beliefs and values.  What we really need is action.  The power of the action lies with us, as the Leader has said, and it is only with us.</P>
        <P>To use an analogy that might be better understood by Senator Mac Conghail, I do not want to be in scene 4, act 4, on my way off the stage pursued by a bear, as happened in <i>The Winter&rsquo;s Tale</i>.  We certainly do not want the Seanad to be the winter&rsquo;s tale.  If this is an epilogue, then it is our fault because we will not do anything.  We will have no one to blame but ourselves if we do not do anything.  However, I suggest it could be a prologue in form and in function.</P>
        <P>I know from being privileged enough to be around Senator McAleese that democracy and dialogue never hurt anyone, and democracy and dialogue cannot be casualties of the recession, no matter how difficult things become.  It is my opinion, as I know from his work over the past 14 years, that democracy and dialogue are the only way up, the only way through a recession and the only way for a surviving Seanad.</P>

	<P>Like other colleagues, I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I thank him for his forbearance in listening to this and look forward to hearing his contribution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In line with colleagues, I very much welcome this motion, which is practical, useful and ties in totally with the aims, goals and objectives of all of us in this new Seanad.  It is in line with every Member&rsquo;s view and thinking.  The amendment, of which I am supportive, is only the slightest amendment.  As Senator Cummins said, it was tabled merely to structure the proposals involved, and that will be easily done.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges, at its meeting this morning, even agreed on the speed with which it will tackle this, and Senator Cummins has given voice to that this evening and also to dealing with the petitions committee, which will also be done speedily.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was particularly taken by the portion of the motion which refers to respectful North-South dialogue that would consolidate the peace process in Northern Ireland, develop a dividend for all the communities &mdash; those communities that have been so hurt by the divisions and conflicts of the past &mdash; and deepen cross-Border relationships.  That is very constructive because down here we have often acted too much in isolation without concern for the people with whom we share the island of Ireland.  I very much welcome that part of the motion.  It is very positive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was very taken with the contributions of the proposer and seconder of the motion, Senators Zappone and Mac Conghail, and by what the latter said about cultural links and the constantly changing and innovating ways in which he in his line of work has to perform.  Surely that is something we have to take on board in our work, of which we are now very conscious.  The concept of having a citizen&rsquo;s hour was mentioned by a previous speaker and perhaps that could develop from our Order of Business.  I have no doubt that Senator Cummins will have the Committee on Procedure and Privileges deal with that efficiently and well.  Senator Tom Sheahan also referred to that.  We have started well in that we are greatly shortening the <Col N="452"/>summer recess.  This Seanad will be, and perhaps already is, more efficient and will be even more so, and this Chamber will become more effective as time passes.</P>
        <P>For all those reasons and more, I greatly welcome the motion.  I look forward, in the role I now have, to contributing actively to providing those improvements both in Chamber and through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is a pleasure to speak to the motion and I am happy to do so, but if we are being honest, the truth is there is nothing this Chamber can do, by changing around procedures, to connect with the people.  There is only one thing that can happen politically and that is that the people would elect Senators to this Chamber.  Everything else is tinkering around the edges and tiptoeing around the real issue.  That is the only way this Chamber can become relevant.  It is the only way the Seanad should be saved.</P>
        <P>To put it into context, a number of Senators should be directly elected in very large constituencies.  A very large constituency might be ten D&aacute;il seats comprising two five-seat constituencies.  Wicklow and Wexford are an example I can give of a constituency of 250,000 people.  In terms of why that should be done, a person elected to a large constituency of that type cannot attend all the funerals and do the constituency work or the other work being done by Members of the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not just critical of the way this Seanad is operating or how it is elected, I am critical of the way the D&aacute;il is elected.  The reality is that in the 1970s and the 1980s, constituency clinics were first held.  In the 1990s constituency offices were first opened.  In the next decade Deputies were out knocking on doors.  With e-mails, mobile telephones and social networking, Deputies have become constituency slaves.  They do not analyse or scrutinise any legislation.  Anything that is happening is a pretence.  We can pretend we are doing something about that or we can do something alien to politics, that is, we can do something about it.  That is reform.  It is not tinkering around the edges.  It will have to be a massive change.</P>
        <P>Two other areas must change.  The control of the Executive over the Legislature in this country is total.  Our adversarial type of politics is based upon the United Kingdom model, but other countries have a looser and better system in regard to separation of powers.  The separation of powers here is irrelevant.  The Executive is in full control of the Legislature and that is not a good thing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The final issue I want to address is our Civil Service.  We must reform the Civil Service.  We must reform the way those in the Civil Service are appointed.  A Secretary General is appointed and no one knows who he or she is but he or she has full power.  Why does he or she have full power?  It is because Ministers come and go.  It is classic Sir Humphrey Appleby in &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; and it is the classic Civil Service we have in this country.  That must change.  We must be prepared to be bold, and I hope this Fine Gael-Labour Party Government will be bold.  We must be bold because when we leave office, we will leave the institutions in a better condition than that in which we found them.  That means being brave, although that is not always something one gets rewarded for in politics.</P>
        <P>Equally, it is crucial we reform our local authority structures.  The way they were designed on establishment in 1899 was grand but we have an amazing number of county councillors in some areas.  The best example I can give is County Leitrim which, with a population of less than 30,000 people and with a standard turnout of 60%, has 22 councillors.  One can get elected in County Leitrim with 300 or 400 votes.  The largest local authority electoral ward is Carrigaline in County Cork.  It has six council seats and 60,000 people. The imbalance is ridiculous.  This is the legacy we have inherited and no one will decide to change it because leaving it is easier.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been the Government party since the establishment of the State.  Why change <Col N="453"/>the system when one is in charge and is able to win local, Seanad and general elections?  For the first time, Fine Gael has the largest number of seats in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  We must stand up and declare that we will leave the institutions in a better state than they were when we first found them.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Independent group for taking the initiative to raise this issue.  I welcome the motion and agree with its proposals.  I thank the Leader for his commitment to progress them and hope that it can be done via the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>I echo the comments regarding the 2004 report of the committee chaired by former Senator Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.  It is important that we build on that cross-party report, which contained many excellent recommendations and followed on from a public consultation process.  The report identified possible new roles for the House in a number of areas, for example, legislative consultation, EU affairs, social partnership, North-South implementation &mdash; North-South relations comprise one of the issues raised in the motion &mdash; and scrutiny of public appointments.</P>
        <P>It is fair to say that the Seanad has served people better than is generally appreciated in terms of providing a forum for a more constructive, less partisan debate and through the legislative improvements proposed in the House.  All Senators are anxious to serve people as best we can, to address their daily concerns and to make a real difference.</P>
        <P>It is vital that our work should add value to rather than duplicate the role of the D&aacute;il.  That the House has struggled for a long time to find an optimum role is evident, given that there have been 12 reports on Seanad reform over many years.  I agree with the Leader&rsquo;s sentiments that it is now a case of reform or die.  However, considering reform of the Seanad separately from reform of the D&aacute;il and the Government would be fundamentally wrong.  I agree with Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy that the real problem lies with the D&aacute;il, which is given the most power under the Constitution and is supposed to hold the Government to account.  We have seen a weakness in that role, especially in recent years, and this matter needs to be examined carefully.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While Fine Gael and the Labour Party proposed during the general election that the Seanad be abolished, Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s position was that the Seanad&rsquo;s role should only be examined following serious changes to the D&aacute;il and the Government.  As an eminent professor and political scientist in Trinity College stated, without such changes, the abolition of the Seanad would reduce rather than enhance political accountability.  It is vital that the D&aacute;il, the Government and the Seanad be examined together.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators, in particular Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy, have pointed to the key weaknesses in the current D&aacute;il-Government system, those being, excessive localism, an infectious level of party political posturing in place of real debate on a daily basis and a lack of expertise around the Cabinet table.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s proposals during the general election focused on addressing these weaknesses specifically.  For example, we made proposals on changing the electoral system.  Senator Crown eloquently referred to the benefits of a national list system.  For the D&aacute;il, we proposed a mix of single seat constituencies and a national list which would allow people to retain their direct link with local politicians at constituency level while providing an avenue to elect people who were genuinely interested in national issues and who could represent a national constituency.</P>
        <P>We made good suggestions on improving the quality of debate and legislative oversight in the D&aacute;il and opportunities for co-operation.  The Government has discussed improving the <Col N="454"/>opportunities for Deputies on all sides of the Lower House to have an input into legislation.  By the time legislation appears in the House, the Government has typically set out its stall and drawn up detailed legislation and the House is presented with a de facto position.  Ministers tend to be reluctant to accept amendments, seeing it as a weakness that they did not think of something, and the Opposition tends to attack everything in the Bill from a political point of view.  During the election, we believed this situation could be addressed by holding a general debate in the House before legislation is drafted and by allowing all Deputies, including Government backbenchers, an opportunity to table proposals.  In this way, the legislation would benefit and people would see a real difference.</P>
        <P>We also proposed that we would improve the method of selection for Government and that those who were not Deputies could be Ministers to allow people with an expertise in other fields to serve, for example, business people who do not want to opt into politics as a 30-year lifetime career but who would like to offer something for five years.  We could gain dramatically from this proposal, given our economic difficulties.  Will the Leader use his influence within the main Government party to ensure the whole issue of political reform, not just Seanad reform, including the excellent ideas proposed in this debate, is advanced by the new Government?</P>
        <P>I wish to touch on a further issue, that is, women&rsquo;s role in politics.  It is wrong to discuss political reform without considering that, while 50% of the population is female, it has always been the case that 85% of Deputies have been male.  I welcome the fantastic initiative taken by the Taoiseach in nominating seven women as Senators.  It shows the quality of women and I do not doubt that excellent women could take a place in the Lower House.  The lack of women in politics matters.  Without a doubt, the lives of men and women have become increasingly similar in that everyone is concerned about issues such as the economy, jobs, housing and so on.  However, a number of other issues affect women predominantly.  For example, women are more likely to be full-time carers in the home, either for a child or an elderly parent, to be in low-paid, part-time employment and to be victims of domestic violence, as chillingly revealed in today&rsquo;s publication of Women&rsquo;s Aid&rsquo;s annual report.  With respect to the male Senators, and while male politicians will do their best to represent all their constituents, life experience is something that each of us brings to our roles as public representatives, and a woman&rsquo;s life experience and different perspective cannot be genuinely reflected in our national Parliament until it is more representative.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s recent initiative in this regard.  Some weeks prior, our party leader made a commitment to run a female candidate in every local electoral area in the next local elections.  I hope the issue will be taken on board by all parties.</P>

	<P>I thank the Independents for tabling this motion.  When I was first elected to the House in 2002, I was frustrated by people entering the Chamber, making speeches and then leaving.  That is impossible to understand.  If a person makes a statement, other people can respond when they speak.  It is nonsense that we call these &ldquo;debates&rdquo;.  They are not debates.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make the criticism I tried to voice to Senator Quinn.  The 1979 referendum was to allow the university vote to be extended to other third level colleges in the country.  Many of the most articulate Senators in this House were from the university panels.  Although there were six such Members in each Seanad, not of one of them drove that change, as voted for by the people.  All political parties failed to deliver in that regard.</P>
        <P>Debates and discussions in the Seanad are much more harmonious than in the D&aacute;il and as such the Seanad does not excite the media.  Debates in this House are not as personal, insulting or antagonistic and, as such, the Seanad does not make good television.</P>
        <P>The 1937 Constitution allowed for two Ministers to be appointed from the Seanad.  This was only done on one occasion by the late former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, when he appointed Professor Dooge as Minister, which I find frustrating and difficult to understand.  Fine Gael, the Labour Party or Fianna F&aacute;il could regularly, as provided for in the Constitution, appoint two Members of the Seanad to be Ministers.  It is no wonder new Members are frustrated.  One can only imagine the excitement had two Members of this House during the past few years been appointed Ministers.  I would love to have been a Minister.  I have business experience.  I co-founded a business which now employs 250 people.  I know about business.</P>

Second, why has the provision in the 1937 Constitution, which allows for two Members of this House to be appointed Ministers, not been utilised?  Third, why did the university Senators not drive the change voted for in the 1979 referendum?  Perhaps it is because they did not want to put themselves out of business.  I have been a Member of the Seanad for eight years.  The university Senators believe they are superior to everyone else.</P>

Tuigim gur seo ceann des na c&eacute;ad r&uacute;in i nGn&oacute; Comhalta&iacute; Pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha a bh&iacute; agaibh san Seanad &uacute;r.

S&iacute;lim gur maith an rud &eacute; sin.</P>
        <P>The fact that one of the first issues debated at Private Members&rsquo; time in the new Seanad is a motion on Seanad reform clearly indicates a new willingness on the part of the Members of this House to engage with the issue of political reform.  The fact that the only amendment the Government side has made to the motion is that the proposal be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges displays a willingness on the part of this Government to engage with groups interested in working towards political reform.</P>
        <P>The results of last February&rsquo;s general election clearly displayed a shift in public support from those with a history of opposition to political reform towards the parties that proposed detailed plans for the radical reform of our political system.  The Fine Gael-Labour Party programme for Government sets out an ambitious and comprehensive programme for political reform across a number of areas, of which Oireachtas reform is part.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of our commitments on Oireachtas reform have already been addressed.  The programme for Government outlined the intention to increase the number of sitting days by 50%.  The   Government has already reduced the Easter recess, removed bank holiday breaks and shortened the summer recess by four weeks.  The programme for Government outlines plans to reform the Oireachtas committee system.  The number of committees in this Oireachtas has been reduced to allow the committee system work more effectively.  Savings of an estimated 35% on the cost of running committees last year have been achieved.  The new committees will be stronger and will bring real focus to the areas they cover.  They will be properly resourced to carry out their functions.  We have established a Committee on Investigations, Oversight and Petitions which will be chaired by a member of the Opposition.  This is a strong addition to the committee system.  Irish MEPs will have an opportunity to attend and contribute to Oireachtas committees.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While this is not a debate on Seanad abolition and I do not want that issue to dominate this debate to the detriment of some of the good proposals put forward in this motion, it is important to acknowledge the Government&rsquo;s proposals in this area.  The Government has committed to reducing the size of the Oireachtas significantly by reducing the number of Members in the D&aacute;il and putting before the people a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad.  When as Leader of the Opposition, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, announced that in government he would give people an opportunity to vote on abolishing the Seanad, many doubted his commitment.  Within 18 months the other main political parties were in agreement with the policy.  Now, it is in the programme for Government and next year people will be given the opportunity to vote on the issue.  It is not within the power of any Government or political party to abolish the Seanad.  It is for the people and them alone to remove it from the Constitution.  In the course of next year the Government will put a referendum before the people asking them to remove the Seanad from the Constitution, a decision by which the Government will be bound.  There will be sufficient opportunity to debate that issue in the weeks and months before the referendum is held.  I want to use the remainder of my time in this debate to address the <Col N="457"/>reform proposals outlined in this motion. Many might have thought that a Government committed to abolishing the Seanad would have little or no interest in reforming it.  That is not the case.  The Government wants to see this Seanad become the most effective and efficient in the history of this institution.  The Taoiseach's 11 appointed Senators were a break with the past.  The appointments were used to appoint a number of genuine independent thinkers from outside the political system, people who could bring a new perspective to debate within this Chamber, and today's motion is an indication of this.</P>
        
        <P>The Government is broadly supportive of the proposals for changing the way that the Seanad conducts its business, as set out by the Independent group in its motion.  There can be little doubt among anyone, even the Members of this House, that the Seanad needs to change.  The recommendations contained in this motion would have a major impact on the way the Seanad conducts its business.</P>
        <P>The motion calls for arrangements to be put in place to allow the Seanad engage directly with citizens and residents from all walks of life whose experience and expertise can contribute to debates and add considerable value to the work of Senators as legislators.  This may provide an opportunity to encourage active citizenship and allow citizens engage more with the political system.  The petitions element of the new Oireachtas Committee on Investigations, Oversight and Petitions also aims at encouraging such active citizenship.</P>
        <P>The motion seeks the power to invite to the floor of the Seanad, on a case-by-case basis, leaders and representatives of civic life who have a significant contribution to make to issues before this House.  Such a development may see the Seanad being used as a forum for those whose voices deserve to be heard, but care would need to be taken to prevent such a forum being abused.</P>
        <P>The motion believes it is possible to host North-South dialogue that consolidates the peace process, develops a peace dividend for all communities affected by the conflict, deepens cross-Border relationships and promotes a shared approach to the significant centenaries that will arise in the next decade.  Such a proposal may provide a way whereby the two traditions on this island could develop closer bonds and move towards a better understanding of each other.  The centenaries that are fast approaching should be seen as celebrations of our shared history, not as battlegrounds for the political beliefs that divide us.</P>
        <P>The Government believes there is merit in the proposals contained in this motion.  The procedures within the Seanad have to be agreed by the Members, which is why we believe these proposals should be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at the earliest opportunity.  Seanad reform is, of course, the shared responsibility of every Member of this House.  Senators of all political parties and none should have an active interest in this area.  I hope the members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges review the proposals contained within this motion with an open mind and consider how the Seanad could benefit from the changes recommended.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I know that in the course of the contributions today and those to follow next week from Members of this House we will see the concept of shared responsibility for Seanad reform embraced in full.  At some stage next year, the people will decide if this is to be the last Seanad.  Regardless of the outcome of that referendum, the Members of this Seanad should strive to make this the best Seanad.  I have no doubt that this will be the case.  Having listened to the contributions today from those Senators who have been elected and those who have been nominated, I am sure it will be an exciting, constructive and positive Seanad.

	<P>I commend the Independent group on bringing forward this important motion and I acknowledge the contribution made by Senator Mac Conghail, which was a very important one.  Some very profound statements and proposals were made by the Senator and by members of his group in terms of their vision of the Seanad and political reform.  I acknowledge the contribution from the Leader of the House who said he will ensure no obstacles will be put in the way of ensuring the substance and thrust of this motion is achieved, and that what all in this Chamber want happens, namely, that we would have a Seanad that works, is relevant and is dynamic.</P>
        <P>I accept the proposal that this matter be sent to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I acknowledge that the Leader said this is not to kick the motion to touch, as he put it, but to ensure there is some structure, which is positive.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the robustness of the Leader when he talks of having flexibility in amending Standing Orders on this issue.  I am sure he would forgive me for seeing this as somewhat ironic given that when we called for flexibility in Standing Orders in regard to speaking rights for the Sinn F&eacute;in grouping, the Standing Orders were then said to be sacrosanct.</P>

	<P>I hope the Leader of the House will correct this.  I welcome the fact he has been positive, courteous and constructive in dealing with us as a group.  I hope the CPP will take on board some of the proposals we have made.</P>
        <P>In the context of this motion, we must ask ourselves a very obvious question, namely, what we believe is the purpose and future of this House  That must be the starting point.  We must ask what this House can be.  Can it work as a check on and balance to the D&aacute;il?  Can it be a House where we can have genuine participation from groups outside this Chamber?  I believe we can.</P>
        <P>We should not be under any illusions that if we do not change and live up to the rhetoric that has been expressed by so many Senators in this Chamber, then, as Senator Norris said at our first sitting, we could become extinct.  I am reminded of a phrase by a politician, &ldquo;radical or redundant&rdquo;.  If we do not become radical, we too, like the person who coined phrase, will become redundant.  We must ensure that is not the case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In my maiden speech in the House, I spoke of my view that there is a place in the State for a second Chamber.  I would certainly argue for a reformed Seanad.  I believe there is an opportunity for all Senators across all the parties to work together and to put together a set of proposals in order that we could at least go to the people and say we want to reform this House and make it relevant and democratic.  When we talk about the Independent Senators who have been appointed, and I acknowledge the diversity in the Independent group, I make the point <Col N="459"/>that no one should be appointed to an office where the people involved have an opportunity to be legislators.  Everyone should be elected.  One of the things we need to do if the House is to have any future and have a real connection with the people is to ensure Senators are democratically elected, which is very important.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposal from the Leader to resurrect the petitions committee as we must find some structure whereby we can invite groups to the House.  This would be a very fair way of doing that.  When people are invited to a House such as this, they tend to be academics.  While I have nothing against academics, we need to ensure we hear the voices of the people who are experiencing real problems, those who are living the recession and, for example, those in the education sphere who know what effect the impact of education cuts on children, or those who work in the health service who understand the effect cuts to that service are having on citizens, or people from disadvantaged and working class communities.  We must find some way to deal with these issues.  The petitions committee would be an opportunity to do so and to ensure their voices are heard and that the voice of every group across society is heard, including the marginalised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recently, we had a discussion on immigrants.  We need to ensure immigrants and the new Irish who enrich our society have a voice and an opportunity to contribute.  I believe strongly in a multicultural society.  We have seen in recent years that immigrants to Ireland have enriched the country and that it is a better place because of them.  We must find some way of ensuring they have a voice.  Young people are also important.  We have the youngest Oireachtas Member, Kathryn Reilly, in this Chamber.  Some 100,000 young people have left our shores because they see no hope, leadership, energy or interest in young people.  We must find space for these young people.</P>
        <P>One of the most critical issues is reform of the electoral system.  All parties and politicians must be involved in this.  Far too many people in Ireland do not vote, many are not even on the register and many are disenfranchised.  We must simplify our system to ensure as many people as possible vote.  I see no reason we must have an election on one day only.  Elections could take place over two or three days.  There is much we can do, but there is no point in coming up with proposals and engaging in debate and the rhetoric of reform if we do not deliver.  Senator Mary White pointed out the number of reports that have been published on Seanad reform and the fact that none of them has been implemented.  It is a question of being radical or redundant.  I choose the radical, not for the sake of it but to make the House more relevant, democratic and more connected to the citizens we seek to serve.  I thank the Independent group for tabling this motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and welcome the opportunity to debate this important motion which was put forward by the Independent nominee group.  I thank the group for providing us with the opportunity to debate these proposals at this early stage in the new term of the 24th Seanad.  This opportunity is important because it gives us an opportunity to be radical, as Senator Cullinane said, in the way we reform our procedures to ensure the Seanad becomes more relevant and that our debates have more impact.</P>
        <P>The contributions from Senators Zappone and Mac Conghail when proposing and seconding the motion were hugely thought provoking in putting the case for more deliberative democracy and for opening up the Seanad.  Other speakers have also put forward diverse views on how this could be done.  Senator Landy, for example, my Labour Party colleague, has spoken about the need for greater links with local government in the Seanad and has taken a comparative view of the role of local government.  Senator Harte also made an important contribution and put forward the notion of the Seanad sitting outside of Dublin at different times.</P><Col N="460"/>
        <P>The issues raised by the motion can be addressed in a number of ways to make the Seanad more relevant and to open it up.  The idea of inviting outside speakers to the Seanad is one that should be explored.  We should look at allowing people with a significant contribution to make to the deliberations of the House to do so through that mechanism.  The idea of using the Seanad as a forum for furthering and deepening respectful North-South dialogue is an idea that has arisen in many of the reports produced on Seanad reform and should be considered.  Direct engagement with citizens and residents can be done in various ways.  The use of a petitions committee was suggested and the Labour Party is keen to vitalise that proposal.  As a Senator, Deputy Joanna Tuffy, initiated the Seanad petitions committee in 2006 but it has never been used.  It is an important mechanism we could use to engage with citizens outside of the House and to make our business directly relevant.</P>
        <P>There is precedent for the idea of sitting outside of Leinster House.  The Seanad may not have done it before, but the D&aacute;il sat in the Mansion House on the 90th anniversary of the first D&aacute;il and it may have done the same in 1966.  The joint committee on the Constitution has certainly sat at different venues outside of Leinster House, at Trinity College and UCC in the last session.  Those sessions were successful at bringing in new people to hear what the committee was doing.  If this can be done at minimal cost or in a cost neutral way, we should do it because it is a way of addressing the clear disconnection that exists between the public and political representatives.  Those of us who canvassed in the most recent election found that after the economy, the next most important issue was political reform.</P>
        <P>The reform of the Seanad is a topic that has been raised by several speakers and it has also been addressed by the Minister of State.  I am grateful he said the Government is committed to making this an effective and efficient Seanad.  The appointment of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees from such a diverse and generally non-party political background has demonstrated that intent by the Government, which is welcome.  The announcement that there will be a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad should not be taken in isolation.  It would be a mistake to look only at abolishing the Seanad without considering parallel reforms to the rest of the political system.  There is a concern that the proposed abolition of one House is mere window dressing that does not look at how we ensure the useful functions it serves can be incorporated into the other House.  If we are to move to a unicameral system, we must ensure the heightened level of scrutiny that is afforded by two Houses can be achieved through the D&aacute;il.  I and many others have given much thought to this.</P>
        <P>The Seanad forms a particularly vital function in several areas, such as scrutiny of legislation and Government policy.  One area this is demonstrated is through the strong procedures we have for debates on Committee Stage of legislation.  The figures produced by the Oireachtas in 2008 show that in that year 1,199 amendments to all Stages of Bills were made in the Seanad.  Over the decade, from 1998 to 2008, some 30% of all Bills initiated in the Houses of the Oireachtas were initiated in the Seanad.  There is no doubt the Seanad has had a very significant role in the area of legislative scrutiny and there are quite a number of examples of critical amendments made to Bills that would otherwise have been very flawed had issues not been spotted in the Seanad.  Senator Cullinane mentioned the issue of age.  Discrimination on grounds of age would have been left out of some of the equality legislation in the early 1990s until its omission was spotted by the Seanad which ensured age discrimination was included as one of the grounds.  We could point to a number of ways in which heightened scrutiny is afforded through this House.  If we are to consider abolishing the Seanad, we must look at how we afford that level of heightened scrutiny in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Another valuable feature the Seanad has brought to political debate is the fact that it has provided a forum for voices that are not being heard in the D&aacute;il and for those who represent <Col N="461"/>constituencies different from the geographic constituencies directly represented in the D&aacute;il.  Examples of these are the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees and the university Senators.  Generally, Senators have tended to bring a more national focus to bear in debate.  If we are to move to a unicameral system, we must investigate whether there is some way of reforming the D&aacute;il to ensure we can have a group of persons elected from a national list or have people in the D&aacute;il who have a more national focus to bring to bear on legislation.</P>
        <P>The idea of a constitutional convention which could tease out issues around the future of the Seanad and the parallel political reforms that must be made is important.  It is an idea in the programme for Government that has excited many people.  They are excited by the idea of wholesale constitutional and political reform and by the proposal to have a tight timeframe for a convention that would examine that.  I look forward to the setting up of the constitutional convention and to the debate around reform of the political process, of which the future of the Seanad is just one part.  This debate gives us an opportunity to reform our own procedures, pending the outcome of that national debate, to ensure we become more relevant and more engaged in public debate.</P>

        <P>I have no sense of being on death row.  To succumb to that would only lead to paralysis and I am too much of an optimist for that.  I support this motion and, in that context, will speak briefly about the coming decade of sensitive centenaries, of which there are many examples.  In 1912, the Balmoral review took place in response to the third Home Rule Bill and the Ulster Covenant was signed.  In 1913, the great lock-out took place.  In 1914 came the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Force and the landing of arms at Donaghadee and Larne.  The Easter Rising took place in 1916, followed by the executions, and the battle of the Somme occurred.  In 1918 the general election took place.  The First D&aacute;il sat in 1919 and the War of Independence began. In 1920 the Government of Ireland Act was passed.  The first Northern Ireland Parliament sat in 1921, and the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed.</P>
        <P>It is incumbent on us all, North and South, Unionist and Nationalist, loyalist and republican, to find a collective way to manage the celebration of the events surrounding these centenaries in such a way as to add value to the peace process rather than subtract from it.  Undoubtedly, these centenaries present an enormous challenge but, if conducted sensitively, they have the potential to consolidate the peace process fully and give a very precious legacy from this generation to those who will come after us.  The first of the centenaries will take place next year and the ways in which it and those following immediately after are celebrated will set the tone for the rest.  As the Bishop of Cork, Paul Colton, stated recently, a broad and generous perspective needs to be taken in commemorating the full spectrum of these centenaries.</P>
        <P>Good work has been done in the past 18 months by the Ulster centenary committee which has linked into work already under way in the Department of the Taoiseach.  However, that work would benefit from additional input from the Nationalist-republican tradition, particularly in Northern Ireland, and from within loyalism.  For the decade of centenaries to enhance relationships on this island, there is a need for an integrated approach, considerable mutual generosity and full acknowledgment of parity of esteem.</P><Col N="462"/>
        <P>This Chamber can have a role in, first, promoting a general awareness of the sensitivities of these centenaries and, second, supporting and encouraging those who will play crucial roles in ensuring the related celebrations consolidate peace and reconciliation between the two traditions on this island, the Unionist and the Nationalist.  To that end, this House could be briefed by, for example, the likes of the chair of the Somme Association and by reputable historians who have a particular interest in the history of this period which would put this Chamber in a very strong and informed position to make its own contribution to the success of these celebrations and to engage confidently with those who are pivotal in ensuring that success.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator McAleese for giving me so much of his time.  We Independents brought our motion to the Chamber today.  I have listened to many, beautiful, eloquent speeches from other Senators but I wish to speak only on our motion because I see things very simply.  I come from the business community and have no political leanings either way.  I am a total Independent.</P>
        <P>I hear fearful talks about receivership and other matters such as the abolition of the Seanad.  Like Senator McAleese, I do not wish to be paralysed and believe we must take action.  We Independents thought very carefully about introducing this motion.  To me, it seems a very simple action.  I welcome that Senator Cummins said about his amendment that the issue would be dealt with in a very timely manner because when I drove to Dublin this afternoon to attend the Chamber, my heart sank at the sight of the amendment.  I read &ldquo;that these proposals be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at the earliest opportunity&rdquo; and when I saw &ldquo;considered&rdquo; I thought to myself, they are just going to put it up on the old shelf.  I thank Senator Cummins because I was very comforted to know it will be dealt with in a timely manner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am in business and things are really tough.  I was in the Westbury Hotel yesterday with 160 companies belonging to KPMG.  Matters are just as bad as they were in 2008 in many ways but we are all very positive and are working hard.  Change is very difficult for us who work in business but we must push through the same change in this House.  Let us try.  For fun, let us pretend we wish to discuss retailing and supermarkets.  Senator Quinn spoke earlier.  I agree with Senator Mary White about the bit of housekeeping.  If we are debating, is it possible that people might not leave?  It is very difficult to talk to people who are not present.  I have enormous respect for Senator Quinn, who is a brilliant man and globally brilliant on retail.  I reiterate may point.  Let us say we wished to have a debate next week on retailing and supermarkets.  We could invite Mr. Terry Leahy and Senator Quinn to speak, for 20 minutes only, followed by questions and answers for 12 minutes.  It would not waste a great deal of time.  We 60 Senators could get the most expert people one could imagine rather than oblige a poor committee to sit repeatedly, see if it could invite such people and, if it could, prepare a report with its interpretation of what the experts had said.  That is all we propose.  We want to keep it simple.  We do not want to upset anyone or waste any time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity.  It is the ninth year in which I have made similar points.  I congratulate the Senators who introduced the motion.  It is impossible for me not to agree entirely with the previous speaker because I, too, saw the motion was to be adjusted and understood this was the ninth year in which we have made many of the same points.  As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; stated, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges may need to reform in regard to how it considers these issues.  There is nothing to disagree with in the motion.  It does not take from the initiative of the Independent Senators to point out there have been many like it over the years which were stifled.  Senator White pointed out it was not the fault of Senators that work has not been done.</P><Col N="463"/>
        <P Just="Left">In my experience in the Seanad, we have all spoken openly throughout this time on different aspects of legislation and then voted, the Whip having taken a very different line on issues from that of the party or the Government.  That is the strength of the Seanad.  I shall return to the issue of the Whip presently.  It is the political hierarchy within all parties that is to blame for the fact that the Seanad has never been reformed.  It is disgraceful in the extreme that the seventh amendment to the Constitution, made in 1979, has never been implemented.  We have seen various reports throughout the years and Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party in Government absolutely share the blame for ensuring we have maintained the <i>status quo</i> in this House.  They have abused it as merely the safety net for the also rans or the breaking ground for new talent.  I am a product of that system in that I contested the general election, was not elected and I am back again in the House.  That being given, in the eight years since I was elected on the industrial and commercial panel, I have been acutely aware of my vocational responsibility.  My background is exclusively in representative work with the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland movement and others, and I always try to reflect that in the legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Over the years, great proposals such as this one that were cost neutral to implement have been becalmed.  The hierarchy of the political parties and the Government of the day stifled progress.  Therein lies the difficulty.  If a meaningful proposal to have a person come to the Seanad is agreed by all Members and goes before the CPP, the Cabinet of the day will not allow it if is politically insensitive.  There is no Senator, current or former, who would disagree that is the problem.  The Whip should not apply in here, there should be a free vote on every issue because we cannot block legislation, only delay it for a period and highlight to the nation that a Bill requires a longer period of reflection.</P>
        <P>There are many great proposals on how we could do business better.  If the public was truly informed of how well it is being done as it is, they would have more confidence in the political system as a whole.  Senator Bacik mentioned the 1,900 amendments to legislation, with one of the higher profile changes being that on discrimination on age.  There were many others.  The NAMA legislation debate in this House led to several adjustments in the D&aacute;il.  The late Brian Lenihan would have acknowledged that.  If there is a challenge to us, it is to convince the Government.  There is no better man to do that than the Leader of the House and, from working with him, I know he believes in the work of the Seanad and what it can do.</P>
        <P>Legislation has just been passed that was initiated in this House, pioneered through the leadership and guidance of Senator Ivana Bacik, although she would acknowledge that it was started by the previous Government.  There was not a single media representative here.  I do not recall the debate being recorded in any medium of the media.  I used to joke that to get on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; one had to be gay, a former president of ICTU or a <i>Sunday Independent</i> journalist.  That was often not far from the truth, as I am sure other Senators will acknowledge.</P>
        <P>If we have a referendum I presume there will be an independent referendum commission that must ensure both sides of the argument are put forward.  It would be disingenuous when we come to that stage if the question is merely if we should abolish the Seanad.  That would be wrong.  There must be a broader debate about the wording of the proposal and what a reformed Seanad could look like.  We should look at the work of the Seanad to date.</P>
        <P>I have a lot of proposals for Seanad reform.  The motion deals specifically with a few that could be easily implemented and I hope the CPP and the intentions of Senators are not stifled by the Cabinet of the day, as so often happened in the past, regardless of who was in government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to see all public appointments scrutinised by the Seanad in order that there is a new head of a semi-State body, he or she would come in here for five or ten minutes and make a presentation, as happens with Commissioners in the European Parliament.  That would bring <Col N="464"/>people closer to their State agencies.  The scrutiny of EU legislation, in my experience, is lip service.  One of the positives of the Lisbon treaty was the establishment of an embryonic stage for legislation where it is kicked back to member states to consider and this is the appropriate forum for that.  If there is a proposed directive, we should bring in the stakeholders in order that we then can tell Ministers and MEPs the Irish views on the proposal rather than it being conjured up in the bowels of Government Buildings, with none of us knowing anything about it until we read about it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We might have more detailed debates on actual proposals.  I support this motion and implore the committee to honour it and ensure it is done.  Everyone on this side of the House wants to see that.  The Seanad has a great future and while I can understand populist statements being made in the thrust of an election campaign, when people play the man and not the ball, I cannot understand why the Taoiseach had to bring a pickaxe to the pitch.  We must believe in the potential of this House, the value for money it genuinely offers, however many millions of euro it costs compared with the HSE, which will cost &euro;14.3 billion this year.  Will this be better?  I have no doubt this will be the best Seanad, I have also no doubt it will not be the last.  I will personally campaign vigorously to ensure it is not, in the interests of the people.</P>

	<P>This is an important motion on a small change that can and will be accommodated in an effort to make this House more relevant to the general public, to those who elected us and for those who have been appointed to this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would not like to see the choice being between abolition or retention of the Seanad, the question should be asked in the context of the total reform of our politics.  The D&aacute;il must be reduced in numbers.  As an elected representative in a constituency with two Senators, five Deputies and seven councillors, I went to a public meeting last October and every Oireachtas representative and councillor was at the meeting which was attended by ten members of the public.  There must be change.  I was a local authority member and local authorities play an important role, they are connected to the people.  Last Monday, there were council meetings up and down the country.  No one really knows what went on at them, unless the media happened to report them, but important business was being done by people representing their constituents and trying to improve their lot.  Democracy is important.  In this House we represent those who have elected us and those who have been nominated to the House have a responsibility to speak on issues they feel are of concern to their constituency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we go back to basics, the primary function of this House is to scrutinise legislation.  The other issues are important, such as inviting representatives to speak on issues of concern, but scrutiny is our main function.  Today we discussed the Finance Bill and the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill.  That is important business, and as long as this D&aacute;il lasts, that will continue to be the business of this Seanad.  The introduction to the programme for Government states that by the end of the term in government, Ireland will be recognised as a modern, fair, socially inclusive and equal society supported by a productive and prosperous economy.  This House will have an important role to play in the delivery of that ambition.</P>
        <P>We must bear in mind there is a record of everything that is said in this House and that record will be there in 20 or 50 years.  When I was writing my speaking notes today, I was listening to an interview on &ldquo;Drivetime&rdquo; with Mary Raftery about the Magdalene laundries and there were references to the debates in this House and the D&aacute;il at the time.  What we say will be revisited in future to see what the issues of concern were.  Reform of the Seanad and our contributions during this debate and the course of this Seanad will be noted.</P>
        <P>This term in the Seanad will be important and I have no doubt changes will result from the convention on the Constitution to which the Minister referred and the referendum.  Change is <Col N="465"/>always for the better.  If we do not change, we will always get the same results.  Is that what we want?  I favour reform, as we must move forward, but it must be done in the context of reform of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, as well as local government, as a strengthened local government system could play a very important role.</P>
        <P>A point that should have been made concerns the importance of the role of the committees.  The Leader will announce the membership of the committees tomorrow and they will then be established.  They provide a forum for witnesses to answer questions from members, but they do not receive the media attention they deserve.  We must take the business of Parliament seriously.  The record will show that worthy contributions are made by Oireachtas Members from all sides.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann resolves that section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 (No. 32 of 2009) shall continue in operation for the period beginning on 1st July, 2011 and ending on 29th June, 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the motion is to provide for the continuation in operation of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 for a further period of one year from 1 July.  One of the most important traits of a democratic society is a justice system that operates free from interference by anyone seeking to wrongfully influence outcomes.  The criminal justice system is made up not only of judges and lawyers but also by the participation of citizens, whether as witnesses or jurors.  It is this latter role which is so central and essential to our idea of a trial by a jury of one&rsquo;s peers.  There is nothing that can be considered more insidious than the targeting of those citizens who are prepared to put themselves at the service of the public by serving as jurors with a view to influencing the outcome of criminal proceedings.  That is the reality we must face and a matter that we, as legislators, must resolve.  </P>
        <P>I know that Members of this House feel as I do that trial by jury must be preserved to the greatest possible extent.  However, none of us can be blind to the threat posed to the criminal process by individuals, terrorist groups and organised criminal groups which seek to intimidate jurors or potential jurors.  Their aim is to subvert the criminal justice system.  We cannot allow that to happen.  Therefore, we must take measures to prevent this interference.  It is a sad fact that to do so we have to make the decision that trial by jury is not appropriate in certain limited circumstances.  I emphasise the point that section 8 of the 2009 Act is aimed at particular types of cases and that the centrality of jury trial to our system remains intact.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 and the measures contained in it were put in place by the Oireachtas to take further action to address the increasing levels of violence by gangs involved in organised crime.  Although the measures were aimed, in particular, at those who directed the activities of these criminal gangs, given the nature of organised crime, it is also essential to target those who participate in these activities.  The Act primarily provided for <Col N="466"/>the trial of organised crime offences in the Special Criminal Court, unless the Director of Public Prosecutions otherwise directed.  The creation of a new offence of directing or controlling a criminal organisation and an increase in the maximum penalty for the offence of participation or involvement in organised crime are caught with regard to all organised crime offences to be able to draw inferences from a failure to answer questions or to account for movements, actions, activities or associations, with an increase in the penalty for the intimidation of a witness or juror from ten to 15 years imprisonment.</P>
        <P>It is the view of the Garda authorities that these provisions are indispensable to them in tackling organised crime.  A large number of arrests have been made under these provisions and charges are being pursued against a number of people.  I would be less than frank if I do not say to the House that useful as the provisions are, there will be disappointment that they have not proved to be of greater benefit in tackling the death and destruction caused by criminal gangs.  That is why I have asked my Department to review them to see if there are any further measures we can take.</P>
        <P>Section 8 of the 2009 Act is the subject of this resolution which is aimed at ensuring organised criminal gangs cannot interfere with the court process to influence the outcome of cases.  For this purpose, the section declares that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, the preservation of public peace and order in relation to certain organised crime offences under Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, as amended.  I will detail these offences for the House.</P>
        <P>The offences are deemed to be scheduled offences for the purpose of Part 5 of the Offences against the State Act 1939.  This means that they will be tried in the Special Criminal Court.  However, the Director of Public Prosecutions may still exercise his power to direct that offences should be tried in the ordinary courts.</P>
        <P>Section 8(4) provides that the section shall cease to be in operation, unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that it should continue in operation for a period to be determined by the Oireachtas.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann passed such resolutions on 29 June 2010 to continue the operation of the section until 30 June 2011.</P>
        <P>Section 8(6) provides that before a resolution to continue the section in operation is tabled, the Minister shall prepare a report which shall be laid before both Houses on the operation of the Act in the period under report.  I laid such a report before both Houses on 14 June.</P>
        <P>Section 8 of the 2009 Act refers to four particular offences which are set out in Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, as amended.  They are section 71A, the offence of directing a criminal organisation which carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment.  This offence was inserted by section 5 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  It is intended to target those who direct the activities of organised criminal gangs.  However, it is aimed not just at those who are in a leadership position in the gangs but also at those who are further down the food chain, so to speak, at all levels of the gangs.  The offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment.</P>
        <P>Section 72 is the offence of participating in or contributing to the activities of a criminal organisation in order to enhance gangs&rsquo; ability to commit a serious offence or facilitate the organisation in committing serious offences.  This offence was inserted by section 6 of the 2009 Act and carries a penalty of a fine and-or up to 15 years imprisonment.</P>
        <P>Section 73 is the offence of committing an offence for a criminal organisation.  The maximum penalty for this offence was increased from ten to 15 years imprisonment by section 10 of the 2009 Act.  Section 76 provides for liability for offences under Part 7 of the 2006 Act where they are committed by corporate bodies, their members, directors and managers.</P><Col N="467"/>
        <P>Senators will be well aware of the ongoing threat which organised crime presents to society.  There are a number of criminal gangs in the State which continue to engage in very serious crimes.  The unfortunate fact is that there is plenty of evidence of the involvement of these gangs in murder, armed robbery, kidnapping, drug smuggling, counterfeiting and other serious offences.  There is also no doubt about their willingness to engage in the most serious violence to protect their interests and ensure they can continue their activities.</P>
        <P>I take the opportunity to praise the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its ongoing efforts in tackling these criminal gangs.  It continues to deploy considerable operational resources in a number of operational approaches to tackling organised and serious crime, including a multi-agency approach and the deployment of intelligence-led targeted operations.  The primary role of the Garda organised crime unit is to target organised criminal gangs in conjunction with other national units such as the emergency response unit, the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  These units are working collaboratively.  They have had and continue to have success in disrupting criminal gangs.</P>
        <P>Senators will know there have been a number of significant arrests and seizures of significant quantities of drugs in February, March and April as part of ongoing operations being undertaken by the Garda authorities with the co-operation of the customs service.  Drugs to the value of over &euro;750,000 were seized in March during an operation in Slane, County Meath.  During another operation in April near Enfield in the same county, almost &euro;1 million worth of heroin was seized.  Garda&iacute; made arrests in these and many other operations and charges are being brought.  The nature of organised crime means that the process of investigation and prosecution can be lengthy and difficult, particularly in light of the power criminal gangs hold over the people involved with them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report I have laid before the House is based on information provided for me by the Garda authorities.  It shows that section 8, which is the subject of this resolution, has not been used in the period under report, but the related sections of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 have been used by the Garda on 72 occasions.  These arrests have resulted in four people being charged with offences contrary to section 71A &mdash; directing a criminal organisation &mdash; and section 72 &mdash; participating in or contributing to the activities of a criminal organisation.  These arrests have resulted in other charges, relating to firearms offences, the sale and supply of controlled drugs, robbery, aggravated burglary and other serious offences, being proffered.  Although there have been many arrests under the relevant sections of the Act, no cases have come before the Special Criminal Court to date.  This does not invalidate the reasoning for having such a provision available for use when the circumstances require it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I said, the Garda authorities are clear in their view that the provisions of the 2009 Act are indispensable in the fight against organised crime.  The Garda authorities consider it is of paramount importance that the relevant provisions of the Act be extended for a further period.  In matters of this nature, I must have the utmost regard to the views of the Garda authorities.  It is absolutely essential to ensure garda&iacute; have at their disposal the best possible range of powers to face and tackle these dangerous criminal gangs.  The Garda authorities devote considerable resources from across the Garda organisation to their efforts to tackle organised crime.  The Garda Commissioner has made it clear time and again that there will be no let-up in the action being taken against these gangs.  He has my full support and that of the Government for his approach.  In recent years, the Oireachtas has legislated for a comprehensive programme of criminal law reform to assist in combating organised and serious crime.  This legislation is making a significant contribution to tackling this type of crime.  I will keep under review the question of whether any improvements could be made to the overall legislative package in this area to render it more effective.  As I indicated, I have asked for a specific review of the provisions of the 2009 Act.  I am sure Senators will agree that as legislators, we have a duty to <Col N="468"/>make the most effective legal powers available to the Garda, the prosecution authorities and the courts to deal with criminal gangs that cause so much harm to society.</P>
        <P>We need to make it clear that those who are deeply involved in organised crime are desperate and will stop at nothing to avoid being brought to account for their crimes.  Extreme violence and brutal intimidation are a way of life for these thugs.  They have no regard for society or the law.  We all have a duty to make sure the criminal justice system can hold sway over them.  To that end, we must ensure that in the most serious of cases, where jury intimidation is a real possibility, the law has the means available to it to bring these criminals to account.  This provision is a departure from the right to trial by jury in the normal course of law.  In the circumstances, however, I believe this is a justified and measured limitation of that right.  On balance, I consider that the period of time for which I propose to renew this section is proportionate.  The 2009 Act provided for an original period of one year for the provision to be in operation before its continuance in operation should be reconsidered.  The period that is now proposed, which will run from the current expiry date to 29 June 2012, corresponds to that.  If it is proposed to continue the operation of the provision after that date, of course the Oireachtas will have to consider the matter again.  I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House.  As Fianna F&aacute;il spokesman on justice, I wish to confirm my party&rsquo;s total support for this provision.  It is a reflection of the times we live in that our legal and criminal justice system has had to be amended to provide for trials of organised crime offences to be held in a Special Criminal Court.  As the Minister said, the normal process of trial by jury does not apply under these arrangements.  There are very good reasons for that.  The Minister mentioned that this is relatively new legislation.  I do not think the fruits of what the Legislature intended when it passed the legislation in question have been seen on the streets to date.  I expect that they will be evident soon.  I am not looking forward to that, but the reality is that it is necessary.  In parts of Dublin and particularly in Limerick, trials have collapsed as a result of intimidation of jurors, witnesses, etc.  These extreme measures were introduced because this has become a relatively regular occurrence, unfortunately.  There is no doubt that the Al Capone scenario we saw in Limerick over a 15-year period has abated.  Many of the serious criminals in that city are behind bars, thanks to the vigilance and constant surveillance of the Garda.  The Garda authorities have enjoyed some success, albeit perhaps not as a direct result of this legislation.</P>
        <P>Like the Minister, I would like to compliment the Garda on its tremendous fight against crime.  The Minister mentioned a couple of successful operations that resulted from intelligence-led investigations.  The operations in question, in Slane and in Enfield, are to be commended.  I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude for the apprehension of an armed gang in Kill recently.  I do not want to say much about the matter because it is <i>sub judice</i>.  A group of armed men were traversing the streets of a relatively quiet country town between 1 a.m. and 1.30 a.m.  They were not out for a midnight ride with Paul Revere.  They were not out &ldquo;gallivanting around&rdquo; the country, to use the late Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s phrase.  They had a serious criminal intent in mind.  They may have been planning some sort of tiger kidnapping or some other criminal activity.  They were quite heavily armed.  The Garda must be complimented for apprehending them.  I welcome that.  The citizens of this country can sleep a little easier in the realisation that a powerful branch of the Garda &mdash; the emergency response unit &mdash; is working with the Criminal Assets Bureau and other bodies to ensure they are properly protected.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that the legislation we are discussing is severe.  These provisions are extreme.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is required to come before the House on an annual basis.  If he does not do so, these provisions will lapse.  I welcome the statement of intent <Col N="469"/>on the part of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to the effect that this legislation will be strengthened if it transpires that it is not strong enough to deal with armed criminals and drug lords.  It is difficult to envisage how that could be done if it is deemed necessary.  The Minister&rsquo;s intention is to ensure law-abiding citizens are protected.  He wants the streets of Dublin, Limerick and Cork, not to mention our country lanes, to be more secure and more peaceful for normal law-abiding citizens.  Any measure he is prepared to introduce to that end will receive my full support, if necessary.  The Minister&rsquo;s speech covered all of these matters comprehensively.  I endorse what he said, by and large.  I will conclude by stating categorically that along with my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, I fully support the Minister&rsquo;s decision to continue this severe and draconian provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Shatter, back to the House, his second time in a 24-hour period.  He is before us to seek the renewal of what one must describe as rather stringent and almost draconian legislation.  These times, from a criminal gang point of view, mean that we have little option but to accede to the Minister&rsquo;s request.</P>
        <P>We had a substantive debate in the House on the original legislation, if I recall, in late 2008 or early 2009.  The backdrop to that debate was what appeared at the time to be a significant increase in serious crime throughout the country and there was almost public hysteria about the fact that the Garda and the authorities seemed almost powerless to deal with the situation, in particular, with criminal gangs and drug gangs which appeared to be causing considerable destruction throughout the country.  We had a substantive debate on the introduction of this legislation with then Minister, Dermot Ahern, and on the Fine Gael side of the House on that occasion was Senator Regan.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan would have been contributing for Fianna F&aacute;il.  The merits and demerits of the legislation were debated in great deal at that stage.  We all had to recognise, as is our duty, that we must always guard personal and civil liberties, but the case made then, which I think is being made by the Minister this evening, was that certain crimes and certain criminal elements are almost beyond the course of normal law and law-abiding mechanisms and this type of legislation needs to be put in place.  I certainly support the retention of section 8 of the Act.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister stated that people may be a little disappointed that we do not appear to have a clearer picture of the success to date of the broader elements of the Act, but progress can take time and cases can take a long time to run through the system.  The message we are getting from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that it needs the retention of these measures.  I think we have no choice but to come down on that side of the equation.  To assure ourselves of the necessity of what we are doing here, we would want the clearest possible picture from a statistical perspective of the success of the Act and of section 8 which we are reinstating.  It may be possible to give us some more detail from a statistical perspective of the numbers of cases and other such matters.  Perhaps when the Minister has an opportunity to do so, he might present those figures to the House for consideration.</P>
        <P>As the Minister pointed out, the powers of section 8 are quite severe.  They are not the type of powers that he or many of us would like to be introducing, but the circumstances of 2008-2009, which, to use that awful phrase from another place, really have not gone away, leave us with little alternative.  Communities throughout the country and not only in the greater urban areas have become victims, in particular to drug gangs and the resultant, often violent, robberies.  Sadly, tackling these criminal elements, in particular the leaders of these gangs who are benefiting significantly in a financial sense from the resultant human misery, requires the reinstatement of these measures.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  Perhaps he would expand further, either in his response or at some stage in the near future by way of written correspondence, on the <Col N="470"/>statistical evidence of which his Department is aware and which proves that this measure needs to be retained.  We do not take these measures lightly.  As Members of the Oireachtas, we have a broad duty to guard and protect the civil and human rights of every citizen of this country.  I suppose the greatest civil and human right is the right to life.  Others are the right not to be attacked and the right to be safe in one&rsquo;s home, street and community.  Sadly, these measures are required to protect and vindicate those rights in this current difficult time of criminal gangs.  I support the Minister&rsquo;s resolution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am glad to hear he is conducting a review of the provisions of the 2009 Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act.  That is a useful announcement.  I hope it will be a comprehensive review and that, in particular, it will look at the necessity of this provision in section 8.</P>
        <P>I begin by acknowledging, as the Minister and other speakers have, the real and substantial threat posed to ordinary citizens&rsquo; lives and to the criminal justice system by organised crime, the immense crime that has been done by organised crime at many different levels and the enormous damage done, especially where witnesses and jurors are subject to intimidation, which, I note, was the motivation behind this provision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In previous debates on related provisions, we referred to the dreadful murder of Mr. Roy Collins, and Senator O&rsquo;Donovan referred to Limerick as a place where there has been serious concern about the intimidation of witnesses in criminal trials.  These are immense harms which we are seeking to address. However, I have profound concern about this provision.  I regret to see us being asked to renew it for a further year.  In 2009, when it was initially proposed and we debated it at length in this House, the Labour group opposed the section and, indeed, tabled an amendment to address our serious concern about it.  I would ask the Minister to look again at the text of the amendment, to which I will refer, and the concerns, which we expressed then and which I would express again, to see, when he is conducting a review of the provisions overall, whether it is necessary to have this sweeping provision in section 8.  Our objection to it relates to the broad sweeping nature of it.  Other speakers have referred to it as draconian and, as the Minister stated, it marks a departure from the right to trial by jury.</P>
        
        <P>I described it previously as potentially amounting to an admission by us of our defeat to criminal gangs that we are making a declaration that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice.  The Irish Human Rights Commission made clear a similar objection in its observations on the Bill in 2009 when it stated that it considered that the developed system of criminal justice is capable of effectively confronting the problem of organised crime without resorting to a parallel criminal justice system that does not provide the accused with a right to trial by jury.  Our concern about section 8 is that it marked the adoption of a parallel criminal justice system outside the realm of so-called subversive offences within which the Special Criminal Court already operates.  We also felt it was unnecessary because the DPP has already got the power to refer non-scheduled offences to the Special Criminal Court.  The then Minister argued that it was important to make a general provision in respect of organised crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister to consider, during his more comprehensive review, whether this sweeping provision is necessary and to look at the amendment we put forward on behalf of the Labour group in 2009 which gave the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, the power to refer matters of organised crime to the Special Criminal Court but giving grounds for such referrals.  Our amendment suggested that the DPP should be of opinion that there is a real and substantial risk that the jurors or potential jurors may be intimidated or put in fear.  That, we felt, was a more focused way of dealing with the issue.  The Irish Human Rights Commission made clear <Col N="471"/>also that there were alternative methods that could be used to protect juries and witnesses in criminal trials from intimidation rather than making a blanket provision such as this that denies the right to jury trial to those charged with certain offences.</P>
        <P>One of the provisions I welcomed &mdash; I think the only one &mdash; in section 8 in 2009 was the fact that it would be subject to an annual review.  In the previous debate held just before the Minister came to the House, we debated the role of the Seanad and how to make it more effective.  One of the points many speakers highlighted was the need for the Seanad to retain a level of heightened legislative scrutiny over any legislation that came before us.</P>
      
        <P>In the interests of acting as a forum where we can give that level of scrutiny to legislation, we must be clear that when provisions of this nature come before us for annual review, as in this case and as the provisions of the Offences against the State Act did yesterday, we must ensure we are not simply a rubber-stamping House.  We must scrutinise the measures put before us and we must note in particular the information we are given.  I agree with Senator Bradford that we need full information.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister stated this provision has not been used in the past 12 months.  I do not recall whether 12 months ago it had been used in the previous 12 months, although I am aware this is a relatively new provision, as others have said.  I am aware the Garda has sought for its retention.  If it is to be retained for a further 12 months in 12 months time, however, when the Minister comes to the House, and it has not been used within that further 12 month period, we must take a serious step towards changing the nature of section 8 to ensure we no longer have draconian measures in place unless we can be sure they are effective in the fight against organised crime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House for the second time in 24 hours, as Senator Bacik has acknowledged.  I acknowledge the serious nature of organised crime in the State.  The pain that organised crime causes for individuals, communities, families and those who are the victims of organised crime, gun and drug crime is severe.  Disadvantaged areas suffer from a higher incidence of such crimes.  However, this is no excuse nor can it be an excuse for abuses of human rights.  We could, potentially, create further unjustified suffering and damage to families.  The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act is wide open to abuse.  Each year, Senators and Deputies in the D&aacute;il vote unquestioningly to reduce their own rights and undercut their right to a fair trial.  I call on Senators to reflect on this.  Senator Bacik referred to rubber-stamping legislation.  Oireachtas Members have been rubber-stamping for far too long and that is wrong.  We should reflect on the reality of what this does.</P>
        <P>Often, there is a false dichotomy which underpins the argument for these powers to be extended and often it is repeated by those who support the extension of the powers.  The argument holds that there are the rights of the criminal on the one hand and the rights of the victim on the other and it is about the difference between the two.  I am entirely in favour of increasing the rights of the victim.  However, people should not mistake the rights of the accused as anything else because the accused is innocent until proven guilty.  That must be the basis for any criminal justice system.</P>
        <P>When emergency powers are brought in, they are difficult to get rid of.  Senator Bacik posed the question about the logic of extending this given how seldom and infrequently the powers have been used.  This is a telling point when one reflects on how often the powers have been used, yet we are being asked to extend the powers for another year.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act is the affirmation that the Special Criminal Court is a normal part of our legal system.  It is a damning indictment of our system that we have an <Col N="472"/>emergency court which was supposed to be set up to deal with emergencies but which has now become a normal or permanent feature of our criminal justice system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am somewhat familiar with the legal system, with the great potential for miscarriages of justice and where the usual safeguards are applied poorly, compromised or dropped entirely.  We are familiar with cases such as those of Dean Ryan, Meleady and Grogan, the DPP <i>v</i>. Pringle and, famously, the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four.  The Act provides for the wholesale dropping of safeguards in respect of the right to silence and in terms of the right to a jury trial.  This is anti-democratic, dangerous and corrodes the Minister&rsquo;s right and our right to a fair trial.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">This is a human rights issue.  The right to a fair trial is guaranteed under Article 38 of the Constitution and under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  There is a growing consensus outside this Chamber that the Special Criminal Court should be done away with.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the UN Human Rights Committee have expressed concern at its continuing existence.  As in another case yesterday, the report published by the Minister is grossly insufficient for the purposes of scrutiny.  Not even the false rationale offered yesterday by the Minister that we are using the legislation often so it must be necessary could be offered up in this situation, as was pointed out earlier.  That defence does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
        <P>No cases have been sent to the Special Criminal Court on foot of section 8.  The section has been used 72 times in the past 12 months.  Of these 72 cases, four have faced charges but none has come to the Special Criminal Court.  There is limited utilisation and the rate of utilisation to charges is appalling, never mind convictions.  Is this being used for trawling, for picking people up and questioning them as an information gathering exercise?  I call on Members to reflect again on what we are being asked to do.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik referred to next year.  If we arrive at a situation next year where again these powers have not been used extensively, if at all, then perhaps we should consider the matter in 12 months time.  I see no reason we should do that or why we should surrender our rights.  People are entitled to a fair trial by jury.  This is a fundamental human rights issue.  It should underpin the criminal justice system and justice must be at the heart of any criminal justice system.  For this reason I oppose the extension and the proposal brought forward by the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions and I thank the majority of Senators who spoke in support of this resolution.  I do not believe this House should be a rubber stamp.  It is correct that we have an opportunity to consider each year the workings of legislation such as the measure we are dealing with and the measures we discussed yesterday.</P>
        <P>I cannot agree with Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s comments on the impact of this section on human rights.  The ultimate issue with regard to human rights is the right to life and to go about one&rsquo;s business in a manner in which one is not interfered with.  Unfortunately, there is organised crime and there are criminal gangs in this jurisdiction who are intent on murder and mayhem, who have no difficulty in seeking to intimidate either witnesses or jurors, if they have the facility to do so, and who are willing, as I mentioned in the House yesterday, to engage in open gang and gun warfare on our streets, in people&rsquo;s homes and in public houses.</P><Col N="473"/>
        <P>It would be extremely naive of any of us as legislators to assume that if measures such as those being discussed today and yesterday were removed from the legislative architecture available, then in some way we would better protect human rights.  In fact, it would amount to saying to certain victims who suffer trauma and tragedy in their lives as a consequence of the activities of criminal gangs and those engaged in organised crime that we are granting some of these individuals impunity.  This is because those people would be free to take whatever actions they believe appropriate to undermine our courts system and criminal justice system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provision seeks to counteract those who pose this type of threat and who are willing to subvert the State and the courts system as we would wish to see it operate.  The ideal situation in the criminal law area is to have a judge, jury and no need for special courts.   However, the special courts have proved their importance over the years by ensuring trials can take place in circumstances in which juries cannot be intimidated.  They are essential in order that justice can truly be done and the human rights of victims can be protected.  We have a criminal justice system which presumes the accused is innocent until proved guilty, and the Special Criminal Court has the full procedural panoply of provisions necessary to guarantee that trials take place in an appropriate and proper manner.  The appellate system copperfastens the guarantee that justice will be fully and properly done.</P>
        <P>It is important that we recognise the reality of what confronts our society and the Garda, and the difficulties that can arise in facilitating trials within the normal courts system.  I appreciate that it is important that we monitor how this provision is utilised and that we ensure it is effective.  If it turns out that it is not effective and is not being utilised, clearly it cannot then be alleged that it is interfering with anyone&rsquo;s human rights.  We need a provision which ensures the protection necessary to guarantee the proper administration of justice in the criminal law area so that those who have committed crimes are brought to book, that prosecutions can fully and properly take place and that court decisions can be made.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik spoke about the original approach of the Labour Party in regard to the measure and I acknowledge her suggestion regarding the Director of Public Prosecutions.  However, in the context of the history of this provision, I do not accept that anything particular arises in that context.  Nevertheless, I have an open mind on these issues.  It is important that we see how the provision works in the next 12 months and whether it facilitates the conduct of trials in safe circumstances in which people are brought to justice.  We must see whether it genuinely contributes to the administration of justice.  If it does not, we will have to return to it and address the issue.  However, it is important to keep the provision in place and that the resolution is supported.  I thank the Senators who have contributed to the debate, particularly those who expressed their support for the motion.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well in his portfolio.  This is not his first time in the House, as he was a distinguished Member of the Seanad some years ago.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the matter of changing the placename An Daingean to Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is.  I also thank the Minister for personally taking this Adjournment matter.  </P>
        <P>In 2006, on behalf of the people of Dingle, Kerry County Council carried out a plebiscite on changing the placename An Daingean to Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is.  There was a 95% vote in favour, but, unfortunately, it has taken five years for anything to be done.  The previous two Ministers kept their hands in their pockets and did not deal with the issue.  As a consequence, Dingle as a tourist destination has suffered.</P>
        <P>I commend Kerry County Council for the manner in which it carried out its work in accordance with the outcome of the plebiscite and the democratic process that had taken place.  I again thank the Minister for appearing in person to take this Adjournment matter and compliment him on hitting the ground running in the first 100 days of the Government and dealing with this issue.  There will be massive benefits for the entire Dingle Peninsula generated by the tourism sector.  I hope the Minister will have something positive to say to the people of both Dingle town and living on the peninsula because, as he is aware, Dingle is a worldwide brand and now a highly cosmopolitan town.</P>

I compliment all those to whom Senator Sheahan referred on their efforts in this regard.

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach most sincerely for his kind welcome.  While I attended the House previously in the presence of Senator Wilson, obviously the Cathaoirleach was not present.  </P>
        <P>I thank Senators Tom Sheahan and Paul Coghlan for raising this important matter which Senator Sheahan has raised many times in the past three and a half years in the D&aacute;il, while Senator Paul Coghlan has done so in the Seanad.  I am glad to be given the chance to inform the House that the Government has now approved the inclusion of provisions dealing with the Dingle placename issue in the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011.  They will replace existing provisions in local government law dealing with the changing of placenames.</P>
        <P>There is a problem of incompatibility between the relevant local government provisions and the Official Languages Act 2003.  It was brought into focus by the issue that arose in respect of the name An Daingean, or Dingle, County Kerry.  The amendment I am bringing forward is intended to solve this problem.  It also will put in place updated and clear procedures for the <Col N="475"/>changing of placenames under local government law in a transparent and fair way and in harmony with the Official Languages Act.</P>
        <P>The official name of Dingle was changed to An Daingean in 2004 by an order of the Minster for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs under the Official Languages Act 2003.  The English language version then ceased to have legal force.  As a result, there are three circumstances in which the use of the English version is not permissible, namely, in legislation, on certain Ordnance Survey maps and statutory road signage.  This has given rise to a certain amount of controversy, with significant opposition locally and calls to retain Dingle as the official name, as well as a high degree of recognition, particularly from a tourism perspective.</P>
        <P>In 2006 Kerry County Council held a plebiscite under the Local Government Act 1946 on a proposal to change the name to Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, which was passed.  The council applied for an order to change the name accordingly, but it was not possible to accede to this because the Attorney General had advised that the local government code could not be used to change the name of a place already subject to a placenames order, as was the case with An Daingean.</P>
        <P>To resolve the issue, the previous Government decided to legislate for the use of the names &ldquo;Dingle&rdquo; and &ldquo;Daingean Ui Chuis&rdquo;, in tandem, by way of amendments to the placenames provisions in the local government code.  These amendments had been included in the Dublin Mayor Bill, but this opportunity passed with the lapsing of that Bill on the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il.  Instead, I am now proposing to avail of the earliest possible legislative opportunity to enact these provisions, through the environment Bill.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendments will restate large elements of the existing placename provisions in local government law, but with some significant changes.  In future, any proposal adopted by a local authority to change a placename must specify the proposed name in Irish only or in English and in Irish.  Any plebiscite will require a secret ballot and all proposals will need adoption of a resolution by half of the total members of the council.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The legislation will provide that a placename change under local government law will supersede an order under the Official Languages Act 2003 and, of course, the impact of the 2004 placenames order, as it applies to An Daingean, will be undone.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the sensitivities of all involved in this issue and that there are differing views, but the result of the 2006 plebiscite, even if not legally implementable at that time, was clear cut.  The proposed provisions will provide a more coherent, modern and streamlined set of procedures for the changing of placenames and will place responsibility for this function at local level, where it should properly reside.  An important aspect of the new provisions is that they will also give greater recognition to the Irish language in every case where placename changes are proposed.  I hope, therefore, that these amendments will bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion and I expect that these changes will be completed before the summer recess of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

I join in the words of welcome to the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, and I thank him for coming to the House to deal personally with a matter relating to his own Department and for agreeing to take this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health.</P>

	<P>On 25 February 2008, my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, the then Minister of State with responsibility for children, opened the new state-of-the-art health centre in Ballinagh, County Cavan.  This fine facility which cost in the region of &euro;1.3 million, replaced the old and outdated centre on the Crossdoney road.  The centre contributes significantly to the provision of quality health services in Ballinagh and the surrounding areas.  This excellent facility gives people direct access to integrated, multi-disciplinary teams of nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and until a few weeks ago, a general practitioner was <i>in situ</i> four days a week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent weeks I have been contacted by a large number of concerned citizens in the Ballinagh area, including among them, former Councillor Charlie Fleming and Mrs Bridget Delaney who were instrumental in campaigning for a new centre to be constructed and also my colleague, Councillor Patricia Walsh, has been in contact with me in this regard. The local community has expressed grave concern as to the impact of the withdrawal of GP services on the local community, and also the impact on the local pharmacy.  There are grave concerns that this pharmacy may be forced to close as a result of GP services being withdrawn from the state-of-the-art health centre.  I urge the Minister and to have this urgent situation rectified as soon as possible.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Wilson for sharing time with me on this issue.  As he mentioned, Ballinagh has only had a brand new health centre in the past few years and it provides critical services to the local community.  The removal of the GP service in the area will inflict a significant blow not just on Ballinagh but on the surrounding areas.  What is the guarantee that other towns like Kilnaleck, beside Ballinagh, will be safe?  The new state-of-the-art facility in Ballinagh was a momentous event for the town and it signalled that primary health care would remain at the heart of the community and that elderly people would not have to travel extensively for primary care services.  This is a critical service providing critical access for people.  I urge the Minister, on the day when Cavan General Hospital has the second highest number of people waiting on trolleys in the State, to intervene to ensure that Ballinagh has a GP service and to ensure that frontline care services are kept intact.  The removal of GP services will significantly set back the delivery of primary health care services for Ballinagh and its catchment area.  I urge the Minister and the HSE to intervene.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, who is unable to be in the House to take this matter and he has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
        <P>The general practice at Ballinagh health centre has a substantial number of general medical service clients.  Currently, there is only one GMS GP within the practice as one GP resigned recently on health grounds and another GP has been on long-term leave.  The suspension of GP services in Ballinagh health centre is a short-term measure pending the sourcing of the services of a locum.</P>
        <P>The EU-IMF programme provides for the introduction of legislative changes to remove restrictions to trade and competition in sheltered sectors by the end of the third quarter of 2011.  This includes eliminating restrictions on GPs wishing to treat public patients.  The Department of Health is preparing proposals for consideration by the Government in relation to this commitment.  The Government is committed to establishing a strong system of primary care in Ireland.  The appointment of a dedicated Minister of State with responsibility for primary care is a clear indication of our intentions in this regard.</P><Col N="477"/>
        <P Just="Left">The development of primary care teams and primary care centres is a priority under the programme for Government.  This will significantly increase health and social care in local communities which will be achieved by redirecting services away from acute hospitals.  Modern, well equipped primary care centres will be central to the effective functioning of primary care teams.  The centres will allow multidisciplinary services provided by GPs, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others, to be made available on a single site, providing a single point of access for the user, and will encourage closer co-ordination between providers.  The new centres will greatly assist in the provision of modern services, particularly the provision of chronic disease management by multidisciplinary teams.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are significant variations across primary care teams in terms of their stage of development and the number of clinical team meetings held, the number of patients discussed and the number of patient care plans agreed.  It is a key priority for this Government that all teams are fully functional.  The HSE has been asked to make significant progress on this issue in the next 12 months.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am glad to note he said this is a temporary setback.  I wish to record my admiration for Dr. Prior and his colleagues who provide an excellent service in the health centre.  Unfortunately, it is the responsibility of the HSE to ensure that the GP service is in place in Ballinagh.  The situation has been ongoing for a number of weeks and it is causing significant difficulties for elderly people in particular and people with small children.  The pharmacy is in danger of closing as a result of this decision.  I urge the Minister to speak to the HSE to ensure that the GP service is provided immediately in the health centre.</P>

      <Title>Garda Recruitment</Title>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon.  I appreciate that Ministers are extremely busy but I made the point in the House that where possible it is more satisfactory if the line Minister could be in attendance but I appreciate Deputy Cannon coming to take this Adjournment on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.</P>
        <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the House the situation regarding the non-recruitment of garda&iacute; for the next three years.  The last 120 garda&iacute; from Templemore, Co Tipperary, graduated on Thursday and there will be no recruits for at least two years.  No recruitment is planned.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors said the decision is a serious mistake.</P>
        <P>I must declare an interest.  I was nominated to contest the Seanad election by the AGSI, the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Superintendents.  The AGSI said the decision will take youth and vitality from the force which is already losing experienced members through early retirement.  John Redmond, the assistant secretary of the AGSI, said:</P>
        <P LI="1">By the end of 2012 there will be a huge number of people who will have retired from the service.  There is only one growth industry in a recession and that is crime.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The GRA said the Government is gambling with the safety of citizens and the security of the state to save money.  The policy has been strongly criticised by business people in Templemore who said it would devastate the town which is already suffering in the recession.  The Templemore Traders Association said the absence of students and the running down of the college will cost the local economy in County Tipperary millions of euro in trade and job losses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appreciate that proposals in regard to recruitment in the next few years were set out in the national recovery plan.  It outlined in detail the proposals to be put before the people.  It stated <Col N="478"/>that in 2011 the numbers of garda&iacute; would be 13,500; in 2012, 13,350; in 2013, 13,150; and by 2014, 13,000.  As far as I know, the proposal was rejected by the electorate who decided to elect a Fine Gael and Labour Party Administration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Prior to the general election, Fine Gael stated the recommendations on Garda training will form part of the review that will be undertaken by it should be elected to Government.  I presume now that it is in government it has an opportunity to reassess the situation.  It raised the expectations of many students who were successful in applying for training in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and they will be extremely disappointed that this Administration has decided to follow the national recovery plan which was rejected by the people.  Fine Gael is now in power and we lost out but it seems it is carrying out the policies proposed in the national recovery plan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Due to the mismanagement of the economy by the previous Government the current situation in this country is that the resourcing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the public service as a whole  has been very seriously eroded.  Our overall position is that the State is now dependent on funding from the ECB and the IMF to meet its day-to-day expenditure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All the Members of this House will be aware of the conditions under which the ECB and IMF funding has been made available and a key element of that programme is that Ireland must eliminate its public expenditure deficit.  In that context, it is essential that we restore balance to the public finances as a matter of urgency.  If we do not achieve this we will no longer have the capacity to continue funding public services.  Accordingly, it is vital that the gap between Government income and expenditure is closed.</P>
        <P>When it comes to numbers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the Government is severely restricted by the actions of the previous Government.  In that context it must be borne in mind that the previous Government decided, for the purposes of the EU and IMF agreement, that the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be reduced from 14,500 at the end of 2010 to 13,000 by the end of 2014.  This is the stark situation the Minister, Deputy Shatter, inherited.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the unfortunate consequences of the policies pursued by the previous Government is that a moratorium on recruitment has had to be applied to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This moratorium was in fact initiated by the previous Government in March 2009 and it will have to be continued to achieve the overall reductions in Garda numbers required.  It is of course the intention of the Minister, that Garda recruitment should recommence as quickly as possible.  However, in that area the hands of the Government have been tied by the decisions taken by the previous Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although it is not of our making, the Government and the general public will inevitably be faced with the fact that the number of serving members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be reduced.  In that regard, I stress that the emphasis will be on maintaining front-line services and that where resources are required to deal with serious crime and terrorism they will continue to be made available.  At this stage the Government is closely monitoring, and will continue to monitor, the pattern of Garda members leaving the force and recruitment will be restored to make sure that the strength will be maintained as far as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would also like to refer specifically to the Garda College in Templemore.  I can assure the House that it is not closing or being mothballed.  The college does not simply train new recruits; it also has the major function of providing continuous professional development training for <Col N="479"/>existing members and civilian support staff.  Existing Garda members as well as over 2,000 civilian support staff avail of the training facilities there.  There are over 300 training courses in the Garda College and over 20,000 individual days of training were provided in the college in each of the last two years.  Additionally, the college plays an important role in the development of a professional policing service in Ireland and it will continue to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge the commitment and professionalism of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Even though its numbers will be reduced I am confident that it will be possible for it to provide an effective policing service which will meet the needs of the people of this country.  It also goes without saying that both the Government and the Minister would be very happy to initiate a new Garda recruitment campaign immediately.  Unfortunately, owing to the dreadful economic legacy left to the Government and to the whole country, this is simply not possible.</P>

      <Title>Third Level Charges</Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  While my question is simple there is a certain complexity behind it.  The first indication that the student charge was going to be increased came prior to Christmas when, ironically, a question was tabled by the now Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  It was followed up by his party colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, who asked the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Mary Coughlan, on Tuesday, 25 January, the precise student contribution charge that would apply in the case of siblings in 2011.  The question asked on 25 January is now being asked of the new Administration.</P>
        <P>In her reply the then Minister said,</P>
        <P LI="1">The Finance Bill 2011 provided for certain changes in regard to tax relief arrangements for student fees and charges which would give an effective cost reduction in respect of second and subsequent siblings from a single family who are liable for the new student contribution charge.  The existing tax relief for third level fees and charges will now be amended to provide that the first &euro;2,000 in fees charged per claim will be ineligible for tax relief for students in full-time education and families with two or more children liable for the new student contribution will therefore now qualify for tax relief in respect of payments arising from second and subsequent sibling liability.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The matter then rested and the new Government took over.  Despite repeated attempts to establish with the Department of Education and Skills what exactly the position is regarding the second and subsequent siblings of a student who is in third level education in terms of what the charge will be, there has been a failure to establish it, hence the question I am asking today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">According to the<i> Irish Independent</i>, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has commissioned a report on funding for the education sector and has not ruled out the introduction of fees and new student charges, claiming it is hard to see how higher education can meet Government targets without more money.  However, before the election the Labour Party promised that it would not increase fees or charges and would also reverse the &euro;500 increase in student registration charges due to be introduced in September as per the proposals of the previous Government.</P>
        <P>In an editorial in <i>The Sunday Times </i>on 5 June reference was again made to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">[The Minister has] upset his backbenchers by executing a U-turn on the funding of third level education and his admission that his pre-election vow to oppose the &euro;500 increase in the student registration fee no longer applies and is in line with last year&rsquo;s Hunt report which found the existing funding model for third level education unsustainable.</P><Col N="480"/>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">In a further comment on 31 May the <i>Irish Independent </i>again referred to the Labour Party Minister admitting that the student registration charge would rise to &euro;2,000 per student in September, despite promising the opposite before the election. The newspaper also referred to the fact that, during the election campaign, the Minister signed a Union of Students in Ireland pledge that the Labour Party would not reintroduce third level fees in government or support an increase in the student service charge.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">On 15 December 2010, the <i>Irish Independent</i> referred to Fine Gael&rsquo;s policy to charge college graduates fees.  Its policy on third level funding, entitled The Third Way, proposed deferred contribution payments by students of up to &euro;4,300 for each year of study.  The total of deferred fees mentioned in the report ranged from &euro;11,400 for a three-year arts degree to &euro;17,096 for engineering.  As an alternative to having income deducted, graduates could pay off their fees immediately after graduation.  However, the Fine Gael policy document did not mention how students in expensive courses such as veterinary science and medicine would pay.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The former president of Dublin City University, Professor Ferdinand von Prondzynski, said that while the Labour Party has a strong emotional attachment to free fees:</P>
        <P LI="1">It was a massive gift to the middle classes.  It paid for many well-to-do people to go to university from areas such as Foxrock and Stillorgan, but did nothing to increase numbers going from areas such as Ballymun.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I have tabled this Adjournment matter because it is obvious from all the statements by representatives both of Fine Gael and the Labour Party that there is some confusion over what the position will be when the academic year commences in September 2011.  Will there be a continuation of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Minister&rsquo;s proposals to increase fees to &euro;2,000 for the first student and to introduce a tax relief for second or subsequent siblings, or will there be some other form of increased registration charge?  One way or the other, I do not anticipate that the <i>status quo</i> will remain, given what the Minister of State had to say in answering the previous Adjournment motion.  I hope he will not start with the pejorative statement he made in the last reply, that Fianna F&aacute;il mismanaged the economy.  There were many other factors apart from political activity, as he and everybody else now knows and readily acknowledges.  I would be grateful for some clarification, however, in the interests of parents, like myself, who want to know how much it will cost for our children to enter third level education in September.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I wish to thank the Senator for raising the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will start by explaining the background to the current student services charge.  In the context of the introduction of the free fees initiative in the 1995-96 academic year, in acknowledgement of the variation in the arrangements in place in colleges, a standardised charge was levied by the third level institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and student services.  The range of student services in question may include such facilities as on-campus medical and counselling facilities, access and disability services, careers office services, student facilities, student clubs and societies.</P>
        <P>As announced by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government in the 2011 budget, a new flat, higher education student contribution of &euro;2,000 will be introduced with effect from the 2011-12 academic year.  This new student contribution will replace the existing student services charge and will apply to all students who currently benefit under the free fees scheme. <Col N="481"/> This contribution will encompass the current student services charge and will also include a contribution by students towards tuition costs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also important to remember that the contribution will continue to be paid by the Exchequer in respect of students who qualify under the third level grant schemes.  Conscious of the financial pressures that this contribution may place on families where family income is marginally in excess of current eligibility levels for maintenance grant support, and on families with more than one sibling in higher education at the same time, the current higher education grants scheme&rsquo;s threshold will be increased to provide for an additional eligibility category of support qualifying for a 50% student contribution.</P>
        <P>Arrangements have been made to provide that second and subsequent siblings from a single family will not have to bear the full increased cost of the new &euro;2,000 charge.  While the current student services charge in higher education does not qualify for tax relief, the new contribution will be allowable for tax relief.  The Finance Act 2011 provides that, with effect from 2011, the first &euro;2,000 in qualifying fees per claim will now be ineligible for tax relief for students in full-time education.  An effect of this is that families with two or more children liable for the new student contribution charge will therefore now qualify for tax relief in respect of payments arising from second and subsequent sibling liability.  This will result in a reduction in the overall effective cost of the contribution in these cases.  Based on current rates of relief, the effective cost of the student contribution, net of tax relief, for second and subsequent siblings will be &euro;1,600 each.  These arrangements provide a practical means of giving effect to the commitment made that the full, increased cost of the new contribution would be alleviated for second and subsequent siblings within a single family.</P>
        <P>Higher education institutions have also been asked to put in place arrangements under which a student may opt to pay the charge in two equal instalments of 50% in September and 50% in January in a given academic year.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that opportunities to engage in higher education continue to be made available to potential learners and that access to higher education will continue to be determined by a student&rsquo;s ability and not his or her financial circumstances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to respond to the House on this matter.</P>

	<P>A brief question, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Am I right in saying that the Government will now have to sell this on the basis that it will generate just &euro;47 million in any given year?  The Minister of State&rsquo;s reply is similar to an answer provided in the D&aacute;il which stated that &euro;55 million would be generated in any one year as a result of the increased charges, but that because of the clawback in tax relief there would be a loss of &euro;8 million.  I am suggesting therefore that the net benefit to the Exchequer will be &euro;47 million.  If so, that is what the Government will have to sell to the increasing wrath of the Union of Students in Ireland and to parents who will have to scramble to provide this extra money.  I fully understand, and in no way wish to understate, the real economic challenge facing the Government.  I hope, however, that it will not be a repeat of the attempt by the last Government to end medical cards for all.  That was done for an equally small sum of money in the overall economic context. Nonetheless, I am grateful to the Minister of State for at least bringing clarity to this situation.  Since the change of Government, this has been a grey area for parents.</P>
